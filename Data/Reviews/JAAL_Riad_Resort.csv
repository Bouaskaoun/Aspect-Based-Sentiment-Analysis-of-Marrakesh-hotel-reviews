JAAL Riad Resort,Frank T wrote a review Mar 21,50,Last minute….. fab find,Arrived in dark but how fabulous the pool area looked 👌  Staff extremely pleasant with a big mention for the manager of the Italian restaurant 😉  Live music was lovely in the evening and food especially breakfast was excellent quality and choice.  Large rooms and comfy beds.  15mins from airport and 10 from the hustle and bustle (madness 😳😂) of central Marrakech.  Took a balloon ride and day trip to Atlas Mountains. Both good value and quality.  All in all would definitely recommend and would visit again 👌 Loved it,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankt93

JAAL Riad Resort,Sue T wrote a review Mar 1,20,"Fur coat, no knlckers",Our first encounter with the hotel was when on arrival they gave my friend and me a double bed rather than the 2 singles we had requested and they'd agreed.  I spent the first night sleeping on a very uncomfortable sofa in the room. We were moved the next day.  The hotel is lovely in appearance and some of the staff really nice and helpful...however this is completely opposite to the way the management take seriously guests concerns. They are cavalier to the point of arrogance.  Our room 1112 was overlooking the pool. Lovely. Well when you realise that the garden speaker is under your bedroom window and that music is played all through the night it colours one's opinion of the view.  There was drum and base music played on one side of the pool on the other 70s rock and at the end piano music. None of them were quiet and therefore they were just one awful sound.  We asked for this to be addressed on numerous occasions but it never was. Given the average age of the guests was approx 50 to 60 years old it was a strange choice to have drum and base playing! Last time I heard music similar was when I went clubbing!  So if you have a hearing impairment and / or can live with lots of different music playing around you then youll be ok.  Even at breakfast the music found its way into things. The same throughout the hotel. Never the same thing played at the same time  The food!  I have travelled extensively so am realistic in my expectations. I found the food to be bland and cold. If you want pastries etc they are plentiful and you can get fresh omelettes. So there is good and bad . The better food is served in the Italian restaurant.. the Cat. Otherwise its canteen fodder in the main dining room.  We had a massage at the spa...to relieve all the tension! It was excellent and would recommend  Overall I would say don't visit if you are troubled by music battles or want peace and quiet. You won't get it. If we could have moved hotels we would but unfortunately Voyage Prive didn't help.  They tried to contact the hotel but were seemingly ignored.  The Director of the Jaal Resort has much to answer for but could not be located. He shows scant regard for his guests I would suggest. An arrogance I personally dislike.  There will be many other reviews which say different I'm sure. Ive tried to be balanced in my reflections but hard when there's a cacophony of sound in your ears!,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suet450

JAAL Riad Resort,jonathan r wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Wonderful relaxed friendly stay,Had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff were all incredibly friendly and courteous; they were really attentive and nothing too much trouble.    Although It was very quiet in January the room was great and the whole resort was clean very smart and well maintained with staff on hand at all times.    The food was excellent with plenty of choice for lunch and dinner. The restaurant and bar staff were very attentive and cheerful.    We had an all inclusive deal and could not fault what we received and the value of the package.    Many thanks to all the friendly staff....missing our stay already!    Just a few observations for others:    -we had superb weather for early Jan (23deg during the day) so we were able to sit around the pool during the day but the water was too cold to swim in so we're able to use the indoor pool    - the food was excellent but the Cat restaurant menu didn't change. There was a good choice but perhaps a daily special ir some changes would be good. The outside bar food changed regularly.    - the room was hot and not air conditioned (so we were advised) so the cooling button made it warmer! We were on second floor so we're able to open doors but might be a problem in high summer    - you do get airplane noise bug not really too bad. The location is 20min walk to the medical so would be pretty much the same anywhere sough if the medical.    None of these observations would detract from a wonderful stay and wouldn't hesitate to srsy again.

JAAL Riad Resort,Diane D wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Jaal Hotel Marrakesh,We spent a couple of weeks at this beautiful hotel. Every staff member was so very helpful especially the catering staff. A special meal was organised on our anniversary evening which was much appreciated.    I would definitely recommend the location which was near the Medina and not far from golf courses.    We had trips to the mountains and Medina accompanied by a guide which were also well organised and most enjoyable.

JAAL Riad Resort,Alex D wrote a review Nov 2022,30,fabulous five star hotel trying to operate on a 3 star budget,firstly let me say that this is a fabulous hotel unfortunately is appears to be a five star hotel running on a 3 star budget. so many little things that need fixing to bring it up to a great standard. we booked a 7 night all inclusive stay  the good things : decor is brilliant throughout our room was spacious comfortable cleaned daily a huge tv on the wall great shower room. we had a ground floor pool view room with a small terrace that was practically on the pool side. it would be difficult to find fault with. the pool itself is lovely but extremely cold although a few hardy souls were swimming in it daily. there was no fighting for sunbeds plenty to go around the pool side staff were excellent plenty of towels supplied and the beds were covered every evening. a lovely setting.  the poor: check in was rather slow and we were not really informed of the hotel facilities during this possibly a communication problem as very few of the staff are able to hold a conversation in English. on booking this hotel we were informed that a plate of fruit would be placed in our room this never materialised I also informed the hotel that this was a special treat for my wife for our 32nd wedding anniversary which they acknowledged but there was no mention to us of this during our stay.  toilet paper is very poor quality practically see through not something you expect in a 5 star hotel. tea spoons are few and far between you are forever having to ask the waiters for a spoon to stir your tea or coffee or just to eat yogurt in the morning. cereals in the breakfast bar are very poor quality. no salt and pepper on the tables again you have to ask the waiters for these.  there were only 2 restaurants open for evening meals and you have to book these in advance. Italian and Moroccan we alternated these but found the Moroccan very poor quality in fact one evening we walked out as we just couldn't eat the food. the soup was a bowl of sludge ridiculously over salted followed by a main course of beef livers again so over salted we just couldn't eat it. for us the Italian restaurant was much better but both of these restaurants have a limited menu with just 3 main courses available a meat course a fish course and a vegetarian option. very poor for a supposedly a five star establishment.  there is a pool side bar for lunch which had a good selection but one day they were serving pizza and chips to a customer and when a 2nd customer asked for the same he was told that this was only for the paying guests not those on the fully inclusive at which point a row erupted as the guest tried to explain that he he was a paying guest he had paid for fully inclusive which should include pizza and chips if he wanted it. the waiters in this bar appeared reluctant to wander around the pool and take drink orders meaning many guests just gave up and went to the bar themselves.  the hotel is under ten minutes from the airport and is on the flight path so all day long flights are taking off and landing overhead so quite noisy  in our opinion this hotel is not sure if it wants to be a holiday hotel or a transient hotel during our stay there were numbers of the Moroccan armed forces staying for a day or 2  also a number of flight personnel on stopovers this is probably why there is plenty of sunbeds always available and limited menus in the restaurants.  we would not return to this hotel,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Felixstowe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A2295HTalexd

JAAL Riad Resort,evans57 wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Lovely break in Marrakech,Having read some poor reviews I decided to write a good one. The hotel does have some downsides but these are more than compensated for by the upsides. The pool area is lovely comfortable and attractive sun beds with a lovely well tended garden the Olympic pool is ideal for fitness the overhead planes were very infrequent. The rooms are clean and well appointed excellent toiletries we had a very quiet pool facing room with a lovely balcony. Breakfast was great a very good selection to suit all tastes dinner in the Moroccan/Italian restaurants was good limited choice but perfectly adequate the decor was lovely and entertainment good. I was not keen on the location - around 3kms from the Medina in the less developed neighbourhood - we have previously stayed in or near the Medina - I am a keen runner and as a sole female had some issues since very few people around but nothing too extreme and most people would take a cab (only 5 euros). Pool service needs to be sought rather than offered but that is fine and the all inclusive package provides a good selection of day long food and drinks - try the pizza! We travelled on a Voyage Prive deal and it was excellent value for money. Even though the location is not ideal for me I would return.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evans57
JAAL Riad Resort,gracem wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Great hotel, great service, would definitely come back",We had a wonderful stay at Jaal Riad and would highly recommend this beautiful hotel. The food is delicious the staff are really kind and attentive the restaurants lounges pool are all gorgeous and the rooms are spacious comfortable really clean and have everything you need.    Jaal Riad is a quick taxi to the Medina and key attractions but just outside the hustle and bustle so it is very serene and relaxing. It is also super close to the airport which is a bonus!    A special thank you to Hanane and Youness for always checking in on us making sure everything is perfect and being so kind and accommodating. You have gone above and beyond and have made our holiday very special.,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graceytm
JAAL Riad Resort,Dave B wrote a review Nov 2022,40,"Nice hotel, few minor tweaks and could be excellent",All in all we enjoyed our trip to the Jaal Riad.    On check in we were given a very quick run down on how the all inclusive system worked it soon became apparent that this was far too much to take in having only just arrived. I’d advise providing a leaflet or some information on paper about the times of the restaurants bars activities etc. This would have made our trip far easier as very soon into our trip we had no idea how things worked or what was included and when.    The pool staff although fairly friendly were not pro active in tending to the needs of their guests. Having paid for an all inclusive experience we’d have expected the waiters to be prominent around the pool area so you were able to order what you’d like. This wasn’t the case throughout the entire 7 day trip a waiter brought us a drink twice. Every other occasion we needed to go to the pool bar to order a drink although numerous staff members were stood around not looking overly busy. It’s a shame as with some basic training this can be fixed and also positive on the staff as they’d receive more tips!    The hotel architecture and pool were amazing a truly beautiful place. Jaal Riad has so much potential. It was clear that there was staff training taking place all staff were friendly however personally it seemed that the French guests were taken more seriously than ourselves.    The room was clean and special praise to the housekeepers! Thank you all very much.    The food on the whole was very nice lots of options the Moroccan restaurant our favourite the Italian was ok however we felt it could have been better. (Entertainment fantastic). Special mention to the Indian chef at the buffet who made fresh naan breads on request with a constant smile!    Our highlight of our stay was the main bar spending time with Salim Driss and the bar team. They made our whole stay and were amazing. Truly special people and made our time at the Jaal Riad one to remember. Both made us feel very special and made our honeymoon! Driss’s cocktails were out of this world and he has true talent not only in his cocktails but his personality also a true gentleman. Salim constantly smiling went out of his way to make our trip one to remember and definitely went above and beyond for us whilst we were there.    We would come back to Jaal Riad solely to have another one of Driss’s cocktails and enjoy Salim and Driss’s company!    I feel this hotel has amazing potential overall we had an amazing time a few tweaks here and there and it would be out of this world.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveB3097
JAAL Riad Resort,St_Chris_10 wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Disappointing stay,As others have said it’s difficult to rate this hotel. Some aspects were very good others very poor but my overall rating is based on comparisons with other 5 star experiences. We decided to go ‘All Inclusive’ for this visit. On reflection this may not have been the best choice as unfortunately there were only two restaurants to choose from in the evening and the AI menu was very limited. There was a separate menu available (at additional cost) but we weren’t made aware of this until late in our stay.    Firstly the good stuff.  - Rooms are clean and comfortable - we had a pool view room which was very nice.  - Public areas are very attractive as is the decor in the restaurants  - Good breakfast choices and a nice environment in which to enjoy them  - Staff are in the main friendly and helpful and are trying to keep everyone happy  - Good selection of drinks and cocktails    The not so good  - Very poor check in experience. It took an age and we didn’t receive the ‘VIP Experience’ promised. We had requested a high floor room but were given first floor. Worst of both worlds really as we had noise from above and below.  - Limited dining choices for lunch and dinner. During our stay the poolside bar was the only option for lunch and on one occasion there were just two choices of main course and no vegetarian option. Evening meals were in either the Italian or Moroccan restaurants which needed to be booked in advance (we only found this out from other guests) but no menus were available beforehand to assist in choosing.  - Music in the restaurants is ridiculously loud particularly in the Moroccan where the live entertainment is so loud you can barely hold a conversation whilst eating.  - Noise from building work at the yet to open spa.  - Being close to the airport can be a drawback. Not in the control of the hotel obviously but the noise of the early morning take offs is irritating.  - We returned to our room one evening to find the door open. No idea who had been in there but it was certainly closed when we left it. We always took care to make sure it was closed as we had noticed it didn’t close easily.    We raised issues with management and the response was usually related to the fact we visited during off season and guest numbers were down. I’m not sure this is valid for a resort selling itself as 5 star.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/St_Chris_10
JAAL Riad Resort,michellemackay wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Three stars,Three stars. Three stars because there are elements of the resort that are fantastic- the decor the pool area is comfortable room and resort is clean and some staff are very attentive including Hamouda at the pool bar.    Unfortunately the resort at the end of the season in October was not quite running as smoothly as expected at a 5 star resort.    We booked Jaal Riad in the understanding that according to their website they had a new spa and fitness suite offering a range of exciting services. We also believed that many restaurants and the international buffet would be open and in full operation. Unfortunately the spa still hasn't been completed despite lovely pictures promoting their spa online and we had to eat in the same two restaurants with set menus for most of our stay.    On arriving there were no restaurants open so we were forced to order room service at our extra expense. The room also did not have bottled water and basic tea and coffee facilities expected- with one mug left at the side. No consideration for our arrival was given.    The next morning we did speak to someone at reception who sent maintenance to unblock the flooded shower (which flooded every day) fix a broken chair and fix the wobbly twin bed (despite booking a king-size room). Maintenance did fix these issues but disappointing that we had to deal with this on holiday.    For most of our stay only two restaurants were open in the evenings. The catering manager couldn't decide whether the main buffet would open during lunch time (and at what time) and sometimes (if you looked like someone who had Instagram and would promote the hotel on their social media) you would be served lunch by the poolside but if you didn't meet the criteria you'd be left waiting until another member of staff would agree to serve you some food. It was clear the food and beverage staff did try their hardest under the instructions they were given but who could get what food and when was not clear and each day at the resort the food situation changed.    Despite the food and beverage issues staff at the hotel are mostly friendly and attentive and we did have a lovely stay at the resort but unfortunately our issues let our experience at the resort down. The resort might be better once the food and beverage issues are resolved operation across the hotel is tightened and the spa facilities open.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellemackay
JAAL Riad Resort,BVHM wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Disappointing experience,What a beautiful pool and proud structure!  We've had a truly disappointing experience however which has left us in need of a recovery holiday.  This was our first post pandemic holiday and we chose Marrakech after a brilliant holiday in Essaouira. What's more this resort had a similar 5* rating and stated the same facilities as the Sofitel we'd stayed at in Essaouira. However our experience could not have been more different.  Firstly the hotel is not central. It's on a flight path; the planes fly overhead from 7:00 a.m. The bigger problem is that it's along a major highway. If you're unfortunate enough to have Room 1119 as we were for our first night there's no chance of sleep. Our first 24 hours were spent negotiating a room change. Although Reception who were largely disengaged in helping us throughout our stay stated originally that the hotel was full to capacity this was denied by other staff and then the duty manager once he took charge. However it took four visits to reception for our move to be arranged and by then I was distraught. We'd lost a whole day waiting in a noisy room.  The room we were moved to WAS a garden room (be careful about this). What's more it was clean for we'd dirty feet from the other room. It also had electricals that had not fused for Room 1119 had no working kettle or television. Unfortunately like Room 1119 it had mosquitoes and then little flies.  My bed had a stain on the fitted sheet and then a lumpy mattress.  When towels were changed- there was no opportunity to decline this so towels were changed daily such an environmentally unfriendly action- they were not replaced for hours.  The writing paper in the desk drawer had been drawn on by an earlier guest. The drawer had never been cleaned. The shower was gritted up about the plug and flooded up quickly. However we appreciated the warmth of the cleaning staff who like many of the junior staff. So much of what they do like the towel changing is unnecessary and inefficient.  We chose Jaal Riad Resort because we sought accommodation with working Wifi. Be warned please that this Wifi is unsecure.  Also be aware that most of the facilities are not open. We saw no evidence of spa or gym. As there is no guide book about the resort anywhere from reception to the rooms we were not made aware of what was available or the structure and layout of the hotel.  Then again we had lots of evidence of confused communication things being worked out and changed upon the day. Menus were not in place restaurants were not open or were supposed to be opened as announced to guests until they were not… It was farcical!  It seems everything is dropped to 'drip over' corporate guests as we saw constantly over the week.  Should you be on an all inclusive holiday there is a lot that you are not permitted. However there's no evidence of what IS permitted which foods or drinks.  Three things made this a really appalling experience however. I mentioned that the resort is not central. It's in an area being developed it seems. There is no information at reception about trips nobody helps or there's distracted communication so we lost confidence about even approaching the front desk.  The new subdivision is noisy even along the garden side to which we were moved. There was a lot of noise outside the wall of gatherings of people and then dogs…. On the Wednesday night of our stay I was awakened by a dog fight howling jeering shouting and weeping. I won't forget those sounds.  Then again the food was appalling. Do not stay here in the immediate future until the hotel has sorted out food labelling. If you're vegetarian pescatarian or vegan there is no evidence of support or understanding. There are no differences made for you. What's more if you've a food intolerance or allergy this hotel becomes really dangerous with the lack of any food labelling.  Then again there are never enough serving spoons in any food stuffs plates are whipped away often while you're still eating from them there are forks used to dish up lettuce and grated carrot…. the same forks are expected to be used for cold meats as cheese?  The final nail in this coffin of a review is the constant harassment of junior waiting staff by the overseers in black suits and trainers. While there is evident training going on it should be not in front of guests and so evident. Neither should a waiter who's attended to a guest (me) who has asked for a spoon- there are NEVER spoons for breakfast cereal yogurt or even to stir a drink- be intercepted by an 'overseer' who sends him off on a personal errand! For his keys! This happened at breakfast yesterday.  I've not even got onto the constant music the increasing volumes at the pool which leaves sun seekers all clustered on the side without the speakers.  Finally as our week drew on we surmised that the hotel managers were becoming more concerned about negative feedback. We were harassed constantly about our satisfaction. All it did was make us feel hassled and hostile. Please attend to what matters respect your waiting staff and pay attention to the guests.  We are so relieved to be home!,Date of stay: October 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BVHM

Nice breakfast as also the lunch and dinner buffet. Their salads were amazing super fresh and delicious.  Great staff from the breakfast as also the buffet area.    We tried the morocco restaurant and since we had all inclusive we had one starter one main dish and dessert. I asked if I could have another starter and thw waiter was very rude. He said no and I said I pay for that extra and he went to speak with the manager Mr. Olivier and it was ok.    The entire dinner service the waiter was rude no smiling taking out our plates in front of us instead by french side... horrible.    When I requested the bill to pay for that extra starter they brought me a bill of somethinh that wasn´t even in the menú. I felt cheated and I spoke with Mr. Olivier the manager who refuse to give me the waiter name so I could do a complaint as also didn´t answer me until today how could he charged something that wasn´t even in the regular menu.    Staff from the pool bar should be more nice and smile more. We endend having our meal and they brought coffe without taking the plates from the main meal. A disaster.

JAAL Riad Resort,Ellebee09 wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Little bit disappointed ☹️,Argh so I found it really hard to rate this hotel because some aspects were great others not so much. We came here for our last 10 days of peace and quiet before our first baby arrived in early 2023.  Great:    The bed is amazing so comfy lots of cushions and pillows for your comfort. The shower is also super hot which I love. The building architecture is stunning there’s no doubt they’ve put a lot of effort into the external of the building. There are some real stand out members of staff who we definitely enjoyed seeing and being served by.    The pool is lovely and well kept. Different variety of beds including loungers day beds and cabanas. The specialist restaurants that we went to are stunning inside (we had the Italian and Moroccan).    Not so great:  We had a “garden view” room and it was really bad. It’s actually not a garden at all it’s a rubbish heap then a small side road then another hotel and there’s some trees in between which apparently constitutes a garden (see photo). There was a lot of noise in our room including moped racing up and down the road people laughing and partying in the hotel next door which you can see from your balcony dogs barking every single morning as well as a giant industrial fan sound.    The hotel is also on the flight path of the airport so at some stages through the day there are flights going over head quite low every few minutes. The hotel is also situated on a road with 4 of the biggest nightclubs in morocco which is amazing if that’s your thing but for us we just wanted 10 nights of peace and tranquility but the music from next door was deafening. We wish we had paid a little extra and got a pool view room as they did seem much more peaceful and the pool area is lovely.    If the hotel is at lower capacity there is no buffet dinner and only 2 restaurants open which only serve 2/3 food options which limits your food options significantly. Food is mostly mediocre to be honest we do consider ourselves foodies however not fussy or pretentious by any means. Our food would be served at the same time but one would be cold and the other piping hot so they may have left the food out served waiting for an order. The service was also shockingly slow. I do understand the French like to take their time to eat but we waiting 2 hrs for 2 courses which was quite unbearable.    We found some of the staff to be quite abrupt and could barely crack a smile and quite a significant language barrier. Some don’t speak even basic English and didn’t also seem to understand our attempt at French either which made it quite difficult to build a rapport. They don’t seem to engage when you attempt to speak french.    The food always looks amazing the way it is laid out and presented but it’s just quite meh to be honest. The service is a little comical sometimes and they don’t seem to know what they are doing as they run around passing plates of food around each other delivering the wrong meals to the wrong tables having to order dessert 3x after waiting 40 mins and drinks twice then being told they didn’t have it rather than them just letting you know. If you do tip though they tend to remember you and make more of an effort to give you a better service.    The rooms are fine as I mentioned above but they do let the rest of the hotel down. They are a little run down in places and could be doing with a refresh. I wouldn’t say this hotel is a 5 star it’s 5 star in some places 3 in others (pool side toilets where the mens urinal was on the floor and the doors didn’t lock or the toilet didn’t flush or the female toilet where the seats were falling off or stained with god knows what).    Moroccan restaurant was sooooo loud with the constant live Moroccan music it was just unbearable and waaay too loud for the small space and we ended up having to leave because of it. Italian is beautiful and has a live singer.    The food situation is odd too there’s no ability to get food at any time of the day if needed and I’ve not experienced that before in an all inclusive hotel. I’m suffering from pretty bad hyperemesis (severe pregnancy sickness) and it’s at its worst when I’m hungry. I woke up on night 1 very very sick and unwell and my partner tried to order just some pastries off the room service menus but was told they only had 3 items on the menu including cheeseburger and spaghetti - which wasn’t ideal for 3am and they couldn’t even give us a bread roll to help stop my sickness. We then tried to take some pastries from breakfast to help me through the night and they weren’t best pleased despite my partner explaining my situation. If I’d have know I’d have just taken a packet of biscuits with me but I didn’t think food would have been an issue in an all inclusive 5 star resort. I did find myself hungry often which shouldn’t be the case in an all inclusive resort! There is no mini bar in the room so no water or drinks at all which again is unusual for all inclusive.    Overall I’d say it’s a 4 star but in some places it’s definitely only 3 star. Make sure you get a pool room and pay a little more.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellebee09
JAAL Riad Resort,Alan.M.Walshe wrote a review Oct 2022,50,The holiday every couple needs to recharge and reset. Hope to make it annually,Wow…. 9 nights / 10 days of pure pleasure with the entire Jaal team.    Each point of contact was special 5 star service is delivered in a unique almost relaxed fashion. But in reality it’s their excellence professionalism that makes it relaxed.    On arrival the accommodation manager Adil introduced himself and provided us with a fantastic room.    Salim is the host of the main hotel bar. Salim has a large smile and an even larger personality which is infectious and made any visit an uplifting experience.    Finally Mehdi the food & beverage manager. This man is the star of the show. Attentive and generous with his time. If there was anything required at any time Mehdi ensured it happened nothing was a problem. From early morning to late evening Mehdi made us and the other couples we met feel at home and made sure that everyone felt like they were personal friends.    I could not recommend the Jaal highly enough if you want some relaxing adult time in a professional but not stuffy environment.    The hotel and amenities are fantastic but it’s Mehdi and his colleagues that make it special.

JAAL Riad Resort,FaizalGara wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Shout-out to Hannan,I was in Marrakech for a short time to attend a conference nearby the rooms were spacious clean and the staff were attentive.    Not every experience is perfect but how the issues are attended to and resolved is what makes an experience excellent.    For a holiday maker there’s plenty to do at the resort in itself I wish I was able to spend more time.    A special shout-out to Hannan she assisted above and beyond in terms of what she had to do she ensured I was looked after and attended to anything to make my experience more pleasant. She did not need to do that and had no obligations to do so but I am forever thankful that she did. On that basis herself she has earned 5 stars for this resort.

JAAL Riad Resort,Annelies v Wamel wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic experience,It was our first experience in Morocco and we enjoyed it every minute.  The beautiful hotel extremely helpful and friendly staff the food colours and smells the souks too much to mention.  Not once did my blonde daughter or myself feel harassed. Yes people expect you to haggle so please do and don't be embarrassed about it. But we felt safe and thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere.  Leather spices and perfume are outstanding. Try to find a good shop-ask the hotel staff to advise you and call a taxi for you. I am very certain we got a better deal because of the quick Arabic spoken to the driver before we climbed in.....  And don't forget the hammam - never knew I had so much dead skin to lose!  The hot air balloon trip was magic.

JAAL Riad Resort,Jason J wrote a review Sep 2022,20,Avoid,Staying at the JAAL Riad Resort was quite possibly the most disappointing hotel I've ever experienced from beginning right through to the end. And I've been fortunate enough to stay in luxury hotels over the years.    The attitude of the check in staff was incredibly rude it felt like I was hassling them by asking to check in. I was asked to take a seat and that someone would be over... 30 minutes later I was still sat waiting so went back and asked if there was a problem again to be spoken to like I was an inconvenience to them. I asked for the passports back to be told they still needed to be scanned and to take a seat again. 10 minutes later I was escorted to the room with no introduction about the hotel where the bar / restaurants are. Which I could eat in as we were all inclusive.    Moving onto the room I booked a garden view room with a terrace. the room had a tiny balcony that overlooked what I can only describe as the hotel dumping ground There was piles of rubbish and old furniture as a 'garden view'. After complaining twice we finally moved rooms which was better and actually had a terrace but i still wouldn't say it overlooked a 'garden'.    Other awful experiences include asking for a drink 4 times in the bar area after still not receiving it I went to the bar and asked the same person who seemed to be listening but then thought it would be fun to walk off and disappear - I don't know if this was a language barrier issue but it was terrible service. The second experience at the however is even more atrocious. We were next to be served and the bar tender spoke over us to the guy waiting behind who pleasantly said 'oh these are next'. The bar tenders response was a simple 'no what can I get you' to the guy behind.    The lunch and evening buffet was very poor little choice of food available and zero atmosphere. The Italian restaurant on the other hand had a musician playing who was fantastic. However he was playing to an empty restaurant because it seems there version of being 'fully booked' was having 6 tables on the terrace outside which was baffling. The food was also not great.    It seems the new all inclusive package the hotel has recently introduced has not gone down well with the staff and you are treated poorly for spending extra prior to arrival expecting a relaxing stay.    All in all although the building itself and the architecture is stunning I would not stay at JAAL again if it was for free the experience was so bad I checked out of the hotel early and moved to a different hotel which I won't name but was the total opposite experience and I would go back there in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonj391
JAAL Riad Resort,John T wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fabulous,This is a gem of a hotel . Recently refurbished the rooms are large and well appointed with a lovely alcove seating area and king size beds . Large walk in shower with separate loo.    The main restaurant is huge with a large patio service lots of salads Moroccan dishes and international cuisine with lamb and fish being the major choice but lots of others too.    The staff are excellent albeit that many were in training but they were keen to learn and get feedback from guests. The pool is massive (see photo) but very cold. The no kids aspect is a major plus for a peaceful vacation.    Special credit goes to    Fatou lounge bar  Training 88 terrace  Salim lounge bar  F&B manager  Hamza pool bar  Mohammed pool bar  Difficult to name more as only a few wore name badges but as I said great service all round.    The only minor negatives is that there is no milk in the rooms and the chamber maids don’t replenish bathroom products such as shower gel or coffee once used ( milk I got at breakfast.

JAAL Riad Resort,NAC1272 wrote a review Aug 2022,50,A palace of beauty with VIP treatment!!!,Visiting Marrakech for the first time I did a lot of research on various hotels. The first thing that struck me was the numerous fantastic reviews people wrote about the Jaal Riad Resort. I decided to book 7 nights all-inclusive for my wife and I.  WOW. What a fantastic hotel. The architecture the decoration the detail and the cleanliness is exceptional. A stunning Palace.  Even more impressive though was the service. Mehdi the F&B manager treated us like VIP's. There was nothing that was too much trouble for him. He was always happy to see us warm and welcoming greetings throughout the day. I have never received service and treatment anywhere like this in the world. His team are so fantastic too and clearly follow his example. Every member throughout the hotel treated us like a King & Queen. It was so special. The food was utterly amazing and delicious. Fresh everyday with an amazing choice of everything and more you could dream of. Mustafa one of the Sous Chefs there treated us to amazing food including the most delicious calamari. Youssef another wonderful chef spoiled us with his array of delicious Indian dishes cheese naan's and other 5 star quality foods. The sweets/pastries (desserts) were incredible and better than you can find in the best patisseries in Paris. They looked beautiful and tasted even better than they looked always on display with a choice of at least 10 different tastes of heaven. The choice of cocktails wines spirits and soft drinks on the all inclusive menu were so very generous with lots to choose from all using best quality international spirits including local mixes. Our favourite was definitely Coco-Loco which the staff made sure we were never short of supply. The evening bar was manned by two fantastic guys Salim and Nourdine who were both great fun to be with and exceptional bar staff. Friendly funny professional hard working polite and kind we spent many an evening chatting with them whilst they delivered delicious drinks.  Frank the manager within the O2 (pool bar & restaurant and Terrace) took exceptional care of us. As my wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary Frank organised a bespoke - off-a la carte - menu for us with custom made dishes which were totally amazing. Our table was decorated with rose petals we received custom cocktails custom dishes and to top it all off a beautiful fresh anniversary cake brought to our table by Mustafa accompanied by all the restaurant staff the excellent local Moroccon musicians Frank and the amazing F&B manager Mehdi. It was totally amazing and made the entire trip magical. The restaurant hostesses dressed beautifully in stunning green dresses welcomed us with warmth and kindness. A credit yet again to Mehdi.  We also dined in the beautiful Italian restaurant on site and the brilliant restaurant manager Monsof gave us a VIP welcome and Michelin Star service. He is clearly a master of fine dining service and faultless in his craft. He recommended the Jaal Riad Red wine which was the perfect accompaniment to our meal and it tasted delicious. Full-bodied smooth and warm.  The hotel rooms were always cleaned to the highest standards decorated beautifully and the room staff were so polite. They even decorated the bed with rose petals on our anniversary including towels shaped as two swans forming a heart. Room staff greeted us every morning and their warmth and friendliness was lovely.  This was truly a magical experience one we shall never forgot highly recommend and definitely return to.  The only sad part of the trip was the couple of very rude French guests who stayed there. They spoke to the staff in an unacceptable way. Treating them like worthless servants rude and ignorant. It was unacceptable and total uncalled for behaviour from these two French guests but Mehdi and his team smiled and remained professional. The other French guests there though were pleasant enough.    If you want to experience what it must feel like to be a VIP the Jaal Riad Resort is 100% the place to visit. Thank you Mehdi Frank and everyone there.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Burgess Hill, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NAC1272
JAAL Riad Resort,Mike M wrote a review Aug 2022,50,FIVE STAR AND MORE,My wife and I had an all inclusive couples holiday at this resort hotel. Adult only so no kids at the pool and plenty of sun loungers day beds and cabana beds to choose from.    A stunning hotel with exceptional staff. The number of staff we were addressing by name shows the extraordinary levels of attention we received    The service was really special and the staff could not do enough. On all aspects of the holiday. The general manager Mehdi was completely customer focussed and would make sure we were happy and enjoying all aspects of our holiday. He was happy to spend time with us giving us advice about Marrakesh and how to deal with the bartering something we certainly not used to.    With regards the food and drink the manager Franck-Olivier really made sure that all staff were looking after all the guests and would take time to talk to us to make sure we were happy with the service. He would greet us nearly every morning at breakfast was very attentive and genuinely concerned to ensure we were enjoying our stay.    Breakfast was really good with the usual continental selection supported by an omelette station a crepe station and a Moroccan station. Also a fresh fruit juice section which was just amazing. A big thank you to Chaimie who every morning made sure we were looked after. She was an absolute star.    Lunch at the pool was a full three course restaurant menu at the pool side restaurant the food was restaurant standard certainly not cafe bar standard. Special mention to Mohamed at the poolside restaurant who went above and beyond making sure that we were very well fed and watered and we always had drinks at our day bed. The holiday would not have been as special without his service.    The pool was brilliant with loungers daybeds and cabana beds. The hotel supply you with fresh pool towels as you need them so none of the nonsense with people reserving beds for the day and not using them. Every day we were able to get a bed or lounger when we went to the pool without any issue at all.    The rooms are lovely and spacious and the maid service was excellent when you left the room and put the please clean sign on the door the room was cleaned within the hour.    Different restaurants for dinner and did not have a bad meal. Never eaten Moroccan before and Yousef the chef was happy to put together something special to showcase the different tagines. Really rich gorgeous tasty food. Again three courses but you have to try. The local wine was really nice quite spicy to match the food. The Italian restaurant was more romantic and again the food was really good. The manager mounssif really went out of his way to make sure we had the very best of service. He made the experience really special. There is also the buffet restaurant which was themed and the food was again of an excellent standard. The Moroccan mint tea was a nice surprise.    The bar had a brilliant singer every night and the head barman whose name escapes me made sure there was a relaxed atmosphere with large comfy seats and drinks cocktails and snacks at the table although you had to be careful of the large measures a great way to wind down at night.    The hotel is a real oasis from the madness and lunacy of Marrakesh and the medinas.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cumbernauld, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeM441

JAAL Riad Resort,Eve K wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Aesthetically pleasing,This hotel will offer you some wonderful Instagram moments and has attentive staff but I wouldn't stay again.  For the price you expect the Spa to be open (though admittedly this was lastminute.com's fault for not telling us as the hotel stated they were informed of the closure 20 days before our stay).  The breakfast appears to have a large selection but the taste is all pretty bland. By day three I didn't fancy eating any of the array of breakfast items (and I freakin' love breakfast).  You can't expect other guests to be quiet for you but paper thin walls don't help.  You're about a 35 minute walk from the old town and anyone who has been to Marrakech before will understand the hell of haggling for a taxi. This is made worse by every taxi having no idea where the Jaal Riad is. A fault of the taxi drivers and perhaps not the hotel.  Pool is lovely but is it worth the price?

JAAL Riad Resort,gemma s wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Excellent stay,we stayed here for our 33rd wedding anniversary in July 2022 the hotel had just recently reopened after a major revamp. The decor in general is far higher than 5star rating & i would place it at 7star. even when small things needed improving the staff seriously bent over backwards to help make our stay memorable. I particularly would like to highlight the bedroom manager who upgraded our room to a suite for the last couple of days Amazing! The hotel currently has 2 restaurants open the morrocan which i tried once but wasnt very authentic and more of a fusion. However the Italian restaurant with manager Monseff was amazing service by him & his team this man serves with his heart and treats you better than family! On the evening that was actually our anniversary he treated us to a 6 course meal (we were all inclusive anyway but the dishes he served us wasnt even on the menu) Monseff is truly a great asset to this hotel and whatever they are paying him needs to be doubled. another person is Fedoa on reception there was no issue that she could not solve! Franck one of the managers who serviced breakfast and lunch wow what a master of service this young man is he made the best masala tea on the planet! He was always gracious and helpful.  Mehdi had such skills with difficult guests was a pleasure to watch & Salim in the bar made amazing cocktails.  Was there small things that could be done better YES but honestly the way we were treated like celebrities made those small things insignificant.  Truly enjoyed our stay didnt want to leave and definitely will be back one day when the Cat club and hamam is open again as entertainment was missing and very much needed as the hotel is a bit away from the center of marakesh and you need taxi. The other thing was not many of serving staff and maids tidying rooms spoke English so it made it very difficult. It was comical when i asked a server what time does the restaurant close and he thought i asked him to bring 4 drinks lol and 15mins later bought the drinks.. so very funny! and they gifted us a wedding anniversary cake was lovely but then the bought it out singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY this will be one of the hilarious moments i remember all my life!  Room tea trays also needed Tea spoons only table spoon was provided to stir your tea in room & at breakfast and please include quality english tea on the room trays for the UK guests.,Date of stay: July 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemmasN5076MZ

JAAL Riad Resort,Tyler17 wrote a review May 2022,50,Amazing - 6* star service and food,Wow! What a wonderful hotel. Ww booked last minute for one night before flying out of marrakesh. Best decision we made!  Firstly the service is exceptional - very kind and attentive- but also giving you space. That is a hard balance to achieve.  Secondly the food ... wow wow wow! Every meal - even pool side - was of an exceptional standard. It was at the level of a Michelin star restaurant and that is not exaggerating. It was balanced beautifully presented healthy and filling. Some items had a Moroccan/Japanese/French fusion vibe which was different but beautifully executed and worked so well. Highly recommend the teriyaki prawn soft spring rolls and the prawn tomato and Avocado salad. The truffle pizza with dried beef is also worth a try (we ordered chilli on the side and that was amazing).  Thirdly the rooms are compact but comfy - but nicely finished. There are fresh fruits waiting for you which was a lovely touch. The only change I would make was putting water in the fridge.  Finally I was super impressed with the equal opportunity employment at the hotel. Some staff had physical disabilities and it was wonderful to see that the hotel was supporting an inclusive work environment.
