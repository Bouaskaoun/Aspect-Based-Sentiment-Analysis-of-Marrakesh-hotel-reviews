The staff were incredibly happy all with an amazing can do attitude.  Lots of entertainment from cooking classes water fun gym and spa.  The food and beverage manager Faska was so hospitable and knew my name instead of my room number.  The bar staff El Habib and Ahmed had your drink ready before you asked. Amazing hospitality and service.  The receptionist YasminehayatAssiaimanenada should all be managers‚Ä¶.. there‚Äôs nothing they can‚Äôt do for you or find out.  Such a wonderful welcome‚Ä¶.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Sharona V wrote a review Mar 5,50,Great Vacation,We had a great holiday the staff is very welcoming and friendly. We met a waiter at the hotel named Ahmed Laghrib who gave us advice this holiday so we could make our days as productive as possible. He taught us Arabic words and made sure we lacked nothing. Really a topper !! They do everything they can to make sure you have a great holiday. We met the locals and went on adventurous excursions. If you don't feel like going into town the hotel has a great animation team who know how to keep young and old entertained. We will definitely come back here and also recommend everyone to go there.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/407sharonav
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Ian B wrote a review Mar 5,40,Cheeky 4 days away,Looked at all the mixed reviews on this hotel  so went there with no expectations . We just knew it was raining at home and was looking for some sun and a few days together . It‚Äôs quite a big hotel  a bit tucked out the way would be a bit of a criticism  but our rooms were clean food was ok and the staff we encountered were very friendly . Animation came for a chat everyday around the pool  despite us just wanting to relax . Still nice they took the time to come and say hi . Tarik in particular was very friendly  although he had a bit of a dodgy man bun  which all the guys seem to like . The drinks in the restaurant is a bit of a funny set up  with a guy at a table pouring drinks from a table  a bit like an 80‚Äôs engagement party üòÅ. Spirits and cocktails weren‚Äôt what they are meant to be  but this is an African Muslim country  so just go with it .  Entertainment is the usual kids thing then poor caberet and quiz  very much geared up for the French  so take a book  chat to each other and have a few drinks .  My wife lost her new iPhone one day and the staff went above and beyond to help find it  and a female staff member had handed it in for which we were very grateful . I wanted to tip one guy who‚Äôd really helped but he was insistent he needed no reward . I went looking for him that evening and forced the equivalent of ¬£8 on him . He started praying as we left .  Couple of bits of advice would be to arrange transport before arrival . Taxi rank is a bit intimidating  and you‚Äôre sort man handled into a cab before you‚Äôve sorted a price  and passport control is a bit strict and unwelcoming .  Final bit of advice is  we did a couple of trips to break our few days up . A morning out at the medina was a good one  although not for the faint hearted . A lot of people up close and personal  snake charmers etc  the second was a show in the evening with horses and a meal in a Bedouin tent . All of it was so bad  it was actually funny . Up to you if you‚Äôd want to go  but we wouldn‚Äôt rush back .  To summarise  hotel gave us a decent few days away  nice staff and food ok . Would be nothing much to do if it were raining  but we were very lucky whilst we were there .,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St Osyth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbB298SE
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Inspire11828024300 wrote a review Mar 3,40,February trip for sun and warmth,This was my second stay in Marrakesh. It seemed like the perfect escape for some February sunshine. The highlights of this hotel were the attractive buildings and planting large pools (with one being heated even in February.)  Spacious and calming rooms friendly staff and good quality food. The negatives about the hotel for us were mainly to do with the volume of the constant music that ran from 10 am to 5 pm and could be heard everywhere on site including in your room with the windows and door shut. If you‚Äôre not a fan of constant thumping bass then this probably isn‚Äôt the hotel for you. The spa was pretty much closed except for the treatment room and the pool there was not heated and not in use. The alcohol choices were very limited but they poured a generous gandt and local wine was pretty good and could be found all day. As we were ‚Äòoff season‚Äô the hotel was about 1/4 full leaving plenty of space in the restaurant bar and round the pool.  We‚Äôd happily return ( with earplugs) to enjoy the sunshine and trips to the souk which is 30 min on the hotel shuttle bus .,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inspire11828024300

We had dirt on floors and there was a nest on balcony of insects . Nothing was done .  The hotel is not geared up for winter guest . All areas apart from rooms had no heat . It was freezing inside at night in bar  restaurant and reception cold .  Food was good  great selection staff friendly  The older bar staff were friendly . The animation  Team were really miserable and didn‚Äôt make any effort speaking to any of the guest unless it was showtime .  The food was good and drinks were nice  The hotel is far out to the nightlife and if you want to get on bus to Marrekech . The last bus was 10.30 and it parked far out to town . Or it is 20 pounds each was for a cab . Gardens and views lovely .  Massage really nice .

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Becca L wrote a review Dec 2022,40,Fabulous,Loved staying in this hotel. This was my 3rd visit this year and couldn‚Äôt fault it. The pool is great days at the pool were made extra special by Mohammed working at the pool bar. Infact all of the bar staff made us feel like royalty during our stays. There was no request too large for the two Ahmed‚Äôs! They made us feel extra special. Simple things like remembering our orders and making us cocktails to try really make a holiday in an all inclusive. Was slightly disappointed by the interactions from some of the animation team very clearly only interested in the 20 something girls which clearly took up a lot of their attention both throughout the day and at night. However my experience was saved by the excellent service from bar restaurant and reception staff.    Overall would 100% recommend the hotel and will definitely be back.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beccal730

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Stuart E wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Excellent holiday in Marrakesh,This is the second time we‚Äôve been to this hotel I would highly recommend it. The staff are very friendly. The food is excellent quite a high variety of different food‚Ä¶ There are two swimming pools one for kids and adults pool‚Ä¶. The animation staff are really good very friendly just like all the other staff everybody does the hardest to keep you happy especially Asma who is always happy to see you and has always a lovely smile.  Would highly recommend going all-inclusive because all the drinks and everything is part of the package and be in Marrakesh is virtually guaranteed the hot weather.

The rooms are in a block of riads with your own balcony  fridge and hairdryer  it was very clean   The food was good although not always to our taste  but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs seeing different countries is about ( we didn‚Äôt go hungry ) there was also a good selection of drinks on offer and a coffee machine that‚Äôs available all day .and plenty bottles off water .  They also have holidays reps there that can also organise trips like desert safari  quad bikes hot air balloons and a guided tour into Marrakech .  Beach towels are available also you pay a deposit and get it back when you hand them in.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,T D wrote a review Nov 2022,10,FILTHY! Truly Shocking.,This place has potential the pool area and lobby seem impressive but the rest of the place is filthy and completely neglected. It seems as though it was built and then just left half abandoned. Honestly some of it looks like a scene from a zombie film.  We left and went to the Sol Oasis next door.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Raymon H wrote a review Nov 2022,20,"Do not come here, stay in the sol oasis by Melia next door",This is one of the worst all inclusive hotels in morocco i have stayed in many. The rooms are old insecure and full of mosquitoes. The wine is undrinkable the food is poor quality and repetitive. There is nowhere outside the reception or your room where you can sit or sunbathe without being surrounded by smokers. Most of the staff are not properly trained to serve food drinks or provide any customer service and the management ignore complaints and do nothing to improve the place. I stayed here for 11 days and it felt like a prison sentence. The only worse hotel in my experience was the argana in Agadir but this was less than a third of the price per night. Morocco has many excellent all inclusive resort hotels check carefully before booking and do not waste your time and money coming to this one you will regret it.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Rivehaute, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymonh499
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Eilidh M wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Below average,Arrived and taken to our room to find out someone was in it so had to wait and given another. The key cards were a nightmare and had to get reset at least once a day.  Room was okay bathroom dated and not the cleanest.  Left without electricity one day and reception were rude and basically told tough luck.    Food was awful the same every day just about. I ended up with a bacterial disease campylobacter which was confirmed when I returned home by doctor. I was ill for roughly 6 days and needed antibiotics. I mentioned this to staff who weren‚Äôt interested at the time.  Even when there was a spillage of  Juice by a child I mentioned to staff numerous times so no one slipped. They weren‚Äôt inwtetested I ended up cleaning it up with napkins.    Entertainment team worked there socks off  And tried to get most people  Involved but was very samey if you are there for over 7 days. They seem to work crazy hours and don‚Äôt get the thanks or appreciation for there work.    Bar staff were nice but felt pressured a lot of the time to tip. Also first night when we arrived were charged 200 dirham for bottle of Coke as after 11pm. Also felt there was not a lot of choice of all inclusive drinks no rum and cocktails were rubbish. And served in paper or plastic cups a lot of the time with no ice.    Bus times to and from Marrakesh were not suitable bus was never on time far to hot and even over booked on occasion.    Also the litter around hotel grounds was prettty bad I found myself picking rubbish up and binning it.    All in all I wouldn‚Äôt return to this hotel cheap yes but don‚Äôt believe it could pass for anything over a 2/3 star.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/125eilidhm
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Global62230768224 wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Worst place ever stated on a holiday!,This was the worst place we have ever been to on a holiday.  Google reccomends this place stating it is a four star hotel in our opinion this was more like a one star hotel.  The hygeine of the hotel was dreadful there was blood stains on the bedding hair on the bathroom and room floor the food is left uncovered and has flies on it. Upon arrival there was a half eaten plate of food in the stairwell by our room that was then left there for 3 days! The food was also of a very low quality and wasnt good at all.  In terms of comfort the bed was almost unsleepable being so hard it feels like concrete. We had to layer 2 blankets under the sheet in order to sleep. There is also nowhere in the hotel that is comfortable to sit and relax the deck chairs around the pool are also rather uncomfortable but more comfortable that the bed!  In addition the staff at the hotel were very unfriendly and unhelpful. For example our bathtub had no plug so we couldnt use it we asked 4 times for one and they never supplied. The only staff who were nice and friendly were the animation team.  2 of the 3 resturants advertised were closed and just be aware the deposit for towels is cash only which was not made aware on website. They have a ATM on site but it charges 20% fee for transactions!

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Katie B wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Good value for money - realistic review,I came here with my boyfriend for a week we wanted an easy sunny all inclusive holiday and that‚Äôs what we got.    Enjoy the review..    Being British: ignore other reviews the staff treat you all the same we felt. Naturally they know more French like the majority of Marrakech but they always tried to conversate and all of the staff were nice to us. Terrace bar staff nicer than pool bar staff.    Reception: Did the job got us checked in and helped us with any thing we needed and always pleasant. Agree that they will finish anything they are currently dealing with first but never found them rude.    Food/ Drink: good variety of food for all three meals would switch up main dishes (fish/chicken etc daily) but the majority of standard salads / cheeses / meats / condiments stayed the same but because we‚Äôre not fussy we‚Äôre absolutely fine with this. Also catered for days when you weren‚Äôt feeling cultural and will indeed serve chicken nug nugs. Only complaint not enough nugs and the snack bar needed to be on for longer throughout the day with a better selection.    Alcohol: appreciate this should fall into the drink category but it deserves its own. First day you think it‚Äôs the best thing in the world by day 4 it‚Äôs paint stripper but we got a second wind to carry us through. Served sometimes in coffee cups by pool but at least no one got any glass in their feet    Animation/entertainment: the team work so so hard and make an effort with everyone they will always try to get you involved and special shout to mimi she is so lovely. The evening entertainment is good and an easy watch when your having a drink after dinner. If you don‚Äôt like baby shark don‚Äôt do all inclusive?    Every time a new activity comes along the Tracy beaker theme tune with a hint of snake charmer remix comes on.    Aqua gym: do it.    Rooms: beds are hard but you get over it. Towels need a revamp. We had a lovely big room with double bed and two singles well decorated and way better than expected.    Resort and Pool: super clean well looked after and plenty of sun beds.    The Shop: could do with selling water / soft drinks etc otherwise it‚Äôs alright    We had no trouble and had a lovely holiday :),Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiebF6692HH
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,homerda wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Overall Poor.,I am a regular at hotels in Marrakech sometimes coming twice a year staying at a variety of different stared and priced hotels  But the Ona Ryads Hotel and Spa is the only bad experience I have had out of a dozen trips    Firstly the service is incredibly poor throughout so unlike any other place I have stayed and so different to the Morocco I have experienced before.    And There are so many small things like never having glasses or plastic pool glasses so tall drinks are served in wine glasses or mainly In disposable cups    The food is often reheated in the main restaurant and cooked from frozen in the snack bar    The room i stayed in was large but poor with cracked tiles and with small old towels    The pool toilets are cavernous but unfinished ..like a building site.    Even the entertainment team who do work hard seem to focus on one type of tourist ( the under 30s) ..    I haven‚Äôt tried the Spa which is separate but several people said it was fully booked so couldn‚Äôt get any treatments when they stayed .. maybe a sign that this is good .. but disappointing for those that came here for a Spa break    If you are over 30 and or like a little attention to detail even a little customer engagement stay just about anywhere else in Marrakech,Date of stay: October 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/homerda
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Shinderkaur wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Value for money,Stayed fa week. Mostly french speaking guests.but staff did speak english too. Clean bright and comfortablerooms and bathroom. Food and drinks of good quality although not a wide range of alcohol or cocktails.  Although there is a big menu for food it's the same almost every night.  Entertainment team were excellent and very engaging.  Reception staff are attentative f2f but when you ring through to report a problem it's either forgotten or corrected several hours later. Reception staff could do with some customer service training as they tend to finish their conversations between themselves before addressing your concerns even f2f.  There is no information in the rooms about meal timings or activities available.  Sun loungers are not comfortable as no cushion pad available.  We found used cups and napkins still on tables in the morning by the pool left from the night before.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Loving hols wrote a review Oct 2022,30,It could be so much more,With a few tweaks and staff training this could be a real gem.    Food : was fine restaurant headed by Sayeed and Ahmed waiting staff polite and friendly.    Room: was lovely and clean.    Bars: service was rude the majority of staff would rather be on their phone than serve a drink. The lady in pool bar was lovely and some of the guys on the terrace bar were great but definitely some training in customer service is needed.    Animation: unless you‚Äôre under 30 they have no interest in you. The entertainment itself was pretty dire. Throwing spoons in the pool first one to retrieve is pretty lame. The team standing by the pool bar smoking isn‚Äôt impressive.    The pool area: loungers are filthy just to go round every morning and clean the beds wouldn‚Äôt take a lot.    Reception; most of the girls were lovely helpful and attentive apart from Maya rude and patronising.    For the price I paid it‚Äôs value for money but with a bit of effort it could be so much more.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Rochelle R wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Honest review !!!,Came here for 4 nights with my mum on a little getaway. I will say 4 nights was enough I think any longer I might have lost the plot.    To start the staff are all super super friendly. Mostly speak French but their English is good and always welcoming and say their hellos and good mornings.  Hotel is clean but definitely needs a revamp the rooms are standard but the beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable. This gave me back ache most of the holiday. The pillows also too big and hard so I slept without pillows which helped.    Breakfast for an all inclusive holiday was the worst I have ever experienced. Usually you get your simple eggs toast beans etc. The scrambled egg was so undercooked it came like porridge I did not eat this as it looked like it might make your stomach upset. There was no fried egg only someone making omelettes and pancakes. Again omelettes so undercooked it would fall apart and the soggy white fluid from the egg would run around your plate. I had to inform the chef to overcook. The pancakes and waffles came with icing sugar only. No banana or toffee or chocolate Nutella or syrup. Kind of defeated the object if you ask me.    The food was bland. No flavour. No spice. No salt. No flavour. Which was a shame as I was looking forward to some Moroccan food and culture. It was repetitive but there was lots of option and you wouldn‚Äôt go hungry but it would not give you the satisfied feeling you desired. I was shocked that there was never any sauce or gravy added to any of the food. It was so dry and bland. The sandwiches they did in the pool house had no sauce and was so hard and dry would cut the roof of my mouth. Safe to say I went hungry for a lot of the holiday and I am a person who can eat anything. I‚Äôm not a fussy eater.    My mum is elderly and struggled walking from our hotel room to the food and entertainment section of the hotel. It is a long up hill walk and I would not recommend if you have someone in your family who struggles to walk or someone in a wheelchair.    The pool was clean and the best feature. Always got a sun bed even when we went out later. The pool area was always clean and the drinks were strong and made nicely by the staff. Never had an issue with the strength of the alcohol.    The entertainment was good and the animation team work so hard day and night. The entertainment starts a little too late. 9pm which by then children are tired and the adult entertainment would not start until 10pm. When we first arrived we didn‚Äôt realise there was any entertainment because it started so late we ended up going back to our room.    I wouldn‚Äôt return here but I would recommend for a short and sweet and cheap get away for anyone. There is nothing around the hotel. You will need to get bus or taxi and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going into town alone as the markets are very pushy. We went with a tour guide from the hotel and found the experience a lot more enjoyable with someone there to help.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RochelleXRoachXEats2

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Hayley G wrote a review Sep 2022,20,"Average hotel, food awful",Good points. Rooms are nice and big cleaned every day with fresh towels. Pool is really nice and clean and big always got a sun lounger even on days we went out in the morning and came back at 2pm.  Bad points the hotel is really far away from the centre there's a shuttle bus (times aren't great) which is about 3 quid return per person. However if this bus is full it will cost you about 30 quid in a taxi return!  The food..... the food is not great. There's lots of options but its the same everyday limited drinks in the food hall no diet option other than water both me and my partner started with upset tummys 4 days in. Been home 2 days and still both so ill.  The hotel is very French including entertainment but they do translate some things.  Overall it was ok to far out and the food and how ill I am has put me off returning.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4079IVhayleyg

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,TeresaMG wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Ignore the reviews,Me my partner my daughter and her partner stayed for 10 days from the end of August into September. After reading the reviews we were worried but needn‚Äôt have been. We arrived before check in so our rooms weren‚Äôt ready so were given wristbands and went for lunch. There was a big selection of food and even I found plenty to eat and I‚Äôm really fussy. The majority of the food was labelled unless it was the salad bar or desserts. There‚Äôs soft drinks water or wine at meal times. We had a few drinks and our rooms were ready.    Our first problem was that they‚Äôd given us rooms a long way from the amenities but as my partner is disabled they moved us closer. The room was spacious and clean with everything we needed. Dinner was much the same as lunch but there were more choices.    Out take on previous complaints -  Our key card didn‚Äôt work so we were given a key - not a problem.  We always got 4 sun beds and 2 parasols together after 8.15 am.  If we needed towels or toilet roll we rang reception and they brought them to our room.  The food is repetitive but it‚Äôs the same in the majority of large hotels abroad.    They don‚Äôt give out bottles of water at meal times only by the glass but it‚Äôs not difficult to get one from the bar on the way in. After seeing the amount of wasted water I‚Äôm not surprised.    Yes the prices in the hotel shop changed (if they weren‚Äôt already priced) but that‚Äôs because you should haggle.    To the people moaning about listening to baby shark every night then don‚Äôt go to the kids entertainment - wait until it‚Äôs finished.    The hotel shuttle is about ¬£3 each for a return and needs booking the day before you want to go. The only problem we had was the receptionist told us they‚Äôd drop us where we wanted and the shopping centre was a 5 minute walk. Instead we were dropped in one pace and it was a 40 minute walk!!    We‚Äôd go again but wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to people with mobility problems as it‚Äôs on a hill.  All the staff were helpful and we didn‚Äôt come second to the French. They speak more French than English so tend to chat to them more. We were never ignored and they even had a minutes silence when the Queen died.    People moan about it not being a 4* but you need to remember that they‚Äôre a poorer country with different standards.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Long Eaton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeresaMG

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Celia G wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Enjoyed my relaxing stay here,I feel quite a lot of the reviews on here are unfair. If you‚Äôre not willing to accept and enjoy other cultures then don‚Äôt go abroad!    Reception area is lovely. Reception staff very welcoming and friendly. When checking in there was a British person being very rude to staff complaining about people being rude if you‚Äôre not nice to staff don‚Äôt expect it back in my opinion! Unable to check into room as we were early was able to enjoy the lunch drinks and pool until our room was ready.    Dining room with our booking it stated some of the restaurants are seasonal so didn‚Äôt expect these to be open. The buffet restaurant had a lovely selection of morrocan style food granted it wasn‚Äôt labelled well if you had allergies you might struggle however I enjoyed trying all the different foods they had on offer. If you‚Äôre just looking for plain ‚ÄòBritish‚Äô style food then maybe stay at home! Heard lots of complaints about not being much on offer but it was all delightful the salad bar was full of lovely salads beautiful cous cous and morrocan style curries the desserts where delightful such lovely little cakes and lots of chocolate ones I enjoyed every meal in this restaurant! Sometimes travelling to countries how they prepare food I can end up with ‚Äòtravel stomach‚Äô no issues here in this hotel everything was prepared beautifully!    The room we just had a standard room couldn‚Äôt figure out the safe but this didn‚Äôt phase me could just stash important documents in bottom of suitcase no issue. Lovely balcony air con worked room key always worked could do with a bit of TLC but enjoyed my stay. Needed a crib for my baby asked reception and it was in the room very quickly. Shower pressure lovely. See a few rooms being re vamped. Yes the fountains didn‚Äôt work but they‚Äôre in every ryad and I think it‚Äôs very sensible to conserve water usage in a hotel like this I understand why they aren‚Äôt all running! Still made a beautiful feature without the water. Mini fridge worked well could stock with water. Would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room.    The pool is beautiful very cooling on a hot day. There are activities run by the animation team all day. Bar staff were friendly and attentive. Always had ice in my drinks my partners beers were always cold. They had selection of spirits vodka gin rum whiskey for a Muslim country I don‚Äôt think you can ask for more it‚Äôs not always standard to have such a selection of drinks when it‚Äôs not really in the culture to drink! I think people need to remember this and be more culturally aware. You could ask for water but in the pool bar they would try conserve their stock and give you it in a cup but if you went to the bar by the terrace you could get as many bottles as you like.    Evening entertainment a bit sparce as we travelled with baby we didn‚Äôt really stay up late to see what went on. But with what we paid for the hotel (very cheap) can‚Äôt really expect amazing shows! The animation team did their best!    Shuttle into marrakech was about ¬£3 very cheap they drop you not far from the centre where all the markets are download offline google maps to help you find your way. Drop a pin where they dropped you off as this is where they pick you up!    Be prepared to haggle! You will always get over charged in shops and markets unless you try haggle a bit that‚Äôs just how it is in cultures like this they will try their luck!    Yes lots of tourists were French so lots of things were spoken in French. Once staff knew you were English they would talk to you in English. Had no issue taking part in activities with mostly French as the animation team just spoke in both languages switching between the two so everyone understood. Yet again this is just part of travelling certain areas have more tourists from certain countries you can‚Äôt just go and then say that ‚ÄòBritish people are second class‚Äô because you‚Äôre not comfortable with other languages!    All the staff were so friendly I enjoyed my stay here with my baby very relaxed just what I wanted loved sitting by the pool food was great!    Overall I think most of these negative reviews are from people who are a bit snobby if you want more to pay for a more luxury resort. And like I said before if you‚Äôre not going to enjoy other cultures don‚Äôt  come abroad!  I will be recommending this hotel for the price I paid my family thoroughly enjoyed our stay!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/celiatinson
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Micraman2001 wrote a review Sep 2022,30,"Warm beer, limited glass wear... catfished",Honestly do not base your hotel decision on the official pictures alone. This is nice hotel that could be exceptional with limited investment and decent managment observation    Primary issues.. bullet points.  1. None of the fountains around the hotel are switched on  2. No seating around the courtyard of the roads  3. Runs out of cold beer at pool bar and evening bar frequently and early  4. Bars regularly run out of spirits way in advance of close.  5. The two other restaurants on site are closed  6. Buffet whilst plentiful is repetitive and bland.  7. Pool restaurant is repetitive with limited selection and bland.  8. Bars are ill equipped and regularly run out of ice  9. Towels are older than the rags used to clean your kitchen floor  10. Charged a deposit for pool towels that are also like rags.    This hotel was mediocre and certainly not worth its 4* rating its in my opinion struggling to justify a 3* rating.  Issues with water pressure in the ryads poor attention to detail in room cleaning missing towels empty glasses left on balcony Ash tray rarely emptied.    The plus points the pool is fabulous and they have just replaced the sunbeds.  The restaurant staff are friendly and try to do their best in looking after the guests.  Lobby is nice and the staff in reception are very helpful.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Kyle wrote a review Sep 2022,20,Would not recommend for British,To start the only good things this hotel had were;    1. The animation team were brilliant full of energy and always happy.    2. Some and I mean only some of the bar staff were nice - 1 or 2 of them were helpful.    3. The Aircon is free and luckily (after reading other reviews) our room Aircon worked perfectly fine. If honest I think it's pot luck if you're allocated a decent room.    4. The rooms are large and spacious but very dated I had to factory reset the TV to get channels.    Now to list the bad things to come from our stay;    1. The food was bland no labelling so couldn't even tell what ingredients were used in each dish and when you asked the chef's they either had broken English or didn't really tell you much about it so you had to guess what you were eating half the time. To add lots of variety however 2 things out of all the options changed each night so if you're happy eating pizza and bread for a week then this is the go to place.  None of the desserts had any labels so was a game of dessert roulette when it came to eating them.    2. Drinks were very limited to taste the only soft drinks they had were Pepsi Max and 7up. Beers were served in a plastic cup during the day and were pulled straight from a warm case - would only drink a beer at night if I were you. Cocktails were also just the local orange juice mixed with vodka and a dash of cordial.    3. The reception staff were rude and would not have any authority over ANYTHING that happened in the hotel they'd always just tell you to speak to someone else regarding your question.    4. Cleaning of the rooms was shocking you have to be in the room when it's being cleaned to ask them to change your bed sheets otherwise you're sleeping in the same sheets for as long as you stay. Towels were also old and full of holes like another review here - it was like drying your body with sandpaper.    5. The toilets in the rooms would stink of sewage throughout the day at times it was almost unbearable to even be in the room.    6. Cleaners would leave our balcony doors open good luck if you're on the bottom floor.    7. We watched someone ask the staff for a fresh towel as the one they'd been given was dirty and unclean the staff refused and told them they need to come back the next day for a fresh towel.    8. SOME of the men speak down to women every time my partner asked them a question they would direct their answer to me.    9. Safe didn't work no guide on how to work it.    10. Loveholidays noted it was 20 minutes from the airport when we booked however it's minimum 30 minutes and is in the middle of nowhere minimum 150 MAD (¬£13ISH) to get to the city centre.    11. If you happen to come at a busy time good luck finding anywhere to sit at night if you are a late eater. There were about 40 tables outside which are taken by 8:30pm sunbeds are the exact same but all taken by about 8:30am (probably normal in a place like this).    12. Shuttle bus is cheap (¬£3pp) but drops you off no where near anything and you've to find your own way to wherever you're looking to go. Google maps is handy to have in this situation. Don't take any guidance from the locals unless you're willing to give them some money.    13. WiFi is in a world of its own other than when you're sat at the reception.    14. DO NOT bring any travel adapters made in china none of them work and would advise to buy one from the shop in the hotel.    Overall we enjoyed our holiday in Morocco however would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone which is a shame as Morocco is a beautiful country and filled with lovely people. If you're staying or planning to come to Morocco then stay in the city centre Marrakesh to save yourself the hassle.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569kyleb
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Michelle A wrote a review Sep 2022,20,Not a 4*,This hotel is not a 4* at all however there was a few positives.    The entertainment staff were really good and worked hard - however by the pool the speaker was far to loud!    The rooms were nice but needed some TLC - however air con was free which was needed for the heat also mini fridge in the room not stocked but that didn‚Äôt matter as able to put bottles of water in to keep cool. Cleaners came in everyday and the towels were changed however they are very old towels    Food - shocking! It‚Äôs pretty much the same everyday and just not great at all - whilst a lot on offer it‚Äôs boring and after 10 days it‚Äôs took it‚Äôs toll    Drinks - shocking and disgusting - there is no sugar free option apart from Pepsi max if they have it. Cocktails they should just take them off the menu they are not cocktails at all.    Staff - most of the staff were pleasant and friendly and would help out with what they could.    Hotel offers a shuttle service into the town - you have to book the day before and it‚Äôs 30 per person return journey which is nothing at all - however it‚Äôs not advised that you have to pay for it and I only found out from a review on Tripadvisor.    There is a cash machine at the property but never has cash in it!    Towels - you can put a deposit down for pool towels which you get back at the end of your stay as long as you hand the card back.    Overall this was not my best holiday and I wouldn‚Äôt return - the issues which the hotel could be resolved if they spent a small amount of money and it‚Äôs a shame because the grounds and the designs of the rooms are really good but I feel most people would probably feel the same they would return,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Potters Bar, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleaU5852NU

Pool was very well looked after and also kept clean. Food was good only down side to this holiday was the bottled water situation around the pool you would go up to the bar and ask for bottled water for two people and this was done by two cups or if you was tipping then bottled water would be given this is all inclusive holiday and it is water as a pregnant women asking for water should not have to tip for a bottle.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Philip G wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Pleasant hotel but it is NOT a 4-star,1. Hotel particularly good nice rooms well-apppointed. Room service shoddy towels provided in rooms were old worn full of holes it was like rubbing yourself down with sandpaper.  2. Grounds are lovely lots of trees and shrubs the pool is fantastic. I would not recommend this hotel for the elderly or infirm. The rooms are a quite a long walk from reception and Terrace Bar and quite a few steps leading up to that area. Disabled access is good as there is a long ramp beside the steps that takes you up to the Terrace Bar and reception. None of the fountains that were featured in the hotel description were operating including those on the ground floor of the riyads.  3. Food was well-presented and plenty of it in the main restaurant but it lacked diversity and was repetitive and did not explore the diverse nature of Moroccan food. Desserts are fantastic the pastry chef deserves a special mention. There is a pool restaurant that serves a limited menu. The two other restaurants Tapas Bar and Darkhoum which were part of our package on a limited basis were not open disappointing.  4. The Pool Bar and Terrace Bar were constantly running out of cold/warm or no beer also mixers spirits -- extremely poor service. There is the Blue Bar which is available after 11pm but drinks are not free and you pay premium prices. We did not use it.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Aish wrote a review Sep 2022,30,It was an okay hotel,The staff of this hotel were really nice but overall I would not say it was one of the best hotels we have visited. It is not somewhere I would recommend to my own friends and family. When we arrived to the room (which we had to find ourselves and in the dark not an easy find) the room smelt of sewage because of the bathroom we were given one bath towel to share between two the safe was not ready for us to use the air con remote did not even have a working battery. The room which we were given was quite a walk away from all the facilities. For an all inclusive hotel they dont really have much to offer (this is based on what the neighbouring hotel serve in comparison to what was served here). The food was okay but they didn't really have a lot to offer people who may not be interested in eating fish/meat/chicken or may not enjoy the Moroccan cuisine. They advertise that they have an indoor pool but dont be fooled as you have to pay to use it as it is in the spa. For someone who enjoys swimming in private this was not ideal. On their location it says only 15 minutes from the hustle and bustle of the souks and medina this is also not true as it used to take us 30-40 minutes to get there and they have a shuttle but you have to pay for it we chose to take a private taxi each time as this accommodated us and our timings rather than the hotels. The animation team were amazing and very welcoming and encouraged us to join in on their activities.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,angela s wrote a review Sep 2022,20,10 day stay,I don't often like to write reviews as they are very subjective. Like others i was sceptical after reading the reviews .I am currently on my last 2 days here . I am very open minded especially following years of covid and no tourism trade.  Safe not working I can live with  Toilet seat half off I can live with  Fridge no shelves or door shelves again can live with thread bare towels can live with    Plenty of space around pool although a lot of the loungers are broken and need a good clean .  Reception was always very helpful when we needed anything .  What I was shocked about was the fight and I mean arguments about getting water . We dont drink Alcohol drink little to no juice but trying to get bottles of water is like asking for gold. There is none left in your room there are no bottles to collect at the restaurant so only pool bar or main bar where you have to argue to get more than one bottle ALL INCLUSIVE !!    Also have never ever had to wash my own bed sheets when on holiday so I can have a fresh bed . I stripped the beds to be changed and they just made them up again using the same sheets.    This could be such a lovely hotel but some investment is needed and attention to detail ASAP.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Mikey D wrote a review Sep 2022,30,You get what you pay for,This was booked fairly last minute and we got given a good deal (which ties in with the title).    Before the trip we read the reviews and were concerned regarding the negativity surrounding guests‚Äô stays. However it really isn‚Äôt as bad as it is made out to be on here. Yes there were a few hiccups along the way (allocated a room that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned yet safe not working and leaking air conditioning unit) but the rooms are really nice and come with an outdoor balcony area which is perfect in the evenings.    The pool area is ideal and we never had issues getting a sun lounger (we would head down at 9.30/10am). The animation team are great at running entertainment throughout the day at the pool area (there are two pools) however be prepared to have music blaring at you if you decide to sit in that area. The pool bar is also good but like with the main bar the portion sizes and range of drinks are limited.    The restaurant (cantina) provides breakfast lunch and dinner but it is repetitive and you will likely have the same food every night. It can be manic in there in the early hours of dinner service and if you‚Äôre looking for high quality cuisine then you should look further afield.    The evenings come with a mix of entertainment for children and adults ranging from talent shows to karaoke. Again repetitive but they do their best to entertain and cater for all.    All in all the staff are really friendly and the hotel did the job for us providing a relaxing 7 night get away! Our advice would be to come with an open mind and embrace the world of the ryad park and spa for the week - you‚Äôll be entertained thats for sure!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/731mikeyd

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Alex S wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Very disappointing in so many ways,We are on our last day of our 5-night stay in this hotel which is about 20-30 minutes from the centre of Marrakesh. Reviews we read prior to our trip gave rise to some concerns about the quality of this accommodation and sadly many of the negative ones were fair and accurate.    We didn‚Äôt expect anything approaching UK 4* standards but the hotel left us very disappointed in most respects.    On the positive side the pool was very good clean and with plenty of space for loungers around the perimeter. The two sections meant that when water sport activities were running they didn‚Äôt interfere with people wanting to just swim. Also the restaurant whilst very soulless and lacking atmosphere did serve a good selection of food which was mainly of a good standard fresh and acceptable.    Sadly though the negatives far outweigh the positives. This hotel most likely looked and felt impressive when it first opened but years of minimal to no investment has left it looking very sorry for itself. Many fixtures and fittings are well past their serviceable life and should have been replaced long ago. One of two table tennis tables only has 3 legs (one had rusted away!). Towels were threadbare and we were only given 2 for our family room of four. When we asked for more we were told they would be sent but they never came despite repeated requests. The minibar fridge was empty and absolutely filthy so we turned it off. A cockroach made an appearance in our room simply because the doors to our verandah would not close properly. The bath had been allowed to rust and the toilet was stained. The safe never worked despite us repeatedly asking for it to be repaired.    Some staff made a little effort others always managed a smile but some were outright miserable and rude. Customer service is not in the culture of how this hotel has been set up to operate. Too many inexperienced junior staff are left unmanaged which leads to poor ineffective and sometimes almost obstructive service where staff will tell you ‚Äòno‚Äô to something with no attempt or interest in finding an alternative.    The list goes on but suffice to say we would never return for all the genuine reasons shared above. I don‚Äôt suppose that this hotel is alone in this respect with other reviews of similar hotels seeming to reflect much the same. We enjoyed our time in Marrakech and used the hotel as a safe base from which to explore but next time we will spend more and ensure a far better accommodation. It was definitely not good enough for our money.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerset, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex-Bex
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Bilqees A wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Lovely holiday with my family,A great week here. The reception staff are very welcoming helpful. Stunning lobby and restaurant. Cleaning always maintained. Entertainment team are amazing always doing something for the guests. They work all day and still enthusiastic at night time entertainment. Only issue was the room was quite far away from the main building but wasn‚Äôt a big problem. The pool is amazing however people are up from 4/5am to put towels on Sun beds so if you‚Äôre not early then you will not get a sun bed all day. Food was good plenty of variety. The staff work very hard thanks for an amazing holiday.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bilqeesa2018
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Laila K wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Not a 4 star hotel,Well ! What can I say about our lovely family holiday in this 4 star hotel ? Basically all the above is a miss quote apart from my lovely family .  Reception staff are rude and basically can‚Äôt be bothered to help or don‚Äôt know the meaning of providing a service .  Food was ok but became very the same but waiting staff pleasant  Rooms were not maintained and most things were broken including the safe  Plugs hanging off wall and A/C really loud .  Ants everywhere  Hotel shop - staff were again rude and no pricing on items staff just plucking prices out of air .  Pool ok and pleasant enough but having to get up early to get sunbed otherwise you have no way of getting a sunbed all day !!  Nothing to do in the evening unless you want to dance to baby shark every night for a week .  Terrence bar needs more staff and needs to have a new fridge and ice machine as everything served is basically warm !  Apart from that the rep from love holidays was trying to be helpful but he is fighting a losing battle as this hotel and most of the reception staff need to be closed down cleaned up with maintenance and attitudes .,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832lailak
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Stephen G wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Rude! Poor! Avoid!,There are a lot of poor reviews left already and to be honest it doesn't matter what gets written as the hotel will ignore it anyway!    We arrived and there were not enough beds in our room. Reception not at all helpful and basically said we would need to put up with it. We ended up getting one from a maintenance guy and then having to steal one from another of the rooms we had booked (we were a large group).    Took 3 days to get more than one bath towel for the room (there were 4 of us). Kept getting promised more towels Never materialised until our rep got involved after we said we wouldn't pay for our trip until they were in the room. Surprise surprise this was then sorted.    Bar staff were rude. We asked for a large bottle of water for our room. We were told we had to wait until 10pm until we could get that! Had to escalate to dining manager to get that sorted. A bottle of water for crying out loud!!    Hotel is really poorly maintained and in need of investment and repair. Many toilets and lights not working.    Dining area is ok. Food was OK. Difficult to get a drink! Water is treated like gold by the staff and they are very careful in pouring it. Cutlery was not that clean and it is hot inside!    Pool is great! You do need to reserve the beds or you won't get one. May be different in off peak times.    The public toilets in hotel were disgusting. Saw three toilets covered in poo (not hotels fault). Seems the solution is to just close the door!    We had a good time as we went as a big family. However would I go again?

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Tigerlily F wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Alright,The rooms: We arrived at 12 and had to wait till about 4pm to check into our room but reception were lovely and we were able to have lunch while we waited. Rooms very standard they were clean we had a safe aircon and fridge so can‚Äôt complain . We are a couple and did have twin beds we were a bit uncomfy sleeping and had to make do. Rooms did get hot but it‚Äôs about 40 degrees outside so to be expected. Tv very good had English channels showing good films so nice to pass the time. Most rooms seemed to have balconies or an outside part shower was fairly decent.  Staff: everyone is so lovely always wanting to help special thankyou to sallah and idriss they took photos for the hotel like a professional thing but would sit and play cards with us and always had a chat.  The pool: a lovely big pool had separated parts one for kids and activities and then the main pool which was big enough for everyone to move around but despite saying no reserving sun beds this did happen meaning you have to get up early to get a sunbed staff didn‚Äôt enforce the rule and a lot of the time sun beds would be reserved but no one using them so that was quite annoying. You also have to put a deposit on towels to use at 200 dirhams  Food/Restaurant: food was alright presentation always nice and floors and tables kept clean but there are flies always around. Not much of the food is labelled which if your fussy proves difficult to eat but they do have pizza and pasta everyday the food is always the same which did become boring near the end of our stay and they didn‚Äôt have ketchup in the main resteraunt which really upset my boyfriend as he does like ketchup. Drinks where pretty simple on the all inclusive side not really any cocktails and the glasses where very standard did have another bar but it charged money and I never seemed to see any staff there. The bar hygiene wasn‚Äôt to great either due to the amount of flys that where around the Pepsi pumps ext. You can‚Äôt drink the tap water here so they did provide water but seemed to get a bit funny if you asked for more than two and considering it‚Äôs a 3 minute walk from your room the bar to get little bottles of water it can be tedious.  Entertainment: again it was alright but the same songs/dances over and over again good for kids but really we didn‚Äôt spend a lot of our night there so can‚Äôt comment too much. They did provide  Pool games and such like waterpolo and Zumba    The hotel: the entrance was really nice to walk into when we arrived and the reception staff where very kind it always looked very nice in the reception area. Sofas etc. but when walking around the riads there was a smell of sewage throughout the day but it never made its way to the pool or into are rooms Which was good.    Trips outside: so they advertise trips which you pay for through the hotel a little bit expensive but getting to see the culture was amazing. We had three trips quad biking which was brilliant taxi out there and a visit during the ride to a village for tea and then taken back. A tour into the medina well worth it to see the souks also taken to a pharmacy sort of thing where you get taught about how things are made such as Argan oil also with a tour guide you don‚Äôt seem to get bothered too much . We also went to the waterfalls but remember to bring a swimsuit so you can swim as we didn‚Äôt and had to walk around a bit wet for while. However we did have to pay the tour guide at the end which we thought was included in the price. But it was only around ¬£5 for two. So not a rip off. So overall trips pretty good. You can pay for a bus into the market which we did however our bus broke down and we got picked up by another and then ended up paying for a taxi back as we wanted more time and there wasn‚Äôt another bus till 3 hours later so best option to go early as you can.  In general we had a lovely stay but the hotel is a bit out of the way and not loads to do if you didn‚Äôt want to be in the pool all day but the trips are good and everyone nice. for what it is the hotel is okay but i wouldn‚Äôt recommend going in school holidays or other expensive times just because the hotel is simply not worth the price we paid but this don‚Äôt mean that we didn‚Äôt enjoy are stay hear just wish it was worth the money we paid and I can‚Äôt say that it was but again the staff were lovely and the atmosphere was good.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tigerlilyf2022
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,berttantill wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Resort was a mix of good and bad.,We had an overall good trip but there were some shortcomings to the hotel.    Room cards would get wiped if they were too close to your mobile not a massive deal but trekking across the whole resort late at night got a bit annoying probably had to do this 3 or 4 times.    Aircon was sketchy out of 10 nights probably had fully working aircon 5. One night it just started screeching like a crying baby which is what I was like after only two hours sleep.    Maintenance was very slow I had to go to reception and ask several times for the aircon to be fixed.    Wi-Fi coverage was bad I expected the speeds to be low but they were all but unusable and there were several blackspots including around the pool.    All inclusive bar closes at 11 there was a pay bar open later but this was very noisy.    Food overall was very good and a good mix.    Entertainment was good a very active animation staff particular nod to Simon who couldn't do enough to help.    Bar staff surly and rude. Arbitrarily imposing 2 drink limits when I'm getting drinks for a whole table was very annoying. Selection was very limited only Vodka Gin Whisky or Beer. The mixers were very sweet too not much call for diet drinks in Morocco it seems.    Ridiculous rules about not taking water bottles to table at meals meant constantly getting up and down to refresh small glasses. We were a family of 6 just give us the bottles!    Incredibly rude restaurant manager who was sneering in my face at my audacity for requesting some water.    Cultural differences in appropriate behaviour staff asking young girls for social media details and one French gentleman who was basically groping anyone he could and was lucky be left with an intact nose.    Rooms were clean and the cleaning staff were great.    Weather fantastic and any contact with locals was very good. Taxi drivers bent over backwards to help us.    We managed ot have a good holiday despite the niggles which did add up.    Would not go back due to moody staff and site needing a refurb.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Dunstable, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berttantill
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Georgie O‚ÄôConnor wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Don‚Äôt waste your money,I am never one to really leave reviews but honestly this has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Firstly your room card doesn‚Äôt work (everyone in the hotel has the same problem) our first night we was locked out the room for around a hour. The reception was about a 7 minute walk from the room after going back and forth FIVE times they gave us a key and guess what the key didn‚Äôt work. Then for 3 days we asked for towels over and over nobody bought us towels in the end we had to shower and use a hair dryer to dry our selfs. The cleaners don‚Äôt leave towels and when you ask they say someone will bring them. The phone in the room doesn‚Äôt work so you can not contract reception unless walking there. The bath was blocked so when you showered the water didn‚Äôt go down the plug. The toilet seat in the room fell off every time we sat on it also ants running around the bathroom. Now let‚Äôs get to the food I honestly think people in UK prisons eat better food then what they have every single plate was dirty or wet the food honestly I can‚Äôt even explain how bad it was I have stayed in many all inclusive holidays this is by far the worst food. The only good thing about this hotel is the pool and entertainment Simon and Joseph are honestly a credit to the hotel. They make it fun and are honestly so good at their jobs as well the rest of the team. The bar staff are also lovely. The shuttle bus to town runs often which is very handy and cheap!

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,JoAnne N wrote a review Aug 2022,10,"Poor hotel, do not recommend",Not a 4 star hotel.    On arrival we were taken to our room by a Porter. It was discovered that our key didn‚Äôt work housekeeping let us in and we were told we needed to go to reception and get it sorted. Not a great start and not great service. We made our way to get a new key (it was a 10 minute walk back to reception) we were sent back to the room and maintenance came eventually and replaced the lock. It was replaced with a lock so hard to use that only my husband could use it.    Day 2 the aircon started spewing out a disgusting sulphurous smell that was unbearable. Maintenance came cleaned out the filter and sprayed the room with disinfectant. The next day it started again. They offered to come and spray the room again we declined as this smell was making us feel really ill. After googling we were rather worried about the cause of it and requested a room change. They then moved us to a room with 2 singles beds they pushed them together but they were different heights and they had no sheets to fit. Once again we asked to move. They said there were no more rooms and then there was a room (I am unsure how they found one). It was fine.    There are not enough Sun loungers for each guest guests get up at 7am and pop towels on them so by 8am every single bed has been ‚Äòtaken‚Äô. This is directly against what they ask you to do in the welcome document. We asked if there were more sun beds reception weren‚Äôt interested passed to animation team who simply shrugged and said people are crazy.    They ran out of beer twice once on a Friday night. They they started giving out glass bottles around the pool which felt rather dangerous. The pool is large and is kept clean.    There is only one restaurant there are others but they are not opened (in August). Food is the same morning noon and night. Many items are not labeled so if you have allergies this is not the place for you. There is no air-con in the restaurant and it is boiling in there.    Reception were apathetic at best.    The day prior to departure we asked to arrange a late check out as per the welcome pack. We were told that we must come in the day of departure to check if this is possible as it couldn‚Äôt be done‚Ä¶so we had to get up out of bed and go to reception to check if we didn‚Äôt need to get out of bed. It was very backwards.    At the main bar we were served a bottle of beer we asked to keep it in the bottle. The bartender refused and said no because it‚Äôs glass he then decanted it into a glass. This was odd and I think sums up the hotel.    The all inclusive part of the holiday stops at 11pm and suddenly they have nicer branded products for you to buy to drink. All day it‚Äôs rather terrible local products until this point.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannenf

Animation team were great particularly Jozef and Simon chatted with everyone every day. Reception staff efficient asked for extra pillows they were there within 15 minutes we had a problem with the card access on the door rang them maintenance guy was there within 5 minutes. Pool huge exceptionally clean plenty of sunbeds. Cannot fault this hotel staff and/or facilities in any way. Loved it so much we have booked to go again in September!!  The only downside is nothing to do with the hotel as such it's to do with the guy who sells the trips from W2M-DMC trips this is a private company situated within the foyer of the hotel. Don't bother booking with them ... we did 2 trips with them one a tour of Marrakech which promised shopping in the Souks however the shopping trip was to the guides mates shop that was it! Very disappointing. We also did the trip to the Bedouin camp camel riding was great but the ""traditional"" food was awful the chicken tagine was not a tagine it was roast chicken so overdone that it was inedible in fact at one point i thought i had eaten a bone - it was in fact the chicken skin. For other trips and a taxi back to the airport we found a local guy ... Abdo from Abdelkhalek He was so knowledgeable much cheaper than W2M-DMC it was a personalised service strongly recommend this guy. Website ..

There are always sunloungers available which is almost unheard of in most places! The rooms were absolutely stunning .. and had air con which is what you need in the incredible Moroccan heat.  The negatives - the staff on reception were nothing short of incredibly rude. Everytime I had been to reception they seemed to ignore the fact I was there and continued discussions between themselves. When I finally got seen too they were rude and unhelpful. As a solo female traveller I find this quite upsetting. The animations team also seemed to only focus on and approach groups rather than myself as a solo.  Don‚Äôt let the above put you off.

There really is only 1 restaurant which is buffet style and the menu throughout the week hardly varies at all but the food is well cooked for the most part.  I‚Äôm disabled but despite not being fully booked which was their excuse for only 1 restaurant they decided to put us as far away from everything as possible and up 2 flights of stairs with no lift the path leading to it was made of uneven stones which were difficult for me and painful to walk on the hotel room was very basic and could benefit from tea and coffee facilities and much better air conditioning unit as the one in our room barely made a dent in the heat. But everything was kept clean by the really lovely staff.  The hotel itself is a bit run down and lots of the amenities were closed so outdoor pool or bar were the only options unless you wanted to pay for spa treatments.    You could travel into town using their shuttle service for a fee or taxi. Walking is out of the question as it takes a good 10+ minutes drive to get there and there‚Äôs so much building work going on in the area around the hotel which is in the middle of nowhere we used the shuttle but neither the hotel staff or driver warn you about the people waiting at the drop off point who claim to be guides from your hotel of course they‚Äôre not they get paid by vendors for bringing you to them if you buy something for the most part this is fine but remember they‚Äôre not really there for you.

We were greeted by the hotel manager who was very friendly and was offered welcomed drinks. On first impressions the hotel reception is beautiful large and clean.  When we were allowed to check in after 2pm we was shown to our rooms. We got to see the pool and it was lovely very big and plenty of room around with a pool bar.  The rooms we did have a few problems such as a plug socket hanging off wall cracks in bedroom floor a cracked sink and one part of the patio doors did not lock. All the things that could be sorted was dealt with straight away.  The rooms are nice and big with plenty of storage and you have a fridge.  The food was great plenty of choices and plenty of it. If you enjoy Rice noodles & different meat/ fish then you‚Äôve got different choices each night. Also has Chips and pizza every lunch time. Cannot fault this at all. The waiting staff are excellent especially Medi who went out of his way every day to serve us our drinks.  The Animation team are extremely friendly everyone is so nice and they work extremely hard every day and night to entertain you. Lots going on during the day but if you are after a quiet sun lounger day by the pool sorry this isn‚Äôt the place for you from 10 am till 5.30pm the music is blaring out most in French.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,leighleigh97 wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Most perfect hotel on outskirts of busy Marrakesh,This hotel is amazing from the rooms food scenery to the staff it really is worth every penny. We went all inclusive and found there was so much to choose from at all meals they cook some meals fresh in front of you which are delicious so many different options to chose from (even for picky eaters) and the desserts are out of this world. They really pride themselves on their food and they had so many options for lunch and tea: fish meat salad pasta potatoes fresh food stations freshly cooked pizzas breads soups etc. Leave room for deserts‚Ä¶ they have fresh waffles and ice cream at lunch.    For breakfast there is porridge cereals pastries salads fruit traditional Moroccan breakfast- thousand holes (pancake/crumpet) crepes and most importantly an omelette station. This was the best part of breakfast the omelettes are delicious.    The staff at the hotel really make the place amazing the maids are so attentive and change towels and bedding everyday sometimes leaving cute surprises such as petals or pretty towel displays. Every single member of staff couldn‚Äôt do enough and so friendly and helpful‚Ä¶ even offering to carry drinks to your table for you. We loved the animation team they were all friendly and didn‚Äôt push to hard if you didn‚Äôt want to get involved. If you get chance to watch the cabaret show please do it‚Äôs really amazing to watch! They made sure everyone was able to get involved as little or as much as they wanted and are a credit to the hotel. The waiters/bar staff do anything they can to help and are super friendly.    The hotel is situated 20 mins from the centre of Marrakesh old town we used the hotel shuttle bus which was 15 dirham each way and really simple book the day you want to use it and check the times for the return bus. We enjoyed being on the outskirts as could visit the markets when we wanted but avoided the hustle and bustle of the centre.    We booked 5 excursions with the gentleman in reception and they were worth every penny. We did the:    - Hot air balloon at sunrise (was the most amazing views and defo recommend)    - Quads and camel trek    - Guided market trip- we felt so much more comfortable with a guide as we would have got lost. Helped with locals who wanted us to visit their shops.    - Visit to Essaouria (6-7 hours on coach but worth it) to a beach and get 4 hours free time.    - Atlas Mountains trip (Long day on coach due to stops at Argon Oil Co operative Berba House etc) but the views are amazing. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk up steep hills.. worth it to see the mini waterfall.

First of all I want to give a massive thanks to Simon Hassan Joseph and Mimi of the entertainment team. From day one they opened their arms and made us feel welcome. Hassan has the biggest heart I‚Äôve ever seen and Simon and Joseph are so funny. Not a day went by where 5 minutes with these 2 didn‚Äôt put a smile on our face. Bar staff maybe need to learn to smile and why they are so protective over bottled water baffles us we pay money for all inclusive we shouldn‚Äôt have to explain why I need water when it‚Äôs 39 degrees. (Buy a 6 pack in town) saves hassle. Next big mention is the restaurant manager always forgot his name (I‚Äôm sorry) but a massive massive thanks to this gentleman whilst on holiday I proposed to my partner and when arriving at the restaurant that night we were taken to a table decorated with flowers big wine glasses and the most beautiful cake clearly made that day! Touches like this just put the cherry on top of what was a great holiday and we will never forget the holiday because of the effort individuals listed above put in to make it special. Miss the place and the team already and hope to go back and see you all again soon.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Genea Adams wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Amazing,LAST DAY TODAY  We arrived on 12th June from stepping of the plane I loved every minute of this trip! The hotel has a very traditional feel with its beautiful decor and stunning views. The staff are so helpful and nothing is too much trouble. The animation team are fantastic not too pushy with a great programme thats for everyone! The ryad rooms are lovely and spacious. The pool is lovely and refreshing after spending an hour in the sun. Everywhere is so clean all staff work so hard! The food is fab too something for everyone even fussy eaters. I recommend a trip to spa for massage! So relaxing and the smells that come from spa are amazing. Take a trip to medina  very interesting and knowledgeable learning some morrocan history and saw the amazing sights of bahia Palacethe Jewish quarters mosque sights of the culture and the amazing medina! We have booked quad bike and dessert trip today so excited! Everything is very reasonable priced to! Don't be scared to haggle either.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Raj_worldandher wrote a review Jun 2022,50,A relaxing experience,Our experience was pleasant. We stayed here for a week and made the right decision staying 20 mins outside of the centre (we also spent some time staying in the centre). The rooms were nice bathroom was big the pool area was good and the restaurant had a fair amount of choices. There‚Äôs also a spa and gym which was nice to use. The shop inside (ran by a lady and her dad) were also really good at getting what you need be it going to buy something that they don‚Äôt have in stock that day.    I would have rated the resorts facilities less but the animation team responsible for experiences/ shows changed my decision. A special note; Mimi was very attentive - both her and Asma had a huge smile on their face Simon (Moroccos breakdance champion!) and Joseph really helped us understand the local culture and Chinwin was a fantastic host /DJ who knows everything about the resort - all being excellent dancers too! If you‚Äôre reading this - Thank you all.    Feedback for resort: Keep an eye out if you have dietary requirements. You need to ask what‚Äôs in the food - the labels aren‚Äôt 100% clear.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raj_worldandher
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Liv X wrote a review May 2022,10,1 star,I‚Äôm not usually one to leave 1 star reviews but I had to as this place is awful. To start off the key cards and door locks for our rooms didn‚Äôt work correctly after going back and forth with the receptionist multiple times a new lock had to be installed. Due to this happening we felt like we had to lock our suitcases every time we left the room. There was also no wifi connection or air con in our room.  Secondly the food was abysmal and had no variety whatsoever. I‚Äôm all for trying new things but when the buffet food given to you has no labels on and has flies all over it it puts you off. On this note; a lot of the food wasn‚Äôt labelled so we couldn‚Äôt work out what ingredients was included and was cold/Luke warm majority of the time. Due to this my partner and I had upset stomachs 5 out of 7 days we were there.  And thirdly the hygiene of the whole resort was poor. Flies and insects were everywhere not only in the lobby bar and restaurant but also in our rooms. There was also a broken mini fridge which kept leaking all over our room floor. Housekeeping did come in everyday to inspect but would just make the bed and leave dirty glasses were left and no clean towels were ever given until we requested new ones.  Overall a very disappointing experience considering the price was not cheap. This hotel has been advertised as 4 stars I would only give it 2. I‚Äôve previously stayed in lower star rated basic hotels and have felt a lot safer and cleaner :(,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/745livx

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,PlymouthSmiler wrote a review Apr 2022,20,Very disappointed,We are currently at this hotel. The hotel it‚Äôs grounds and most of the staff (apart from the 2 absolutely miserable ignorant male staff in the main bar) are very friendly. There are plenty of sun beds around the pool and no urgency to try and reserve them in the mornings. Of course we have sunshine which is why we chose Morocco at this time of year. Unfortunately that‚Äôs all the compliments I can give this hotel. Let‚Äôs start by saying the food is horrendous. Everything is luke warm sometimes cold. I‚Äôve had an upset stomach for 2 days now. My husband complained last night to the main chef and he didn‚Äôt look like he was interested. I also reported it to reception. The variety is poor and there are so many flies around the food too. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve lost weight on an all inclusive as I‚Äôm eating salad a bit of pizza and bread. We look forward to breakfast every day so we can have freshly cooked eggs or omelette. Now for the drinks. Very poor selection. Yesterday I noticed they had a cocktail menu so asked for a pina colada. The bar man basically put barcadi in my glass and fill it up with orange juice! We are very disappointed in this hotel and definitely wouldn‚Äôt return. We have been Morocco before and I would class this hotel a 3 star not 4. I would like to say we got this hotel at a cheap rate but we didn‚Äôt. Maybe they have dropped their standards due to Covid and losing money but if they want their guests to return they need to up their game.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,plymouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlymouthSmiler

Also stair lights switched off - dangerous!  Taxis booked by guests not allowed to entrance (stopped at barrier) so no way of knowing if taxi is there    We stayed at this hotel in October 2021 and needless to say from points made above we would not recommend or return.  At the weekend there were ‚Äúimportant‚Äù guests staying during which time the main restaurant was opened the food choice and quality improved significantly and the outside lights were switched on!  When the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù guests left the main restaurant was closed again (we got to eat in a smallish dark room) and the food selection was limited to say the least.

Our rooms inside a beautiful ryad with an airy central space were lovely. Comfy bed and good furniture. Each ryad is set in huge grounds that are green and beautifully cared for. The pool was spectacular (hardly anyone was swimming maybe because it was March and a little chilly so we had it to ourselves). The facilities were excellent and the reception area was huge and quite magnificent. We had an all-in deal so with really good cooking and an extensive selection each night and well-stocked bars it was really good value.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,martyn r wrote a review Mar 2020,10,UTTERLY TERRIBLE - DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!,This is the first time in over 20 years of travelling around the world that i have felt so strongly about a hotel and its total disregard for its customers. The hotel has the potential to provide a good holiday experience but with the majority of the current staff this is impossible! below are my experiences and if you read through other previous reviews you will see we i am not alone in my findings.  Below I have listed the issues we experienced during our 4-night Stay at the ONA Marrakesh Ryads & Spa. Feb 2020.    1. Generally rude cold and unfriendly staff at reception. Given no information about the hotel facilities or the surrounding area on arrival.  2. During check-in we were told that we were not all inclusive and that we have booked for breakfast only. Upon providing 2 x form of proof both detailing all-inclusive which they refused to accept explaining that their system does not show this and we would have to pay extra. We refused and said that we suggest she contact her manager to get this sorted to which she told us to come back to reception in a few hours. We were also told that there were no restaurants shops or bars near the hotel and that the closest were a 30-minute taxi drive away. This turned out to be a total fabrication as our airport transfer driver told us there were restaurants within around 5 minutes.  3. During check in we were also asked to pay a 500Dir (¬£40) tourist tax which she simply typed 500 into the calculator and showed us the figure on the screen. When asked how this is calculated she became hostile and said ‚Äúyou must pay‚Äù! I asked again how is this calculated is it per night per person etc? Again she said ‚Äúyou must pay‚Äù. At this pointy I said we wanted to check this and if correct would happily pay later. At the end of our stay we met 3 ladies travelling form London who had stayed the same time as us and we asked to pay just 15Euros tourist tax for the 3 of them. At the point of checkout we were dealt with by a different member of staff and asked to pay the tax which by this time had reduced to 160Dir (¬£13.00).  4. After check in we were told to wait in reception and someone would show us to our room. We waited 25 minutes but no one appeared so I went back to reception to ask when they would be there to show us. She then asked the porter who had been sat at the end of the reception the whole time to show us which he did.  5. As our flight home was 9pm during the week we went to reception to ask if it would be possible to use a shower and get changed prior to our collection. We were informed that we would need to pay a 500Dir late check out fee as our stay expires at 12.00 midday. We were also told that we would not be able to have any food or drink after this time unless we paid the late check out fee. We did not pay this and decided to try to use the pool bar restaurant on checkout day so that we didn‚Äôt need to walk by the reception to get to the main restaurant. The food in the pool bar was a very limited choice and not suitable for my partner who ended up going hungry from midday.  6. Upon arrival we were told we needed to pay a 200Dir (¬£16.40) deposit for the pool towels. We handed the receptionist a 200Dir note and she wrote out a receipt with our room number on it and stapled it to the money. She then put this in a draw behind reception. We were then given 2 x cards and told to take them to the pool bar to collect our towels which we did. At the point of departure around 5.30pm we went to the reception with the 2 towel tokens which we had been given after returning them to the pool bar. The man behind reception asked for our receipt which I informed him we had not been given as it was kept by the receptionist and stapled to the money. He replied ‚Äúno receipt no refund‚Äù with a smile on his face. Again I explained that the receipt was stapled to the 200Dir note which was in the draw behind the counter. He opened the draw and pulled out a pile of cash and card receipts which he began to finger through. Again I said we gave you cash we didn‚Äôt pay by card. He smirked and said ‚Äúno receipt no money‚Äù. At this point it became very clear that this is another way of them exploiting customers and I became angry which is something I very rarely do. I explained again what our receipt was attached to the money so he needs to be looking through the cash pile not card receipts. He just smiled at me. I asked for his name and to speak to the manager to which he replied ‚ÄúI am the manager‚Äù. At this point my partner came over and others in the reception area were watching after hearing raised voices. At this point my partner spotted our receipt stapled to a 200Dir note which clearly stated room 1020. He leant over the reception and grabbed our note. At this point the receptionist became very angry and began swearing and shouting. The situation was escalating fast so another member of staff came over to calm the situation down. I pulled the receipt off of the note and gave it to him over the counter. At this point I walked away as I was very angry and upset by what had just happened. My partner stayed trying to explain to the other member of staff what had happened who apologised for her colleague‚Äôs behavior. We were both left physically shaking by this and felt sick throughout the rest of our journey home!  7. Following the dispute with the pool towel refund we sat down in the lobby to wait for our airport transfer which was booked for 6.00pm. As the time approached 6.20pm we could see the guy behind reception smiling at us and talking in his own language to staff who were laughing with him. At this point we had a feeling he had done something to the transfer so made contact with our travel agent via facebook. our agent was amazing and instantly put us at ease offering to find out what was going on. She contacted the transfer company who said they were on the way but that 1st driver had been in an accident. I‚Äôm not sure if this is true or if the receptionist had told them to use that excuse for being late or not arriving. At this stage the hotel receptionist said he would organise us a taxi to the airport but we would need to pay him. I told him there was absolutely no chance of us ordering anything through him and walked away. At 6.45pm a minibus arrived at the hotel. The driver was apologising for being late and loaded our cases into the bus. At this point the hotel reception guy came out and spoke to the driver. The driver replied in a confused way to what the guy had said. We got into the bus and left for the airport. I asked the driver what did the guy from the hotel say? The driver replied ‚Äúhe told me to drive slowly and take the long route to the airport‚Äù to which he replied ‚Äúbut these guys will miss their flight‚Äù. Again the hotel receptionist replied with a smile. Following a 1-hour terrifying journey to the airport we made it with minutes to spare going straight through security and onto the plane.  8. The shop in the hotel is a total rip off. The guy who runs is it rude and arrogant and is charging extortionate prices knowing the customer has been told they have no choice unless they want an expensive 60-minute round taxi ride.    Some general issues which I also think are worth a mention include:  1. Cleaners entering the room daily at 8.30am without knocking on the door.  2. The beds are very hard making it difficult to get a good night‚Äôs sleep.  3. The food is average at best with a lot of it being cold. There were reports of guests becoming ill from the food whilst we were there.  4. Location is very isolated and at least a 30 min journey not 10 as stated on the website. the Hotel is surrounded by dusty dirty wasteland.  5. The main swimming pool is very cold and far to cold to swim in.  6. During our first and last visit to the city we were repeatedly approached by locals offering assistance and guided tours and then asking for money. We have traveled extensively through Turkey Egypt Indonesia Thailand and the Caribbean and have never felt hounded like this. After 3 hours we returned to the hotel following a an attempt of an elaborate scam by a group of locals.    All in all this was an horrendous experience and has left a very sour taste in our mouth about the hotel and Morocco in general.,Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457martynr
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,frequent traveler wrote a review Mar 2020,20,UNTRUSTWORTHY: BEWARE OF DISHONEST MANAGEMENT,A beautifully laid out hotel and would have been stunning in its hay day.  Sadly the bathrooms are quite dated and not that clean plus a pipe exploded during our stay.  Everyone has to listen to the loud music by the pool most of the day.  The food choice and quality is good for a buffet style  Ambience of the brightly lite dining room with squashed seating makes for a poor dining experience  A lovely waiter called Hamaz even went over and above his duty.  The most disappointing and frustrating thing of all was the dishonesty of the hotel management. This is the reason why the star rating is so low.  ‚Ä¢ I has originally booked 3 days in June 2020 non refundable. However a couple of weeks after the booking (Jan 2020) we decided that we would quite like to get some sun in Feb instead.  ‚Ä¢ So I rang the hotel to ask them if they would consider canceling my 3 day June booking (6 months in advance) in return for me booking a 7 day stay with them in Feb. The gentleman checked with management and stated that this was not a problem.  ‚Ä¢ They took the booking over the phone and sent me email confirmation of the 7 day Feb booking ... without written confirmation of the 3 June booking being cancelled.  ‚Ä¢ Once they had my Feb booking they then refused to cancel by booking in June (7 emails 8 phone calls and 2 face to face requests).  ‚Ä¢ Not only did they lie but they have 6 months to get those 3 days in June booked so I do not understand why they cannot honor their promise,Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer462114
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,gina h wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Completely disregarded and ripped off,"I booked the hotel last minute via Hoteltonight There were 2 errors. The app showed the hotel was in walking distance of the Medina. It is 13 KM away. The hotel listing also said All Inclusive. After a pricy taxi ride there I was told nothing was included. Each time I tried to talk to the hotel about this they would just say it was a mistake of the App disregarding they made the listing. If I wanted to eat I had to pay for pricy but mediocre buffets. No one could tell me if I had to pay for breakfast or not. In the end the manager told me I was supposed to be paying for it but was letting it slide this time which made me feel like a thief. I went to buy a drink by the pool The price changed twice and then I was told I would have to walk to the lobby to get change. As woman traveling I was isolated unless I wanted to take a shuttle into town. This eats up a half hour each way. I took two tours with the hotel. Both very expensive and bad. We sat in a bus for 2 hours by the side of the road waiting to go to the desert as they sent on shuttle in and out of the city to get people from other hotels. I also paid for a private guide in the city so I could get an understanding of it and get some history. I said multiple times I did not want to shop. I was brought to demonstrations and shops. i asked for assistance in buying a SIM for internet.. I was pushed into buying the wrong thing. Hoteltonight made some adjustments on their end but the hotel gave me a coffee after I felt like I was being accused of taking breakfast. I just wanted them to say that they were sorry for the problem and correct their listing but they wouldn't do that. They would just tell me to let it go. In the end they told me the taxi to leave would be twice as much as coming there. When I got upset the took off a third of the price proof they are skimming wherever they can. The ""taxi"" driver dropped me on the wrong side of the Medina that was a far walk from my new hotel when there was a main road that was closer.

The hotel is set in an ideal location outside the city with stunning views toward the snow capped Atlas mountains from the terraces & pool. The staff are very friendly the food was excellant with plenty of choice tasty & plentiful. The bedrooms are spotlessly clean & spacious. Already looking at booking next visit. I read reviews prior to our trip & so glad we didn't take their advice. Some people are always negative if you look for fault anywhere you can find it but you will have to look very hard to do that here. The towels for the pool are free you pay a deposit on arrival & get it refunded on check out. The entertainment team were fun & every night there was something different. Faboulous holiday....well done to all who made it very special.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909kerryi
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Guy W wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Friendly hotel on edge of Marrakesh,Hotel is in the north of Marrakesh about 40mins from the airport (and 30mins from the medina/centre of Marrakesh). Upon arrival at the hotel the reception staff made for an easy check-in (and easy check out at the end). I think we had a room upgrade due to us visiting in early February and so the hotel was very quiet. The bed is firm - whether this is to your liking will be a personal preference. It‚Äôs worth noting the times (or taking a photo) they offer their shuttle bus service to get into Marrakesh centre and back ‚Äì this is a free service but they need to know beforehand so make sure you tell reception the day before if you want to go to town. Due to our flight times we only arrived at Ona around 10 pm so the restaurant was closed however a helpful waiter offered to make us a sandwich ‚Äì this was greatly appreciated! Although in typical Moroccan fashion afterwards the reception staff suggested that a tip would be welcomed‚Ä¶ I had no cash on me however I made sure a couple of days later when I had some I came back to give him a tip as he truly was very helpful!    Staff - The team who arrange the excursions who have their desks in the lobby area of the hotel were very helpful ‚Äì the lady on the desk there was extremely professional and friendly not trying to up-sell us and just gave us genuine advice on things we could do. She also helped us to confirm our return airport transfer even though it wasn‚Äôt arranged through them. The animation team around the hotel were friendly and offered us to get involved in games (volleyball etc.) but don‚Äôt push you into joining in with anything if you aren‚Äôt keen!    Food - During our stay the main restaurant was open offering a buffet for all meals however the additional 2 restaurants were closed as we were visiting during early February so the hotel wasn‚Äôt very busy. The buffet restaurant did offer a generally good mixture every day though including local Moroccan dishes and also had seating outside which was pleasant. You can get drinks at the terrace bar although a few drinks aren‚Äôt included in all-inclusive most are including beers wine gin (generous portions!) ‚Äìafter a certain time (11 pm I believe) they may charge.    Facilities - They have a gym a large swimming pool (with an attached kids pool) and a smaller heated pool. Besides is an outside pool bar for convenient drinks however due to the time of our visit the atlas pool bar was closed. Something worth knowing that we weren‚Äôt offered during our check-in but found out from asking around is if you‚Äôd like beach towels for drying off after swimming/sunbathing on you can get one by going to reception and pay a deposit to receive a ‚Äòtowel card‚Äô (keep your receipt of this). When you want a towel give your card to the lifeguard (often found by the atlas bar in the shade) then he will give you a towel when you‚Äôre done he returns your card. It‚Äôs a simple system and at the end of the holiday when checking out return your card and show your receipt to get your deposit back.    Spa - At the front of the hotel (near the gates) there‚Äôs a very nice spa ‚Äì in the spirit of Morocco we had a Hamman. This will exfoliate away all your dead skin making you feel smoother than ever. I‚Äôd recommend doing this at the start of your holiday (we did it on the first day) if you‚Äôd like to get a nice suntan. We did this as a couple together and it‚Äôs done in your own sauna privately. Be aware if you don‚Äôt have your swimming costumes on you‚Äôll be provided with little paper underwear/thong to wear and you‚Äôll be topless so make sure whoever you do this with you‚Äôre comfortable around ‚Äì staff are very professional throughout! The spa also offers all other usual treatments (massages waxing its own swimming pool/hot tubs)    Shop - in the hotel where some cheap items do have set prices (e.g. magnets/postcards) however if it has no price on it you still need to haggle.    General notes/tips:  - Wifi was good for us (I got over 50mbps in our room) but I would not rely on it totally as it was inconsistent at times.  - Bring along pound/euro coins for tips ‚Äì everybody in morocco wants a tip but you‚Äôll find it hard to get small change in Moroccan dirhams however people are more than happy to accept ¬£/‚Ç¨ coins so just bring them along with you on holiday.  - Morocco has a closed currency so you won‚Äôt get good rates outside of the country. However do get your money out when you first arrive into Morocco (ATM machine in arrivals gave me a good rate) as not much cash is held at the hotel for you to change your notes (they do accept card payments at reception though). Change your dirhams back before you leave Morocco too as again you'll get better rates while you're still in Morocco.  - Be aware when you check-in at the hotel you have to pay a tax (2 of us stayed for 4 nights and our tax was 300dh). This is normal in Morocco.  - Keep in mind the hotel is 30mins away from the medina and this hotel isn‚Äôt going to have much immediately around it this is perfect if you want to be on the edge of Marrakesh to relax but still have access to the centre whenever you want.  - Bring a pen for the airport! You may have to fill in a card to pass through immigration both ways ‚Äì this will go a lot quicker if you have your own pen on you and you have the hotel address already at hand.  - Expect delays at the airport when arriving and departing you may get lucky and get through quickly as I did but it wouldn't take much to delay everything as there are lots of checks to go through. When arriving you have to get your passport stamped when leaving you'll have to go through check in (eve if you're already checked in and have a boarding pass as you'll need it stamped) there's 3 seperate bag checks - entering the airport security and at the gate as well as having your passport stamp (from when you arrived) checked and restamped to say you're leaving.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Overton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guywalki

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,sheenar_13_13 wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Lovely hotel,Stayed a week all inclusive with friendsin February. Rooms were lovely and very cleanalthough single bed was very hard and a bit uncomfortable. Set in beautifully kept gardens. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Food was delicious and varied and plenty of choices for vegetarians and vegans.local wine served was very nicelight and refreshing. Animation team were great and provided varied entertainment to the mixed group of world citizenswith a wonderful morrocan themed show on our last night. It worries me that there are no recycling facilitiesespecially for all the plastic bottles of water that tourists demand bearing in mind what a precious resource the water isit was painful to see tourists taking it for granted and wasting half full bottlesand what a universal problem we now understand plastic to be. I didn't use the spa or indoor pool so can't comment on this facilityinstead I had a traditional Hammam in townwhich was a wonderful experience. Thanks to all the staffit can't be easy dealing with some of your guests !! X. I rate this hotel 4 star only because of the hardness of the bed which affected my sleep.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheenar_13_13
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,julie b wrote a review Jan 2020,40,lovely hotel,Hotel lovely and clean staff all very friendly the hotel was pretty quite at 1st but then I think there was a convention of mainly morrocan men who took over the dining room a little but not a problem. The food was good could always find something different its ok if you like tagine as lots of these.  Room was spotless and bed very comfortable just a little cold in the evening!  Down side: safe broken and told on arrival it would be sorted never was.  Patio door would not lock and on ground floor so bit unerving.  Visited spa and had the most lovely facial would highly recommend.  Didn't use pool as to cold.  Bit of advice if going into Marrakech to visit market be aware of men trying to give you directions as they will demand money and it is a bit daunting.  Hotel is lovely though and staff are great would recommend,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Winsford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/504julieb

Food can be a bit touch and go but there‚Äôs plenty of it. Great trip to the souks booked at the hotel. Beware... the eid celebration is in September which of your sensitive to animals could be quite upsetting.

We attended the new years party which was one of the best new years celebrations i have ever been to its was amazing and the staff couldnt do more if they tried they really did put on the best night and nothing was too much the food was fantastic and the night was perfect from start to finish. We organised a guided tour to the markets through reception and this was fantastic the taxi picked us up from the hotel to take us to meet our guide and we stayed with him for 3 hours he took us around the markets while we did shopping then called the taxi when we was ready to go back to the hotel he was very knowledgable and friendly.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Harvey Levene wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Will NEVER go back!,I wanna start this off by saying: I read a lot of reviews on places when travelling and quite a traveller myself and usually find that people can be quite dramatic about their experiences... but the bad ones on here I genuinely would take more seriously than I did.  Firstly the design of the hotel is nice. Nice rooms nice walks around pool area borderline lovely... but the staff firstly were disgustingly rude. We were 2hrs later for check-in and the room STILL wasn't ready for another 2hrs on top of that. Do you think they even apologised? No. The food every single day gave me or one of my four friends a bad stomach. I have a stomach of steel and even I threw up on the 3rd day. Half the food was cold undercooked. Me and my friends even had a personal joke about the eggs throughout the holiday. The staff are basically either careless or borderline passive aggressive ESPECIALLY a specific bartender and I wish I remembered his name now. The hotel basically ripped us off ¬£200 each including completely screwing us over on taxi transfers to the airport when we left. Completely helpless with any questions asked or advice needed. They didn't even properly organise our waterfall tour properly with the guide!  I really really wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone especially are you can get the same if not better for the same price.,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hkindlon
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Jacinta G wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Honest review,Honest Review which I hope will help make your decision when choosing a hotel.    Pros;  1. Lunch and evening dinner is great! Good selection and there was especially 1 lovely gentleman waiter that served wine.  2. Spa is lovely and good staff but extremely expensive (more than Dublin prices) and you have to pay ‚Ç¨10 for indoor pool use for 1 hour. Not free!  3. Rooms were lovely and very comfortable. We had great sleeps!  4. Shuttle bus service was great. Some reviews here said they had to pay for bus but ours was free for the 10 days.  5. The two trips we booked in hotel were fantastic!! Go for the camel ride and dinner in desert. Tour of Berber village was great.  Cons;  1. Pool looks fantastic for photos but that‚Äôs all it seemed to be really used for. It‚Äôs freezing cold and the ‚Äúwarm‚Äù pool was empty for first few days of our trip. However when filled it was still cold. Pool wasn‚Äôt really used by anyone.  2. Majority of staff were really rude. On arrival at reception at 12.00am at night we were welcomed by the rudest man I‚Äôve ever met in hospitality. (He wouldn‚Äôt give me his name) He was charging us ‚Ç¨55 for government tax that which we were never made aware of by anyone but his handling of the situation was extremely shocking. We complained and He laughed and was very sarcastic to us (little sexist) didn‚Äôt like a woman questioning him. He never talked us through anything about hotel told us everything was closed at 11 (which we found 1 week later there is a bar opened to 1am). Next day we got a nicer man at reception who explained the tax which was actually only ‚Ç¨30. We were happy to pay when explained and treated nicely.  3. I cut my hand badly on broken glass at pool. The hotel didn‚Äôt have 1 plaster for me and tried to charge us ‚Ç¨4 for one Single plaster in the shop. I actually lost quite a bit of blood but no help from anyone. Very worrying that a hotel this size with 400 guests does not have a first aid box or a box of plasters.  4. Drink is pretty poor. No selection. Everything is warm and we didn‚Äôt want to use ice as we got sick from the water. Lots of flies everywhere as surfaces are not kept clean.  5. Bar staff constantly asking us and other guests for cigarettes and for us to get to them drink. One got so comfortable that they just lifted cigarettes from table without asking. I felt some of the staff were a little creepy. Have to note one younger bar man was very friendly.  6. Do not go into the shop within hotel. This man is a con man and will fully exploit tourists!!! Charging on average 3 times the actual price.  7. Poor water service. I was sick one of the nights and needed water and reception told us to wait to 7am next day although they have bottled water In storage they wouldn‚Äôt give it to us. It was horrible. This happened a few nights so we started just stacking up on water during the day.  8. Although not the hotels fault there was guests rowing in our complex one night and it lasted for 2 hours. It got very aggressive and we heard smashing and threatening language from the room. No staff or hotel presence came once to intervene. I genuinely hope these guests are ok because we never seen them again! Maybe they were thrown out though.  9. All in all I didn‚Äôt feel that safe and kept table pushed up against bedroom at door at night I would never think of doing something like normally but unfortunately that‚Äôs how I felt.  10. Safe doesn‚Äôt work in rooms and heard his from other guests we met also. (Bit strange).    Advice to hotel - a lot of the cons come back to basic manners and common courtesy! improve on the staffs manners and hospitality skills as this will go a long way!!,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672jacintag
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,alibehnam42 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Brilliant hotel and staff,I cannot fault this resort! Forget about bad reviews that some never-happy people leave!  After reading mixed reviews I was so worried and unsure of what to expect but on arrival check-in went very smooth although the majority of people only speak French and Arabic but they can still communicate in English you should respect that your French is surely not better than their English too! So take it easy! It is all about holiday and having fun.    Hotel is very very clean beautiful Ryads given to us which was a two bedroom apartment in s breath taking beautiful garden nice traditional moroccan decoration every where which adds a touch to your holiday.    Buffet food always very good i am In Keto diet and my family are very fussy but every meal we were happy with many dishes which we couldn‚Äôt try them all in 7 nights stay. At least 50% new food at each meal time so you never fed up with repetitive food.    We were on All Inclusive package and we truly enjoyed our Xmas 2019 here as the weather was so nice and most days around 27c and very hot.    They have a REALL heated pool which is smaller and circular shape but the water temperature is always kept at 22-24c which is perfect so we were always in the water with my two kids.    The big pool is cold (12c) so nobody really uses it in this time of the year.    Hotel provides free shuttle bus to Jamaa El-Fba 3 times a day you just need to book it one day in advance I used the shuttle 4 times (4 days) as I love shopping! Moroccan people are very warm and friendly inside and out.    Animation/Entertainment staff are really lovely and do their best to entertain everyone we enjoyed the show every night. JOJO is one of the guy and he is full of energy and fun he even entertain you buy the pool if he sees you are bored!    They also run a free kids club/mini club were they take care of kids for you and even take them to lunch and dinner so parents can really enjoy their time. SONYA (SONIA) is the Kids club manager she is very lovely and both my kids adore her without Sonya there are girls which I didn‚Äôt pick up their names but they are lovely.    Then we have a POOL BAR where you can get your drinks from and two people working there are amazing! A lady called SOUAD and a man called YOUSEF (hope my spelling is not too far!) they were both amazing! Always gave us the drink we wanted with the strength snd taste we liked! They never say NO! Even if you ask them to fill your glass with Vodka Gin or Whisky they will do to hive you being at home feeling very lively people. They even remember your choice of drink and before you order they prepared it for you!    YOUSEF even taught us how to cook Moroccan dishes like Tagin it was a great fun and he is so charming I loved him and we had chat and laugh everyday together. See attached photos.    All in all a great hotel great holiday and service and surely way way more than what we expected to received! Highly recommend this place to families and couples.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alibehnam42

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Roving Lulu Belle wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Fun Christmas break,Overall we had a great time but there are some things that would have been good to know before arriving.    General: the grounds are beautifully kept the food is really good (varied and tasty) - just wine (plus soft drinks) available for all inclusive at meals. We had a family suite - spacious airy clean modern Moroccan decor huge bathroom. Had a couple of maintenance issues - despite two reminders they didn‚Äôt get fixed but it didn‚Äôt overly affect our experience. However Christmas decorations were up Christmas Eve celebrated Santa visited - great fun.    Good to know:  Location - while the Resort is only 20 minutes north east of the centre taxis can be costly. There is a shuttle from the hotel to the centre - departs hotel 9.30 10.30 15.00 19.00 and returns 13.00 16.30 18.30 22.30. From the shuttle drop-off it is a good 20 minute walk to the main square - with the souks on from there. The shuttle driver can do drop offs en-route eg Majorelle Gardens which saves a long walk.    Activities/day trips - Many of the tour operators pick up from central Marrakesh - so that can limit options. The resort offers them - but they are significantly more costly than online operators so needs a bit of research ahead of time to see if pickup can be arranged. The quad bikes/balloons/camel ride etc operators are based just a few kilometres from the hotel (in the desert) so there must be options.    ATM - the Ona has very limited ATM facilities (ie wasn‚Äôt available most of the time) so relies on you having cash (either Dihrams or other) so be prepared as you can‚Äôt just charge items to your card.    Local taxes - there is a local tax payable at the hotel which may be additional to your package rate. Check T&C before arriving as this too was payable in cash.    Room locations - the rooms are spread out across the grounds which makes it private and peaceful. However it is quite a walk from the rooms to the reception on uneven ground with very limited lighting - so if there are mobility issues may want to consider requesting a room closer to the reception.    But overall a great stay.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Berkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rovinglulubelle

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,spikyredzz wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Really enjoyed our stay!,Location: about 30 minutes from the airport. I would recommend booking your transfer in advance it's easier. Hotel operates a shuttle bus to the medina. We used it once with no problem booked the night before completely free large bus.    Reception: very helpful on arrival at 21:30 making sure we made it in for dinner. A bit forgetful when we asked for a room change the following day (plumbing problem) we had to ask three times but changed with no argument. Arranged a late checkout at a reasonable price for departure day. All of the staff were friendly. The luggage porter was so nice helped us on more than one occasion!    Room: first room was lovely very clean comfortable. Strange smell next day which didn't dissipate so we asked for a move. Second room also lovely suite 1001 further from the main building but very close to the pool. Plenty of hot water good air conditioning/heating.    Food: the hotel is isolated so all inclusive is the best plan. We both enjoyed all of the food on offer; breakfast - omelette to order excellent selection of cold meat and cheeses pastries fresh fruit etc. Lunch - varied every day - hot dishes salads desserts fresh fruits breads wine and soft drinks all excellent! Dinner - extensive selection varied by day - we had fish/chicken/beef tagine fresh fish curries chinese seafood salad shrimp kebabs salads pasta pizza and tried every moroccan dish on offer! Overall to our taste the food was outstanding! Not forgetting the restaurant staff who were all friendly we can't speak French but a smile is perfect!    Activities team: what a credit to the hotel this team is! As November is a quiet time with not so many guests the team had to encourage everyone to take part in the poolside activities; they did a great job without pestering anyone who just wanted to relax. Music is loud but we liked that! The team work split shifts from early morning to late night; hardworking young people! Nawal adopted us always a smile and a quick chat to find out our plans for the day. She really made us feel very welcome! We even joined in dancing in the evening unusual for us but so much fun! I wish I could remember everyone's names they are all brilliant!    Entertainment: different every evening - we enjoyed every show not very big audiences in November though. I skipped out at the snake    I would definitely return to the hotel. It felt welcoming and safe. Taking a shuttle to the Medina suited us best of both worlds.,Date of stay: November 2019,,gateshead england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spikyredzz
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Holly wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Not the best. Not the worst.,The hotel is ok - our room was clean and quite nice. Lovely comfy beds. The bath didn't have a plug so you couldn't have a bath but the shower was fab. Nice little balcony had a safe but I don't think it worked - we didn't use it.  We had fresh bottled water put in our fridge every day.  Shuttle bus you MUST book the day before you need to go in as it gets booked up - it's a good free service though.  The women on reception are some of the most miserable unfriendly people I have ever come across. Could do with some training and improving their customer service !! When we arrived we were charged city tax (this is normal) the woman on checkout then tried to charge us again - do not fall for this! I kindly told her we had already paid and nothing more was said. I did read a review before travelling that made mention of this so just be aware.... this is the kind of thing they may try on!  There are excursions and things you can book but I organised these independently through TripAdvisor rather than using the hotel reps.  I visited the spa it was reasonably priced and a really lovely setting.  /the pool is bloody freezing but nice to cool off in on a hot day.  The drinks service is really weird if you're paying all-inclusive you should get all-inclusive? You can literally only take one drink at a time even if they can see your travelling companion waiting on a sunlounger/sofa a little way-away. Very odd! Not had this before!    Overall it was OK. I wouldn't return as I think there is better places on offer. IT was cheap though so can't grumble too much.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Banbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lholly123
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,WJW123 wrote a review Nov 2019,10,Shocking,Unfortunately the hotel let us down time after time. It started with the lead up to staying at the hotel; It was a surprise birthday trip for friends;    several emails/telephone calls being ignored trying to make reservations for the spa /airport pick up  Picked up from airport 1 hr late Arrived at the hotel to find the room advertised didn‚Äôt reflect what we booked  3 rooms later we settled for the best of a bad bunch  Toilet broken  Safe not working  Telephone not working  Mini fridge empty  Again several attempts to resolve our issues took up time and effort due to lack of engagement from reception staff. We witnessed so many people complaining and spoke to people who were unhappy.  shuttle was never free but it was - hotel charged a fortune for taxi‚Äôs  checked out of the hotel their chip n pin service wasnt working they refused to take to the airport until we paid our ¬£60 bill but we had no cash they made a member of reception take us to cash point the staff member was really rude finalloy half way to the airport they pulled over and said we had to get out as they WERE late for their next job and made us get in to a taxi!    I‚Äôve never been treated so bad the hotel and the reception staff ruined our trip. Yassin the guest services manager was useless and didn‚Äôt follow anything through.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,PW25 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Half Term Break with Teens,This hotel is lovely with rooms being spread across the various Ryads there were only 20 rooms per block. We had a family room which was perfect as there were twin beds in one room for our teenage sons and a separate double room for us. The porter that bought our bags for us when we arrived was a great help - showing us how the safe worked and other features in the room. This is by far the longest check I have experienced but there is not much to be done about this. The room was always very clean and tidy - however despite there was obviously four of us staying in the room we were repeatedly left 3 towels. We ran reception each time and an extra towel was provided but this did get a bit tedious as it happened every day!  There were always plenty of sunbeds and there was no need to be up at a ridiculous time to reserve one which was such a pleasant change from places we have stayed at before. There is no getting around it - the pool was FREEZING - it is not heated and the best way to get in was to jump/dive. Once you were in and swimming it was bearable - but such a shame as it was a fantastic pool and would have a lot more use if it was a few degrees warmer.  The restaurant was clean and tidy and the food was generally good breakfast was our favourite meal of the day. Lunch and dinner were quite similar offerings and where food was dished up by staff the portions were often quite stingy - my husband had the pasta and meatballs and was given two meatballs which were marble-sized - he was very unimpressed. As with a lot of other reviewers we found we got a bit bored with the food choices by the end of the week. The freshly made pizza was always good and a big hit with our sons.  The entertainment team were great they always came around the pool for a chat in the mornings and did a great job of encouraging people to join in with the activities. Our boys liked that they could get equipment for different sports particularly table tennis and basketball. The evening shows were on par with what we have experienced in other hotels. The Halloween dance show was very good except for the lighting chap who just went over the top with colours and strobe effect making it very hard to enjoy without a headache which was a pity!  Overall we had a great family break in glorious weather which was our aim there were definitely things that could have been better but none of them were sufficient to spoil our holiday.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PW25
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Fiona A wrote a review Nov 2019,30,A realistic review,My husband and I booked a week at Ona Marrakech for immediately after our wedding. The reviews from earlier in the year were far more positive than the recent ones. Don't let the awful reviews put you off but I hope this review will help you especially if you have already booked.    Firstly we naively emailed ahead asking them to put some flowers in our room etc as this was to be our honeymoon. That email and a subsequent one was ignored and for the whole week no-one spoke to us enough to learn why we were there. Anyway I digress...    Check-in took much longer than seemed necessary but it's worth remembering that they have to ask you to fill in the form by law. Please ask for a receipt if you pay the hotel tax in cash! You'll be given 2 towel cards you can swap these for towels down by the pool from around 10am (the lifeguard is usually sitting by the bar in a white top with red edges). Don't forget to swap them back at the end or you'll be charged 300DHS. The man who took our cases to our room was really friendly and continued to be so throughout our stay.    The food is fine and it was only after about 5 days that I started to get a bit bored. There's a great selection of fresh salads and the meats are generally pretty good too. Everything is cooked in a LOT of oil so we tried to mix it up a little. Don't bother paying for a meal in the Moroccan restaurant on site they serve the same food next door every few days...learned that the hard (expensive!) way. Make sure to take a bottle of water from the restaurant at every meal as they don't put any in your room. It's nice to sit outside on the terrace to eat and I especially loved when the cats came to visit.    The rooms were very spacious and kept really clean I really can't fault the housekeeping service. We asked for a second duvet as one single duvet for two single beds pushed together wasn't really enough and this appeared the next day. One comment would be that the hotel really needs to consider adding some additional lighting as as night it really is too dark and felt unsafe (riads have lots of corners and shadows!).    We enjoyed most of the entertainmentand the day time activities round the pool were fun. Nawal and Asha in particular we're really friendly and a credit to Ona. The evening entertainment varied each night with a mini disco first which was always fun to watch! The Moroccan evening left a bit of a sour taste but I won't go into the treatment of animals in Morocco here!    We took the free shuttle into Marrakech and highly recommend this. The square is only a 20 minute walk away and the bus stop is well placed for visiting the new town too. Cyber Park is well worth a visit and is right next to the bus stop.    Overall we really enjoyed our stay. If you go in expecting British levels of service you will be disappointed but as long as you are willing to fend for yourselves and enter into the spirit you will have a great time. We were really lucky with unseasonably warm weather too. :),Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaR437

What an all inclusive does.  Hotel clean and tidy .staff friendly and helpful.  Rooms very clean and tidy and modern.  We had a junior suite. Had water and electrical issue rang reception and was sorted straight away .  Evening entertainment was good every night and round the pool everyday.  The only down side was you was to far out of town to just pop out if you was wanting something different to do.  You could get taxi but it was half an hour ride.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,steveuk2016 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Great hotel,I haven‚Äôt written a review for a while but felt compelled to write this one due to a recent post by a UK visitor which is simply unfair. The hotel is great away from city however the hotel has a free shuttle service that leaves and returns throughout the day. It is a 48 seater coach with hotels logo on the side and can be booked at desk to left of reception. We left at 9am had a great day out in Marrakesh back on 430pm bus.  The hotel is welcoming with a member of staff taking your bags on arrival and taking you to your room showing you where animates are in room free safe fridge and TV which does have English channels if you choose to stay in your room watching TV.  The all inclusive package is well worth it and the food is amazing. Every meal lots of choice including a wide range of Moroccan specialities including hand made desserts. Breakfast has all the favourites fresh omelettes. Eggs and a wide range of fruit. Lunch again wide range of food a dessert station with made to order and a indoor/out door bbq. Dinner was a great and every meal different in fact we had hand made sushi ceviche and carpaccio. Wide range of meats Vegetables legumes. With dinner and lunch great Moroccan Ksar wine a very nice red white and it‚Äôs rude not to have rose at lunch. The chief and team work hard and the food combinations and flavours are fantastic. Also impressive are the serving staff polite and courteous. Impressive a number of young people work in the Restaurant who are under the eye of exceptionally professional staff. You will also see in my pictures a special Halloween meal that was prepared - great effort from all the team who must have spent ages on this.  The rooms are in small riads approximately 16 rooms in each. This provides a lovely peaceful atmosphere around the complex. Which by the way is beautiful a dedicated team of gardeners keep all area beautiful and work so hard. We saw the team create a new garden while we were here and them harvest olives.  Our room extremely comfortable cleaned each day with new towels. Air conditioning was great and rooms felt secure. We chose to be in a quite part of the hotel and loved it. In the morning watched the sun rise with the distant sound of Marrakesh in the back ground. Large bathrooms two sinks (push the plug cap to release water!) powerful shower.  The bar on all inclusive package has local drinks which were fine and a few cocktails before dinner if you wish ! Lots of different branded soft drinks and bottles of water plentiful and free. (Great to put in fridge in room).  The hotel has a number of bar areas. Outside a stage area and terrace a large entertainment room a lounge and a lounge with TV. Every night entertainment starting at 930 with kids disco then others. Lovely watch families enjoying time with each other. It‚Äôs there if you want it and if you don‚Äôt you can relax elsewhere.  The pool area is large 3 pools connected to each other. Many people relaxing in water swimming and water exercise. There is entertainment if you wish but no pressure if you don‚Äôt. Loved the mediation music to start the day - so peaceful.  The staff at the hotel we excellent polite and caring. All of them spoke enough English and others fluent. I don‚Äôt speak French but can use my CSE grade 2 to be polite and say Bonjour Merci. Being in another country is an adventure and trying doesn‚Äôt hurt. By the way there are a number of nationalities at this hotel and all get along. It‚Äôs wonderful watching children from different cultures embracing others nationalities.  I won‚Äôt add details about Marrakesh city here as I am sure dear trip advisor reader you can use google and search yourself. None the less we loved our day in the city. Only tip is go to the M√©dina in the morning stay in shopping areas and enjoy sights sounds and smells. People will offer to guide but a polite no thanks worked.  All in all a fab relaxing holidays : would I book again Yes absolutely,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveuk2016
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,CanCanMan wrote a review Nov 2019,50,First Rate,You cannot please everyone all the time and Trip Advisor reviews certainly reflect that.    I have to say that the country the location and this hotel by far exceeded expectations.    From the moment we landed we found a modern hospitable airport with security at the very top of the agenda. Private transfer to the hotel was seemless and on arrival the check in was with ease.    Some of the clearly disgruntled trip advisors negative comments must have been attributed to the wrong hotel. This venue is remarkable its staff extremely accomodating and professional. Not one of our group encountered anything but friendly staff at the hotel who'd bend over backwards from the outset to ensure the experience was the best it could be.    For those who've never been to Morocco before and may (as we were) be a tad apprehensive ... dont be. For those who envision it to be the same as places such as Egypt - it is far from that. We were never bombarded or harassed in any way.    The views at sunrise and sunset of the Atlas mountains from the hotel are breathtaking.    The animation team are a very accomodating and friendly crew - engaging and not overbearing they are respectful whe encouraging guests to engage in the extensive range of activities on offer. To highlight one fella look out for Ach (pronounced Ash) who took time out to soend time with us on our last night dining with our party and teaching us more than we'd ever know about the customs and places to go when we next return to the country - as an aside he is a credit to the hotel in general and is typical of all of the team who work tirelessly to ensure guests have the best experience during their stay.    Some tips you might want to think about before coming :    - if you like tea and dont want to bring a travel kettle then why not bring your preferred bags and a small flask.  - bring your own sun creams etc before coming  - they have tomato sauce but not heinz. So if you're picky cant love without then pack a small bottle  - you'll get a bottle of water in your room on Day 1 and cam grab another large bottle each day from the restaurant  - the green base sunbeds are more comfortable if you are a sun worshipper so be sure to aim for those when looking to lay for the day !  - French is widely spoken - so knowing the basics there can really help but isnt essential  - Take advantage of a siesta - if you want to make the most out of your stay then try and take a break in the afternoon out of the sun. This place is so peaceful and relaxing its easy to get exhausted and slip off to the comfort of your fantastic room for an early night  - The mattresses are orthopedic standard - they are comfortable firm with extremely comfortable bedding. If you prefer a more bouncier pit to retire to then the quilt could quite easily be used as a topper together with the extra covers and throw provided  - Another great idea from one of our great holiday hackers (Ash) is to bring a multi plug extension lead and of course your adaptor. You can pick these up from the pound shop or other similar low cost retailer and are a god save to plug in multiple devices to maximise the plugs available.    The organised trips in the lobby are very good too from the feedback other guests were telling us. We went for a desert camel ride after the usual apprehensions - and dare I say is the company have under priced this. For 30‚Ç¨ per person for what you experience this is extremeley good value and for making memories this is by far one of the best to make and I would highly recommend it - just make sure you water yourself beforehand and bring a bottle with you.    I could go on endlessly about this place - put simply of you are in two minds deciding should I shouldn't I then book it. You will not regret it and will come back far better stress wise than when you depart.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Suenrick wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Lovely October Break,We arrived at the hotel about 20.45 pm after a great flight with easy jet  we had a taxi transfer which came with in minutes of our arrival. When we got to the hotel we went straight to reception who told us to go to the restaurant as it would be closing soon which we were happy to do so  after we had eaten we went back and with in no time we had our room key and paid the tax which we got a receipt for also we paid ¬£10 each for our beach towels which you get back at the end of the holiday. The reception staff seemed really friendly to us so no problem at all . We then went to our a room a junior suite number 503 it was lovely smelt nice and clean  it was newly refurbished great . The safe was locked so we couldn‚Äôt use it the first night but we went to reception and with in 15 minutes a member of staff came and opened it for us and then showed us how to use it . The food just got better and better each day at the beginning we did notice the veg and some of the other things were not hot enough for us but we did speak to one of the managers about this and from then on it wasn‚Äôt too bad  there was so much to choose from salads  meats  fish  potatoes and so much more . Water was available in bottles at lunch and dinner plenty of it also red  white and rose wine which were good. Breakfast was also great with so much choice. The animation team worked really hard from 10 in a morning until late at night always with a smile they were brilliant we joined in a few of the things aqua fit  boules  water polo which we loved one thing if you don‚Äôt want to join in they do not pressure you it‚Äôs totally your choice. The shows they put on at night where if a good standard too. On a few night the entertainment came from outside the hotel which we also enjoyed After the shows around 22.45 you could then go into the blue bar and have a dance which we did a couple of evenings but not many people did  you had to pay for you drinks after 23.00 even when on all inclusive but not really a problem we just got a drink just before the outside bar closed and took it with us . We stayed for 10 nights we had a fabulous holiday and the weather was fantastic for October. I would say to anyone go to this hotel ignore the bad reviews and decide for yourself we would certainly return in the future.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighouse, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suenrick
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Catherine12341 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Reception let‚Äôs the hotel down,Just back from this hotel.  First the good stuff. The hotel is clean throughout. The room is spacious. The staff in the restaurant are friendly and professional. The animation team are good fun. We stayed all inclusive for four days. It is the typical all inclusive fair. The breakfast is lovely the lunch fresh and good. I think we just didn‚Äôt need dinner so that is why for us it was okay. Plenty of wine water and juice. The bar at the pool also open all day and you can get a pretty good. Coffee there.  However the reception staff and front of house staff are unorganized to the point of frustrating. From arrival to ordering a taxi it‚Äôs hassle. One young woman behind reception shows her annoyance as her gossip chat with other staff member is interrupted. I could go on. No one wants hassle when on a hard earned break. Dealing with front of house staff is hassle here. Do not order a taxi at the hotel as it is double the price. This lets the hotel down. Front of house need to work on communication and basic customer service.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wexford, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine12341
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,monika g wrote a review Oct 2019,20,"Not for English speakers, 2 stars only because the food was amazing and we traveled All Inclusive",The worst hotel in Morocco I've ever experienced and as the person who lived and worked in Morocco in tourist industry I've got to say this was the most disappointing experience ever mainly due to poor customer service. The staff was rude and often ignored the guests who didn't speak French. The information on the hotel's website reg. check-in time restaurant opening times etc. is completely different than reality.    Location: this hotel is 30 min drive from Marrakesh in the middle of waste land so if you are going there you need to book All Inclusive as there is nowhere else you can buy food and if you ought to buy meals in the hotel you will spend a fortune. On All inclusive option the food is really good and plenty of it and that is the only good thing I can honestly say about the hotel. Free shuttle bus has limited spaces so you have to book it in advance. We tried to book it on Monday for Tuesday but we only managed to get a space on Thursday! If you cannot get a place on the shuttle bus you can book private transfer for ¬£20 each way (twice the price of the taxi fare)    Check-in: on the website it states that you can check-in to your room at 2.00 pm (I've arrived with 2 children at 11.00 am). Upon arrival to the hotel my luggage has been literally snatched out of our hands by the guy who couldn't say a word of English and placed in front of the main door to the hotel among other suitcases. We were then told in the reception that we need to come back at 2.30 pm to check in which in practice meant we didn't get our keys until 3.00 pm as there were people arriving from the airport all day and the check-in process took ages as only one out of 5 people from reception could speak English. You will also need to pay ¬£20 city taxes before you get the key to your room.    Money: If you planning to do some sightseeing you need to have Moroccan Dirhams as everywhere you go you'll be expected to leave tips 'bakshish' so make sure you have plenty of Moroccan change (Euros are also accepted). We've brought British ¬£ with us. At the airport the ques to exchange offices were very long so we've decided to do it at the hotel as exchange rates are the same everywhere. But in this hotel they rarely have enough money to provide that service. On day 1 I went to the reception 5 times throughout the day just to be told there is no money. Finally they managed to exchange it at 8.00 pm! Few days later I had the same problem when I wanted to change ¬£100 I was told they only have enough money for ¬£40    Rooms: We've stayed in family room. Rooms are basic. There is air condition TV (only with Russian and French channels) and hair dryer. But only 2 towels for 3 people. When I asked for the additional towel this never arrived so we had to use our towels we brought to use at the pool. In our room the lock on the window and balcony door was broken as well as the safety box. This meant that we had to carry our passports and valuables with us at all times. During our 6 days stay the room has been cleaned only twice! Also when we checked in we've discovered that both basins in the bathroom are blocked and the water does not go down. I've reported that as we couldn't even wash hands without flooding the bathroom. 24 hours after we've reported it 3 times my 13 year old son fixed it himself as he had enough of brushing his teeth above the toilet!    Restaurants: you have to find them yourself as there is no signage or information on site and when I asked in the reception they only waved their hand towards the door and said 'over there' in French.  La Medina restaurant - this is where you will have breakfast lunch and dinners if you AL. Food is lovely and good variety fresh and plenty  Terrace Bar - serves only drinks very low quality juices from machine mixing flavored powder and water. I don't drink alcohol so I cannot comment on that. Coffee machine often runs out of coffee so you get milky hot water instead.  Pool bar - again staff doesn't speak English. Considering that in the hotel was lots of Italians Germans and English people who tried to communicate in English it was appalling.  Pool restaurant looks like abandoned unused building there is no signage or opening times anywhere therefore it took us 3 days to figure out that this is the place we can get any snacks when the main restaurant is closed. It seems that this building was mainly used by local staff and their friends and family to drink coffee and smoke cigarettes. On the website it says it should be open at 10.00 but when my kids went there at 11.00 they were told that  a. they cannot get any food unless the adult will come to order (even though they were wearing AL wristbands and only wanted a burger)  b. they cannot ask for any food until 12.00...    Animations and evening entertainment: the animators are trying very hard to entertain people around the pool area and they are also doing evening shows. In the reception every morning there is an information on what show will be that evening... well out of 6 days we've manged to see only 2 shows happen even though guests were sitting and waiting for the show to start the show must have been cancelled on some nights but nobody has informed the guests. One of those evenings I went to the reception and pointing at the poster about tonight's show I asked what time is that suppose to start. I was told 9.30 I pointed out that it is already 10.15 and we've been waiting 45 minutes. To that the receptionist made a phone call which resulted on turning lights off on the stage... no explanation apologies or anything. After that we didn't bother anymore.    So to summarize if you don't speak fluent French or Arabic - avoid this hotel. My ratings from 0-5:  Customer Service - 0  Rooms facilities/safety - 0  Rooms cleaning - 2  Food quality/choice - 5  Evening entertainment - 0  Animators effort - 4  On-site information - 0,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Beccles, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monikag677

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,olivia wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Wouldn‚Äôt return but amazing animation team,Me and my Partner came here for a week away mid October. We booked B&B however after arriving and realising you literally are in the middle of nowhere we paid to go all inclusive. First let‚Äôs start with the positives. The animation team are honestly amazing. No other words for them. They are so so lovely and do get everyone involved. Noella and Ashraf (excuse the spelling) where hands down the best out of them and really made our trip more enjoyable. The pool is gorgeous could not be faulted. Plenty of sun beds. Rooms were nicely decorated and very modern. They were clean enough. The whole hotel looked lovely especially the reception. Now the negatives. You are miles from anything and the hotel will try and charge you 250DH for a taxi (we said we would get the shuttle and they said it was full because we said no to a taxi). If you use the Wi-Fi and WhatsApp call 0212 661 519 356 this is to a local taxi driver who will charge 150DH to the market or 200DH to the airport. We did get the shuttle another day and you are dropped a 30 minute walk to the market so we got a taxi (only 20DH so not even ¬£2). Market is made for locals not tourists a lot of grabbing. They do sell some lovely things and it was much better in the day rather than the evening. We paid to go all inclusive because there wasn‚Äôt a shop or restaurant anywhere near. First day fine after that well the food repeats. Don‚Äôt touch the butter it is not like butter at all! I was served raw chicken. Spent the rest of the time quite unwell and resulted in very little food being ate after that. When I did tell the manager I got an apology but that was all. They tried to say we rushed the lady serving however no complaints were made in the restaurant so she wouldn‚Äôt have known who she had served or made the complaint. Our safe was broken after being told 10 minutes 10 minutes someone showed up after an hour to say he was a luggage man and we would have to wait until tomorrow. The next morning we went and asked and were told someone would be 5 minutes and we needed to wait in our room for them. 2 hours later someone showed to change the batteries that was all they needed to do. The rooms were clean enough however if it was my house or hotel I would have higher expectations. Unless for lunch and dinner you want to pay nearly ¬£15 each way to go into the town then you have to suck up the all inclusive food. It takes around 30 minutes to get a taxi to the airport or market. The new town is much nicer to visit and is more of a city atmosphere. Overall no we would not return.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olivia181199
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,mark h wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Lovely break for all the family,I must admit I was concerned about going to this hotel after reading some of the recent reviews just goes to show you shouldn‚Äôt believe all you read as we had a lovely time.  The hotel is far from perfect and not to the standard we usually stay in. That said we went into this holiday knowing that and so managed our expectations in advance.  We did have a couple of incidents on our first 2 days and had to change rooms twice (first room the front door didn‚Äôt lock and the second room had ants)  Once we‚Äôd moved to the 3rd room we didn‚Äôt have any issues after that.  The food is pretty good and we all found something we could eat at each sitting. The facilities are also pretty good (could do with a bit of TLCbut again manage your expectations)  For us what made the holiday was the animation team special mention to Nawal Achraf Chinwi and Momo full of energy always in good spirits and got all of our family involved and entertained throughout the day.  Moreover I‚Äôd also like to correct some points made by other reviewers regarding the hotel staff being rude and unhelpful (unless your Moroccan or speak French) We found the staff very helpful and friendly and Farok and Ahmed in the restaurant were really helpful when we asked for various things. In my opinion if your friendly smile and take the time to engage with the staff they will reciprocate.  Overall this is a good place to get away with the family for a relatively inexpensive all inclusive. Yes there is plenty that could be tweaked and improved that said if you can overlook these points you will have a good family holiday.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markhB808JS
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Catherine G wrote a review Oct 2019,40,A great week,Arrived at a quiet time and received great service from the Receptionist who upgraded us free of charge to a Junior Suite.    The room (908) was lovely spacious and very clean. Beds made and towels changed daily.    Be up early and armed with your towel to bag a sunbed. The plastic ones do need some padding! The pool is lovely and the animation team seem to be doing a great job although take a hint very quickly if you do not require their services.    I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the cocktails at the pool bar the beer however was very good. The cocktails at the main bar were straight from a machine and I had to ask for my glass to be changed twice as a lot of them are chipped. The bar itself is modern with a big screen for sports. The older bartender is downright rude and really does need sacking but did provide entertainment as we learned to laugh at him getting more irate as the night progressed.    The food was very impressive although we both did suffer from a day of ‚ÄòDelhi Belly‚Äô. Not sure if this was the food ice or just a bug we picked up on the plane. The shop does not stock any medications for this eventuality so I‚Äôd recommend taking lots with you just in case. I enjoyed the fresh pizzas and the soup and the deserts were really good. On the all inclusive you are able to take water and fizzy drinks from the restaurant. There is also a plentiful supply of wine and lunch and dinner. Breakfasts were really good although this is the only opportunity to make a cup of tea. Hunt around in the tea bags for the yellow label which is the English breakfast tea. There is a fridge in the room so this is a good time to take a few tea bags and some milk to put in your room. (Remember to keep a key in for the electric otherwise the fridge in the room turns off when you go out). Obviously a travel kettle will be needed.    We caught the free bus (pre booked) into Marrakech and spent the morning in the Souk. There were no directions we were lucky and followed the general direction of the crowd. If you walk past the church and bear left until you reach the big square the Souk is opposite. Start low and don‚Äôt be afraid to haggle! We weren‚Äôt hassled and the stall holders were very friendly. Everyone we spoke to spoke very good English although brushing up on your French wouldn‚Äôt be a bad thing.    All in all a very relaxing week with great food and brilliant weather. If you‚Äôre looking for a party then this is not the place. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the hotel if you‚Äôre not all inclusive as we heard it was expensive to buy things individually. We would definitely go back though.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Belvoir, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callyj20
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Kas wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Disappointment,Came here in September for a girly holiday and definitely would not recommend.    On arrival the check in time was ridiculously long really don‚Äôt understand why as there was staff just loitering around.    If you do not have an inclusive wrist band or are not a local then you are treated very poorly in comparison to the other guests.    Apparently choosing to bring in mcdonalds from outside is not allowed because it isnt fair on other guests and their children like they did not have the option to go out and buy food for themselves as well absolutely ridiculous imo.    The water is not free you‚Äôll end up paying 25-30 dirhams depending on who serves you for a 1 litre bottle of water when you can buy a 5 litre bottle from the supermarket for 4.75 dirhams.    As mentioned in other comments the hotel does seem to have been refurbished as the rooms are quite nice but it is quite a pitty as they are not maintained well.  The were filled with ants and seemed to not have been dusted in quite a while which you would not expect from a 4* hotel!    The reception staff and managers are quite rude BUT the only good thing about this place is the animation team!!  They are so friendly and go out of their way to make the guests feel welcome and enjoy their evening the only reason why any of us tolerated the place tbh.    In terms of distance it is quite far out from the main centre of Marrakech ontop of it the hotel itself charges double sometimes triple the price a normal taxi would charge.  I would suggest if you do stay here find a local taxi and use them instead it is MUCH cheaper!  For booking excursions go to the sqaure. You‚Äôll find much better deals for a better price!    All in all this place was disappointing.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H_khn1

Awful, noisy, unprofessional hotel with very rude staff left after just one night out of a week‚Äôs stay",Worst hotel I‚Äôve ever visited. Did not accept any card payments so were expected to cash for everything even though you cannot get Moroccan currency in the uk before arrival here as is a closed currency. Extremely noisy to the point where our daughter simply  Could not get to sleep  Before midnight at the earliest as live entertainment was that loud it was as if they were actually in the room with us. Staff disinterested and rude we left after just one night and ended up  Paying 3 times the cost then for a hotel as it was such short notice and October half term holidays. Although we‚Äôre completely delighted with our alternative hotel...the Kenzi Manara Palace which was quiet and the staff extremely  professional.l they take credit/debit cards and the food is excellent.  They refused even to speak to the company that we booked the stay through regarding a refund which is just unbelievable. If a customer has a complaint you need to address it....that is expected in the hospitality industry. We would definitely recommend and revisit the Kenzi M√©nara Palace but WILL  NOT be returning EVER to the Ona Marrakech due to the way that they have chosen to deal with our issues with their hotel.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,MLM1003 wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Disappointing stay!,Would definitely NOT recommend staying at this hotel unless you want to be ripped off on a daily basis.  We were charged different prices at every bar (150 DH = ¬£12 for 2 beers that were less than half a pint at the pool bar ) paid for an hour massage which was all over and done within 40 minutes.  On checking out with my towel card would not refund me the deposit which is ¬£8 because apparently the number that they had written down on the receipt was apparently a 4 and not a 5 (pretty sure they do this to every guest) and insinuate I have somehow got my hands on the room next doors towel ticket.   When it comes to customer service don't expect to receive any the reception team can barely crack a smile.  Only thing positives are the swimming pool  and animation team but the rest of the staff are a joke and have left a real bad taste in my mouth.    If you challenge anything they just stare at you and never want to help or try and resolve any issues they just want your money!    Also asking for an iron was like I'd asked them to fly me to the moon about 24 hours and after asking 4 times one did eventually show up!   If you decide to come here make sure you do all inclusive as there is a serious lack of food options and the quality of food isn't great also don't expect everything to be included (drinks are inclusive until 11pm after that you pay) again they will try and rip you off I witnessed a girl having to challenge why they wouldn't serve her drinks at 10.40pm.   The city is half an hour away not 10 minutes as described on the website there is a free shuttle but it is quite restricted most evenings we would jump on the 7pm which gets you into the city at 7.30 eat quicky and jump back on the last bus which is at 10.30.    I have stayed in many hotels aroujd the world and this has to be the worst when it comes to being over priced and the absolute non existent customer service.  I would not come to this hotel again and would recommend if you come to Marrakech to stay closer to the city where there are some great restaurants but be mindful it is really expensive.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLM1003

The food- a massive selection with different themed nights not always to my liking but I‚Äôm not that adventurous when it comes to trying new things!

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Martin G wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Good Short Break,"Only ever book this as All Inclusive. Holiday Companies should not be offering this hotel without AI. The hotel is a minimum ¬£15 cab ride each way from the centre and there is nowhere else to eat nearby you need AI. People may suggest staying central but personally the traffic fumes on a hot day are horrendous and personally we were delighted to be staying out at Ona!    Maybe everywhere is busier in the summer with delays possible but after landing at 10.45 we were transferred checked in and sat with our first glass of wine by 12.30. Staff are all fantastic. I don't do 'Animation' but those participating looked like they were having fun. Evening entertainment especially the Moroccan night with camels and horses was great!    Do remember you are going to a 2nd world country 4 star here is not 4 star London or New York. Morocco being a former French colony it's strange being somewhere that the second language isn't English. No kettle in the room solved by taking teabags and a ¬£5 kettle from Argos!

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Jason wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Not what is seems online. Avoid.,This hotel appears amazing at the photos but sadly the reality is completely different. Although the property has a big potential they have a long way to go to reach it. In the meantime the drawbacks outweigh the good stuff.    So reasons you should stay away from Ona Hotel:    1. Distance. The hotel is ridiculously far from the city centre (around 30 min driving / 8 miles 13 km). There is no public transport so you only rely on the hotel shuttle bus. However the shuttle has limited spaces and limited timetable so if you don‚Äôt book the day before it will be full and you‚Äôll be left out. The only option remaining is their taxis which will cost you ‚Ç¨60 for a return trip. Crazy.  2. Rooms. Rooms are full of problems. Our garden door was broken and would not close. The safe box was also broken. There was no way to secure our things so we ended carrying all our valuables with us at all times. We‚Äôve asked the reception 6 times before those issues being fixed. Hot water runs out by the end of the day and at times the water coming from the shower is brown and dirty. The air conditioner was either far too cold or not working at all. The furniture was freshly painted with white paint and our things were stuck on them leaving white marks. Rooms were full of ants marching on the mattresses and pillows. The bathtub was stained with brown marks. I‚Äôve witnessed at least 7 other people was complaining about room issues.  3. Staff. Problems can arise even at the best hotels. It‚Äôs how the staff handle and sort them out that matters. Be sure that the staff in this hotel will not care at all. Receptionists are at the borderline of being rude. They don't even say hello or smile when you approach them. When you report an issue they‚Äôll say ‚Äùsomeone is coming now‚Äù. Now means in 2 days in the best-case scenario.  4. Health and safety. There was broken glass in the pool and two girls have stepped on it and cut themselves. They went to reception to report this but nobody seemed to bother. The pool is not clean. Don't be fooled by the photos on the website.  5. Food. Food in the main restaurant is average to bad. Coffees and juices come from machines that mix powder with water. They taste absolutely disgusting. If you don't have an all-inclusive ribbon lunch and dinner cost ‚Ç¨22 each per person per day. Not worth it. Also I would recommend that you avoid anything that is not cooked like fruit and vegetables. Your stomach will thank you. There are a couple of other restaurants in the home but they were either closed or not worth the price tag. Oh and by the way some staff like to serve you food using their bare hands.  6. Internet - WiFi is one of the biggest jokes of the hotel. It only intermittently works in the reception area. In the rooms you‚Äôll be lucky if you ever make it send a single iMessage. Even if you buy a local prepaid SIM card the reception is terrible since the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. In short you can forget internet connectivity.  7. Gym. The gym is a tiny room in the garden. When we went there the air conditioning was not working and it was impossible to work out as it was boiling hot in there.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CPJason

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,jojo274146 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,We stayed here for a week in September on an all inclusive basis. Lovely clean hotel. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. Especially when we needed help with our return transfer booking. The rooms were of a good size and the bathroom was very spacious. The shower wasn‚Äôt very powerful but usable. The food and restaurants were of a high standard. And there was lots of choice at all mealtimes. Breakfast was great with omelettes and pancakes being made fresh to order.  The was a good range of drinks on offer which again were of a high standard.  The pool area is really large and there was no problem getting a sun lounger. There‚Äôs a restaurant by the pool which is open in the day to get hot food or snacks which again we ate in a few times.  The animation team work very hard during the day and evenings. We didn‚Äôt really participate in the daytime activities apart from the cooking demonstration but there‚Äôs was lots going on with varied activities.  There are two restaurants that aren‚Äôt included in the all inclusive and we visited the Moroccan restaurant which was well worth paying extra for.  The location of the hotel is about 25 minutes from the centre of Marrakesh so you arent in the hustle and bustle of the city but There‚Äôs a free shuttle bus into Marrakesh several times a day and we would recommend using it to visit the markets.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,KGeorgee wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Great stay üòä,Stayed here for 4 nights. Check in was quick and pleasant and even got a free upgrade to a junior suite which was lovely. Thank you.    The pool area is vast with plenty of sun loungers. (mostly hard plastic ones). If you get up early enough you can nab one of the very few fabric ones so the plastic ones not a problem for me. Please get some mattresses!    The restaurant was great plenty of choice bbq every night free flowing wine and all very clean. Must mention Mohammed and Sied who made my day with their banter and outstanding service.    My only gripe was the older man at the main bar who had his own agenda about how many drinks you can have at any given time! And the cocktails were pre-mixed from a machine. The mojito was mintier than listerine.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,neil wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Very Clean and Beautiful hotel,we arrived late as our plane was delayed along with about 10 other guests. Lucky for us we got there before the minibus as check in at 11pm took a very long time it was change over on reception so we were served by a young man and the mushy woman behind the counter who had signed one couple in before us packed up and left leaving the young man alone to sign everyone in after returning to reception an hour later to find a drink some guests were still in the queue.  if you do arrive late please take either cash or something to drink. There was nothing to drink after 11pm apart from buying drinks in the blue bar.  That was the worst part of the whole holiday Everywhere in the hotel was super clean the gardens were lovely the pool area was 99% of the staff were very nice helpful and greeted you with a smile. With the exception of 3 staff.  The Room cleaners were great with fresh towels shower gels and shampoo daily beds changed twice while we were there. The Pool area i cant say anything other than this was a beautiful area plenty of sunbeds with full sun or shade music daily and the bar for drinks and the atlas bar for limited snacks but to be fair we were out of season.  Food was really good with plenty to choose from and something for everyone fresh pizza made there and then and masses of fresh salad. Breakfast had fresh pancakes or omelettes made to order and plenty of choice. Wine and bottled water were freely available in the restaurant. Could have done with lager on tap in there as you find in other places.  Entertainment staff were great very busy all day and night. plenty of activities in the pool beside the pool and dancing at night. i even ended up playing uno one day which i even won!  we did the excursion to the waterfall (Ouzoud Falls)  which was a 3 hour bus ride there and back but well worth it.    We also used the Spa on the last day that was also a lovely experience and worth visiting.    overall this is a lovely place to go on a relaxing holiday and i would return.,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilpN4654CB
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,JC21229 wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Beautiful hotel but disappointing holiday,Reception and check in procedure  Arrived at reception to check in @ 20.45 which was a fairly slow process. Despite being slightly late we managed to get dinner Thank you to kitchen manager and staff for arranging this it was much appreciated. Reception staff on occasion could be seen to help French speakers first which can leave you feeling quite frustrated. Although I really appreciated the helpful man on reception letting us have our room a couple of extra hours when we fell sick on our last day.    Hotel Room  We travelled as a party of 3 therefore allocated a family room which was nicely decorated and looked as advertised. Room 318. However Our safe didn‚Äôt work and the toilet moved rocking from side to side quite a bit. Also we had our bed made with a cosy duvet whereas our daughter got a small single sheet left folded on her bed whilst we were snug under our duvet our daughter was cold at night with just a sheet for bedding. Surely we should all have similar bedding in our room. We asked for a duvet at reception several times but never got one for her despite assurances she would. Another problem was the lack of towels As a party of 3 people we were only ever given 2 towels if we were lucky. We raised these issues with reception somebody came to look at the safe and ‚Äúfixed‚Äùit by locking it shut so we could not use it throughout our stay. The Toilet issue was not addressed so good luck to anyone in our room.    Hotel  The hotel reception and grounds were very pleasant and well kept. Although I was quite disappointed to see so much rubbish outside the hotel grounds. Due to its location being quite remote the hotel provides several free shuttle buses into central Marrakech. Which I would recommend you book early as they get busy. I was pleased to see pool tiles cleaned during our stay as tiles were becoming slippery in places. Although some Previous reviews mentioned lack of sun beds and a problem with ants neither was an issue with us although we travelled outside school summer holidays.    Food and Drink  We found the food which followed various themed evenings to be of good quality overall with plenty of choices. However labelling food would really help especially for those with special dietary requirements. If you‚Äôre a tea drinker you may need to bring your own bags unless you like herbal or mint tea. Coffee cups could be bigger as had to be refilled a few times for breakfast. It would be great if they were also out for dinner as it would be nice to finish a meal with a coffee. Drinks such as wine with dinner were a little hard to get hold of on several nights except when the managers were around. Cocktails were disappointing they were from a machine which weren‚Äôt great in my opinion.    Entertainment  The team work really hard to keep everyone entertained and do a great job overall. Personally I‚Äôd prefer to have less loud music around the pool and listen to my own music or just enjoy some quiet time reading. The nightly entertainment was reasonable. However on Moroccan evening the use of live animals such as camels and horses may look dramatic but one of the horses in particular was clearly showing signs of distress. Horses have sensitive hearing and the loud music and singing were effecting it badly. At the very least provide them with ear plugs if you have to have them in the show. But seeing horses in distress is not something I would call entertainment.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Channel Islands, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JC21229

The morrocan night was the Best. Drinks okay apart from the fact the old barman complains if you ask for more than 1 drink then changes his mind the next night and gives some people 4 drinks but others only 1. Cocktails okay  pool bar better and friendlier  Entertainment: the team are just amazing! They work so hard all day and night great entertainment. The morrocan and Hawaiian night was brilliant. Shout out to Gilsell the lady who served our table every night was lovely.  All the staff apart from the reception lady were absolutely lovely kind and welcoming.  Free bus to the medina is great. Lovely clean welcoming place. Tip; a taxi to the medina should only cost 140 dirham some people were paying much more.  Pool is amazing plenty of sunloungers ps...Never seen any ants or cockroaches.

Hotel appalling wouldn‚Äôt bring any water to room (the water issue is another problem) as they don‚Äôt have room service.

Reception staff tried to blame gastroenteritis on the swimming in their pool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or change of food! We weren‚Äôt the only ones several people had similar symptoms.    We had to pay to stay on for a further two days as couldn‚Äôt get a flight out No free or even discounted rooms and had to pay for all inclusive (there was no way we were eating the food)    FURTHER ISSUES  You wait ages to be checked in at reception. (Take a book)  No tea/coffee making service within room.  All inclusive drinks are not good it‚Äôs a push button machine for pina Colada Mojito etc so a real sweet synthetic taste unless you are willing to pay!  Glasses are tiny and you are not allowed to get more than two so there are several trips to the bar. (Along with everyone else)  Be careful getting taxi from hotel - ordered and paid for one Another couple done the same taxi driver arrives and we are all put into one taxi - taxi/hotel get double the amount.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alli6203

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Jake91_12 wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Overall a great resort with outstanding entertainment.,For the price we paid we were pleasantly surprised! We would happily return :)    + Entertainment was SUPERB. The team are all incredibly friendly and well... entertaining! You can tell that they love their jobs and this really shows.  + Food was pretty good. Plenty of choice and good wine. I would recommend sticking to the Moroccan choices instead of chips etc.  + Staff were very friendly. Some of them do know limited english so you may spend a little longer getting your point across.  + Pool was fab. Not too busy and very clean.  + Rooms are spacious and powerful modern AC.    - It took longer than expected to get checked in. There was also a rather long form we needed to fill in.  - Cocktails were out of a machine. Too sweet and artificial tasting... stick to the wine.  - A few minor room niggles. Fixed relatively quickly.  - Depending on where your room is located you may experience noise from the entertainment until 10-11pm.    One tip for the hotel..    1) Get rid of the artificial low quality juice next to the check in desk and replace it with Moroccan tea served fresh upon arrival. This is a small change but would make such a big difference in how your resort comes across! This small detail (initially) lowered my expectations considerably after tasting it.. First impressions count and serving cheap juice on arrival is not a great start!,Date of stay: October 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jake91_12

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,S1877 wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Will NEVER return!!!,4th time here 1st time since Its name change . Boy was I in for a shock  standards have dropped dramatically !!!!!! I‚Äôd give it 2.5/3 stars.    Firstly check in took an hour and my room wasn‚Äôt ready‚Äô so had to wait 2 hrs for my room which you can imagine is inconvenient after an early flight .    The excursion people give everyone a different price though there is a price list!    They only allow you to use their taxi which costs 5 times the local taxis ( so we used same local taxi driver for our trip avoiding being ripped off ) ontop of that they don‚Äôt let you bring local taxis into the hotel. Gate workers tried to fight our driver simply for dropping us ( local taxi) so we have to walk a few mins out every time we use our driver.    Under old name the hotel food was amazing with daily selections of traditional Morocco dishes. This time it was like being in Spain .. pizza chips and nuggets DAILY !!! I did not come to Morocco to eat typical and cheap western food I came for a Moroccan experience. VERY disappointed with the food .    Came with a large group  customer relations made big promises for our occasion had spoke prior our arrival to confirm yet STILL THEY FAILED to arrange as planned . They apologise and said they‚Äôll do something big that night again they FAILED to deliver . Having brought a large group of people and being. Regular you would of thought they‚Äôd go over and beyond but NO!!!!    The only good thing about this hotel is the spacious room and lovely pool area. Bedrooms full of ants and bugs which got into bags clothes and on our toothbrush!!!!    This is the last time I‚Äôll visit ONA never again !

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,justin wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Decent getaway,After reading alot of reviews before arrival I was very tempted to change hotels  however I'm pleased that I didn't follow through. Hotel is located out of the way to the mayhem of marrakech centre. Hotel itself is stunning on arrival . Reception staff made us feel very welcome . And was all checked in very promptly with no issues. Yes you do have to pay taxes on arrival which I knew. Food is ok lots of variety. Pool area is clean and massive . Animation team work endlessly if you wish not to participate in activities it's not an issue . Stayed at this hotel for 7 days then moved to eden andalou aqua park hotel for a short extension on our hotel but ona marrakech ryads and spa is hands down a far better hotel.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,sglyn wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Lovely hotel however could be more professional,Overall I enjoyed my stay here at Ona. The room was nice as was the pool and most of the staff.    We had a few issues during our stay. When we arrived the reception were incredibly slow at checking people in. As well as this a few days after check in a manager approached asking why the hotel hadn‚Äôt received the confirmation of booking from the company we had booked with. This confused me as I don‚Äôt understand why they would have checked us in without this and then left it a few days. This was quickly resolved by the package holiday company.    During our stay our room key broke several times and the reception weren‚Äôt always pleased to help us. As well as this on the 4th day the door key mechanism broke and had to be fixed. This was dealt with quickly but was a pain.    At around 1am whilst my friend and I were asleep in our room a male receptionist burst into our room using his own key and then apologised and left. I‚Äôm unsure if he forgot it was occupied however it was scary and strange.    Our room was very well decorated and had air con and we had a balcony. The only shame was that it is difficult to find your room as there are no signs anywhere to guide you to them and due to the accommodation being various ryads this was quite confusing.    The swimming pool was great and there were enough sun beds for everyone. The animation team were particularly professional and fun and were often helpful in providing information. The evening entertainement they was very good and enthusiastic.    I enjoyed the food at the hotel and it was varied however it would be better if guests could access large botels of water to take to their rooms and we were told off when we tried to take some. The temperature is too hot not to have access to water. The hotel bar staff were good however the drinks are served in very small glasses.    I wouldn‚Äôt say the hotel is suitable for children and there isn‚Äôt much to do and the animation team as aimed at adults. Kids may get quite bored.    The lighting in the hotel is poor particularly when making your way to the room in the evenings.    We used the free bus the hotel provided to Marrkaech which was convenient and easy however it does drop off and pick up in a strange location as it is difficult to find. I‚Äôm glad I experienced Marrakech as it was interesting however it is very difficult to navigate and I felt like we were conned out of money. I would advise not to speak or make eye contact with sellers as they can force their product on you. A lady sellong henna grabbed my friend‚Äôs hand and started drawing on her. She was quite forceful and we did decline her offer however she wouldn‚Äôt have any of it. The forcefulness of sellers made is reluctant to buy any other items in the market.    I enjoyed my stay at Ona however they could improve on so many simple things to make it a 5 star experience especially the reception.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powell1s
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Tara Y wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Good hotel,Me and my husband stayed here For 1 week the accommodation was clean and modern only complaint was there was no tea/ coffee facilities in the room which we found very strange as all the hotels we've stayed in being all incl have always had this the food was our main concern  there wasn't too much variety  it was pretty much the same day in day out  made us feel quite bloated and the 2 restaurants that were on the resort  you had to pay for Seperately  so we stuck to the main restaurant the pool restaurant was also same food on a daily basis pizza  burgers chips these were ok though  the pool areas are beautiful and chilled  we spent most of our time in the pool as the weather was amazingly hot this year  in the 40's  very dry heat but beautiful  we didn't visit the spa at all as went for chilled holiday  I have to say we found the main thing that made our holiday was the entertainment staff  wow they work hard all day and night around the pool in the day making sure they talk and make all guests feel happy and welcome it was my husbands birthday and they made it special and fun  they also do the evening entertainment on a regular basis and make it enjoyable and fun there is also a blue bar that is open after the evening entertainment finishes but again I don't feel happy with this as you have to pay for the drinks separately again  makes me feel that this hotel is not really all incl !! The staff overall are friendly and helpful  the shuttle bus ride to the market and souks is regular and just 30 mins ride  free  20 minute walk the other end and was great overall would go back for a shorter stay / girls weekend  but would mark it down to a 3* hotel and not 4* .,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaraY51
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Maddie‚Äôs Travels wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Came to this hotel for a weeks stay on all inclusive in September 2019,I looked at many hotels and reviews and chose this hotel although not visited Marrakech before have been to several all inclusive Hotels around Egypt and i have to say this Hotel is up there as one of my favourites. The pool is absolutely stunning and very clean never a shortage of sun beds. There is one all inclusive restaurant the food was very good especially the breakfast and lunchhplenty of choices freshly cooked omelettes on the odd occasion the food could have been hotter but this was probably as we ate late and the food was probably hotter earlier.  We were allocated a room a bit far from the main hotel was poorly lit at night but we managed to change rooms after two nights and the next room was much better. The rooms are beautifully decorated in a Ryad style and the air conditioning and wifi were great. The animation team are fantastic and the entertainment was far better than other hotels i have stayed in and i couldn't fault the dedication and hard work from the team. The Moroccan evening was fabulous horses and camels snake charmer belly dances it was truly magical.  I loved the fact there is a courtesy bus which takes you to the Medina the only downside is the bus drops you off a good twenty minute walk away fro the Square but if you like a walk then its no biggie. On the whole this stay in the wonderful hotel was all i hoped for and i would highly recommend it and will definitely be returning next year as i loved the hotel and the ambience and staff.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"East Sussex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/300663
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,301jaynes wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,This hotel was amazing.  The staff from reception to bar staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you.  Rooms were spotlessly clean.... but.... just a couple of things to improve on no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which would have been nice.  And just 3 sockets none by the bed. Just mAde it a little difficult charging phones hairdryer etc. And the lighting wasn‚Äôt great. But that‚Äôs all I can think of as a negative.    The animation team work so hard from morning to late at night and every day/evening make a point of going around and saying good morning to all the guests... they‚Äôre absolute amazing. You can be as involved as you would like they are never too pushy.  The lifeguards are friendly chatty and willing to help with towels sun beds or even swimming advice..... lovely guys.  The restaurant has a great selection all day although I must say the flies at times drove me mad. üò°  But I would say the best holiday I have had and I cannot wait to come again next year.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,walshj1 wrote a review Sep 2019,20,All Inclusive - but not as you know it,Overall a poor stay saved only by the amazing weather in Marrakesh. The main issues come from this not being a true all inclusive resort the constant need to keep paying more leaves a bad taste.    Restaurants - only the buffet is in the all inclusive. The two others are not one of these is a tapas restaurant which we didn‚Äôt see used once the other a Moroccan restaurant which we visited. This was a waste of time since the menu was then served in the buffet the next day you also had to pay for the wine which was free in the buffet just 10 meters away...    Drinks - in reality there are very limited drinks available. Lager Moroccan wine Moroccan gin and Moroccan vodka the later two are used with fruit juice to make a variety of three cocktails.    Pool - towels have to be hired there is also no drinks service and since glasses are only collected twice a day you will also be clearing away drinks.    Snacks - these are the left over pastries from the mornings buffet breakfast served in the building by the pool that used to be a restaurant (now really just an empty space). Want to have some ice cream to cool down? That will be extra...    Spa - of course treatments are extra and the price on these is good value. What isn‚Äôt is that if you have booked numerous treatments you aren‚Äôt allowed to wait in the spa unless you pay ¬£8 per person per hour - not a huge price but annoying especially when you have paid for your treatments and you cash is a half hour round trip away.    Gym - this is by far and away the worst gym I have ever been in. It wasn‚Äôt cleaned the week we were there so everything has a crust of salt no cleaning equipment is left either so presumably this will continue until geological formations start to form under the bars. Air con? Yes (sometimes) but it‚Äôs set to 28 degrees which makes it fairly pointless. The most disappointing thing was that this gum is used by the hotels staff none of whom made any effort to clean up after themselves.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Lewis B wrote a review Sep 2019,20,Not 4*,We‚Äôve been here 2 days now and the experience has got to the level where I‚Äôve even created an account to leave this review to help others who are thinking of coming here.    On arrival we were left waiting with a staff member on the phone and the other 2 having a conversation with one another. After standing there waiting the gentleman didn‚Äôt say hello and passed us 2 forms to fill out (general info).    He said our room would be ready at 12.00 (we expected 2Pm so was happy) to leave our bags at the door of the hotel where they will be taken to the room for us. He pointed where the bar was and gave us no additional info.    12pm comes so my girlfriend and I walk over excited to start our holiday. One of the two after staff who were previously chatting said nothing else but ‚Äú2PM‚Äù. We explained the above and the gentlemen who dealt with us was on the phone next to us.    We began to walk back to the bar confused and a little annoyed as it was 40 degree heat and we were still in our travelling clothes and just been told 12pm. As we began to walk off he shouts at us waving the key card. We walk back over hoping to get some info or at least told where our room was but nothing. We are now standing at the lobby room key in hand no idea where we are going and spot our bags still outside (in the sun).    We decide to take our own bags and ask a member of a staff (a gentlemen to what his job role is other than being rude and sexist to customers I‚Äôm not sure) for directions to room 512.    We explained we was tired received no info about the hotel or anything and been left to wonder the complex in the bid to find our hotel with now our luggage to drag around. He said to my girlfriend ‚Äúlook here lady after day 1 everything be ok‚Äù which we didn‚Äôt really feel was the appropriate reply. He pointed loosely where to go and still had no idea where was going and where anything was.    With it being day 1 of the holiday we were just happy to be there in the sun and begin to enjoy ourselves (not relying on any staff). We went into the room to shower off to find the bath dirty and as we showered the plug cover fell off leaving a filthy metal plug underneath.    As we was by the pool a member of staff told us how we must pay a deposit for the correct towel (we used a room one). Which would of been completely fine had someone told us leaving us feel rather awkward.    Day 2 comes and we requested a bottle of water (we are all inclusive). The gentlemen who i assume is some kind of manager as he was in a suit advised we are to have x1 water bottle at breakfast lunch and dinner.    He said we aren‚Äôt allowed another one until lunch where my girlfriend then explained that we missed breakfast (which we did). I was sat 20m away which he points at me says ‚Äúthis your partner‚Äù my girlfriend said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to which he responds ‚Äúyou have a bottle‚Äù (which was also empty and why we was asking for one). He then rudely and reluctantly hands my girlfriend a bottle of water (technically we should have x4 water at this point if that‚Äôs the rule of all Inclusive water and the bottle was from dinner the night before!).    The reason for the additional star is that the food is OK and the coffee machine works in the bar (although there is no hot drink facility in the room which for a 4* you‚Äôd maybe expect.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Broadstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571lewisb

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Jay wrote a review Sep 2019,20,"Stressful experience, rude staff, overpriced, do not book.",Me and my family stayed there for a week first of all it‚Äôs in a deserted area far away from everything it‚Äôs about a 30min drive to the main square/souks where all the shops are. After a long night we just wanted to get to our hotel and shower but it took us over 2 hours to be checked in with a lack of communication as to what was happening. The guy who checked us in had no idea what he was doing and kept getting everything wrong. We had paid for 3 rooms with twin beds but ended up with double beds. There was loud music all night so unable to sleep even after having our rooms moved after several sleepless nights and countless requests you could still hear the noise!! There was misinformation regarding the shuttle bus to and from the hotel which meant we were unable to use the shuttle bus resulting in a lot of money on expensive taxis. We had massages booked in the hotel so which were overpriced and definitely not worth it with staff re-using dirty towels. We had to wait over 3 hours to receive towels so we could shower! Even after several calls to reception. When we went to the staff at reception with any problems they were rude and unhelpful and accused us of our complaints being invalid. Although several customers had been complaining the entire team we were there. By the end we couldn‚Äôt wait to leave. We spoke to the manager as we were leaving who even agreed he had already received several complaints about the reception staff he then offered us a free stay at the hotel for all the problems we had suffered which of course we still have seen no sign of!!

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Zaink wrote a review Sep 2019,10,TERRIBLE STAY - DO NOT BOOK,This hotel was a nuisance from start to finish. Firstly the hotel is quite far out even though the hotel website states its about 10 minutes away from the main square it's actually minimum 30 minutes. It took the staff 2 and a half hours to check us in (which is the last thing we needed especially as we were extremely tired from travelling). The shuttle service is not that regular and you have to book your seats a day before (which we were not informed of) which meant we spent a lot on taxis. It costs minimum ¬£20 for a single journey - that's how far out the hotel is. We had booked a twin room (which specified 2 single beds) but we're given a double room so only one double bed whereas my siblings had a twin room so 2 single beds and 2 sinks however our room only had the one (even though we booked a twin room too!). To top it all off we had a full body massage which was very poor and could tell the towels were not fresh. Once the massage was over the masseuese straightened the same towel I was lying on for the next client instead of getting a fresh one! Disgusting! Finally the staff were extremely rude when we raised our complaints saying 'we are the only guests who seem to have a problem' when literally 2 minutes later a lady turned up to complain that the tap in her bath had not been working for the past few days which shut the rude staff member up. When we raised our complaints to the hotel manager at check out he promised us an all inclusive 5 night stay for a free and that he would send an email confirming this. 2 weeks later and still no email so not only are the staff rude but also liars.

The souks/city centre is not a 10 minutes shuttle bus ride away but minimum 30 mins. Shuttle bus information is conflicting - not that regular and limited spaces PLUS same staff member said the rule was to book 1 day before then a couple of days later said you should have booked in advance?! We asked to move rooms because of the noise which they did - lo and behold they moved us to a room where you could still hear the music instead of the back rooms where noise is blocked. Asked for towels - took them several hours to bring despite asking a few times. Kept forgetting to give us shower gel and when requested they brought up more lotion and shampoo! Took 2 hours to check in and were given the wrong wristband; the restaurant manager made out as if we were trying to get free dinner! They also spoke in French about us right in front of us - and when I said I could understand what they were saying they had the decency to at least be embarrassed - very poor service. The manager said he would send us an email for a free stay because of all the issues - nothing received 2 weeks later (no surprise).,Date of stay: September 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hajira_KT

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,FRC0384 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great holiday,I booked this hotel for a week‚Äôs holiday with my friend. This was the second year we have done this and after a really good experience in a different country last year I wanted to make sure we equalled that! I have to say having booked it back in early May the trip advisor reviews and also the lack of them worried me! Then from May they picked up and seemed so much better apparently they were due to the property being refurbished. We really needn‚Äôt have worried we had a lovely week here! Very relaxing! The staff were all impeccably polite and friendly. The buffet restaurant was the only restaurant that appeared to be being used by diners really and it was like a buffet repetitive in some respects but there were always at least some variations and there were fresh eggs/omelettes every morning.    We stayed in ryad marguerite which was one of the first blocks down from reception. Happy with the room. It was spacious and clean. Only water included in in-room drinks and a couple of issues (air con stuck on though given the 40o heat that was no problem!) and plug socket by the bed not working but certainly not things I would mark down for!    There was a small gym which had what you would expect from a holiday gym it served its purpose and was never overcrowded.    The pool was large. Sunbeds were old and I can definitely imagine that in high season you might struggle to get one but we always managed fine. It could be very loud at times. When the animation team were in the music was loud but in actual fact the team were FANTASTIC! I particularly enjoyed the step aerobics but perhaps not in such a ferocious heat! Never a long queue at the pool bar but I think we were probably off-season again!    The lobby is also huge but beautiful! Plenty of places to sit comfortably and avoid the direct sun.    Yes the location is out of town - about 20 minutes but the hotel ran free shuttle buses that we took regularly. We enjoyed it being a little quieter.    Things to improve on?    If and when you look to get new glass-wear purchase larger ones! The ones they use are very small and in that heat necessitated going to the bar every few minutes!    Big bottles of water available at the bar. Big bottles were really only available during the opening hours of the buffet restaurant or when housekeeping cleaned your room. Plentiful supply of water is essential in the heat that Marrakech experiences!    Better light on stairwells if the ryads- was dark after sunset.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,fleaty1 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,GREAT BREAK IN THE SUN,My partner and I wanted a hotel based break to relax and recharge our batteries.This hotel fitted us perfectly  both myself and my boyfriend had never been to Morocco before and didn't know what to expect.We were pleasantly surprisedWe arrived early before check in time but reception where great and really helpful and had no communication issues despite what previous reviews have said  I'm guessing if you speak to them with respect then they will do the same.They gave us our bands and we changed put cases in luggage room and went to pool. This hotel had a great pool and all surrounding areas where very clean and tidy with ample sunbeds the pool bar was basic but had everything that was needed.The apartment in the ryads was pretty decent again very clean and tidy.with a safe. fridgeTv and good aircon .In the whole of our stay we didn't come across a single member of staff that was rude in fact they all made a point of smiling and saying hello.The food was pretty decent but guess what several dishes where Moroccan yes I know that is a real shocker being in Moroccohowever there was also lots of other stuff Paella Lasagne and pizza for example it could have been a bit warmer but apart from that it was all goodhowever there was a lot of people mainly British who seemed to think they where at the Ritz for a few hundred quid and did nothing but moan about the food making comments it wasn't English enough. The entertainment was good but it is very traditional so if you want karaoke or some kind of pub singer this isn't the place for you (stick to Benidorm ) All in all we had a great time and got everything we expected for a last minute budget break  we would be happy to come back again. we encountered none of the issues that some reviews had mentioned that had actually began to worry me just before we went. No ants no bugs  no rudeness decent food with lots of choice (be adventurous try something new ) entertainment that didn't involve someone screaming out the lyrics to My Way  and no early morning music blasting from the pool  yes there was music at about 9.30 am that was at a perfectly normal level.So in summary a great Holiday,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fleaty1
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Luke7 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,"Great food, hotel and staff",Great hotel with great staff don't believe the negative reviews staff are human if you are nice they will be nicer in return they were very polite and helpful it always seems to be my fellow Brits who moan complain about everything and are rude I saw a woman shouting at staff as she wanted a can rather than a glass and yes...she was english from the UK ! This place gets top marks from me in all areas great food  clean and staff are great.  Some advice - make friends with a good taxi driver they are rare but I used a good honest one - as the hotel will charge 250 to the square or you are tied down to the shuttle it should only cost 150 for a taxi call the taxi 20 mins in advance - his name is Siddique he is a very humble honest and joyful man he won't overcharge and has s great personality.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Gisele C wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Disappointing,Lovely staff all maintenance issues we reported were sorted promptly. Shows were different and majority were quite entertaining. Weather was glorious. Good selection of food but majority cooked in olive oil that smelt and tasted awful. Butter was rancid in first couple of daysthey had also used it in some of the desserts. Both of us had food poisoning after being there for 24-48 hours that lasted all week & there were others who were also ill in the same way as us we've been home over a week and still not feeling right. The guy directing us into the restaurant offered to get the doctor to see us I wish we had taken up his offer. Swimming pool cloudy and surrounding areas not cleaned properly. Sun beds old and hard no pads. Take a torch lighting really bad in the dark timer switches don't stay on long enough. Hotel in the middle of nowhereneed to get shuttle bus taxi or organized trip to go anywhere. We were unable to leave hotel anyway due to the sickness. Our ryad fountain was stagnant and wasn't fixed until the night before we left. Our air con had to be fixed but it pumped out an awful smell like bad drains perhaps that's what made us ill. All inclusive local drinks were like firewater we only tried a couple of alcoholic drinks and drunk water for the rest of the week. It didn't seem to bother many others who were getting their moneysworth. Needs tea making facilities in rooms. Bottled water was plentiful for which we were thankful. Hotel rating not 4 star and not all recently refurbished as was advertised. Wouldn't go back. Have stayed in traditional ryad in the centre of Marrakech before would do that again if I ever went back. Still waiting for Love holidays to respond as we also had issues with our airport transfers.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194giselec
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Natalie S wrote a review Sep 2019,40,"Overall, enjoyable - but easy improvements could make it a lot better!",So we arrived at Ona late on a Saturday evening around 11pm there was around 5 parties dropped off from our flight to the hotel.    CHECK IN - First impressions were that there was only two people on reception and they were INCREDIBLY slow. We were served by I believe her name was Amal she served us well but was very slow at processing everything and kept having separate conversations with members of staff and checking her phone - and you could tell everyone at reception was bored of waiting and just wanted to go to sleep.    We stayed in the Riad Rose Room 416 - and as soon as we arrived I checked all appliances as I'd read certain things mentioned on various reviews. Annoyingly despite asking for twin beds the beds were put in an awkward double in the middle of the room. Also the door to the balcony didn't work - and this annoyed be despite our room being on the second floor.    After complaining at reception they didn't seem to grasp why we were so worried - and they did not seem concerned. We persisted and eventually the man who helped carried our luggage came and checked again persisting that nobody could get in - after battling he then brought a locksmith to our room and the he was there for around 45 minutes checking our door and fixed it and left. Not a great start however I appreciate that they made sure it was fixed and it was done quickly. I would say if you have any issues then persist - as they do try and palm you over stating that they'll 'fix it tomorrow' however just push on.    What I would've appreciated was a guided tour of the room as we didn't know how the safe worked (you don't have to pay) and we had to get someone seperate out for this. ALSO note that despite noting 'mini-bar' there isn't anything in the fridge. And no drinks/snacks are offered in the room. This is a small qualm but it would've been nice.    ROOMS - Rooms are lovely all the Riads are very quiet which was appreciated. We were also in a Riad near the pool which was very nice and easy in the morning. Air con is GREAT - so silent and keeps rooms so cool. Not a great choice of TV channels on TV only English News Channels.    Bathroom is very big and nice amount of wardrobe storage. However both the plug for the fridge and the shower head were partly broken and stopped working a few times - so that should be looked into. i WOULD bring your own towels just as housekeeping would sometimes take towels and take a while bringing new ones - but no big problem.  You can also get a towel card at reception for beach towels.    Beds are nice a bit hard - but annoyingly they only give you one pillow. However when asking at reception we were given two more. Again if you do mention it - they do normally try and resolve your problems.    FOOD - Food was okay definitely could've been more choice. Same style of meat at most meals with same sides/salads/dessert - would've been nice if they'd had more variety - however majority of it was very tasty. Wine options would also change out but overall would be okay. Often good meat/fish options with pasta and pizza. Desserts were nice. Annoyingly they have a Spanish and Morrocan Restaurant but these were all closed or a lot of additional money so were always empty. Should try and incorporate this more into the all inclusive. Would've liked to have tried more Morrocan food such as Lamb Tagine.    DRINKS - Wine at meal times was okay however gin tasted funny. What was one of the most annoying parts of this hotel was the drinks stopping at 11pm as the entertainment stopped. VERY ODD. A lot of people would have to line up drinks which they often took from under your nose so they could clean up quicker. Definitely think the all-inclusive should run till at least 12am. Drinks and cocktails by pool were nice.    POOL - Pool was very nice could be cleaned more often. Often quite a few ants in the grassy bits so try and sit closer to the pool. Try and get one of the green sunbeds as these are comfier. We went in September and plenty of sunbeds.    EXCURSIONS - We didn't go on any excursions but very good minibus thats free that goes from Hotel to Marrakesh which was much appreciated. Wouldn't get a taxi from hotel as they charge a lot.    SERVICE - Service was VERY hit and miss. We returned a few times in the evenings to reception and Amal was VERY rude and would never help you directly. However the manager was very good and would be seen around the restaurant a lot. Really depends who you get.    ENTERTAINMENT - It was good their was a lot of variety and good for kids - pool activities but you weren't forced to do anything. Entertainment team don't speak a lot of English so sometimes hard to converse but always tried their hardest!    OVERALL - Very nice refurbishment but small fixtures in rooms (doors leads safes) could make it a lot better. Definitely think all inclusive needs to go on until 12am as it cut the night short and you had to stockpile drinks. Very quiet resort which was appreciated not that busy - which was nice. Service was very hit and miss - but depends who you talk to. Needs to be more variety in food for all meals real juice at breakfast would've been appreciated as well as more Moroccan meals and more choices in meat/fish and paid restaurants need to be used for something! Went int he gift shop once but WAY overpriced. About 25 minutes from town but shuttle is great! With some small changes this place could've been great. But overall enjoyable for a 5 night stay.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalies270
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Sheilarodr wrote a review Sep 2019,30,NEEDS IMPROVING,The hotel is not horrible at all. It is true that it has a lot of opportunities.  There‚Äôs plenty of glasses plates chipped. That is a health and safety hazard.  The fridge in our room wasn‚Äôt working after 3 days going to reception they put a new one. It wasn‚Äôt cooling at all but they tried.  Despite we paid all inclusive you won‚Äôt have a simply bottle of water in your room. Just asking for water nothing else. I‚Äôm not fancy with fizzy drinks or alcohol. Just water.  We hadn‚Äôt got any problem with ants or insects in our room. It was very clean at all the times. üëåüèº  Some nights we had people working next to the swimming pool with a machine to pick up the hammocks. That was at 23:45. Despite we called reception they kept doing it. I have even recorded a video. Guys we are going to that hotel to rest. Not to party every night. Believe me that I am really reasonable with complaints.  Take your swimming pool towels or you‚Äôll be charged to use one. Ridiculous!  Also to go to the swimming pool. That looks like Benidorm. People wake up in the morning and go there to leave the towels in the hammocks. So easy that you won‚Äôt find a proper space.  Food was ok most of the times. A couple of days was poor but it is understandable. Love the girl in the morning cooking the pancakes! The best pancakes ever! And she was always cooking under pressure with a lovely smile!  The restaurant manager was arguing with employees a lot of times in front of us.  Anyway overall I‚Äôll give you a 3 but there‚Äôs so  Many things you need to change.  I wouldn‚Äôt pay the price I‚Äôve paid to go back again as for the same price I‚Äôm going somewhere else better.  Good luck with the hotel congratulations for the animation team the work tirelessly! And hope you improve little by little!

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,TirupatiVenku wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Lovely all inclusive,We had a safe and pleasant stay for 6 days here is our review:    Reception    We checked in late and found staff to be helpful. During the course of our trip whenever we had a few things to discuss the staff was very helpful. I lost an item and they were able to quickly locate it as well. Because we came after the kitchen closed we were quite hungry but they arranged for their staff to whip up a plate for us and serve us and we found that incredibly thoughtful. They are also nice welcome drinks at the entrance and the lobby is gorgeous. Drinks and ice are made with filtered water so you can help yourself.    Suggestion: although we didn‚Äôt have a wait time in order to avoid long waits at check in they may wish to assign numbers to those waiting so guests can comfortably take a seat and get a drink while waiting without losing their place in line.    Room    We got the junior executive suite it was very nice. We didn‚Äôt get housekeeping so we can‚Äôt comment on this but we did see cleaners everyday coming through and we were able to ask for things on the fly.    Food    I‚Äôm a fussy eater and vegetarian and I found the food amazing. Each meal each day there were numerous options. The dishes were constantly replenished I never saw the dishes go less than halfway before being refilled. There are smoke fruits desserts charcuterie trays freshly made pastas wraps meats traditional dishes etc. Each meal has 4 station attendants making something from fresh in addition to other dishes. There is also wine pop juice and mint tea service at every meal.    I don‚Äôt recall if we were to have access to more than 1 restaurant as part of the all inclusive but we only ever saw the buffet open bc there were so many options this was never an issue.    Pool    Every group must set their own norm but the guests visiting during our stay would reserve loungers with their stuff. We followed suit early morning. We never found late arrivals to have difficulty finding a lounger nevertheless. Animation team is kind and engaging without being pushy and respectful of your privacy. They have a number of activities during the day if you care to join and great music that starts off soft early morning and ramps up during the day. They also have a bar at the pool.    Shuttle/ excursions    We did not do any excursions but we did shuttle to the market. They drop you at the halfway point between the old town and the new town. It‚Äôs a brisk 20 minute walk in running shoes to the square. I would advise to skip the 3-6 shuttle the heat is at its most intense between 2-6. An early morning jaunt or the evening one where you see the square come alive would be best. It‚Äôs very safe it‚Äôs full of tourists and locals are accustomed to seeing you. We didn‚Äôt have any experience with any aggressive vendors or those looking to tag along. Recommend watching some YouTube videos on the area before you go so you‚Äôre well prepared.    Clothing    At the resort you can wear your skimpiest of outfit and outside in the market we found tourist women to be wearing pretty much whatever they pleased. It seemed locals were quite accustomed to it. It was quite a sight seeing them mixed amongst the locals but all that to say you don‚Äôt need to be too stressed. Because of the heat I would recommend taking in some of the local wisdom and wearing loose flowing outfits contrary to what we think they actually create greater room for air circulation in the intense heat and keep heat out than wearing a tank and shorts. Because this is a key holiday destination in the UK we found tourists to be quite fashionable here. So if you want to dress up go for it!    Language barrier    The resort did well in English. I speak French so I was able to get further. Learning a few French likes will help.    Entertainment    The entertainment show around the world and Morocco based one was best. You may want to be sure to be present for the latter they bring in camels horses and dancers. I have mixed feelings on whether this is the subjugation of animals but that‚Äôs another topic altogether.    Spa    We got the couple‚Äôs hamam with Sana‚Äôa. It was gold. Highly recommend it was worth every penny. If you got fake lashes or hair dye that runs you may want to advise them to steer clear of your hair and lashes. If you‚Äôve never had a hamam you will want to try it. It‚Äôs different than Turkish hamam. You will be scrubbed clean- you‚Äôll be given a tiny g string and men will get shorts and you will sit on a heated marble slab each and your attendant will scrub and wash you from head to toe in a private room. Your self consciousness self will dissolve rapidly. It‚Äôs a once in a lifetime must at least.    The relaxation massage was ok. Once you step into the spa you do away with modesty if you‚Äôre not comfortable with having your breasts massaged or your buttocks you may wish to clarify that upfront.    The skin brightening facial was ok it felt a bit aggressive and underwhelming.    Suggestion: attendants should explain each step and/or when they‚Äôre leaving the room.    Ants/ wasps  I never saw any wasps ever but there were teenie tiny ants outdoors which seemed normal to me. I did spot a few in the took but only the first 2-3 days.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TirupatiVenku
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Siobhan C wrote a review Sep 2019,40,In one word - Fantastic,This place is fantastic for a getaway I came here solo for 7 days and I have to say I felt safe each and every night that I was here. I have written something on each section. I give it 4 stars and you can read about this underneath.    Room:  I got upgraded to a junior suite and it was really nice to have the extra space even though it was just for myself. Rooms are clean beds are firm and the room is stylish as it was newly renovated. I stayed in the 500 area so it was inbetween the hotel and swimming pool. There is a bit of walking from the hotel to the swimming pool so just be aware of this. In the room they provide a hairdryer shampoo conditioner body lotion and body wash. They don‚Äôt have an iron in the room just FYI.    Reception:  Amal and Majda were extremely helpful throughout my stay I had a few issues and they were happy to help me no matter what. I didn‚Äôt like the man on reception he didn‚Äôt understand what I was asking and rolled his eyes at me so if I wanted something I would wait for the women to come back. He tried to apologise the next day which was fine but I have to say that especially Majda was honestly the nicest woman I have met in Morocco. On my last day I had trouble calling my transfer company and she was working two hours after she was supposed to finish and she still wanted to help me. I am so grateful she was there.    Food:  The food is great and I am a picky eater. The selection here is SO much better than the other hotels I have stayed in. Buffet style for each meal always had something I really liked! Pool service was also good and I would recommend everyone to choose the All Inclusive package.    Entertainment:  The Animation team were the best part of the hotel. They work very long hours and are really hard working. They try to get everyone involved in activities every day but also talk to you and get to know you personally. I joined in the games and it was a lot of fun and met really nice people because of this and have great friendships with them now. Oussama one of the Animators was THE nicest man I have ever met. He was friendly a really great dancer but also made me feel welcome. I don‚Äôt speak French so he helped explain a few things to me in English. I saw him there every day making people feel welcome always smiling and happy. He is definitely an asset to the team.    Spa:  I had the Hammam and a back massage and it was a great experience. Ladies are lovely in there and I really enjoyed my treatments. A little bit more expensive than I thought it would be but you can‚Äôt complain if the service is amazing.    Complaints:  I don‚Äôt have many complaints which is very rare for me. I was checking out on Sunday but on Saturday a couple who were leaving the hotel said they were in 509 which was my room so the staff packed up all my belongings and put them in storage. I came back at 6pm to find everything gone and it took a while to get everything back. Not only this but on my last day I got woken up at 7am from a call from reception to tell me my transfer car to the airport is here but my flight was 8pm so that was wrong. I wasn‚Äôt happy about that because I was extremely tired but I know mistakes happen they need to be more careful with this.    Advice:  If you are a person who wants to be asleep by 9pm go somewhere else. The hotel provides great entertainment which is not for everyone but I really enjoyed it and it usually goes on until 11:30pm. Or you can ask for the furthest room there is so that you don‚Äôt hear much noise  Also there are ants and wasps everywhere. It‚Äôs not the hotels fault it‚Äôs just the area we are in so if you hate them try stay away from the green area at the pool and go closer to the pool itself.    DO NOT BUY FROM THE GIFT SHOP!!!  On my first night I bought a UK adaptor and it was 11 euro. I also needed to buy sun lotion and they actually charged 23 euro for a small bottle. I had no choice but to buy this and I was very angry!! That is not ok. They need to look at these prices because you would not pay that price in your own country no matter where you live.    Overall - amazing! I am definitely coming back!!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562siobhanc
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Tom N wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Average,Came for a 10 day holiday rooms were excellent very spacious two balcony and a large bathroom. Swimming pool wasn't cleaned as much as i would expect but very big with enough room entertainment was average if you come more than a week you watch the same show more than once but its nice to sit down and have a drink at night bar shuts early some nights. There are alot more things that are sold to you on the holiday which are not included. There is no cash machine and the shop is very over priced no ice creams or crisps available with all inclusive. The food was the most disappointing aspect of my holiday the same boring bland and cold meals we was also served raw chicken 3 times in 10 days i complained every day and was just looked at like we was rude. Nothing was resolved and carried on like normal. The managers seemed to always do nothing didn't engage with you as a customer didn't ask if our food was ok. All just milling about looking busy. I would just like to add Hamza who works in the hotel is by far the most polite and outstanding worker i have seen in this hotel and would just like to mention him for his hard work all day and to see a manager come over and shout at him for 15 minutes for amount of glasses he had collect working on his own whilst the football was on and was a very busy Saturday didn't impress me.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomNolan1912
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Reena M wrote a review Sep 2019,10,Disappointed,So the hotel has promise but from the moment you walk in as a group of British people (civilised women I would add!) we were treated badly. The ladies at reception ignored us got annoyed when we asked to check in asked for an extra key or generally breathed near them! One of our group went to their room and it was someone elses room! All of their stuff was in it!    Pool is nice and great for a families. Lots of loungers. Food and buffet is great.    Rooms are not great. Patio doors rarely locked across the whole group half of the safes don‚Äôt work towels get taken at 10am and not returned til 5pm. Ants all over the floor. Haphazard Cleaners.    If the reception were helpful we would have given feedback directly but they were so so rude! And we‚Äôd just arrived with smiles and holiday excitement to be treated with contempt.    It advertises a number of restaurants and bars. Not all function and are closed so check before you book.    The animation team are very hard workers as are the guys who serve your tables in the restaurant - helpful and welcoming. If you are a Moroccan family this hotel is for you!

Reception staff need work they are borderline rude and don‚Äôt prioritise when you have a serious issue such as balcony door broken and getting you to your room etc.  Shuttle bus is really good and the guy driving is really nice. Just make sure you book on a day prior.  Entertainment team are good and they try very hard and are great with the kids.  Bar should stay open longer than 11.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,karl r wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Bit of a let down,The worst thing about the hotel unfortunately was right at the start of our trip - check in at reception was absolutely horrendous 1hr 30mins to check in in a lobby that‚Äôs air conditioning was mediocre at best. Unfortunately this really wasn‚Äôt an ideal start as they say first impressions last...    Food - generally decent enough typical buffet style of a fairly wide spread of different cuisines. Limited drinks tho    Rooms - again clean enough few small problems safe wasn‚Äôt working although was fixed after a couple of moans. Phone never worked but not a big deal so no worries.    WiFi - works in reception area well enough other than that round the pool and in the rooms didn‚Äôt work bit frustrating.....    Evening Entertainment - appalling    Pool - clean pool staff not much control over kids jumping in messing around etc tho not much authority.... sunbeds can be a struggle to find at times towels out on beds at 7am.....    Drinks pretty mediocre small in size and cocktails rubbish straight out of machines.  No ice cream for kids would have been a nice idea. Poolside snack bar pretty basic and limited time availability.    Shop - what a absolute disgrace no prices advertised... two different staff members quoted different prices for suncream on consecutive days... which btw was an absolute rip off... ¬£20 at first which I refused the next day I got it for the bargain price of ¬£15 from another staff member.... when we ran out later in the week the same guy who asked ¬£20 before asked ¬£18 this time when I told him i got it for 15 before he made a phone call to the other staff member clearly as he didn‚Äôt believe me... I argued with him and he accepted ¬£15.... I know I Shd have bought elsewhere but when you‚Äôve run out and forgotten you‚Äôre sort of a little stuffed...... anyway avoid the shop if poss    Would we go again... probably not tbh just disappointed all round with the general standard of the hotel the recent refurb seems to have worked but they have some serious teething problems they need to address.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Great Bookham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956karlr
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,LGTURNER wrote a review Aug 2019,20,Terrible entertainment/service. Esp for non locals.,Every morning they blare music at the pool. Seriously???? Maybe at 5 in the evening but every morning??? No thanks.    Kids are allowed to run around and jump into pool etc. No obidience. Entertainment terrible. Especially every evening. Just kids everywhere. Some local dance or music. No dj even. Locals seem to like it. Not for Europeans. Reception staff soooooo slow. Loads of them just standing around. They will never approach you if you are there. Locals are treated superior. If you are non local and at the bar the staff will serve a local if they come up after you. Locals treat non locals like crap. The shop in the hotel is a disgrace. No prices on anything. Staff make the prices up on the spot. ‚Ç¨22 for sun cream. Again if you are a local cheaper prices. Alcohol terrible. No branded drinks. Don't believe the positive comments about cocktails. Didn't even get one. It comes out of a machine. Staff press a button and hey presto.    Can't believe the comments about loads of sun loungers. Not true in August. People leave towels on loungers from early morning and don't turn up till after 12/1. Cannot get a bed for just myself after 9:30. Staff tell me that's all the beds. However when locals ask the staff tell them to stay put for a while. A few minutes later they get them a sun lounger from an apartment building where they store excess sun loungers. Hotel will charge ‚Ç¨50 return taxi to the centre because they clearly get commission. Use a private driver always. WhatsApp them etc. I did that for the week. Charged me ‚Ç¨25 return. No iron in 4 star hotel. Ridiculous. Staff told me I need to pay for it to get it ironed. Again another way to get more money out of you.    Food was nice and pool layout etc nice. However terrible service and entertainment. Especially if you are European. Treated inferior. Ants are in room yes. They crawl under the door. Impossible to get them out.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerardluke
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Fraser wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Could be good with some changes,Stayed at the Ona resort for 1 week with my girlfriend. Booked through Expedia.    Pros  - Areas renovated look good  - Large pool  - Food in buffet restaurant generally good  - Animation team work hard to ensure guests have a good time  - Spa was lovely    Cons  - Similar to other reviews the service at times was pretty poor especially reception check in. It was quite common to simply be ignored. Lots of managers walking around (not sure what they do!) but little English  - The restaurant at peak times felt like a school canteen with food having run out etc. It was quite common to set your own table  - Night time entertainment wasn‚Äôt great but they do what they can    Tips  - The earlier you go for each meal the calmer and nicer it is. Also means you get choice of all food  - Make sure to take bottles of water from lunch and dinner. It is very hard to get a bottle of water from any other place in the hotel and you have to keep asking for small glasses of water. Can get a bit annoying.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FraserM793
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,R S wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Hotel,WORST HOTEL.  the only good thing about this hotel is the pool which you‚Äôd only like if you like KIDS KIDS KIDS. The service is the worst in fact I was told I COULD LEAVE when I was explaining the problems in the room such as telephone not working the whole 7 days bathroom HAD CORROSION when they opened 2 months ago?. ANTS EVERYWHERE. HELLO? 4 star hotel buy ant pesticide. Room service absolute DISGUSTING no towels expected to share 2 with 3 people. Staff is so rude they don‚Äôt care and WORSHIP MORROCAN LOCALS they are very slow to bring anything. The shows are full of kids and the breakfast buffet was absolute horrendous as they did not even have English tea.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsG1858VO
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,453JoH wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Fabulous hotel and holiday,Visited Morocco for the first time and was not disappointed with our first experience at the ona marrakech hotel. The hotel has been closed for a year and has only been open for 2 months so we were delighted with being at a less than busy hotel.  The positives about this hotel are it's location 30 minutes from the airport and a sort ride in the daily shuttle bus into marrakech. The hotel is decorated tastefully mixing tradition with modern. The reception area is so welcoming with the inviting view of the gardens and pool area. With the choice of many restaurants and bars visitors are spoilt for choice. The food is varied and tasteful with the unlimited  drinks available from morning until 11pm.  Our bedroom overlooked the beautiful pool which provides areas for swimming relaxing or a special pool for the kids. There are ample sun beds available where you can people watch as they play pool games or enjoy a morning workout. There is a small fully equipped gym for the real fitness fanatics.  Our bedroom for larger than I expected with a separate lounge area bedroom and fully equipped bathroom. There was also a fridge to keep that cold drinks  TV and telephone 2 balconies and air conditioning in the lounge area plenty of storage and a mini safe. The nightly entertainment was great especially the Moroccan night. The staff were all pleasant and welcoming especially the entertainment team.  Had a fantastic few hours in the lovely spa.    To improve and be even better in the future I would suggest the following;  1. The reception staff need to meet and greet visitors perhaps with a drink and a speedier service to their rooms.  2. There needs to be an information board in reception and by the pool bar of daily events/entertainment.  3. A bureau de change in reception or cash machine.  4. The prices of name brand items in the shop (e.g. sun cream) needs to be similar street prices as sun cream is wholly overpriced.  5. On site trip organisers should give more detailed explanation and prices not included in trips (waterfalls trip does not include price of boat accurate time it takes to get there and difficulties for people with walking/health problems).  6. Food needs to be labelled more clearly for allergies and dietry needs.  7. Rooms should be equipped with tea/coffee facilities and an iron.  8. The closing time of the main bar should be 12 midnight as stated on hotel brochures as most nights it closed at 11pm.  9. Regular cleaning of pool side toilets in particular mens toilets which contained swarms of filter flies everywhere. Strip curtains would resolve problem together with regular cleaning.  10. Improve pathway lighting to apartment rooms around the back of the pool area.    With the above improvements I would give this a 5 star rating.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/453JoH
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Sha-John wrote a review Aug 2019,50,No disappointment at all!,Excellent place to stay considering this hotel complex has only just reopened after a refurbishment it is really well run staff are really helpful and nothing is too much trouble.  Management team know they're stuff everything is run so smoothly and they never pass you by always stop to say hello or ask if everything's ok!  The animation team are fantastic Hassan and the rest really know how to get the party started and work really hard from morning til night the shows they put on of an evening are the best we have come across in any hotel we've stayed in!  The rooms/suites are beautiful decorated in an authentic Morroccon theme. Beds are comfortable and each suite has a TV air con mini fridge safe with complimentary bottle of water and shower products. Rooms are in traditional Ryads with each Ryad housing 20 rooms the rooms surround a small courtyard with fountains in and climbing trees.  The food is also excellent breakfast lunch afternoon snacks and dinner. We stayed on an all inclusive basis and was spoiled for choice! Food from a variety of countries was made while you waited therefore it was fresh and hot other food was pre prepared but was still hot and just as fresh. Salads meats pastries cheeses bread cakes and freshly prepared fruit were all available in abundance. There is a pizza counter with freshly made pizza while you watched the chef prepare it from scratch! A variety of drinks are available with throughout the day so you need never be thirsty!  The facilities are also excellent the pool is huge with a small children's pool and another pool that water polo and other games are played in table tennis boules darts and football are among other entertainment available.  Everyone from the chamber maids the porters waiters and so on helped make our stay the perfect week it turned out to be we would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a holiday in Marrakech!,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sha-John1969
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,mariajdickson wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Fantastic Stay!,Just come back from a week in Marrakech. I went last year and the hotel I went to then put me off Morocco completely but this hotel makes me want to come back again and again! They have a few teething problems but that‚Äôs expected considering it‚Äôs only just been taken over by Ona    Upon arrival a man was there waiting to take my suitcases so I could check in. The reception is absolutely beautiful it gives such a Moroccan vibe but it also still quite modern. There is a language barrier so it does help if you can speak a little bit of French. They gave me my wristband and said ‚Äúeat lunch and come back for your room‚Äù so not a very clearly indication of when I should return but I ate lunch went back to reception and they said ‚Äúno not yet 10 more minutes‚Äù so I walk around having a look around the hotel grounds which are all STUNNING! Went back after 10 minutes and they said ‚Äú5 more minutes‚Äù it took them an hour to check me in eventually.    When I was given my room key one of the bell boys offered to show me to my room I wanted to carry my suitcases myself and because of that he wouldn‚Äôt take me to my room just spoke to me in French some very unclear directions. So I‚Äôm walking around with no idea where to go and another bell boy comes along loads my suitcases on the trolley and takes me all the way to my hotel room.    The rooms are stunning spacious and really follow through with having a Moroccan theme. However the beds are rather uncomfortable there are ants all over the balcony and the cleaners never gave me a new bottle of water the whole week I was there. They do provide you little bottles of toiletries that are replenished every day which is lovely and they have a mini fridge with a freezer which is handy to freeze a water bottle in that heat. Only thing I‚Äôd say the rooms are really missing is a tea/coffee making facility and a full length mirror other than that the room was great!    The pool was absolutely beautiful!! I‚Äôve never seen a pool so big before! They also had a smaller pool for activities and a kids pool with a life guard always posted. The big pool ranged from 1.3meters to 1.8m deep which was amazing! It wasn‚Äôt too cold but then again it was 40¬∞c so the pool was a relief to get in. It was clean and amazing! Couldn‚Äôt fault it. The sunloungers were amazing and I was lucky enough to have the double bed loungers for the majority of my time there they‚Äôre so comfortable and you can easily fall asleep just again though there are ants EVERYWHERE and they do bite too but that‚Äôs not the fault of the hotel just a heads up.    Food was lovely I‚Äôm a fussy eater but I found myself trying loads of new things whether that be because there was no labels on the food or because I felt adventurous but im glad I tried it anyway. However be aware that they use their water in a lot of their foods/drinks you will most likely end up with a bad stomach during your holiday but I found that with the hotel i stayed in last year too bad stomachs are just inevitable when you visit Morocco.    The hotel shop is a rip off so avoid buying anything from there because your money will disappear so quickly. The hotel do a free shuttle bus to Marrakech which is great but go in a big group because it can be quite intimidating.    Entertainment is fantastic always something different every night they even brought in camels and horses that you could ride at the end!!!    Drinks are brilliant highly recommend the San Francisco cocktail met a group whilst I was out there and by the end of the holiday we were all drinking it! Ali is a lovely bartender! All the entertainment staff are excellent! It‚Äôs been amazing!    I‚Äôd happily stay here again it was a fantastic stay and my first ever solo holiday this has made me so much more confident about going away on my own again!,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariajdickson
Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Jessica wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Overall we had a great time on our first holiday together,Loved the hotel (just had a phew snags)    We booked through on the beach because the hotel looked amazing offered many restaurants was all inclusive and had the authentic Moroccan look. I would say 90% of the time we stayed there was great just a phew things unfortunately that let it down.    We arrived into Marrakesh airport for our holiday at the end of July 2019 with them having a closed currency we decided not to get our pounds exchanged at the airport and just do it at the hotel (as on the description of this holiday on On The Beach says they have currency exchange there). They do not. In fact when we arrived at the hotel they asked for us to pay the tax at the reception. We explained we needed to exchange our money first to which we were informed that the currency exchange at the hotel had ‚Äònot actually been built yet‚Äô. We had to pay on our card ‚Äì but don‚Äôt worry it only works out to be around ¬£20 for staying there for a week. We straight away struggled with the language barrier as there was only one man on reception at the late time of night we arrived which did not understand much English.    Once taken to our room we were given two single beds after booking one double bed. The bellhop pushed the beds together and made the bed in front of us we were absolutely exhausted so decided not to ask for a proper double bed as we just wanted sleep.    The next day we went and found a man fluent in English at the desk as the majority of people behind there only speak French making it incredibly difficult to ask them any questions. We were told the nearest place to exchange our money was the middle of Marrakech which we could get a free shuttle bus to there and back to the hotel which was fine. (Just a pain as if we had known we would have exchanged it at the airport)    The hotel was beautiful the riads were spacious and extremely clean. The gardens were so well kept with gardeners working all throughout the day to keep the flowers and grass looking immaculate. The hotel room itself was air conditioned cleaned daily and had that Moroccan vibe with the d√©cor.    The pool is absolutely huge with lots of sunbeds. There is a cocktail bar which is great and they do activities around the pool everyday. We particularly enjoyed the aqua aerobics which unfortunately we didn‚Äôt understand much of as they were mostly taught in French. They do also enjoy taking your drinks away from your sunbeds when you haven‚Äôt actually finished them‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..    The restaurants all inclusive include a buffet breakfast with lunch and dinner. The description on On The Beach offered also a Tapas restaurant and a Moroccan restaurant. The Tapas restaurant was completely empty every night so we weren‚Äôt sure if it was actually open or not. As for the Moroccan restaurant yep you‚Äôve guessed it ‚Äì hadn‚Äôt actually been built yet.  The buffet food was lovely however we did have a few problems. My boyfriend is a huge meat eater and was able to eat everything under the sun (not knowing what he was actually eating as there were no descriptions to any of the food) at breakfast lunch and dinner. I myself am a vegetarian and REALLY struggled for the start of the holiday. I started off guessing what looked vegetarian but all I was eating was salad and bread. I tried to ask the chefs at the cooking stations but none of them spoke English nor did the waiters which I tried to tell of my dietary requirements. The language barrier was quite difficult. So I decided the next day to learn some French phrases and luckily they worked. I told the chefs and waiters I was a vegetarian in French and straight away they were showing me all the things I could now eat. They even made me my own veggie pizza‚Äôs and pasta‚Äôs I was really happy about all this after all the money we had paid to be all inclusive! Some of the waiters will fetch you cocktails from the bar (only if you tip them) if not all the alcohol you have to choose from is red or white wine‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Look out for Ali as he was great and brought us beer and cocktails most nights.    We did 3 excursions through the hotel which we would HIGHLY recommend. Camel riding quad biking and horse riding in the desert. We had the best time and will have these memories for a lifetime. The excursions are priced well and often give you a drink and snack while you are there along with perfect photo opportunities.    All in all we would say we had an amazing holiday here as a couple and would definitely recommend the hotel.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Lucy A wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Would recommend!,A week away in the Moroccan sun with my mother in a gorgeous newly-renovated hotel. Staff all friendly and most could understand English. Rooms were beautiful and kept clean as was the entire site - very impressed! Pool was enormous and plenty of sun beds and excellent lifeguards keeping watch over the children (though limited number of fixed umbrellas). Pool snack bar was fine - cold chips and chicken/ burgers and limited salads so most people ate in the buffet restaurant at lunch times. Food was good in the ‚ÄòMedina‚Äô buffet restaurant with plenty of options including multiple daily tagines; would have been nice to have labels on the dishes (ie. meat/ fish) - however plenty of staff to ask. Entertainment was mixed - although Animation team were lovely evening shows were ok (some better than others!). Alcoholic drinks were ok on all inclusive; understandable as a generally a non-drinking country. Free shuttle bus into Marrakech at certain times of the day (we had problems with the pick up as they had double booked the bus so sent us in a private taxi to the wrong drop off place; ended up getting a taxi back to hotel as well however we were assured this would never happen again to us or any other guests). Make sure you know that the pickup is from the Place de Liberte roundabout - the shuttle worked well on our second trip into the city. Hamam Marrakech at the Spa was lovely - would recommend the treatments here.    Overall would highly recommend Ona Marrakech for a great break in the sun!,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyaG3768NY

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Jess A wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Great hotel/Amazing Staff/Fab holiday for my mums 70th Bday,Well what can I say arrived at this hotel around 9:45pm greeted by bell boy who was great as were the reception staff. We got an upgrade to our room for my mum's 70th birthday which was lovely. Restaurant was still open for dinner which was wonderful. We met Faska who was brilliant every day chatting about our day and generally being great always happy. Rachid and Salou for breakfast and lunch were great interested in talking to us. We meet with Alba what can I say an absolute amazing lady she personally took us to our room and when we got there there was champagne a card and nibbles for my mum. The Entertainment team were great in particular Hassan Nawala and Ily they sat with us and other guests at lunch and dinner and interacted with all which was quite different to most hotels it added that extra touch. Abul the lifeguard was great too. All in all this hotel has been newly refurbished and you won't be disappointed very clean very friendly staff no-ones too busy to chat give you advice where to go etc. The free shuttle bus from the hotel to the Medina is good if you like shopping or just want to get out. Me my mum and sister would like to thank you for a wonderful holiday in particular Alba thank you so much for your hospitality and nothing was ever too much for you which we are grateful for you're the best. Sofia in the Spa absolutely amazing the spa was very relaxing and the ladies were excellent.

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Jemima wrote a review Jul 2019,50,The Best Place to Stay in Marrakech,This place is honestly the only place to stay when in Marrakech! Newly refurbished it‚Äôs decor throughout is beautiful! When we first came into the foyer we were warmly welcomed and escorted to our room (which was absolutely beautiful). Every single hotel staff were more than lovely going above and beyond throughout our week-long stay. The animation officers(?) (the entertainment people) did their job and so much more! They made us feel so welcomed and comfortable providing with high octane activities everyday. The daily activities were so enjoyable I probably exercised more on the holiday than I do on a regular basis üòÇ. The evening entertainment never failed to bring joy! The first and last nights we were there there were camels and horses we could ride! Each night was different and so fun! I particularly enjoyed the dance showcase the animation officers did! There is nothing I would negatively say about this place- even the food was amazing especially for very particular eaters like myself and my friends! I couldn‚Äôt recommend this place any higher!!

Marrakech Ryads Parc & Spa,Shaheda wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Fantastic accomodation,We stayed at the hotel for a family holiday. The family suite was brilliantly decorated. The food was out of this world with so many options to choose from. The staff were so friendly and courteous. One of our air conditioning units stopped working after midnight and as soon as we phoned reception a technician arrived within minutes and fixed it. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff at this resort.  The pool facilities were superb along with the activities arranged by staff.  The live entertainment each night was really good too. Some of this included snake charmers many types of dance even fire breathers and live camel rides.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who comes to Marrakech. The views surrounding the hotel were breathtaking. This hotel is really good for city dwellers who want a calm and peaceful break in natural Moroccan surroundings.  One of the managers of the hotel Yassin greeted us on arrival and provided us with fresh orange juice after our journey from the airport.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaheda2009
