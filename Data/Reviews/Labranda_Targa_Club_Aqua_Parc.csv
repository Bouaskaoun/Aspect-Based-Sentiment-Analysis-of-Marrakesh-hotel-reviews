Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kaitlan J wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Wow!,We have just returned from a week stay with you and WOW - we had the BEST time!    When seeing a couple of reviews being negative my expectations were not very high; my experience exceeded the expectations!    Firstly the food - it was amazing! It was great to try some traditional Moroccan dishes along with more plain dishes available too if you were more fussy. At breakfast the chefs made omelettes and pancakes in front of you and at lunch time and dinner the pasta was made in front of you too! There was a wide range of food available and the desserts were beautiful!    The hotel room - these were exceptionally clean and spacious. They were cleaned daily with the bed made and towels replenished. Thank goodness for air conditioning- it was hot!!    The staff are what made our holiday SO incredible. They are all so friendly happy and like to get you involved. A special mention to Ben & Abdul who always came to see me and my partner throughout the day and got us involved in activities throughout the day and evening. The madison dancing was super fun along with the aqua fitness classes in the pool.    We were lucky to be there when they were celebrating Moroccan day with a range of entertainers - we were so lucky to experience.    To all the staff at Labranda - thank you so much for taking such good care of us! We are already looking at returning üôÇ,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983kaitlanj
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,evishalee wrote a review Yesterday,50,Make up your own mind,I am going to write this review having read previous reviews but not jump on the negative band wagon.  We arrived after a delay to a smooth check in. We were told to head straight to the restaurant as it was to close at 9.30pm. In fact it stayed open later to allow us to eat and the dishes were still being replenished. The food was plentiful and varied with lovely salads tagines pizza pasta and lots of different desserts. We could get beer wine and bottled water. In fact I have never known a resort to offer free water at all times. Very Good. The labels were in French but as we were in Morocco I realised English is not their language. My school girl French and Google translate helped!  Breakfast the next morning was just as good fresh omelettes and pancakes plus the usual AI offerings.  The bars are good and a menu lets you know what‚Äôs on offer. The Cosy bar has plenty of space and even an outside terrace. In fact you could get more tables and chairs in. We tried a cocktail in the Sports bar (worked out about ¬£6.50). Very lovely and came with nuts and canap√©s which we were not expecting. Some drinks from the Coco bar were half full but this was usually when it was busy and they were trying to get through a long line.  The rooms are plenty big enough we had a pool view double which had a sofa in it. The bathrooms were a good size and the shower was one of the best I have had hot and powerful. I slept very well in the beds and my husband who suffers with neck and back problems had no complaints.  The pools were amazing even though we didn‚Äôt try the main pool or slides everyone looked like they were having fun. There is loud music but you can easily find quieter areas. We used the adult only pool which was very relaxing and the cold water was invigorating helped to cool us down.  We had no problems with any of the staff finding them helpful and attentive.  We highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to return. If you expect what you pay for then you will not be disappointed.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,G Hamp wrote a review Yesterday,40,Couples and Families retreat,We are a couple and have enjoyed our experience so far lovely pools a separate kids pool with flumes which has a gap but next to the other big pool the other pool has afternoon activities if you wish to participate there is also a separate small quite pool away from everything which is adult only.  We are in a square courtyard on the upper level with a balcony this is private and looks onto a grass area this is comfortable and clean.  Mini fridge t.v and all the other essentials needed including a hairdryer this is cleaned and serviced daily.  Restaurant has a buffet style cold platters and hot food mostly vegetables fish and a meat dishes each night but you can get freshly made pizza and fries deserts have a nice selection and you also have lovely fresh juices to choose from carrot tomato beetroot rosemary mint etc  The same at lunch and breakfast has hot and cold selection also.  We have booked at massage at the spa next week I'm sure that will be lovely!  Nights have entertainment from 9 two indoor bars a pool side bar during the day you have some cocktails included in all inclusive as well as wine beer and soft drinks.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,nick d wrote a review Mar 23,50,Unbelievable!,Can't believe the picky reviews. This was an all-inclusive cheapie that exceeded expectations in all areas. If you want five star put your hand in your pocket.    The hotel was clean and modern the room was huge and comfy and the measures were generous.    The pool seemed noisy when we arrived but was pleased to learn that there was a calm pool too which was perfect.    The staff really looked after us. The bus into the old city is free if you book it the day before and the hotel also run other excursions and will organise taxis for you. I needed to visit the infirmary in the morning and by 2.00 they'd organised for a doctor to visit and had taken me to the pharmacy. Holiday rescued.    The most stress I experienced all week was realising that I'd had the last of the incredible lamb meatball and egg tagine with cous cous. There was a fresh pizza and pasta station and about 4 or 5 different tagines a massive array of salad stuff every lunchtime and evening and a proper variety for breakfast. There's a two and a half hour window for each meal so never any need to rush.    We're going back. Possibly in September. The holiday was a real tonic. We've vacationed all over the world but this one stands out in terms of value and service. Massive thank you to all the staff.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,southampton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332nickd
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Terri G wrote a review Mar 23,30,Great hotel but.....,We have just returned from a weeks stay at this hotel.  The hotel itself is beautiful great grounds and immaculate gardens.  The staff are lovely.  But....  The food was lukewarm at best. We had to take advantage of the microwave they had on offer. Surly having to microwave your food immediately after plating it up isn't good.  Reheating chicken and rice is a no no in any country.  90% of the crockery was chipped or cracked.  There is also the option of a pizza and pasta bar. So you'd think if you chose to eat from there it would be hot or at least warmer than the food that is in the serving chafing dish.  I saw on 2 different nights the server adding into a pan of already cooked carbonara extra cooked spaghetti a glug of cream milk and a pinch of seasoning a quick stir then served to my plate. The pan did not touch the heat! Needless to say another cold meal.    Not once in all 3 meals of all 7 days did we have a hot meal. Thank god for the microwave.  The drinks were good rum gin whiskey and vodka. Beer and soft drinks all on offer. But unfortunately they will only serve you 2 drinks to each person at any one time.  Our holiday group was 3 people for one person to go to the bar we had to either go as a 2 or take the 2 drinks and re join the queue to receive our 3rd drink. Each time we told the bar tenders the 3 drinks were for 3 people yet we were limited to 2 only.  The bars close strictly at 11pm even if you are queueing before 11pm you'll not be served.    I don't want this review to sound negative it was a great week.    Things I wished I'd have known before going:  - You need cash at this hotel.  - If you want to exchange money to Dirham you can only do it with cash  - There isn't an ATM on site  - If you want to buy drinks that are not on offer with the all inclusive you need preferably cash or you have to go to reception with the bar tender and pay for your drinks with them first then return to the bar to get your drinks  -The shop on site does except card and cash    Other positives are:  Freshly cooked omelette and pancakes for breakfast  Fresh bread  Beautiful desserts  Very clean hotel and rooms  Water slides are great fun  Free shuttle bus into Marrakesh    All in all we had a lovely week its just a shame about the food.  We now understand why so many of the guests were ordering in KFC.  Unfortunately it's not an area where you can walk around. You literally need to stay on complex.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9393EOterrig
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,louisemunday wrote a review Mar 21,30,Pricey holiday; sadly a lot missing.,I paid a lot of money for this all inclusive holiday and whilst the rooms themselves are lovely and the hotel looks great and the pool areas are clean and pretty there was sadly a lot missing.    1. The air con was not working in any room despite it being 36 degrees ‚Ä¶ this package is sold with air con in rooms?! We asked the reception and they told us they wouldn‚Äôt be turning it on due to it being March. It was sweltering and we could not sleep. Couldn‚Äôt leave windows open either because of the bugs. Made for a very uncomfortable night every night which didn‚Äôt go well with the solid hard beds.  2. We were sat outside the bar area most evenings playing cards when out of nowhere all of the external lights would go out without warning. This would be mid card game. No communication nothing to say that would happen just lights out and doors locked. The lack of communication is rude - at least give us chance to prepare!  3. A lot of the drinks machines were not working around the hotel specifically in the main restaurant. They were out of order but no signs to say this. Broken the entire time of my stay.  4. There is a ‚Äò2 drink per person‚Äô rule for the all inclusive alcohol drinks which is fair but this isn‚Äôt stated anywhere and staff were sometimes rude about this if you‚Äôre in a large group. In addition to this the whole entire resort only serves the same 4 spirits - whiskey rum gin and vodka. The drinks menu (especially cocktails) is poor and lacks options. The ‚Äòbars‚Äô are tiny. Also we received a lot of half cups of drinks.  5. On two occasions there were no plates available at 1:30 for lunch. This led to a large crowd standing round the main restaurant area with no direction or explanation - just stood waiting for 20 minutes.  6. My transfer was 45 minutes early with no obvious badges to show who he was or that he was there to collect me. Just a man sat on a bench outside the hotel. As a solo traveller this made me feel slightly uneasy.  7. We had to ask for activities to be done around the pool during the day there didn‚Äôt appear to be any set pool activities as described on the signs at the entertainment board.  8. The food on offer for meal times is Samey. The tagines and salad were lovely and the bread is always fresh. But the rest was the same all the time and again for a pricey all inclusive I expected more choice.    The hotel is clean and pretty. The weather we had was great. The upkeep and maintenance they are clearly on top of. However there are a lot of faults and a lot of things missing. For the high price I paid given it‚Äôs March so not particularly the best season it was not worth it and I expected more. (I have been to other all inclusives paid less and been delighted in what they have to offer). I wont be coming back I can get better value for money elsewhere.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisemunday

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sarah T wrote a review Mar 15,10,Avoid at all cost,I wish I listened to the bad reviews. The service from the hotel is shocking. It was 30 degrees hot and no rooms had air condition as they only provide heating services at this time of the year as I was told by reception. Very rude & unhelpful receptionists. Food is awful I have never been so hungry on a holiday and could not wait to get back home. Kids club was not opened I went to the reception over 5 times over 2 days before it was opened. Plates are chipped & some are dirty serving dishes have rust on them.  Only positive is the rooms are cleaned by the lovely cleaners,Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahtV2662NQ
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Pauline130764 wrote a review Mar 15,40,In the main a good holiday & value for money,I was a little apprehensive having read some not so good reviews & not being an all inclusive fan based on that I'm pleased to say it exceeded my expectations just a couple of negative points i could find more complaints but I'm a great believer in you get what you pay for. This is value for money in my opinion.  Accommodation: we stayed in a standard room inside the hotel reasonably comfortable cleaned & fresh towels daily great shower. The corridor carpet is pretty old/stained but not going to affect your stay.  Reception the regular daily guy on reception is professional & helpful. You can also exchange money here.  Food: I can not fault the food offer available i really think this does depend on how fussy you are. So much choice & beautifully presented. The only complaint i have is the drinks machines which were not all always working & therefore would need filling up more often which caused long queues. The staff are plenty & are happy to help when asked.  Onsite Moroccan restaurant basically the only plus is different surroundings & table service otherwise food offer is the same.  Pool areas: lovely clean plenty of beds. Water cold but no different to anywhere else this time of year & still plenty of people using it. Main pool: Small amount of entertainment/games going on music played throughout the day rather loud but quieter areas available. Good atmosphere.  Bars/Drinks: being a wine drinker thought the rose was great my friend said vodka was good the Marrakech cocktail was a winner with friends too.  The evening bar: Didn't find the staff very friendly. Bar closes at 11pm which is ok but outside lighting is switched off too this is rather early when on holiday. Very little entertainment usually held in the conference room bit odd?  There is a bus into town (20/30 mins) has to be booked 24 hours in advance (go before breakfast)You can also book a taxi for both ways (140 Dirham- ¬£12) There is nothing walking distance outside of the hotel.  Excursions: Bookable at the hotel be sure you know what you are getting. Check the written prices. If you have excursions included in your booking that don't have transfers be sure the taxi you book is clear where you are going & you locate your guide before he leaves!  Manager note: Special thanks to our cleaner (room 1247) didn't get name. Fabulous!  & to Badrddine in the canteen so helpful & the lovely staff at the pool bar during the day.  Better organisation needed in canteen for replenishing crockery & cutlery & filling drinks machines.  Customer note: Treat staff with respect. The staff are very helpful you only have to ask.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Burnham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pauline130764
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,rosieebee wrote a review Mar 12,10,Dreadful,After reading bad reviews on this hotel prior to visiting we were very sceptical but it lived up to these reviews. We must say though the staff snd cleanliness of bedrooms no problem. Food well that is another matter it was awful. Never been to a hotel where there is a microwave to warm up your food as it is lukewarm. Chipped plates by the plentiful. Loads of reviews about chipped plates but obviously nothing had been done . Fresh pizza handed to you by hands no gloves not very hygienic. Speaking to lots of people round the hotel they were in agreement about the food. After reading the 5 star reviews i am convinced it must of been family members.I I ask the manager not to reply to this review as obviously he says all the right things but does not do anything about it. Stay clear of this hotel. My problem was I should of read the reviews before booking. Also towels a lovely dirty grey ugh,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosieebee

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Alan wrote a review Mar 10,40,Good hotel complex prividing excellent value for money,Great hotel complex with beautiful quiet area around the 'calm pool'. We had a room overlooking this pool & it was perfect - very clean brilliant shower & mostly quiet. Buffet meals with plenty of choice so we usually found something to our liking. Lots of delicious fresh fruit for dessert. There were a couple of isues with the coffee machines but freshly made mint tea was on offer as an alternative with or without sugar. We booked a Hamman incuding scrub followed by a massage. Both excellently provided by skilled Spa staff. Generally friendly staff. We hope people are not put off by some of the reviews - there are some things to improve they are minor but the hotel offers great value for money.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6174DSalanh
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Melissa M wrote a review Mar 6,50,Great hotel with amazing staff and facilities,I just got back from a 3 night mini holiday in this hotel last week. We were there from Saturday 25th - Tuesday 28th of February and I had the best time ever! I have no complaints whatsoever and cannot believe some of the bad reviews I read before I went so please do not be put off by them. People will always find a way to complain about something and overrexaggerate!    Firstly the staff were amazing and could not be more nice helpful and attentive. They honestly can't do enough for you.    The lovely bar man Yousef made our holiday with his humour and funny dances. He was also the best at making drinks!    Achraf was also a pleasure always happy smiling and very attentive.    I also want to give a very special mention to Jihane (JJ) from the sports bar. She really went over and above for me by going out of her way to try and find a channel for me to watch the football. They didn't have the channel but she tried her best to get it for me. She is also the best at making cocktails! She makes an amazing Margarita and Mojito that comes with nibbles every time you order one. (Olives and 2 different types of nuts). This is not part of the all inclusive you pay for these cocktails however they are very reasonably priced much cheaper than cocktails back home and definitely worth it! I also would like to mention Abdul who was also very welcoming and attentive.    Khalid was also a big part of our stay. He was the entertainer trying to get everyone involved in dance classes and activities within the hotel. He made the holiday so much fun!    I'd also like to mention Hicham & Mustapha for helping us at dinner time and making sure I had plenty of water bottles for the room!    There are 2 restaurants in this hotel a standard buffet restaurant and a Morrocan cuisine that you need to book. We didn't get to try the Morrocan one we only tried the other one. I didn't know what to expect with the food because of the reviews but all of 4 of us were happy with the food as there is something for everyone even if you are fussy and don't like their traditional food. They have lots of selection such a pizza pasta chips a salad bar selection of meats fish seafood etc. The pizzas were my favourite they were so nice! Definitely recommend.    The all inclusive drinks menu was also decent as you had plenty of selection from wines beers spirits and cocktails.    This hotel also has a spa that is beautiful and smells amazing. I would recommend getting treatments while you are there as they are so reasonably priced. We got 2 treatments which came to like ¬£44 in our money. We got the hamman (their equivalent to a turkish bath) and a full body massage. There is also a beautiful indoor pool in a candlelit area you can use in between treatments.    Unfortunately we didn't get to use the water park facilities as the weather was a bit up and down so the water would have been too cold but the slides looked fun!    The rooms were clean big and spacious with air con and a view of the pool area. The shower was great and the beds were comfortable enough even though a lot of the reviews say they weren't!    The entertainment was great during the day and at night. The first night we arrived we had such a good time in the main bar dancing with everyone. Everyone seems to get involved and have a laugh! Then there was another room everyone went into to dance at night when the bar shut what a laugh that was! During the day at the poolside there was always music playing and then dance classes outside later. I had read a review that all the entertainment was in Arabic & French which is completely not true.    Met so many lovely people on holiday and everyone I spoke to enjoyed their stay at this hotel and would come back. This hotel does not get the credit it's due! I would definitely recommend it and go back. It's such a beautiful hotel with lovely staff and plenty to do that you don't even need to step outside the hotel. Only downfall is that the bar shuts at 11pm but other than that no complaints!    Thank you to all the staff at Labranda Targa that made our holiday one to remember!

Our room was lovely and clean and very spacious with a fridge and amazing blackout curtains. Ha ha. Waking up not knowing if it was morning or night.  The pools were very cold but I think this is to be expected at this time of year.  Food was fine but if you are fussy you may struggle but you can get fresh pasta and pizzas.  Drinks were good too‚Ä¶I‚Äôve had lot worse on all inclusive holidays.  We had a lovely relaxing break and wouldn‚Äôt listen to all of the negative reviews.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Paulifer wrote a review Mar 2,50,A simple getaway to recharge ahead of a heavy season of wedding photography.,The facilities here are fabulous. The water was cool but we went at a time of year where the sun was not too hot so it's to be expected. The food was varied with some dishes served regularly so you could always find something you wanted to eat. The pizza and pasta bar are fabulous.    Every member of staff treats you like you own the hotel a fantastic bunch of people and a delight to interact with.    I can't think of a better place to be to experience Marrakech though make sure you book into that shuttle early to ensure a free trip into the city. When you go to the city be aware if you venture off the beaten path you WILL be led a merry dance by the locals who will then expect you to pay for it.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PauliferC
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Johnny A wrote a review Mar 1,40,Don‚Äôt believe all you read about this place,Before coming here I read the reviews and was really worried. Arriving here late in the evening my fears were eased.    First of the staff who work here are extremely kind and helpful and go out of their way. They work very hard.  Second the room we had was spacious and clean the hotel in general is clean to a good standard.    The food was ok if you are a fussy eater then you may struggle however there was always plenty of vegetables salad fruit and tagine.    The pools are cold but that seems a common theme in most North African tourist destinations and did not in anyway spoil our holiday.    The hotel is out of the way however you can use the shuttle bus provided by the hotel. This does not prevent you from seeing the sights and we actually prefer to be out of the hustle and bustle.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,DaphneDornelles wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Good but not great,Let's start with the good things about the hotel:  - As many bottles of water from breakfast till 11pm  - Pizza on demand was absolutely lovely.  - The free transport to the medinas was really nice  - Breakfast omelets and pancakes are lovely.  - Nice Moroccan restaurant ALTHOUGH you can only go ONCE. Even if you are staying for 7 10 15 nights.  - Shower is great    The bad things:  - The pool is FREEZING COLD  - They turn off the slides for almost 3 HOURS for lunch. It is heartbreaking to watch the kids waiting  - The food is very cold. There is even a microwave next to it  - Most staff is not very friendly  - The manager is VERY RUDE. We saw him being very rude to a woman complaining in a very nice way about the food being cold and he was laughing at her and asking her to go show him because he didn't believe her. We interrupted him and said he agreed with him and he just changed the attitude after my husband said something (I've never seen anything like that).  - They won't give you any water or food if your check in is after the restaurant hours. Our flight was delayed and I message them asking if we could get any sandwich or some fruit when we arrive. They never replied and said no for water.  - The music they plain is the same 10 songs on repeat. Get ready.  - The bed is really hard.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,squareofaninch wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Nice hotel about 15 minutes from the centre,Lovely hotel could just do with some tweaking. Lovely pools but too cold to swim in. Maybe one could be heated. No evening entertainment except football on the tv's in the bars. Could maybe have a bit of music playing. Food was lovely although it was a bit repetitive. The shuttle bus is great but you have to book on the day before. It was a shame some people took the all inclusive to the extreme and we saw some really bad behaviour from some brits drinking way too much and getting violent or urinating in the bar area. Although that isn't the hotel's fault they should stop serving people when they are obviously drunk. Overall a nice stay.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squareofaninch

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,MalteseNomad87 wrote a review Feb 2023,20,Not a 4 star quality! Very far from centre and not suitable for English speaking travellers.,I spent a week as a solo traveller at this resort. Late arrival at hotel and the night receptionist was extremely nice and polite at check in and explained everything to me. I asked for a coffee as I arrived very late and although everything was closed the duty manager took me to the restaurant for me to grab a coffee and something to eat which was very nice of them.    However the service deteriorated after that - different staff at reception so rude and no assistance found when asking them a question its like they dont wanna be working. The buffet service was ok dinner was better. The breakfast had very limited option and alot of pastries similiar to continental style and nothing cooked. Anything traditional Moroccan was really good but other western style food was uneatable - especially the pasta which was overcooked. They had a pizza section cooked on the spot by a pizzaiolo and tried it a few times which was good. There was no option for anyone who has dietry requirements so this would be a big issue for those who are gluten free as evrything they had involved gluten. However my main issue was the labels in french so had to ask the chef to translate which he did. The restaurant manager had no communication skills and everytime you ask him a question about the food he has no idea what hit him (metaphorically) or he doesnt reply. I met alot of local Moroccans who are extremely nice and definetly it‚Äôs not a culture thing.    The rooms where quite spacious and clean although they all are seperated into seperate blocks. However very noisy residents drunk and making parties till 04;00am which made it a challenge sleeping. I did not find the all inclusive option worth it considering the beverages are not good quality and not much choice. The location is far from the centre so you need about 20euros each way to go - and due to it being in a residential area unless you plan to stay stuck in the resort then i suggest to choose an alternative place more central. All in fairness I would visit Marrakech again but will opt in to stay in a different hotel.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalteseNomad87
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sophie wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Worst holiday!,We arrived and had a quick check in which is the only one good review I can give about the place.    Room/cleaners - The bed was the worst thing we have ever slept on. I think it would of been more comfortable sleeping on the floor.  The cleaners - they will knock on your room door and before you even get chance to open the door they are opening it and letting themselves in. So I just hope for anyone else that you are not in the middle of getting changed or in the shower as you will have a shock.    Pools - We didnt even go in the pool. The water was like an ice bath.    Food - worst food at an all inclusive we have ever experienced. Dont expect anything to be hot. Its all lukewarm....but don't worry as there is a microwave to heat your food.  If you are taking children then be warned as there is pretty much nothing for them to eat unless your happy for your child/children to live off chips for lunch and pizza or pasta for dinner (which both tatse disgusting)  I even witnessed the man cooking the pasta cleaning the utensils to serve the food in the pasta water which was cooking the pasta!!!    Cocktails - all taste the same and gave us all upset belly.    Area - nothing around to do unless you want to pay out to do an excursion. We went to the old city market which lets just say was an experience.    This is not a 4 star hotel. We would say a low 3 star.  We will not be visiting again.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daydream56539858147
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ellis Syer wrote a review Feb 2023,40,A great holiday!,Pros - Hotel was extremely clean and staff very friendly. Delicious Moroccan food and afternoon snack bar was a great hit. Pizza and pasta bar in the restaurant were very popular! Good choice of drinks including a variety of cocktails. I would strongly recommend getting the free shuttle bus to the souks and doing an excursion to see Marrakesh at night (can book via the hotel) - a fantastic experience and unforgettable dinner in a famous Moroccan restaurant surrounded by belly dances and live singers followed by horse and carriage through the old town. There is a Moroccan a la carte restaurant at the hotel which was lovely but food was very similar to the main restaurant. Moroccan day on Thursdays when market stools set up in the hotel and the restaurant put on themed food.    Cons - Quite limited food choices and food signs not in English. Lots of bees around attracted to every drink. Swimming pools freezing cold which was a real shame. Very little evening entertainment mainly karaoke which isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs choice. There was a theatre room set up but not used.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellissyer

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ashlea1996 wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Food poisoning galore,One of the worst experiences I‚Äôve ever had    We arrived on the 6th February and was told they had prepared food for us as late arrivals we went downstairs and there was cold pasta left over cheese salad and some deli meat kinda thing. Me and my friend g happily ate this after our long journey.    However the next day I had extremely violent diarrhoea and felt so unwell my friend spoke to the nurse and got me some immudiom which stopped the diarrhoea however the stomach cramps was awful. Me and my friend went down for dinner and I thought I would tried some soup and bread to help my stomach which was the second biggest regret of my life because I threw everything back up and started having really bad diarrhoea again as I only had 5 immudiom tablets. My friend was also sick that night. I saw the nurse the next day and said I still feel unwell I still have diarrhoea and am vomiting now she said that they don‚Äôt have anything to help with vomiting and if I wanted to I could see a doctor which would cost me around ¬£50 just for a consultation. (I am a icu nurse in the U.K.) so I told her there would be no need and went back to bed. I spent almost of the holiday in bed with serve headache stomachache and just vomiting and diarrhoea.    I missed out on a excursion to the desert as at some points I could barely keep water down. I have never felt so unwell in my life.    My friend was speaking to other hotel guests and soon realised that a lot of other guests had been I‚Äôll aswell and I have just seen the last review.    Sundah was the only day where I was able to eat and did not vomit or have diarrhoea I did not eat anything at the hotel and ate out and I had no problems whatsoever. However on Monday our last day I decided to have lunch at the hotel which I later regretted as I began throwing up and having diarrhoea again. I had a flight later that day so went to speak to the nurse to see if I could get anything to stop me puking however I was told I would need to see the doctor.    My friend popped to the toilet at one point Monday before we went to leave and she had to comfort a small girl who was throwing up and then saw Atleast 3 other females also throwing up. So I believe there is a huge issue somewhere with there food.  To make matters worse my friend witness terrible food hygiene one cook licked there hand before making the dough.    However there was a hand full of staff that was amazing. Overall though I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you want to loose a few pounds.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ashlea1996

Arrived at 21.30pm to be told dinner was saved for us. After dropping bags we went down for food whereby waiters told us there was none left. There was a 5 minute gap from being told there was food left for us and then all the food being gone.  Rooms ok no balcony and not kettle in room.  Poolside was clean but swarmed with wasps.  Food terrible. Mostly cold even when fresh cooked chips were brought out. They must have been stood for at least 30 mins before being served. But dont worry you can warm it up in the microwave üëçPizza and bolognese for those not keen on Moroccan food.  Both my partner and I ended up with food poisoning on the 11th Feb.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Dawn C wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Positives and negatives - a fair review.,Positives:  Super clean everywhere all the time. The food is nice. We were a party of 6 adults all with very different tastes & needs and we all liked it especially the salads & the breakfasts (lunch choices tended to be better than those at dinner!). Lots of sunbeds. Staff mainly friendly & helpful. Free bus to and from the city. Nice big rooms and bathrooms. Power showers. Towels changed every day. Adults only pool if you wanted it. Generally a nice ambience. The price we paid.  Negatives:  Beds are very uncomfortable - I like a firm mattress but it was like sleeping (or not) on bricks. Drinks in disposable plastic (& paper) cups - fair enough round the pool but in the restaurant & bar at night it is truly ridiculous and really unacceptableespecially in the 'paid for' bar. A lot of the crockery is restaurant is chipped & damaged so choose it carefully. Turning all the lights off at 11pm when the bar shuts whether you were in the bar or sitting outside - effectively throwing folk out - is downright rude and we thought it was unnecessary and unacceptable. Pools are not heated so they are not usable the water is absolutely freezing. The location did not suit us as it is in the middle of nowhere in quite a rough area. We knew it was on the outskirts of the city but there is absolutely nowhere to walk to or to explore outside the hotel complex.  Overall a nice decent hotel that could be a great hotel with a bit more care.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sol S wrote a review Feb 2023,40,"Great hotel, had a lovely time!",The hotel was great. The weather was cold (being January - take warm clothes!) but the heating in the room made it lovely & cosy. The restaurant & pool areas were clean & well maintained & the pool bar served a good range of drinks.    The hotel staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.    We enjoyed the buffet but it wasn't very varied so meals became a bit same-y after a while. It would have been nice to be able to get snacks during the day so not quite all incusive.    We went on a couple of day trips - I'd recommend the camel/quad bike one but the waterfall trip was a long day and pretty underwhelming. Both were quite expensive.    There was no ATM in/near the hotel so make sure you take cash to change in the hotel or get money out at the airport. There's a shop in the hotel that sells ice creams snacks and gifts so you'll need cash there or if you venture out. There's a free shuttle to the city centre but we got a taxi which was reasonable and meant we could leave and come back when we wanted.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/924sols

In both two rooms there is no any sofa arm armchair. Only one very basic chair. There is no a kettle or hot water service or minibar. That means you cannot sit at your room and drink a coffee or tea as well. Area is very limited and there is very limited area to put your belongings    3.

I really enjoyed our 7 night stay for our anniversary. Staff were very attentive and polite and were always happy to help you.  The rooms and the hotel were cleaned to a high standard and everything was shining. The entertainment at night was a bit dated and more for children but I enjoyed it regardless. The food has plenty of choice and my favourite meal was breakfast. At dinner I enjoyed the Moroccan food the most. There is something for everybody and if you don‚Äôt like the food which I have seen in previous reviews it‚Äôs probably because of bland taste buds.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Martina R wrote a review Jan 2023,30,Ok-you get what you pay for,Arrival- a warm welcome at 10pm with some food waiting for us which was nice.    Room-very spacious as we were put in a family room  even though we were a couple. Very clean and always a hot shower. The improvement would be the heating as it was quite cold in January.    Staff- some are lovely and helpful. The cleaners reception Porter and security were always friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant staff weren‚Äôt always helpful or looked happy.    Food- in general quite cold glad there was a microwave. I am veggie and really struggled as they would put random bits of meat in the beans lentils sandwiches and most salads. There were a lot of other veggies struggling with this. One evening I asked for a veggie pasta nothing fancy just pasta and some sauce with no meat. I got told no the man was making the same meat sauce as was out on the buffet‚Ä¶.very pointless. I could always find something nice to eat though it was just the same thing for 7 days. If you are a meat eater there is plenty to suit all needs and my husband was very happy. I would say that if you want something grab it when you see it. When it‚Äôs gone it‚Äôs gone.    Restaurant- the staff need to be more proactive than reactive. Lots of tables have no cutlery and they wait for you to ask before going to hunt for some. Rather than resetting the tables as required.    Moroccan restaurant- we booked for the last night but weren‚Äôt allowed to see the menu. We arrived and the only option was chicken so we couldn‚Äôt eat there as no veggie option.    The bar- plenty of drinks to choose from. Not enough seating for the amount of guests.    Shuttle- tried for the first three days to get on it and got told it was fully booked every time. So we gave up and just got taxi each way 150dh which is about ¬£13 each way to the old town.    Currency exchange- euro US dollar and sterling were all easy to exchange at the hotel. The rate was 11.6 to ¬£1. You got a better rate in the old town 12.5 to ¬£1. However for convenience purposes we did use the hotel exchange. On the way home we also changed our money back to sterling.    Pool area-lovely and clean with plenty of seating. We didn‚Äôt go in as it was too cold. But would have if it was warmer.    Sports bar-we didn‚Äôt use as you had to pay extra. Would be nice to have another drinks area where you could sit and chat as the main bar was very loud.    In summary you get what you pay for. It was basic clean and did the job.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinar689

We were shocked to a point we started eating outside during our time there. Other thing was iron for our clothes every time we ask for it they said somebody has it. For the past six days we never had a chance to iron our clothes. The pool was not heated which limited activities in the pool for the kids. However the hotel itself was clean and tidy.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,KLR wrote a review Jan 2023,30,OK for the money.,I read very mixed reviews before I came out and was very apprehensive about what it would be like. So let's start with the bad points-    * Theft ! We had 1200dhm (about ¬£180) stolen from our hotel room within the first 24hrs. We don't usually carry cash abroad but did this time as tipping is customary and we wanted to head into Marakech without worrying about finding a cash point. When we arrived we tipped the taxi driver who waved the note at the security guard on the front door who nodded and smiled. We checked in and had a room with a broken safe. We stupidly thought that just by putting the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door would be enough to prevent anyone going in. We were wrong and while we were at the pool someone let themselves in and took the money from our bag. Woman on reception was extremely unhelpful lots of victim blaming and unsurprisingly never got back to us about if anyone had accessed our room and neither did they send anyone to fix or replace the safe after it was reported.    * Bar areas - we don't mind that they stop serving at 11 but what we really disliked was they stopped serving and then immediately turned all of the lights out and literally threw you out of the bar. Made you feel like a nuisance to be there trying to relax on holiday! Having to pay for the 'Sports Bar' is a bit odd when it is right across the corridor from the main bar and they serve a lot of the same drinks but you have to pay! Still we went in there one night just to have somewhere to sit inside.    * Snack times are very limited- just 60mins at the pool bar in the afternoon. Luckily we had no kids with us but if we did there was no ice creams etc for them at all.    Good points -    * Food - perhaps not 'good' but ok / mediocre. Given we had paid not a lot to be there food was as expected. It wasn't replenished for the entire sitting so if you didn't get there early you just had what was left. The local food was more tasty lots of fresh bread salads and the dessert table was lovely. I heard people moaning about how long it took for pizza and pasta or that chips were cold but to be honest on the one night we did try it it was all hot and very pleasant. Breakfast is mostly bread and pastries with an omelette station and pancakes so should be something for everyone.    * Staff were mostly friendly and polite although given that someone had already stolen from us we were constantly suspicious of everyone! Shame a minority spoil it for everyone because many of the staff seemed lovely.    * Hotel - from some reviews I was expecting a run down tip of a place! However it was actually quite nice. They are constantly maintaining the garden areas the communal areas always looked clean and the room was clean enough. Bed was big and firm slept surprisingly well most nights. Some bits look a bit tired but we didn't see anything really bad. Pools all looked nice slides were fun although the water was freezing! Great that there is a free bus to get you to and from the Old Town.    *Trips - would highly recommend booking your trip through Trip Advisor rather than through the hotel which is about double the price. We went up the Atlas Mountains and rode camels in the desert visited 3 villages had breakfast and lunch included for about ¬£35pp. It was a full 10hr day out great value for money. Hotel were charging that just to give you a guide to take you to Marrakech at night!    * Old Town - is certainly an experience! There are cashpoints there so you can get money out when you need it rather than risk keeping it at the hotel. We went in the morning 9am till 12.30. It was very quiet when we first arrived which sounds good but means the locals zoom in on you and don't give you any respite from trying to sell you things. It actually felt more relaxing as it got busier so next time I'd opt for the afternoon trip.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLOURAND

The was a good choice of food at all mealtimes either in the restaurant or snacks at the pool bar and the staff were all wonderful. but all is not what it seems at this hotel.  Its advertised as a family hotel if you have children you will be disappointed. There is not much for them to do no play park no daytime activities and none of the usual food you would expect for children .There is a mini disco in the evening which starts at 9pm consists of 5 songs in French with dance with dance actions.  Its no better for adults despite there been a lot of English people its all in French .  The hotel is not all inclusive as only the pool bar and cosy bar are free. the cosy bar is aptly named as there is only about 50 seat  In both the Sports bar and Shisha bar you have to pay and there is a ¬£10 supplement for the Moroccan Restaurant.,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Clacton-on-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thenewbitts

The staff are extremely polite friendly and can't do enough for you.  Food was good only complaint is que for the pizza can get long but that's expected.  Room was extremely nice we had a ground floor with small patio and view of the pool.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Antonio Espinoza wrote a review Jan 2023,10,"Horrible, boring",I thought I had paid for a gift and I realized that I only paid for what I was going to receive dirty and stained carpets that give a bad impression poor quality food dirty broken and poorly washed dishes the coffee machine without milk having to expect it to be recharged the orange juice from a machine and served in cardboard cups as if it were a juice from a vending machine the staff are very polite but poorly trained the entertainment concept is to play music at full volume that reaches the rooms and a person making children jump and two screens with soccer games for adults the place is boring to the point of staying these last 3 days in my room I spent a tedious and boring weekend to the point of thinking about fighting the charge with my credit card I'm going to wait for someone to have the decency to do it or I'll dispute it it was a really horrible experience.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chovito2
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jules4701 wrote a review Jan 2023,30,New Year Break Away ...,Honestly this is not a 4-star standard hotel I would say it‚Äôs a 3 star plus. We‚Äôre seasoned travellers and was disappointed with the standards when we first arrived as we‚Äôre used to 4- and 5-star accommodation but didn‚Äôt let this ruin our holiday.    LOCATION  The hotel is situated about a 35-minute drive from the airport and around 20 minutes from Marrakesh town centre. They operate a free shuttle from the hotel every day AM 9am -returning at 12.30 and 3.00 pm returning at 6.30p    RECEPTION & CUSTOMER SERVICE  Check in was swift and concierge brought our bags to the room.    ROOMS  The room was reasonably spacious with a double and smaller single in the room. The furniture I would say was basic. There was a sofa in the room but to be honest for where it was situated and how it was built into the room was ineffective.    BATHROOM  A reasonable size. No bathtubs but do have a walk-in shower.    GYM  There is no gym. It‚Äôs a cardio training room with 2 treadmills and two bikes. That‚Äôs it.    RESTAURANT  OMG there was a shortage of forks every single day. You get no information about how the restaurant works when you first arrive. You have to work things out for yourself.    The most disappointing thing here is that the food was good but cold (Luke warm).    The a la carte isn‚Äôt worth it. The food is basically coming from the main restaurant. This is a shame as the ambience of the a la carte restaurant was lovely.    WIFI  WIFI is available throughout the whole hotel and was really very good considering it was free.    NEW YEAR‚ÄôS EVE GALA DINNER  If it wasn‚Äôt for this Gala dinner I would have rated the whole stay 2 stars. The gala dinner gained them an extra star. Food and the entertainment were very good.    Cons  The heating wasn‚Äôt working in our room and they repaired this quite quickly. However 3 days later it broke down again.    The shower was blocked and they fixed this quickly.  Getting information on anything here was like pulling teeth. It isn‚Äôt forthcoming you have to dig to get the information you need.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Croydon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jules4701

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,A M wrote a review Jan 2023,30,First week of New Year,Unpaid for and honest review. Only about 20mins from the airport (hereget some dirham from the ATMif.you need mobile data.get a free SIM card) in a quite residential area. No other hotels near by and nearest supermarket is 15min walk  On arrival the lobby is impressive reception staff quick friendly and efficient (they will ask for the local tourist tax) we arrived just in time for snacks and he suggested we go eat have a drink and when we came back we would be show our room. Lovely touch.  The resort public areas are clean and reasonably well maintained.  The walk to our room though the hotel corridor shows the hotel is a bit worn carpets seem like they have seen better days. Our room was a standard triple 1st floor with a corner balcony. Our view was of the adult pool.Generous size room double bed single and a pull out sofa. As a couple we had plenty of space. A small dressing and wardrobe area on the right as you enter toliet shower room on left.  1st impressions are it's a nice room.  As time went on  it is clear the room is clean but not prestine. A window in the shower is covered in limescale cracked floor tiles repaired with silicone. The shower is strong and hot toiletries available. Housekeeping did a good job very willing to give extra toilet paper  A stair case out side out room meant we didn't have to walk the corridor again which brough us direct to the pool.  The resort is not huge it's compact nature would lend very well to families being able to watch their children when they weren't in club. I would say there weren't many families there during our stay but we knew that it was a mixed reset so we expected children to be enjoying their holiday.  The water was freezing even though afternoon temps got up to 23 unseasonably warm.  Food we ate only in buffet restaurant the variety is wide. Cheese cold meats and desserts are what you would expect in a hot country not fresh dairy like at home.  The mix of food offerings suited us because we like to try new things. Vegetables  meats tagines a nice variety.No need for chips for us but I'f you live on chips this is not the place for you. There is also a pasta and pizza bar.  Breakfast lovely local pancakes sweet pancakes eggs cooked to order. But if you wand a full fry breakfast agin not the place for you.  What didn't I like plastic cups plastic plates plastic straw. I brought me own reusable cup which the gladly filled. The room was a bit tatty but very livablea maintenance issue.  What I did like the staff are friendly the atmosphere was relaxed and just what we wanted for our winter break. The price we paid for our stay represented the standard of the facilities we got.  We might stay again not a bad base but I would love to see more Moroccon touches or a feel to the place.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Clare K wrote a review Jan 2023,10,AVOID AVOID AVOID,AVOID AVOID AVOID! I just got back from a 10 night stay here well to say I was disappointed is an understatement. Food was awful repetitive and cold I waited for fresh chips (as that's all I lived on).. and when they brought them out they were cold!! They made pasta and pizza fresh? Hmmmm when I went over it was in a pan on the side cold with some rubbery pasta in a plastic dish. This was then added to the pan heated and served with one popcorn sized peice of chicken. Pizza was bearable but just cheese on dough. Salads and cakes were ok. No ice cream if your taking kids. Rooms were basic terrible bed and ac/heating never worked. Outside there was 4 Atlantic cold pools and one with 4 slides. Lunch was also fun at the pool par where they have endangered wasps nests apparently. So the food was covered in flies and wasps daily. The cocktails gave u diahorrea. So I'll sum this up as... if u want to go for the weather as it was hot lose weight get a bad back from the terrible beds frost bite from the pools and diahorrea this is the hotel for u.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151clarek
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Dawn E wrote a review Jan 2023,30,Not as expected,Good points ‚Ä¶ On arrival check in was fast and we were taken to our room.  The young receptionist Abdelghani was very pleasant and helpful.  The hotel complex looks impressive it is relatively small a great asset is the water park with four slides.  The main pool is a good size and there‚Äôs a few little pools and also an adult pool around the side of the hotel.  The complex is kept tidy and clean.  Rooms were cleaned daily towels were changed and toiletries replaced. Safe and mini bar included (although nothing is in the mini bar)  Food ‚Ä¶ salads breads and fruit and cakes were always fresh and plenty of them ‚Ä¶ also little lurpak butter.  Breakfast ‚Ä¶ eggs were cooked to order as were pancakes.  Local red wine was of very good quality for all inclusive.    Bad points ‚Ä¶.  Room ‚Ä¶ We booked a standard double garden view room .. we didn‚Äôt get this we got a double room at the far end of the complex overlooking a dirt track when I went to speak to the reception I was told there were no double garden view rooms available? Strange seeing that is what we booked and our paperwork stated  The hotel was no were near full due to the time of year. Every morning I was woken by a very loud cockerel. Bed mattress was hard and pillows were not the best.    Pools ‚Ä¶ the adult pool is in a quiet locations but as no bar area so getting a drink would be a trek when looking at the pool we noticed how loud the water pumps are.    No pools are heated.    Food ‚Ä¶ now we travel quite a lot and we are not fussy eaters we enjoy the local cuisines of the countries we visit. The food here was very hit and miss most dishes regardless of type were cold if you don‚Äôt like bread salad pasta or rice then you will struggle. Chips were served at lunch time and always cold. Pizza was available but it was just like cheese on bread no tomato base. Although on one occasion I stood there and asked them to make my husband a pizza using the ingredients that were available (tomato pur√©e garlic pur√©e mixed dried herbs cheese salami mushrooms) they told me to come back in 10 minutes to collect it when I did so it was still the same with exception of a little tomato pur√©e on the base ?  None of the food labels have English on them just Arabic and French you would expect that they‚Äôd also have English seeing as a lot of British travel here.  Entertainment ‚Ä¶ non existent well with the exception of one night there was a kids disco.    On New Years Eve the hotel put a party on however it seemed not all guest were invited? We weren‚Äôt. We booked direct with MP Hotels who own the Labranda chain I was always under the impression being a member of the chain and booking direct gives you added benefits. Unfortunately not here.  The entertainment for the guests not invited to the end of year party was a Moroccan man playing a keyboard extremely loud. We along with others left. We ourselves opted to go in the sports bars ‚Ä¶ the  sports bar is not part of the All Inclusive so costs us money to have a quieter drink?  There is no lobby bar and in the evening the lobby is full of young unsupervised children running riot.  Also children were using scooters in the dining room ‚Ä¶ an accident waiting to happen.    I‚Äôm not sure if the hotel operates a winter concept and that is why we found lots of negatives with regards to the food and entertainment.  Most staff were very friendly. The dining room staff stood around trying to get a glass of wine with a meal was har work.  We were considering bringing family members out in summer time but after the poor food and the no invite to NYE party we are considering another hotel in Marrakech.  I have never left a bad review of an hotel this is a first. In my opinion this hotel would be lucky to receive a 3* status.

The choice of fish for the vegetarian menu could be changed the same fish dish was severed on the 5 days there although the vegetables provided ensured that we did not go hungry. The rest of the food provided was varied and tasty. The communal areas were kept immaculate at all times and the reception was manned 24/7.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,DilysHelen wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Wonderful value short-break in Marrakesh,We booked our holiday via a Travelzoo offer and wondered what we would get for our bargain deal. We were not at all disappointed - on the contrary we had a lovely stay of 4 nights here. We had upgraded to a room with king size bed and it was very spacious with a balcony too plus an additional bed. We loved the all-inclusive deal - first time we've tried this and it was great not to be worrying about the cost of every bottle of water or other drink. The house wine was very acceptable. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We thought the range of food on offer was very good - just hold on to your plate if you want seconds as they struggled to keep up with replacing the plates! On one night we ate in the Morrocan restaurant at no extra charge which was great fun and lovely food but we were the only guests there - it was very little publicised! There were six pools none of which we went in but they added a lot to the nice appearance of the hotel grounds. Pool towels would have been available if we'd needed them. There were two shuttle buses per day into Marrakesh one 9 am-12.30 pm and one 3 pm-6.30 pm - you had to book the day before. This was ideal for exploring all the sights for 3 hours at a time and then retreating from the hustle and bustle.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Emil H wrote a review Dec 2022,20,I would highly consider not booking this hotel during November-April time,I stayed at the hotel for a week during November 2022 which was out of the season there were still a lot of people at the hotel and the weather was around 26 degrees. We arrived at the hotel at around 2 pm and checked into the hotel fine and were shown to our rooms we were told that the lunch period was still open and to go and eat we went to the buffet where there wasn't really any food left and was just salad. We went to the pool and had a drink whilst watching the afternoon entertainment which was just the man playing with the ladies in the pool. For dinner when we went it was very traditional food and nothing that was plain my partner is lactose intolerant but there wasn't really anything that catered for his needs. We had salad most days. We had a drink at the bar and went to bed. In the morning we went to breakfast the same traditional food and nothing more. The coffee machine you could tell hadn't been cleaned as it came out clumpy nor did they have any breakfast tea. The same was for every meal there was nothing to cater for someone who had dietary requirements or even for children but salad and chips. It said they had a second restaurant which was not actually there we had to get takeaway a lot of the nights. At around 4 pm they would have their snack hour which consisted of cake which was always surrounded with wasps and was not covered. We also got a taxi to take us to the supermarket to buy food we could eat during our trip. On our 5th day we went for a massage which was fine however when we returned from the spa the cleaning services had been and left the door wide open with all of our belongings open to anyone who would want to walk past. We had money passports electronics of a lot of value. When we bought this to the attention of the front desk they did not understand the severity of the matter. They disregarded it not helping the situation at all or giving any compliments for the inconvenience. We spoke with a lot of other travellers whilst we were there who were also very unhappy with the level of service and quality of food. One evening a local football team arrived and checked into the hotel the hotel had sectioned off an area of the buffet and was serving them meals like you would expect in a restaurant and also serving drinks. Please bare in mind if you needed a drink or any silverware you would need to get up and get it yourself there was no help at all. It was my partner's birthday whilst we were there and I asked if they would be able to deliver a cake to our room they ask what time I said 7 pm so it was there before dinner 8 pm came and no cake I went to the front desk where they didn't have a clue what I was talking about and then found the order they then left the cake in the warm room out on the side with no cover and did not find it until we returned to the room later that night. Upon checking out we raised all of our concerns again and also needed a later checkout they demanded we paid for the additional time however they had numerous rooms available and it would have been cheaper to stay another night. If you do book this hotel and need a later check out then book for another night it works out better. We have waited a while to write this review but decided it was best to worn others especially with children as you will find it very difficult to satisfy children during your trip. From what I read during my booking there were good reviews they most likely do better during peak season but its still not acceptable as there were still a lot of people staying there.,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T759FBemilh

We landed late evening on arrival we checked in went to our rooms someone is already inside asleep. Strike 1!  We returned to reception and was taken to a 2nd room that was clearly being used by somebody. Strike 2!  3rd time around we were taken to another room bearing in mind I'm travelling with my 2 grown up sons 17 & 20 our room had 2 cots!! Strike 3!!  We managed to finally get over the cot situation however the food that was served on arrival was a poor cold salad with bread. It was not fresh more like leftover from the dinner service. Some of us got cheese and tomato with potatoes others got cold rice with cabbage. Serious after thought!!  Then the cats were assisting us to eat . üòÜ  It couldn't get any better after that.

Saw a deal online in Marrakesh at Labranda for an all inclusive holiday for peanuts. For what you're paying this hotel is perfect. I can't believe people have rated this hotel low considering how much you're paying for an ALL INCLUSIVE. The staff are bloody friendly and work their socks off. Mustafa is super friendly on check in Anas is quality at the Sports bar and most importantly Sherif is brilliant in the Buffet restaurant.    As a whole the hotel is just easy and chilled. Drink eat sunbathe pool slides friendly staff funny entertainment - for what we paid all of these were worth every penny.    The only complaints - the beds aren't the most comfy in the world and the Wifi connectivity wasn't the best but then why would you want to be on your phone on holiday anyway?

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Daniel T wrote a review Dec 2022,30,"This hotel is ok, not yet a 4*. Sorry guys.",Hotel was good nicely laid out.    Needs a lot of re plastering and painting.    Our room had a loose plug by the bed. Minor fix.    Reception need customer service training in problem solving and communication.    Need work on entertainment need training speak more English and slowly when doing announcements. They need to work on a play list for the poolside live music playing over the speakers is not relaxing and have a mixture of recent music from Morocco UK Spain France. I suggest subscribing to Spotify around ¬£10 a month.    More entertainment and dance shows! You have a stage now so use it! I have worked in entertainment for one of UKs well known Zoo.    Moroccan restaurant not needed! Use it as a lounge/bar for those who want a child free zone. Have entertainment like Moroccan dancing and music. Bring out the big tagines of lamb beef and chicken with a salad bar and various options of couscous.    Cleaners do a great job but like to talk to each other or be on their phones they leave doors opened or forget their key cards in the rooms. Some are also cleaning rooms after 12:00.    Gardeners are great at keeping the grounds groomed.    Pool team are good at keeping the pools sub beds and tables clean the pools do need a little work.    The bars are ok they need to make sure the drink machines are in working order at all times!! There is a sports bar entertainment bar and a ‚Äúpool bar‚Äù thats behind the Moroccan restaurant. If there is a sports bar people should not be watching sports in the entertainment bar!    Rooms are basic but spacious and the showers are two man so perfect for a couple! Toilet roll is cheap 2ply so make sure your not a regular toilet goer!    Food is Moroccan so dont expect your English breakfasts. Needs a little improvement to ensure succulents and tenderness but its tasty. As expected all hotels tend to have the same foods out as they cook in bulk.

Food was great especially considering its hotel food but it was gorgeous! (Fresh pizza) Ended up a bit sick due to eating the Burger King not far from hotel but the lovely nurse gave us medication each for a couple days (for free!). Place was absolutely spotless staff so friendly and helpful. Cleaners and gardeners done an amazing job with rooms and grounds of hotel. Not one staff member was unfriendly and always greeted you with a smile! Entertainment during day was great night time was good however just wish it had started a bit earlier or went on maybe an hour later as everything shut at 11pm. Drinks as you expect for all inclusive but just buy a bottle for your room from local supermarket. Closest big supermarket is 25 min walk away or a short taxi ride which didn‚Äôt bother me as me and my partner didn‚Äôt mind the walk and locals were happy to give directions if we got lost! Daily bus you can book previous day to go to Medina. Not much to fault this hotel apart from the room key cards needing to be fixed every couple days lol and only 1 hour night entertainment at night but other than that everything perfect and will be back again!    Also music round pool was great people complaining about no English songs are stupid why go to another country to moan about their culture and music!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Megan A wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Lovely long winter sun weekend,Great hotel for a winter sun long weekend. Room was basic but was nice and clean. The pool area was clean and well kept. There was Entertainment throughout the day round the main pool the team loved getting everybody involved in activity‚Äôs such as darts and waterpolo. A special thanks to Moses (sorry if Iv spelt his name incorrectly) he is a great asset to the entertainment team! Food was good and we could always find something to eat. The pizza and pasta bar on a evening was our favourite. The omelette man at breakfast made the BEST omelettes! Alchol section was basic but the beer was good. I would also like to say a special thanks too the reception team who kindly sorted my boarding passes being printed and allowing me to call to check my airport transfer details. I would also like to say thank you too the lovely security guard who stood and spoke too us while waiting for our transfer early in the morning (29/11/2022 around 8am) I‚Äôm so sorry I didn‚Äôt get his name what a polite man.

STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!    they have an Absolute joke of management team they‚Äôre bunch of robbing Twonks!! One maid stole my key card from the electric port whilst I was out swimming the next day the troll stole 100dh and the day after 200dh Mind my French after speaking to other guest we found the maids steal your money or items from your room it‚Äôs a scam they leave the door open for anyone to walk in Willy nilly and upon returning. To you‚Äôre room you‚Äôll find things missing‚Ä¶  when you complain to the management team they do nothing about it they just fob you off and say the manager who deals with this stuff is not in come back tomorrow they play on the fact they can‚Äôt understand English when you want to make a complaint!!    however I was due to leave the following day so nothing got done‚Ä¶. Just an absolute joke!!    the key cards stopped working 3 or 4 times so I had to keep going to activate the key‚Ä¶.    FOOD WAS SHOCKING!! Same stuff everyday bland and tasteless I‚Äôve been to Morocco a few times and this time it was just shambles‚Ä¶.    Entertainment was shocking starts at 9:30pm finishes at 11:30pm all they do is scream down the microphone at people and think it‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶ not what I expected at all    The only good things about it are the slides and the sunshine!!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Anneka K wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Excellent hotel with lovely staff,Super friendly staff excellent service and amazing value for money.    The food was delicious - a great range of traditional Moroccan dishes on offer each mealtime all cooked to perfection and well labelled (in French). I just wish they had proper fruit juice at breakfast though!    The staff were all polite and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The shuttle service was very good two trips out per day and you just book on for free at reception. The driver was good enough to take us with our suitcase on our last day so we could wander the souks a little longer before going to the airport.    The slides are super fun! The water in the pool was a little chilly but that's to be expected in November and was actually a nice relief from the hot sunshine.    The mattress was a bit on the firm side. I didn't have an issue with it but my poor other half didn't sleep the first night because of it. This is the one thing that could be improved upon everything else was brilliant and the whole trip was excellent value for money. We loved Morocco and will definitely be going back!

On our first night after a long flight got to 11.30pm and they were still playing told them to stop and staff said its busy and cannot stop. I told them I have a 11 month baby who cannot sleep due to noise and they eventually turned it off. Thank you to the male manager who did eventually turn it off. It however continued the next day as usual.    The agency that do travel and taxi booking are annoying. They double book your taxis and the woman working there is rude and gestures with her hand and grits her teeth. Not a nice woman and needs to learn about customers service.    Food nice staff worked tirelessly to provide good food.    Hotel is on outskirts so will need a taxi to get anywhere.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Joanne wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Based on previous reviews........,I was dreading staying here......just returned from a 7 day holiday and it was brilliant. I agree in part with some of the previous reviews that the food could be a little hit or miss but we always found something that we could eat.  The pool areas were always clean as were the rooms and common areas. All the staff were amazing and so hard working.  All inclusive was good and the drinks of a good quality but strong very very strong!!  The shuttle bus was a real benefit and we used it 3 times throughout our stay.  The shop on site was not so good they had a board outside advertising various ice-cream but there was a very poor selection in addition crisps and chocolate very limited. We had a walk to the local district of Targa to visit Carrefour and found a small general store just outside the hotel a brilliant choice of crisps and confectionery at very reasonable prices and the chap working in there was really friendly had I have found the shop earlier in the holiday I would have used them all the time.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,ashbash wrote a review Sep 2022,30,What you make of it!,I‚Äôve waited a couple of weeks to write this review so that it would be fair and not based off of initial feelings.  We booked in June and upon booking we contacted the hotel to ask if they provided cots - no response. We then contacted them a further 4 times prior to travelling and each time our enquiry went without response so we brought our own cot - only to find that the hotel did have cots not a big deal but a bit frustrating.    Il start with the positives because there were many!    The two big pools were very clean! We always managed to find Sun loungers and there were plenty of umbrellas; much needed because the weather was beautiful I‚Äôm 25 weeks pregnant and my son is only 20 months - so the heat got a bit much at times; to be expected in Morocco!    The staff were largely really helpful and polite! We don‚Äôt know much French and the staff didn‚Äôt know much English but any communication was always super polite and helpful.    Our room was very clean as was most of the hotel. The lobby was immaculate and I don‚Äôt think I ever saw the lobby not being cleaned!    The restaurant is a good size!    Now onto a few ‚Äònot so great‚Äô    My husband and I stayed here with our 20 month old earlier this month. When we booked we were of the impression that because there was a children‚Äôs club 2 children‚Äôs pools and a ‚Äòwater park‚Äô that it would be pretty child friendly. In many cases it is however our biggest disappointment sat with the food - judging by many of the reviews here we aren‚Äôt alone.  Our little boy isn‚Äôt fussy with food by any stretch but by day 3 I was getting more and more concerned that he was living off of chips and cold pasta because nothing else was particularly suitable. The fish was full of bones each time and unless you like Tagine there wasnt much else to choose from. Yes there is a pasta and pizza station but the queues are huge and frankly there‚Äôs only so many cheese and tomato pizzas you can stomach in a week. It didn‚Äôt help that none of the dishes were labelled in English meaning that anything that we couldn‚Äôt tell off the bat what it was we opted against just incase of allergies or not wanting to waste food.  Half way through holiday I came onto trip advisor to see if this was just a bad week food wise or whether the food was an ongoing grievance. Upon seeing lots of people say the same about the food I also found lots of people recommending the App ‚ÄòGlovo‚Äô - which is essentially deliveroo. Despite really not wanting to order food in after paying for all inclusive I must admit that on one evening when the food was particularly bad we did order Burger King.    The children‚Äôs disco starts at 9pm - which I‚Äôm sure isn‚Äôt an issue for most however it was just a bit too late for our little one to stay up for which was a shame because on the one evening we did keep him up he loved it. Entertainment does go on until midnight and it is quite loud so do keep that in mind.    Our room was OK but hardly any rooms have a balcony which we would have preferred.    Now whilst the hotel was for the most part clean; less time could be spent mopping the lobby and more time cleaning the children‚Äôs pool area - particularly the baby pool with the slide. We arrived on the Monday and the baby pool was full of sand until the Saturday. We didn‚Äôt see anybody clean the pool in between  so it wasn‚Äôt that it was being untided and then re-cleaned every day it was just simply left for a week. For this reason (and reading that somebody‚Äôs toddler was very poorly during their stay and even once they got home to the UK - we avoided the baby pool like the plague.    Whilst I appreciate that there‚Äôs a whole manner of bugs and flies to be expected in morrocco the sheer number of flies and wasps around the pool and restaurant areas is unacceptable. The second you put a drink down - covered in flies. Likewise if you opted to eat outside. Too many open top bins which are too infrequently emptied.    Overall this place is what you make of it. We wanted a nice chilled get away before we have our second baby - we got that. We just went a little hungry that‚Äôs all‚Ä¶.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/120ashleighc
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jo√£o O wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Stay Away!!,Misleading and awful experience as soon as we arrived at 21:15 due to flight delay we went to check in. However we rushed to go and eat as they stated that the restaurant was closing at 21:30 even though our booking information was open until 22:30. We got there and there was hardly any food basically all just leftovers. When we finally were able to check in we got to the room the floor wasn't clean the fridge was full of opened used bottles of drinks although we complained that it wasn't resolved. We had no water whatsoever all night.    We had an issue at one of the bars even though we paid all inclusive they charged us claiming that the bar was extra but no one ever told us so. However the problems didn't stop there we constantly had to go to reception because our room key wasn't working and the receptionist was no help actually he was rude and the issue never sorted.    As advertised there should have been at least 2-3 restaurants to eat however there was only one which was the buffet very limited food choices almost always the same food everyday. You had to drink out of paper cups and constantly the waiter to fix either the coffee and soft drinks machine as they were never working. The service was nonexistent and when around they would only stand and watch you eat.    For a 4 Star Hotel the employees' behaviour is really bad always on their phones sitting on the bar or next to the pool. Maintenance was done on the pool almost every day this would be a good thing if it wasn't during operation times. A gentleman was painting and setting new tiles around the pool while people were using it.  The restaurant was always dirty mugs on breakfast always running out. 95% of the plates bowls and mugs were broken and very old.    We also had issues exchanging our towels for new ones the man didn't want to exchange the two towels we paid for clean ones he was very aggressive and rude.  My partner and I spent the whole holiday with D&V after discussing with other guests we came to the conclusion that the pool water was making us all sick and 4 other families also had the same symptoms.  We don't recommend this hotel for anyone! Stay away!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Thetford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo_oo34
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Wendy S wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Family Return,Our 2nd visit to this hotel we came out of season last time so presumed August would be more alive. Well it was definitely busier for the 1st week it was manic in the day time but in the evening it was a different story. Kids club adult pool party (just kids) at night and just 1 evening where we had some actual entertainment.  We could always find something to eat even if it was just fruit and bread unfortunately the food was tepid and very rarely hot. 1 waiter who was mainly outside was so polite and friendly (he might of been Mohamed im dreadful with names) He could teach the inside staff how to be more assertive and polite.  Pool staff were more inclined to chat women up and use their phones to translate their conversations!!! Several days the staff were no where to be seen near the slides and this caused chaos. Fighting over slide mats between kids and adts snatching them off the kids. Not pleasant at all. When the pool staff did come out of shed they'd play on the slides standing up and showing the kids what NOT to do!!  My family had great fun playing water polo twice a day.  The entertainment team would greet you going for lunch but then we wouldn't see them again until 'kids disco'.  Praise goes to the garden staff who really worked hard to keep the gardens maintained.  The rooms disappointed us as we had no view or balcony as we did on our last visit the hairdryer had burnt out mirrors dreadful.

Food is not so much in quantity but its really good quality food not mass quantity and rubbish in taste. Had a nice pizzeria snd pasta stand daily. Tagines were awesome  chicken fish and beef. Breakfast was basic omelette and tonnes of bakery item. Deserts are nice.  Over all service is good of the staff.  Shuttles to new shopping mall and main medina souk from 9 to 12pm or 3 to 6pm. They need to extend these hours.  Pools are fun as they have games and dance aerobics which is fun.  Entertainment in the evening a big flop! No real shows! Go out!  Overall decent hotel.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Martin C wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Mixed Feelings......but actually a great holiday!,"Where do I start? We booked this over a year ago and well getting nearer to the holiday there were some shocking reviews going on and to be honest I was very nervous about going. in fact looking at the reviews even now at the same time we were there there are some shocking and then some amazing reviews going on..... so being totally pragmatic here is my honest opinion of the hotel and what's going on there. But since it's a long review i can sum this trip and my advice on this hotel up in the next paragraph.    Overview: Morocco is a warm (in all ways) friendly country full of mystique friendly people happy to accept western visitors eager to share their way of life with you and desperately in need of the tourist trade after a tough few years of Covid. I have never felt more welcomed and wanted in any other country. you really get a sense that you are somewhere different vibrant and exciting. Any hotel is really only a stepping stone to accessing a cultural wonderment! If you want to sit around a pool all day eat fine food and chat to lots of other Brits.... there will probably be better places for you but if you want to experience Morooco then overall this hotel offered our family a great base from which to explore this exciting country and a nice enough place to enjoy some fun poolside days!!! Drop your western rules and expectations embrace a different way of doing things be pragmatic about a few key aspects of the hotel and I promise you will have a great time!    1.) Check in: we arrived at 10:30am check-in wasn't meant to be until 3pm.... no problem they said we filled in the paper work paid our tax (¬£30ish for 10nights) informed of all the all inclusive bits and escorted to our room. everything worked except the TV remote (i was never going to watch it anyway) but the porter sorted it straight away..... for us....cant fault the check in experience.    2.) Front desk staff in general: well i'd say this is a lottery I wish I had taken some names to call out the good and bad...but I didn't. however there are some very lazy and rude staff on the main desk but equally there are some very helpful and polite ones..... (the women were all brilliant and some of the younger men also but a few of the older guys.....come across as sneering). I did see a few people really laying into the front of house staff I suspect they did have good reason to be frustrated but I also witnessed a number of people using trip adviser reviews (bad reviews) as a sort of threat to get money back or what they wanted (one lady saying she had ~70 relatives who would all bombard tripadviser at her behest if she didn't get her way which really doesn't seem right to me). Anyway I'm sure that most reviews here are genuinely how people felt.....but I cant overlook the conversations I witnessed.    3.) Rooms and Technical issues: we had a family suite the beds for kids are a bit small and maybe there could be a dividing curtain between adult and kids space there is a kitchenette but literally no cups or plates or cutlery so why bloody have it? But all in all the rooms are spacious tidy I didn't see any dirt or bugs at all in our room and the aircon worked the entire time. We had one problem with our room the whole time which was the door lock. a few days into the stay the cards starting not working (every day) then one day even the re-coded card failed....the front of house man said the technician would come....i waited 30mins then went back....asked when it would be done so the other front of house man (older boldish head slightly round very rude i suspect he's more senior in the team....) got off his arse and came and recoded the lock for us....why didn't he just come there and then? anyway that lasted a day then the next night at ~10pm it failed again so they had to call out the door company. we couldn't get into our room and my daughter was tired but honestly the staff that time all worked really hard to get us in and rectify the problem they were friendly and polite and really moved mountains.... so again....a bit of a lottery on whose front of house at the time.    4.) Pool: There are 2big family pools 1big adult only pool a pool at end of slide and 2 little splash pools.... yes they have a liner which is a bit worn in places yes there is the odd insect floating in them (but honestly there's a huge surface and lots of bugs...so there's always going to be the odd bug in there). however the pools were clean tidy you can watch the staff clean and check them daily.... The slides are really good fun and kept me and the two kids (12 & 13) entertained on the days we stayed at the hotel.....i cant imagine not having had them TBH!!! The sunbeds get filled up quickly but they have spare ones and will help you put them out. but the rules on reserving sunbeds might as well not exist 9because in practice they don‚Äôt). and there aren‚Äôt enough parasols which in the glaring midday heat you need but we found a nice spot just in-front of the lifeguard shack that we used with a tree for shade...    5.) Pool Towels: I honestly don't get why they have this ¬£10 deposit rule for each towel? I suspect they have had lots of theft of towels in the past.... however if you put a deposit scheme on towels well how does that discourage theft? yes a budding thief wont steal the towels they rent...but they have no problem taking any towels someone else rents!!! Clearly this is an issue in Moroccan hotels then I guess? but this scheme simply moves the loss and burden onto your well paying guests who then get locked into a sort of stress game over their towels.... we didn't have ours taken but i did witness multiple people who did....the pool side staff appeared not to care to some people who approached them. i see it differently they care but are powerless to do anything. i think the hotel management has made a decision that they will pass the cost and burden onto the guests and as such have tied the hands of the staff to solve the issues..... I urge the management to reconsider this approach......... if you want to raise your hotels game and standing on this forum...that would be an easy place to start?    6.) Entertainment: The music in the day can be very loud but there are plenty of places you can be further away from the noise but still pool side.... the kids disco at night can be a bit OTT hearing the same silly songs night after night....turn it down for that please. But overall they have quieter music times during meal times and i found it ok. I have read a few comments saying there's no entertainment? i honestly don't understand that? (perhaps it was a different time from when we were there?) every day throughout the day the team Especially the amazing Mous (who is a real superstar and credit to the hotel) work tirelessly to put on a range of fun and games. we did all sorts from volleyball water polo dance class aqua size but also observed ping pong tournaments yoga etc. every night they also put on a show of some sort from a mad pool party Karaoke an incredible Moroccan night with snake charmers fire eaters/dancer belly dancers and Moroccan folk singers. For me the entertainment team are one of the real gems of this place.    7.) Staff in general: yes this is a mainly French and Arabic speaking hotel....then again it's Morocco so i think that's to be expected? for me if you go to Morocco in a way don't you want to feel like you really are some-were different from the UK? Or more so feel away from the same old same old (what are now extensions of the UK) in Spain etc. for me have a go at some French and use the common language of expression with the staff and they really light up a little effort on our part goes a long way and it's amazing how much more interaction you can get from this approach. Also i think most of the staff have better English than we have French and really make an effort to make you feel welcome at no point did i feel like my family wasn't welcome. in fact the staff around the food hall and especially the life guards made a real effort to laugh joke and include us. The lifeguards again are a real set of superstars with youthful energy they find the balance of keeping the pools safe but making it a fun place....    8.) Queuing/Other guests: Yes i agree with some of the comments regarding queuing us Brits do love a queue and that's not always the case with everyone there are probably some cultural differences there i agree especially regarding how kids are allowed to push in etc but a little word and generally that could be solved.....and lets be honest it's a holiday so are you in that much of a rush anyway? And yes sometimes some of the other guests would totally blank you..perhaps because we have noting in common...i have no idea..but for me i just sort of shrug my shoulders at that.... it's life right I've played my part in trying to reach out.... But the point here is the hotel is not responsible for any of this really? The key is their staff are (apart from a few front of house staff) all very friendly happy to see British tourists warm welcoming and inclusive.    9.) Food: Wow! now this is where I have most understanding of the comments written...it's a common theme on all reviews here and in part i have to agree with much that is written. the first day we arrived and went to lunch it was a serious shock. The food hall was madness no clean tables people rushing everywhere a huge queue for the pizza and pasta most of the food had run out the noise was deafening....kids were everywhere and allowed to help themselves and push in and some dubious hygiene from the kids but the most upsetting part the shear human greed and waste on display people piling multiple plates high with food cakes stacked on savoury....and then left on the tables. literally we witnessed people fill plates walk to a table and just leave them there? why why why?..... however....on reflection this was all the fault of the guests was it not? a little more control of the kids a bit of decorum less greed less frenzy and it would be actually a pleasant experience. And i can prove that because by the end of the holiday late august/early September the hotel had really quietened down (i asked th staff why and they said it was because the hotel in August was poplar with Moroccan guests but they had left ready for the kids returning to school). and on these remaining days with less frenzy everyone calmed down there was polite queuing (mainly) literally hardly any gluttony and food waste the staff could keep up with the tables it was calm quiet the pizza queue was only a few mins long etc. literally chalk and cheese between the start and end of the holiday. I think for busy times the hotel needs to consider extra staff and bring in some basic rules on queuing kids getting food and how portioning is managed to prevent this mad human feeding frenzy maybe have every station manned for a while etc? As for food quality and variety. for me the highlight was breakfast there was a good variety of continental breakfasts plus hot items and cooked to order pancakes and omelettes. the guy who runs the outside for breakfast and lunch (again wish i had his name) is the nicest friendliest man you could ask for and he makes you feel welcome and special and runs the area like it was a proper restaurant (he is a gem of the hotel as well). There is a good variety of food at lunch and dinner from salads breads and a rage of hot dishes however the quality of the food isn't really that great i would say. we never ordered takeaway but was tempted but we had some excursions that included dinner which gave us a break. I think a few more ""global"" dishes would help and staffing each station would cure peoples issues with how you see the food there is a range of approaches to food hygiene is all i will say on the matter and that can be a little off putting. But also i think when you go somewhere like Africa...you should expect different food it should be part of the fun so we generally embraced the experience but i was ready for a burger when i got home yesterday! ha ha ha! The other thing I‚Äôve read is about illness. sorry to say my whole family did get a bit unwell about 3days in.... one night was really not very pleasant in deed (i'll spare you the details).... what was the cause.? was it the food or the guests food hygiene? i will never know. but do some reading this is actually quite common in Morocco 40% of all foreign travellers to Morocco experience some form of upset stomach caused by the heat unpeeled fruit and veg water and poor food hygiene. so in reality it's sort of expected.... we did see a fair few people who had the same issue....but then we also met people from other hotels who were all the same....so how much can reflect on the hotel and how much just on the travel to Morocco itself? again im fairly pragmatic about it... i think the hotel can help the image of this with some simple rules in the food areas...    10.) Bars/Drinks and other bits and bobs: the bar staff are all great there is a bar open all day till 11am. given Morocco is a dry country this hotel does a good job to meet our western needs with wine spirits and beer. I liked all the drinks on offer and never got bored. we met many people who's hotels didn't have any alcohol (eek imagine that). i do think the hotel should scrap it's sports bar fee's and open it up as part of the all-inclusive since hardly anyone uses it anyway. it was a shame the shisha bar wasn't open i wanted to try that! We didn't use the spa so cant comment. the shop was poorly stocked...but you can easily get into the old or new town using the free shuttle bus or a taxi. the shuttle is a great service and we used it and are so glad we did. There is a hell of a lot of plastic used (cups) given the paly this brand makes on sustainability i fail to see how this is a sustainable approach? I think the wasps people mention are bees i never saw anyone stung but they can be a bit of a nuisance if you leave anything sweet alone for more than 5seconds (my advice don‚Äôt!!!). The lobby area and general buildings are all well maintained clean and I think quite nice. Yes there are some worn out bits but actually I think the standard really isn‚Äôt so bad.    11.) Excursions: we did 5 excursions 4 booked on TripAdvisor all private tours of various place and a cookery class (see my other reviews) all highly recommended and great value. and 1 from the hotel (the medina at night). I cant find the place to review that separately. but if i could... i would say DONT DO IT!!! over priced didn‚Äôt deliver what was promised the tour guide was rude and disinterested (and never cared if he lost us all) the good bit was the meal/entertainment part....but the horse carriage ride was a joke 6 of us crammed into a 4seater to save him money WTF!!! The sales rep is a nice guy and listened to our feedback but he's sadly selling what are outdated and poor tours... search tripadviser and find the high rated trips you wont be disappointed (don't be afraid of how it works you might feel because you book at the hotel it's safer or will work easier that isn't the case these companies do these trips all the time and communicate excellently and the products they offer are amazing for the money).",Date of stay: August 2022,,"Wigton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320martinc
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Robyn S wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do not go here!!!,So we got to the hotel no hello we jusy got handed a form to fill in and told we have to pay tax. The only good thing I have to say is that they saved us dinner as we didn't get there till 11pm.    In our room 3 out of the 4 lights didn't work safe didn't work and neither did the TV.    Maids went in the rooms every day to make beds but the rooms weren't actually cleaned.  The main lobby is very clean but the rest of the hotel is very old and dirty.    Other than the guys around the pool I found all staff very rude.    There is no children's playground nor is there a kids club you have to stay with the children.    The kids pool was very slippery a woman slipped and landed up on crutches.  I had to take my son out the pool on one occasion as there were fag ends in it.  Only one of the slides had water to it.    The water park wasn't running all of the time an hour here and an hour there.  No proper life guards so many kids unattended pushing in at the top and deliberately staying at the bottom of the slides.    Now to the food..  I am quite well travelled and this is by far the worst food I have ever had. It was that bad so many other families were ordering food to the hotel. I paid for all inclusive so made wasnt about to spend extra money on food but i so wish i had of done now.  My 3 year old complained of stomach ache over the week I put it down to him being hungry as he wasn't eating much but it has turned out much more than that.  The day we landed he started having diahrea then came the high temperature on day 5 of this I took him to the doctor we then ended up in A&E he had to give stool samples which I had the results back today. Public health England called me to say that he has shiga toxin they've sent the stool off for futher testing as this can cause serious illness to children under 5.    My friend recommended this hotel as she's been twice a few years back I wish I'd of read the reviews before I booked.    I would give this hotel a 2* rating,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eletusk
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,patsy b wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Never Again!!,Just came got back on the 2nd of September and wow where do I start!! Hotel was very basic basic rooms but okish. The staff I didn't find very helpful at all. One night our electrics kept turning off. The food was tastless and cold not really much to choose from. We basically just lived on crusty bread and butter. Had to order in take away a few times! If you went to eat say a hr after from them opening the restaurant you would be lucky to get any food as they didn't really keep on top of replenishing the food or you would not be able to get a plate or fork to eat with as they would run out too. People where just piling up their plates and just wasting it. There were also so many rude people pushing and barging past you to get food never seen anything like it. I have been to a few all inclusive and I must say its been my worst experience ever!!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patsyb852
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tabitha H wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Don‚Äôt book this hotel,Just returned I have never written a review but this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.  1.The roof in the lobby leaks be careful as there a puddles everwhere  2. The pools are ok but need sorting the lining is coming away and you can feel the liner bubbles under your feet. The ladders to get out are all loose. The sliders are ok but you have to fight for mats to use them. Not enough of them.  3. No evening entertainment other than a music stand  4.food bloody awful cold most of the time and not enough. Pizza que is an hour long and that the only food that is fit for consumption. We soon learnt all the guest we‚Äôre using an app called Glovo to order in burgerkings every night. Not enough chose  don‚Äôt cater for kids at all. Not enough plates or cutlery  5. They cater for Moroccan and no effort for English at all. Very rude.  6. Lots of issues with the door and cards lots of guest with issues and power failures    Look else where if your thinking about booking.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Mel M wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Avoid,I have been to Morocco 4 times and never felt alienated at a hotel. They hardly spoke any English especially at the food court  so lost in translation. Just about managed to check in. Food court staff were very rude. The customers within the hotel were nationals so again not much English spoken no coordination during food serving times like a free fall for all and very chaotic. I have never seen so much wastage of food in my life very greedy. People rush and push in front of you and because you cannot speak another language apart from english they believe it is ok. But it is not. The children felt alone as no one wanted to play with them just stared at them. The food was ok but very repetitive for the 8 days. The area is in the middle of nowhere so make sure you have your taxi money and excursions booked. Animation during the day was ok with zumba exercises but not much stuff happening due to covid. No entertainment at night. Rooms were nice and clean. In the kids play area had rubbish in the sand.    Just avoid completely.,Date of stay: September 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissamX8896XS
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jee789 wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Absolutely AMAZING,Just been on holiday as a group of 7 adults and a child. I can‚Äôt express how amazing everything was. Nothing like the negative reviews that people have written.  The pools are really clean and the staff are amazing. Can‚Äôt express how amazing the cleaners were ‚ÄúAbu Ali‚Äù a sweet individual who cleaned our rooms every single day and would fold our clothes up if we left them on the bed. Fresh towels everyday in the room. Swimming towels can be bought separately but you get your money back once it‚Äôs returned same with an iron. Excursions were booked with ‚Äúmustafa‚Äù at the hotel he was a great help when it came to ordering food from outside or even booking taxis or day trips. The hotel is a really safe area to be in. Entertainment was really good. Spa at the hotel is a must!! A package booked with mustafa only cost us ¬£35.  The hotel is 25 mins away from ‚Äújamaa el-fnaa square‚Äù but the shuttle bus will take you either to the square or new town from 9:00-12:00 or 15:00-18:00.  If you want to exchange money for dirhams the receptionist will help you out and give you the current exchange rate.  Breakfast was always good eggs pancakes Moroccon bread croissants salami different types of honey.  Lunch and dinner always had freshly stoned baked pizza with pasta. Moroccon tegine as the main dishes different types of bread desserts and fruits and salad.  The restaurant at the hotel has to be booked beforehand. But it‚Äôs absolutely amazing the interior design and decor is beautiful. The food is always a personal preference it depends if you like Moroccon dishes. Not many choices it‚Äôs whatever is on that day.  Overall had an amazing trip to morocco as a first timer and would definitely go again,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jee789

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Carlyhockley wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Avoid.,We‚Äôve done a lot of research on hotels and have been to Morocco 4 times before but typically we stay in a Roy. This time we booked through another tour operator and figured we‚Äôd give this one a try.    Do not stay here. Avoid.    On arrival there is very little conversation or explanation where anything is or what times everything is from. Had to find bars restaurants pools towel exchange for ourselves.  The main pool is crazy! Loud music with un-sensored lyrics. For us it was great bc we loved the music and vibe and activities. But be prepared it may not suit allespecially as the entertainment team do all activities by the pool. But there is another 2 pools one is an adult only quiet pool which is very good and another pool near the slides. The kids/baby pool is actually filthy there is a sandpit next to it so typically it‚Äôs full of sand and dirt. Also the kids slides have no water coming down them so are burning hot and can‚Äôt be used for kids. There is a small paddling type pool for kids next to the main pool which is better but very small.  The water slides for adults are good but lifeguards basically sit and blow whistle when they want to but kids still got down together and let people wait at the exit of the slide which becomes dangerous.    The pool bar is hidden around the corner of the main pool but be prepared. The drinks are limited. Vodka rum whiskey and gin. Beer. Cocktails are basically tropical juice with liquor. The drinks are given in the smallest ‚Äòeggcup size‚Äô plastic disposable cups which is so wasteful. Why not use reusable beakers?    Also - one of the biggest problems?! WASPS there are thousands around the pool and bar. You can‚Äôt even finish a coke before they are all around you and in the cup. My son even got stung by one when walking near the kids pool.    This is a predominantly FRENCH and Arabic hotel. Very few English guests and very few English speaking staff. Be warned people are NOT clued up on how to queue either. It‚Äôs also in the middle of nowhere.    The entertainment guys - they are very fun and full of energy!! Shout out to Mouss MoMo Sergio and Greg. Always happy and entertaining and get everyone involved with games. Friendly to kids and my son made great friends with them! Amazing guys and they make the hotel what it is.    The shop on site is ridiculous. No crisps or sweets or chocolate stocked. Prices are completely ridiculous. Woman rude and wouldn‚Äôt exchange a broken water gun. Ended up with manager there as she was abusive and reporting the incident.    Rooms were good as we requested to be ground floor - cleaned daily very well.    Finally - the restaurant and food. Wow. Literally the worst food I‚Äôve ever experienced. Typically all inclusive aren‚Äôt the best but this was a joke. NO food for kids unless you want them to eat cold chips for the duration. Pizza and pasta Bologna‚Äôs is cooked fresh but the queues are 20-40mind a time bc they don‚Äôt make any in advance of the lunchtime rush. Food is bland and disgusting. I got food poisoning from chicken as well.    Most guests including us ordered in from elsewhere using Glovo app (like Deliveroo). Failing that a taxi to new town is about 120 dirham (about ¬£9/10) and new town has loads of cafes bars and restaurants as well as McDonald‚Äôs kfc and Burger King. There is a local shop which is like half the price of the on-site one about 5 mins outside main gate to hotel.    The pool bars does no snacks at all and the only snacks are at 4pm which are limited and all sweet. Pancakes donuts and croissants. As these are limited if you get there about 15 mins later they are all gone.    Such a let down bc we‚Äôd been planning this since pre lockdown so was sad it worked out this way.    Would not recommend this hotel sadly.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlyhockley

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,444bella wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Please give this hotel a wide berth!,We have just arrived home after 1 week and it‚Äôs been mostly awful :( We even looked at getting flights back home a day after we arrived but too expensive :(    First the positives; staff have mostly been lovely and have tried to deal with our issues promptly.    Negatives; Bugs all over our rooms - even in the beds. We‚Äôve had to go out and purchase bug spray ourselves and 3 bottles of bleach spray to try and keep our rooms clean.  We can‚Äôt even get soft drinks from the bar area to bring to our sunbeds as the wasps follow us and there are thousands of them.  I‚Äôve read all reviews from 2017 to present and I notice that hotel repeat the same ‚Äòwe will take note and change things etc‚Äô so why haven‚Äôt they??    The food is inedible and we have had to order fast food in at extra expense.  Restaurant is filthy and people (staff included) touching food with their hands.  Why oh why is there a massive queue for pizza?? Why dont they prepare loads already so that when the restaurant opens people don‚Äôt have to queue??    And don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs so it‚Äôs fresh as I‚Äôve seen the pancakes being made at 12.30 so they can serve them at snack time between 4-5!!    Music too loud by the pool. There‚Äôs no need for it to be that loud. Everyone agrees.    This hotel is so badly run - the worst I‚Äôve been to all over the world. I‚Äôve stayed in better 2star hotels.

If you wanted anything fresh you could get pizza but you‚Äôd be waiting in a queue for minimum 40mins for it. I‚Äôve never been away where I‚Äôve wanted to go home so much.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kate1234 wrote a review Aug 2022,10,"DON‚ÄôT WASTE MONEY, DO YOUR RESEARCH!",On arrival at Labranda targa aqua parc we were taken into reception by our private transfer who left our cases where we could check in.  We were not greeted instead a gentlemen handed  over two pieces of paper and said ‚Äòfill these in‚Äô.  We then went to sit down & my partner proceeded to ask for a pen when a female receptionist asked him to pay ‚ÄòCity tax of ¬£22‚Äô which we paid. We then had to pay ¬£10pp for towels totalling ¬£30.    We then gave the paperwork back to reception with no communication what so ever from them. They then whistled the bell boy to take our cases he then told us our room number & walked us there - we had to walk through customers playing in the pool laying on sun loungers to our room.    We then entered our room the bell boy was pleasant and showed us how to use aircon & safe we then tipped and he left. The room itself is average. Clean presentable - ALTHOUGH fridge in room has NO drinks you have to get them yourself (bottled water only no cans on fizzy unless you pay for them‚Äô there is no kettle for yourself to make drinks we paid for a family room but there was only a double bed we had to request a bed from reception which took 1hr to arrive.    After unpacking we headed out to the pool area.. we had to wait around for sunloungers as there isn‚Äôt enough for ratio of customers. The pools are awful they a lined pool lining which you can feel when you walk doesn‚Äôt feel pleasant. The edging of pool is concrete no filtration or drainage there is loose chlorine tablets left floating around the pool the steps are loose.  The childrens area there are 2 pools one by main pool and another tucked away near the slides & this one was cleaned once whilst we were here they had to pour a bucket of chlorine to shock the water this was very overpowering and very smelly. The pool had floating tissue hair plant sand all over the bottom generally very dirty. The childrens slides are a ridiculous temperature to the point they are extremely too hot to play on.  The slides are average although not enough water coming down them. Life guards only watch if they have to they don‚Äôt man the slides only blowing whistle now and again. Multiple children come down the slides at once which lots of children left in the pool when others entering pool from slide & not behind safety rope in pool. So yeah.. crap.    We then went into the food area now before I start - there is a pool bar that doesn‚Äôt provide snacks and will provide beer vodka rum gin & whisky. They have nothing else & a cocktail is fruit juice and spirit.  The main food area is absolutely diabolical. The food is horrendous there is NO childrens station for food.  Everything is the same everyday there is no change.  They use left overs from breakfast and lunch to prepare dinner that evening. The staff are incredibly rude my partner was threatened by one of the chefs. The pizza area they will only give you 2/3 slices unless your a young girl with a lovely figure. Be prepared to order takeaways we have had to buy every evening apart from our first night.  You will see a lot of people queuing for their takeaway at the front of hotel and will hear a lot of complaints.    The shop stocks no crisps chocolate if you want ice cream you have to buy from the shop although when we bought ice cream there was 5/6 left - shop is only  open 9am to 4pm.  We were very excited to be going on this holiday especially after a prolonged wait after covid we had read reviews and decided to chance it thinking it would all be ok. But I would seriously think about booking this hotel because the reviews do not lie! The hotel is awful & shouldn‚Äôt be functioning as one not should it be rated at 4* at most this hotel should be 2*.    The evening entertain is non existent all day you‚Äôll have very loud music banging out playing explicit content whilst children play in the dirty pools.    DON‚ÄôT DO IT! Shop around find something better because you‚Äôll have waisted your money.  I‚Äôm absolutely disgusted I have never in my life experienced such rudeness lack of respect negligence money orientated and the most arrogant people in any hotel we have stayed in!    * You will have towels pinched if left on sunloungers especially if they are the hotel ones you pay ¬£10pp for. If you then approach reception about this Guest services will tell you ‚ÄòWell you should have looked after your stuff better‚Äô and did the money sign with fingers told to pay another ¬£10 if we want another towel.  * The wifi in rooms is crap.  * You‚Äôll be attacked by fly‚Äôs in your room constantly along with mosquitos - no citronella about nor do they spray chemicals to prevent this.  * In main restaurant the fruit will be only one platter for breakfast it‚Äôs usually cut up Oranges & for lunch/Dinner it‚Äôs watermelon.    Would we stay here again?  Well after you‚Äôve read this you can probably tell that this would be a definite NO.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I8727KWkatiec
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Scott S wrote a review Aug 2022,30,"The good, the bad, the ugly",Firstly this hotel is definitely not a 4* hotel its a 3 at the very best.....    Location  It is literally in the middle of nowhere. If you have visions of just nipping out to a shop bar cafe restaurant etc you can't. There is nothing outside of the hotel for miles just barren landscape residential buildings construction and derelict buildings. The nearest civilisation is a 30min taxi or bus ride away.    Food  The food is repetitive and the same everyday. There is just different variations of the same thing. I like rice chicken fresh veg etc so I personally found it to be fine for me but if you are a picky eater you will struggle. As for kids there is pizza and chips and that's it. No burgers chicken nuggets no ice cream either. But everything was cooked fine and fresh. One coffee machine broke while I was there (there's only 2 in the main eating area) and 3 days later it was still broke. They also ran out of most of the alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktail juices so out of the 5 you can have only 2 were available. That was 2 days ago and they've still ran out. Water fizzy drinks and beer were plentiful though!    Rooms  The room was very clean shower was fine aircon worked as it should and it was cleaned everyday as well as fresh towels every day. Shower gel shampoo soap was also replenished everyday if needed. Room was a little dated but the bed and pillows were more than comfortable. Personally a room is a place to sleep change shower not to spend your holiday in so if its clean and comfortable it's enough for me personally. We had a ground room so no balcony but had a nice seating area outside which was more than adequate.    Pools  The main pool areas are loud with music playing daily and as expected full of families having a good time. One good thing was you don't have to get up at dawn to put your towels on sunbeds even at 10am there was plenty of free sunbeds in the main area. As two adults we never stopped in this area there is an adults only pool that is heaven. Whisper quiet relaxed clean and sunbeds aplenty anytime of the day. We really enjoyed this area a lot!    Cleanliness  As stated before the rooms were spotless. Massive credit to the room maids/cleaners they are brilliant and do a great job. Faultless. Reception area was also spotless. The food area is pretty messy and tables took a while to be cleaned as did spilt drinks and food. General upkeep of the grounds and pool areas were good though. The problem is messy people and not the staff not doing enough. More on people later.....    Amenities  I'm a regular gym goer but the gym isn't a gym. It's a tiny room with a few exercise bikes and running machines. No weights or weight machines at all. It's not a gym and never been a gym. We never visited the spa so can't comment on that. The a la carte restaurant never opened at all as did the shisha bar.    Entertainment  The animation team make it for the kids from what I saw. Every night there's a kids disco with the usual holiday type dances and things going on. This is followed by a live act usually. A snake charmer one night and an amazing solo guitarist/singer that was very talented and far to good to be doing the rounds in hotels. He made my night. As did the pool party. One night there was a pool party that was amazing. All ages in the pool until midnight having a great time and pool dancing to classic ibiza style dance music. That was quite unexpected but was great! The entertainment team do a great job really. Note all the entertainment is in French or Arabic.    The ugly bits  The thing that spoilt it the most was.....people. The sheer level of greed at eating times was unreal. People piling plate after plate then leaving half of it people literally taking an entire bread basket or fruit platter to their table then leaving most of it. Take the omelette making guy at breakfast. Makes omelettes to order so they take a few minutes. Person in front wanted 3 which is fine if they are going to eat them all. I walked past their table later on and 2 were just left untouched. Why do that? Why not get one so others in the queue get one then go back if you are still hungry? Sadly I witnessed this kind of thing at every eating time numerous times and it meant often there were no desserts left as the greedy people took them all. There is snacks at 4pm but get ready....its a total free for all and people descend like vultures as if it was the last food on earth. This is not the fault of the hotel at all. Its the greedy species that humans are that are to blame. People just pushing in hell bent on getting what they want with no respect for anyone else. Was sad to see.    Single use plastic......wow just wow. Everything is single use plastic and as drinks are served in 200ml sized cups there must be thousands of these used daily. In today's age this shouldn't be happening. Every other all inclusive I've stopped in use reusable plastic beakers that can be washed and reused. This is something the hotel needs to address and soon. I'm sure it would be more cost effective to wash the cups instead of buying millions in per year and also would create a lot less waste and mess too. I feel they are very much behind with this.    Would I stay here again? Sadly not due to the location and lack of amenities. Having said that we had an enjoyable time here and the weather is amazing. The staff were all friendly an as English travellers in a predominantly French/Arabic hotel we felt very welcome. We came to Morocco to experience the food people and culture and we definitely got that. If you are an English traveller that wants an English style hotel food and entertainment then this probably isn't the best choice for you!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rotherham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7203QRscotts

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,MariaButzki wrote a review Jul 2022,10,STOP - Beware of the following,I am sure most of us book a holiday based on reviews. I am trying to find more positive then negative because holiday is always about positivity.  Few things to be aware of  1. Its a French resort so unless you understand a bit of French then l suggest book elsewhere.  2.Breakfast is decent with quiet a few options but no matter how early you get there tables are either dirty no cutlery and paper cups.  3. Dinner is not the greatest but the worst part is dressing up to sit down to drinking from paper cups and yet again dirty tables with no cutlery.  4. The lady at the reception is always on her phone and just not friendly at all. This is the face of the hotel yet she is putting her face in the phone.  5. The pools are not very clean despite the m telling everyone to come out so they can clean.  6. The hallways really ripped carpets which can cause you to trip if you not careful.  The only thing that saves this hotel is the animation team and housekeeping.  Everything else is touch and go. Its the second time I have booked with love holidays there recommendations are not great. TUI might be a bit more pricey but l definitely recommend TUI.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Barking, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaButzki

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,RemyRx wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Great Hotel,"To be fair we were quite dubious as some of the reviews weren't the best and not great comments about the food - also because we got the hotel and flights for an amazing price for a holiday in July.    The hotel was excellent the food is of a very good standard and the Moroccan dishes were very good - I can see why people say it is repetitive but there were different types of tagines pretty much every night but as they are tagines they can appear similar and it was great tasting some authentic food.    Also available was the fresh stone baked pizza and the fresh pasta station - the pizza was amazing and loved by all members of the family. Drink glasses were a bit small but there is a free standing drinks dispenser with Pepsi/7 Up etc and wine also available.    Rooms were a decent size very clean room and bedding. Daily maid service with shampoo and shower gel bottles in the bathroom that were replenished everyday.    Pools were great and the 3 teenage boys enjoyed the slides but could do with more matting as can be dangerous due to it being very slippy. Plenty of sunbeds available but not all with shade/parasol.    Staff were very good and no issues - - one of the waiters did try sell us a trip though but we booked a great excursion to desert and waterfalls through TripAdvisor.    Location was actually great as we didn't want to be right in Marrakech otherwise the hotel would have been smaller with smaller pools. Taxi for 5 was 120 dirhams (¬£10) to the main square we also took the hotel bus most days which was at 9am and 3pm.  BE WARNED - as soon as you get off the bus you will be approached by fake travel guides and they will say for example "" The bus back is at 6pm"" and pretend to be with hotel/bus and try and take you round the medina at a cost! Ignore them and walk towards the horse and carriages and from there you will be at the main square.    Overall an excellent holiday but a few minor gripes:  No make up mirror/dressing room mirror in the bedroom and ladies will have to use the bathroom.  Also take your own toilet roll as the one the hotel supplies is very poor quality.  Some of teh tables in the dining are were abit    We did walk to Carrefour supermarket on the first evening which is 20-30 mins away but was good to see the amazing variety available. Also went to Burger King next door.    Overall a great destination very good hotel for the price with decent food and excellent service - maybe avoid July/August as can be unbearably hot! Due to the number of pools and water slides this is a family hotel with children and as such can be noisy especially by the main pool looking at previous reviews it seems some people have got a bit confused!",Date of stay: July 2022,,"Crewe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RemyRx
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Donna C wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Lovely lively hotel with great animation team!,We have just returned after a weeks holiday at your hotel! We were so so pleased at the cleanliness of the grounds the gardens and rooms! The lively hotel pool by day was amazing! Special thanks to Zak Abdul and Ben who were so friendly and welcoming and did their very best to involve everyone in the daily activities! My daughter is a dancer and so they always asked her to get involved with the dancing etc etc! Lovely lads! A credit to the hotel!  A special mention to Cherif who worked on the outside seating area of the restaurant! He went out of his way to make sure all the guests were happy with their table situation( with the hot sunshine) and was just lovely!  A really good selection of foods breakfast and lunchtime! We were really happy with the omelette chef as well as the Moroccan bread station pizza and pasta! The salads were always lovely and fresh and there was always so much choice. It did get very busy in the restaurant with tables uncleared and very untidy areas but I presume this is down to the lack of staff. It‚Äôs a shame as this is really our only criticism. We tended to go into the city by taxi on an evening to experience the restaurants and night life with our daughter.  The daily drinks were absolutely spot on! We enjoyed our daily pina‚Äôs and marrakech cocktails and beers( although needed to be replenished quicker to allow to always have cold ones) water was freely available which was great as the temperature was roasting!  The water slides were great! We had fun on them! Just needed more matting to avoid slips!  Generally really pleased with the hotel! Easy to order taxis! Sorted our safe out and were friendly on reception!  Thank you for a really lovely stay!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tom wrote a review Jul 2022,20,Won't come again,I've specifically made this account to air my frustrations about the hotel and the sheer lack of cohesion within the dinning area. Firstly the food is the same constantly and poor quality. The frustrating thing is that there are no staff to clear tables. No glasses for drinks. On one occasion we resulted In taking our food back to the room due to the lack of clear tables.    The entertainment team is good. I feel sorry for them really as they have to deal with inadequate equipment. Ben is a real shinning star and made my daughter feel comfortable around him. The one problem with the entertainment is that it's all in French barely any translation.    No complaints at all about the cleanliness of the room.    The overall take from the hotel is that it could be so much better. It seems the company that run it have really cut back to save money.    Hopefully someone will read this and take it as feedback and improve otherwise I can see people not coming back again.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4841FQthomasw

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Michelle wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Just arrived home,To start with the ride from the airport was a bumpy one not bad just crazy drivers on mopeds but I guess that is the norm in the area. The hotel is very clean room cleaned every day fresh towels everyday even when not required. The mattress was very hard could probably do with extra pillows being available in the room too    The animation team were all friendly guys especially Abdul and Zac Abdul always had a chat with as many people as possible around the pool and Zac was always up for a laugh they work long days but were always smiling!  If you don't like the busy pool then the adult only pool is a good choice but it's a walk to the bar!    The food was as expected same dishes daily breakfast was our favourite. If you don't like traditional morrocan food there's always the pizza and pasta to choose from.  The shop at the hotel is rubbish and very overpriced no snacks etc just gifts and as the closest shop outside the hotel is a good 20 min walk away it could do with having more in plus the lady who works in there is a bit miserable too.    The free shuttle bus is a big plus they go twice a day to both the old and new towns be warned though if you're late for the bus it will go without you    Overall we had a lovely week,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellegJ8521SP

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Liz wrote a review Jun 2022,40,D√©paysant,Overall a very good experience. The hotel is incredibly clean and most of the personnel is adorable (except the front desk).    We spent a week here on an all inclusive basis to get rest.    A lot of good points to the hotel :  -great breakfast  -clean and big rooms  -number of pools including an adults only very relaxing pool. Lovely park    However...  -thr front desk is not responsive to the client's needs...it took us two days to get our room changed when we were explicit after the first night that it was mega noisy as it was on the pool and they have a nightclub on the pool (don't stay in rooms like 1228)  -.the all inclusive is sort of limited for the drinks and the non alcoholic ones are basically sugary syrup  -the representative for Fram (and most other operators) serves no purpose ...we asked for a private tour and guide and figured out after asking local friends that the price is the double of what we should have paid. And literally with the problems we had with the room the only way we got anything done was to do it ourselves    We did really enjoy the stay. But next time we will clearly ask for a room far from the main pool and will find our own tourist guides!.  -  -,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerlizsellam

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Nusrat wrote a review Jun 2022,30,AVOID SPA IN THE HOTE!!!,I am writing this review in detail as i do not want anyone else to spend lots of money and be dissapointed.    I am going to write my experience at Labranda targa aqua park.  Reached Labranda on 31/5/22.  Left on 5/6/22  The hotel itself was very good.  Cannot complain about service from reception to cleaning staff.  All were lovely and very helpful..made you feel very homely whilst our stay.  A big thank you to Sukaina(Suki) who was our saving grace during the stay who helped us lots as we didnt speak arabic and french.  The rooms wre standard.  I had a room with a terrace..which was ok.  Beds are a little hard..be prepared for that.. they supply shampoo and shower gel in the rooms.  The food was amazing especially the salad bar either that be at breakfast time/ dinnertime or snack time.  Theres a few pools you can go to..Aqua park is not that big only 4 slides...Cannot complain.    Spa in the hotel review.  I paid for some spa treatments which i really want people to read about.  Firstly i had a pedicure done which i paid 250 dirhams.  The lady was very rough when she was doing it..really hurt me.  I had some hard skin on one foot..she said it was excema..  Language is a big barrier here as they dont understand.  So the pedicure started with the lady shaping and buffing my nails..which were not done properly..the nails were not filed properly at all and not straight.  Then she applied a couple of drops of mud clay on my feet and told me to put them in water which wasnt even warm to soften my skin..so was quite dissapointed.    Also i had all ready booked in for a hammam for me and my daughter and a facial with a massage which i paid 1200 dirhams around 91.00 uk pounds.  My daughter couldnt have the hamam for personal reasons so had to speak to the manager who i found very unreasonable..would not come to any agreement when i said can you change the hamam to another treatmemt.. as she cant have it.  She would not budge..she said basically..either she has it or leaves it. In the end i manage to get  an extra 20 minute of massage extra for me. Which i didnt get  So the hammam started.. a lady took me in the room told me to get changed into a gown.  Took me into the hammam room.  She threw water on me then just left me in the room..i was thinking whats this then she came back after 10 minutes..then she applied some scrub and shower gel that they use as in the hotel and then left again for 10 minutes..really annoyed this time..when she came back i said where..she said it was hot.  Then she got a scrubbing mitt and started to scrub me all over..a quick scrub and put the same scrub she put on my body on my face..so thought the facial had started..which was suposed to last 20 min but only lasted 5 min!  Then she told me to get under a shower and i washed everything off..then she shampood my hair and i washed it out.. so wasnt impressed.  What made this hammam different to me having a shower. When i was taken to the massage room.. i had booked the deep tissue massage but the lady was not applying any pressure at all..had to call another girl and manager to sort this out.  So really not please with my experience at the spa.  DO NOT BOOK HERE FOR ANYTHING.  NO HYGENE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN.  I would love to go back to Labranda but i will not be going back to the spa.  It is a shame as all things are abit far from the hotel..  Nearest burger king is 5 minutes away..by taxi should cost 25 dirhams.  We had to get a 8 seater when we went out to the city a few times..which cost us 150 dirhams each way.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zahraa952

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Safina A wrote a review May 2022,40,Labranda Tagra Aqua Park,Absolutely amazing hotel room cleaned daily by cleaners who do an amazing job clean towels shampoos bodywash soap hair cap provided daily.  Entertainment and entertainers are faultless as they entertain throughout the while day and night till about 11.30/12.  5 pool to meet everyone's requirements and 4 waterslides. Enough deck chairs and parasols to go around.  No need to take towels as pool side towels provided for 100 dirrams each which is refunded at end of stay. You get white receipt from reception that you take to pool side service area and they exchange for a towel which can be changed as many times as required.  This resort is a bit further out to the city so if you like to site see and enjoy markets ect the hotel provide 2 free shuttle vans which transport about 17 people. One at 9am and one at 3pm both for a 3hr slot so drop you off and pick you up 3 hrs later. The only issue is you have to book the morning before and usually its full. If you decide to get a taxi you will be oaying 100 dirrams each way.  Food is buffet style and that is the only down fall as its the same repetitive food and its moroccan style. Not much of a selection as other resorts I've stayed at offered but never the less still good.  Security at hotel is on point too have a guard at gate and once through main gates you drive into a long drive to the main entrance you are greeted with 2 more guards and a metal detector machine like ones in airport that you walk through.  This resort is big and have an onsite shop for your basic needs like crisps drinks toiletries ect.    Things that could be improved on is selection of food.  My recommendation to the resort is that they should look into serving ice cream during the day as its very hot and nothing beats a cold ice cream near the pool üòÉ also a third shuttle as 2 is not enough 1 in morning 1 afternoon one evening then it would be perfect.

When we arrived the reception area was very busy during the check in time but what was impressing is how the staff ( Mr simohamed and Mr Ilyess) both handled the pressure by staying calm and polite and also very attentives they did a great job setiously i was amazed by them even if it was only them two dealing with lot of customers.  We had our room which was clean and perfect for us. The buffet was good and the swimming pool was very well maintened.Also i want to mention the amazing job the animation team did that night for the adults and kids.  Next morning before check out i had to phone a taxi but my phone ( UK sim card ) somehow did not work so i asked Mr Abderahman for a phone that i can use to make the call straight away handeled the phone to me to sort out the call.  This place was recommended to me by a friend who is a regular there and i was not dissapointed tbh  and i am recommanding it by my turn to other people and i will visit soon.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Samantha W wrote a review May 2022,50,Perfect holiday,we booked this hotel last minute we hadn‚Äôt been away for 3 years due to covid so just booked whatever we could find this hotel popped up and we were sceptical at first but this is one of the best hotels I‚Äôve been to! Firstly the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful our flight got delayed so we arrived late at night and we were offered some food and drink to take to our room. the entertainment staff are exceptional encouraging everyone to get involved in activities the aqua aerobics was brilliant they make you feel very comfortable. the grounds are very well kept and the pools/water slides are great. My only little moan would be they are French speaking and just presume you speak French we‚Äôve had many occasions where we are approached in French and even when we say we are English they continue speaking French but we got used to this and the food is labelled in French which is hard because my friend is vegetarian so was abit cautions of what the food was,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthawE5806JA

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,neilthetourist wrote a review May 2022,50,Lovely hotel,We were only in Marrakech for 3 nights as part of a package deal and this was the hotel chosen for us. We were all inclusive and can't fault it at all.    The staff were were really helpful and friendly on arrival and are always there if you need anything. Reception work hard and yet still find the time to help you when busy and that was appreciated. You can change money here and it's not much different in rate to the Medina.    The room was very clean and we had a great balcony view out across the orchards at the back. Very quiet at night. There is hotel entertainment at night if you choose the stay on site or they will order you a taxi into town at any time.    Being Ryanair we needed to print return boarding passes and reception did this for us. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody wanting to stay outside of the city.    Big thank you to reception for yesterday morning when I wasn't sure if my pre-booked transfer was arriving. They booked me a taxi just incase for peace of mind...made it a lot easier for us. Staff are all friendly so don't miss the chance to say hello to them.    For the all inclusive the food was always fresh and you can get beers and cocktails at the bar as and when you want to. Service really quick so it's all well organised.,Date of stay: May 2022,,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neilthetourist
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sarah B wrote a review May 2022,40,Overall great holiday,Very good variety of food for all 3 meals of the day great selection to cater for all appetites.  Rooms were clean and well maintained.  Adequate sunloungers and choice of 4 pools for adults and a further 2 childrens pools. Slides were open from around 10:30 and closed for a few hours over lunch but then back on around 3pm.  Pool bar is open and offers snacks after breakfast and lunch. Staff friendly and only moan about the bars was they ran out of vodka and gave gin instead obtaining more.  Main bar shows sports and if you ask reception then they will put it to whichever game you want. Sports bar shows games on big projector screen but image was quite blurry and cocktails not worth their price considering you can take your all inclusive drinks in there.  Entertainment team were great very friendly and welcoming in particular Khalid was fantastic.  Shuttle bus runs 9am into the old town you need to book well in advance as limited spaces. This is well worth the trip but beware of the Henna Tattoo ladies they will just grab your hand and put henna on it and then wanting to be paid. Haggle the traders the price they first say is about 50% extra on what they will take.  Use the excursions in the town for a better deal than the hotel offers we save about 50% by doing this for the same trips!,Date of stay: May 2022,,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahbU6001KG

Food was good and the place was spotless clean.  The only things that let i the holiday down were the French guests being abusive to the staff and having no life guard on the adults only pool and people bringing their kids into that section. To be fair once you told the staff that this was happening they sorted it but that was the only hotel let down. Staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for the guests. Animation team and life guards were amazing.

The hotel is quite a way from the old and new towns but they run a bus in twice a day for 3 hours at a time. The Cosy Bar is a bit small the entertainment is repetitive and loud but we were not really interested in this anyway. Some of the facilities were still closed but not an issue for capacity of hotel. Would have been really nice to try the Moroccan restaurant but this was closed. Too many children running in the main restaurant with plates full of food and drinks. Adult's only pool was nice and quiet. Highly recommend this for a base in Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass40801548363

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Waiidah M wrote a review Oct 2021,20,Not a 4* hotel,When booking online we read shuttle is available every 2 hours however when we got there we found out the shuttle only leaves at 3pm and pick up is at 6pm which was an awkward time. The jemaa square gets busy with stalls set up after 6pm and this is the time recommended to visit. As it is just outside the main centre we were forced to use taxi drivers often complained how far the hotel is and recommended we stay closer to the centre of Marrakesh next time. Not the best hotel if you want to explore Marrakesh.    Food:  The variety of food quality was terrible. Breakfast cost ¬£14 for a bowl of cereal each which was not worth the price for us. The lunch wasn‚Äôt great either costing around ¬£18 each. There is not much options of leaving the hotel to grab something nearby as there isn‚Äôt any shops close.    Room:  The room was so basic there was no kettle no drinking water. One evening after we returned from a day out my husband went to the reception to ask where he can purchase drinking water from as we sometimes get thirsty during the night. They apparently didn‚Äôt have any bottles. This is a cause for concern staying in a hot country and if anyone had health conditions and required water during the night it‚Äôs dangerous to think there is no drinking water available.  Further more the room did not have an iron - we had to pay ¬£20 deposit for an iron which we got back at the end of our stay.    However the Pool and design of the reception area was great!,Date of stay: October 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waiidah

The hotel itself was spotlessly clean and the staff work tirelessly inside and outside to make sure everything is up to standard. The food was lovely and varied and we enjoyed everything we ate. The lunchtime BBQ's were really good. Lots of fresh salad at every meal and a fantastic pizza station. The rooms were a really good size with large balconies.

As for the hotel it was very basic for the room the food was always cold and run out super quick. The snacks were hilarious as they represented some small pieces of dough and few leaves of lettuce. Wifi didn‚Äôt work in the room.    What really made it for me was the little office in the lobby called the Meeting Point and their amazing fabulous attentive warm welcoming professional upbeat enthusiastic employee by the name of Khalid Zehraoui. God was he not the best?! He was THE BEST person and the trip breaker as he booked me on the wonderful camel ride and a 4x4 Safari tour. That was my best experience and I love Morocco just for that exceptional experience Khalid provided.    If you ever go to Targa ask for Khalid at the Meeting point and he will hook you up with the best excursion recommendation. He is an expert and his hard work and caring personality is just out of the roof.    Mr. Zehraoui is the best contribution of Labranda Targa and my trip went phenomenal just because of him. I would recommend this hotel just because of Khalid.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeannetteo179
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,honeysusie wrote a review Mar 2020,30,No help in a crisis.,We arrived and our room was very nice. Spacious and with a view from the big balcony. The staff appeared friendly and helpful. The food was plentiful and varied and there was something for everyone. The pool area was nice with a quiet pool for adults only. It was clean and comfortable. There was a bus to take you to the old or new town several time a day as it was a distance from the centre. The lobby was spacious and comfortable with plenty of seating. However the drinks in the all inclusive package were terrible. We ended up going to the sports bar in the evening and paying for our drinks. Everything changed on day 4 when Morocco announced it was closing its borders due to the Covid 19 virus. The wifi was only in the public spaces and in a crisis like that it was a drawback. People were distressed as flights were being cancelled. At this point the staff appeared to lose interest in us when they realised that we were going. They were at best indifferent and at worst were rude. We were lucky as our flight still came for us on the Thursday but we had three days of dwindling and worse food and fewer facilities as the staff were told to leave. I realise this was exceptional circumstances but the staff could have been a little more helpful. They were either lovely or indifferent. To be fair for the money we paid the holiday and hotel would have been fine under normal circumstances. If the holiday went as planned I would have been happy except for the terrible drinks.,Date of stay: March 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honeysusie
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Debbie H wrote a review Mar 2020,30,"Started off bad, but got better.",Original review: I normally wait until I have stayed the duration at a hotel to review it to give it a chance. However having complained to reception about a few issues I feel it is necessary to add a review early.  Pros: room is a good size cleaned daily the pool areas are nice - although cool - but lovely and clean. Breakfast is great.  Cons: food at any other time of day is limited and when they run out it‚Äôs gone. Equally they have run out of beer at the bars (although the bar in which you pay have beer!) similarly the spirits are clearly watered down. The rooms don‚Äôt have any drawers and no tea/coffee making facilities.  Having complained to reception they pay little attention and tell you to take it up with the bar manager in the morning. Surely they all work for one hotel?????  Not at all what I expect from a hotel claiming to be 4*    Update: the last few days of our stay the food had improved and was replenished regularly. The spirits did not improve and it was hit and miss if you received a really strong drink or a weak one. It was clearly an issue with the spirits as we ordered them separate to the coke so we could mix them ourselves.    The entertainment staff work really hard and are extremely friendly and the rest of the staff would benefit from taking the same approach.    By the end of the stay it had improved - enough that I have given it an extra star. Given what we paid it was good value for money but to say it is anymore than three star is misleading.,Date of stay: March 2020,,"Worcester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieH620

Drinks are very low quality cocktails are just premix syrup in very small plastic cups and the wait at the bar can be lengthy. Food is quite limited and I think it would be hard to feed children here. I think lunch was the best meal I rarely enjoyed the food and found it cold mostly. This is a low cost hotel so you can‚Äôt really complain. The women at reception offer some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced and couldn‚Äôt be more unhelpful.

You walk straight into the pool area which looks very nice and has the flumes at the top end of the hotel. The main pool is very noisy not sure the animation team are aware of the volume button as the music is very loud. The food in the main Resturant is spot on. The bar is ok but very little choice in drink and the two guys who work on a night need a crash course in manners and learn how to smile. The pluses over shadow the minuses and I would go back.

The hotel itself looks amazing and it was always clean and the grounds are very well maintained. All the staff were very friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.    The swimming pools were a little cold which didn‚Äôt bother me but it did stop our two children who were 3 and 2 at the time from going in the pool for most of our stay. Me and my wife enjoyed the slides and I think we had more fun than the kids.    The restaurant was nice and the food was very well presented but there wasn‚Äôt much choice for the kids. They have a pizza corner but the kids soon got bored of that after a few days. But other than that there was no complaints.    The main reason we had such a great holiday was because of the entertainment team. They were so fantastic and they all work so hard. They made such an effort to get to know you and they all made us feel so welcome. A big shout out to Ricky Mousse Amine and Nani. They all made such a fuss of the kids the kids loved learning all the dance routines at the kids club before the entertainment started. The entertainment was very good and the comedy show they put on was brilliant.    We all had such a great time and have made some wonderful memories and got to meet some truly great people.    We will be back!    Thank you,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Herne Bay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenCFC13

The hotel has so much to offer all day and night that you can enjoy the daily activities including step aerobics zumba all day pool music and a fabulous kids club run by the amazing Nani. We found the whole place spotlessly clean the hotel staff very friendly and approachable and the entertainment team are such hard working troupers.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,genie555 wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Great hotel,Went 26 feb 2020 for a week. This review is from the viewpoint of 3 female friends aged 60 plus.  Hotel impressive on arrival beautifully clean with immaculate grounds. All the staff are very hard working friendly and helpful. Food is delicious plentiful and varied on a daily basis. Trick with AI food is try what you dont know instead of trying something you think you know then complaining when it dosnt taste the same as it does at home. The kitchen is preparing food for many different nationalities. Plenty of salads all fresh lovely fresh bread and lots of different desserts. Animation team work hard from morning till late at night entertaining everyone. We didn't participate but enjoyed watching others having fun. 5 Pools were good and clean but cold. Lots of people used them tho. Evening entertainment a bit loud and chaotic for me but families and children appeared to love it. Happy kids happy parents. The only setback as far as I was concerned was there was no quiet bar in the evening. Everything happened in the cosy bar quiz karaoke kids disco. There is a theatre but was used only twice while I was there so very noisy. You could sit outside but was still noisy and chilly. There is a separate bar where you can pay for drinks but this was also noisy due to TVs showing football etc. We did have a great holiday and came home very chilled out with a nice tan. Would I recommend...yes to families. Would I go back maybe if I got a good deal on the price. I do enjoy some live music in a relaxed setting in the evening sadly this was missing.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genie555

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,SidariRules wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Nice relaxing stay,Just returned from a wonderful weeks stay.    We arrived around 2200 on Saturday evening after a delay flying out so missed the evening meal however reception had arranged for some.food to be made available.    The reception area is huge and lots of comfy seating areas.    Our room was clean and tidy with a fridge in the room however was expecting water but none put in.    The room was cleaned every day and the towels also changed every day.  There was a tv in the room with a few english channels which was enough.    There is 3 pools which included the water slides and plenty sun loungers not many parasols and 1 adult only pool which we spent the majority of our holiday round very relaxing only issue we found were the pools were freezing cold and not very clean in the main pools there was sand on the bottom and the adult pool just needed a good clean.  When you arrive at the hotel you can get a token for towel hire which you can only exchange at 10am they will not change throughout the day.    The gardeners all do a fantastic job of keeping the grounds well maintained and tidy.    There is some lovely Moroccan lights situated all around the site which really gives a nice touch in the evening.    There.is wifi which you obtain a code from reception that lasts for a week the wifi is everywhere except your room which is a little disappointing but manageable.    The dining area is quite small for the size of the complex so when there is a lot of guests in the hotel the staff struggle to keep up with the cleaning of the tables and resetting for the next diners a number of times the tables were left full of dirty plates and people were stood around waiting for a table.to be cleaned.    Food was adequate enough choice breakfast continental an omelette bar which was really nice.  There is always a fresh salad bar.    Pudding wasnt the best but not the be all etc.  Drinks.in the restaurant are very limited only wine beer and soft drinks no hot drinks at night.    Drinks in the bar or main area were again very limited local beer storks whixh was ok but you were not given the bottle they served it in a plastic reusable cup the red wine was actually really nice but again disappointing when your in the main.bar and they serve them.the reusable plastic glasses rather than serving in a proper glass.  Bottles of water are.always readily available in the bar areas and free.    There is entertainment in the day around the pool and also in the evening in the Theatre but very much based for french clientele in the main bar area there was a singer who was the same every night he was good but very repetitive.    My partner was feeling a little I'll whilst away and the hotel photographer couldn't do enough for us he drove to the chemist and picked up some prescriptions and paid for it all and delivered it to us. That's what you call fantastic service.  Overall we would stay again.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,reading,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SidariRules

Food plenty almost the same everyday more quantity than quality. Was advertised as all inclusive with hot and cold drinks at all mealtimes. But hot drinks were only available at breakfast. My husband and I both only have hot drinks with food and most people like a coffee after meals. And to make matters worse there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room poor for a four star hotel.  Doors to wardrobe and to the balcony had oily finger/hand marks on it more likely from suntan oil.

We wanted a relaxing break and this hotel having done our research fitted the bill. Its in the middle of nowhere but there is a shuttle bus to the old town and the new town. Room and grounds were immaculate there's always somebody cleaning or maintaining. We didn't want to get involved in any activities but there were reps available doing all sorts from Arabic lessons to yoga. We are quite adventurous with food so had no problems in that regard but we saw some people who really struggled. One couple said that they lived on chips and pizza for a week (they only serve chips at lunch) so they really found it hard.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/590janicel
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Karishma wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Good stay,First off great hotel we had our room upgraded on check in which was a nice start! There is only wifi in public areas and not in the rooms which was annoying when we wanted to look something up for the next day once back in the room. We only stayed 3 nights so wasn't a major issue. Food wise good choice unless you are a fussy eater like me! The Wednesday we were there was a Moroccan night which was great. Other people staying longer had said the food gets very repetitive. Bottled water available whenever needed and drinks dispensers at dinner. Was chilly when we went so didn't use the pool. The hotel shuttle was very useful to get us to the centre just prebook the night before with reception. We missed our one back to the hotel as we needed more time in the centre and the driver let us onto the next one which was very kind.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Staines, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karishma95patel
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Cynthia A wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Amazing Hotel but restrictive for large Groups,I stayed here last year with a group of 24 to celebrate my daughter's birthday.  The hotel was in an isolated location but offered a free local transport system so it was easy to visit new and old parts of the city.  The reception was large with quick check in. There was plenty of seating areas with tables a balcony a tea area and an excursions booking area (Meeting point)which were excellent and offered a great friendly service to ensure we had a great trip with fun at reasonable prices.  Off the reception was a small hallway to 2 social areas opposite each other. Both social areas were large with plenty of seating area but 1 (the TV lounge bar) was for relaxing with great mood lighting but quiet and the other was more the party room with DJ or live music and a dance area but still had a couple of large TV screens wall mounted. Both room had their own bar but only the bar in the dancing area was part of the all-inclusive package.  Further up this hall way was the entertainment room where live shows were acted out by the entertainment staff and they were so wonderful that a birthday cake was arranged on my daughter's birthday and presented to her on stage with everyone singing Happy Birthday.  Opposite the entertainment room was the restaurant with indoor seating and outdoor seating. There was plenty of buffet style food servings with deserts alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks as well as a pizza and pasta area. The food was great and I'm sure there's enough variety to suit all. The outdoor seating area was great as alongside the pool area but separated by a short fence and covered by a mesh which still enabled the sun in with trees intermingled giving it a courtyard look.  The pools were amazing and the best part of the hotel as they were massive with one having 3 long and tall slides although the water was too cold so it took some getting use to. There were plenty of sun loungers but limited parasols with even sun loungers artistically placed along an aisle between 2 pools which was a great layouts for photos. They had aqua aerobics at pool side with other entertainment DJ and table tennis. The pool side bar wasn't quite at the pool but near enough with it's own seating area and great cocktails although only with about 4 to choose from.  The spa was not part of the all-inclusive deal but reasonably price. The spa area was dark and relaxing with Jacuzzis and body scrubs areas.  The hotel was pretty at night with lots of suitably placed lighting and Moroccan looking style lighting  The shisha bar had plenty of seating areas with many available shisha and had the latest opening time to 1am although the bar was not part of the all-inclusive package. However as it was near the rooms a quiet policy was in operation which was hard in a group of 24 excited young people. One night the staff became irate with our noise levels and one particular staff member called Jacques Peters became unprofessional shouting uncontrollably and even throwing a chair out of his way. I did think it was an unnecessary level of reaction and he needs to attend customer training to know how to deal with people without losing his temper and becoming threatening. The rest of the staff were friendly and understanding even allowed us to use another room that evening away from other sleeping guests. Luckily that one incident didn't spoil our trip or the rest of our stay at the hotel.  The hotel also had a doctor's clinic from 10am to 6pm a gym with 6 pieces of equipment but only 2 working when we were there  The rooms were situated on 2 or 3 level floors that were open so the sun shone through every where and around a square that had trees growing up through the middle. Each room had a balcony with chairs and a table. The view was of olive trees or the quiet pool. There was a full length mirror as you entered with a build in wardrobe that had a safe a sofa bed and twin beds divided by a bedside table with a telephone on a desk with a flat screen TV on and a fridge incorporated in it.  The bathroom had a single sink with not enough shelving and limited toiletries but a large shower and a hair dryer.  Overall an amazing hotel on a vast but secluded location with amazing pools food and entertainment. Only 1 staff member needs customer training and large groups may have to adapt their noise levels which can be restrictive when trying to have fun on holiday.,Date of stay: March 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaA8

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Benji wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Amazing,Just got back and what can I say other than amazing. We travelled as 2 couples.  *Rooms were big and cleaned daily lots of lights in them however these had poor lighting (low voltage) for the ladies to do make-up and hair.  *Food was amazing loads of options to choose from and different meals every day except breakfast which was the same daily but did have lots of choices to mix it up each day.  *Hotel is really smart looking and the staff are amazing they work tirelessly to make your holiday special especially the Maxi Club team (Mousse your a legend). They all put in 110% for 12 hours a day they go out of their way to get to know the guests even when they are on a break they are worth every penny they're paid and then some. The bar staff and waiters were amazing too especially Ibdel who held the fort at the pool bar all day every day.  *Location is so out of the way it suited us as we only wanted to chill by the pool everyday. If you were to walk out of the hotel there is nothing but baron land and empty broken buildings around. The hotel does do loads of tours and a bus into the medina if you wanted it though.  *Languages - The staff accommodate loads of languages but mostly French Arabic and English.  *Don't read into negative reviews as this place was brilliant.    All in all this was my wife and I favourite All-inclusive holiday we cant wait to rebook here again (with our kids this time).

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Natalie Williamson wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Marrakesh Magic at Labranda,Let me put everyone straight about this resort. It is exceptional we simply could not fault it.    After visiting and experiencing it all for myself I felt sorry for the staff putting up with the guests who gave such negative reviews. Completely unjustified.    The position of the tranquil hotel was perfect away from the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to visit by shuttle buses kindly provided by the staff.    The variety and quality of fresh food was incredible as was the pleasant outside area to enjoy fresco dining. The water slides. football basketball and evening entertainment was perfect for the kids . The animation team worked tirelessly to provide the guests with amusement and were helpful in every way.    I could waffle on endlessly but to re-cap do not listen to the sad negative reviews which are completely untrue.

I already can't wait to return next year!    ROOMS  Our room was spacious bright and very clean.  The bed was made each day and new towels and toiletries given.  Lovely view of the adult pool from the room!    FOOD (all inclusive)  The food options were plentiful. At breakfast there was a very popular omelette bar and fresh pancakes being made.  At lunch and dinner there were so many choices always 3 or 4 tagines different cooked chicken/beef/fish and lots of salads. Dessert choices were lovely too.  There were always non-Moroccan options provided if you wanted (E.g. Pasta some chips) however be prepared for plenty of delicious Moroccan food!  Snacks were served at 3-5 and were typically cakes pastries and sandwiches.  All-inclusive alcohol was nice and did the job! The wine with lunch and dinner was very lovely.    Cons: food labels at lunch and dinner were in french. This was OK for me as I speak enough French to understand them but could be an issue for others.  Glasses alcohol was served in were rather small but easy enough to ask for 2 drinks at a time to get around this.    ENTERTAINMENT  There is an animation team working tirelessly everyday hosting activities such as Zumba darts football etc and all free of charge!  There is also a sports bar in the building (did not go into as I'm not a sports lover) as well a ""cosy bar"" which opens in the evenings and plays live music.  There are water slides in one of the pools which were very well kept as well as an adult only pool away from all the noise. There was also a small toddler pool available.  There is a spa on site but treatments are charged. I had a 45 minute massage for approx ¬£20 and I cannot recommend it enough - it was so relaxing.  There is also a shisha bar which charges approx ¬£10 for shisha - this was a lovely way to relax.    Cons: pool was cold but to be expected in February. Not really an issue.  Aqua zumba was advertised but did not go ahead. Again likely because pool was cold and really not the end of the world.  Shisha bar drinks were not included in the all-inclusive and most definitely weren't the alcohol advertised (I ordered a Gordon's pink gin and can assure you it definitely wasn't). You can bring your all-inclusive drinks into the shisha lounge so just do that and save money.    SURROUNDING AREA  There is a supermarket 25 minute Walk away (Or 5 mins in a taxi costing approx ¬£6 each way)  The hotel also provides a free shuttle to the old and new Town.

Out of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech so it you want the best of both worlds this has it as the free shuttle bus will take you to and from Marrakech.  2. Really good price for all inclusive  3. Animation staff - they could do no more if they tried! They are so full of energy and they seem to be there 24/7 really friendly team and never without a smile!  4. Plenty of sun loungers around the 5 pools even if we went down at 2pm we could always find a coupe    Negatives    1. I know this would of been out of season but in the buffet area half the drinks machines didn't work  we were forever going round looking for cutlery and glasses in the restaurant to.  2. The noise at night we do like to go to bed quite early but the 5 nights we were there every night there was some sort of noise going on to 3-4 am music karaoke etc.  3.The onsite shop clearly states on the door opens at 8m on certain days so one morning I went down at 10.30 closed asked at reception and they said the staff isn;t here yet she will be here soon!  4. 4 times during a 5 night stay our key card stopped working for our room and we needed to go down to reception and get this reactivated  5. I know food is different for everyone but some lunches/dinners there was lots of choice for us then other times there was not 1 thing we liked (again this is personal choice)    the resort could defiantly improve just a few little things!,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glasgow3826

We found it was very clean the staff were really friendly. The food was lovely with a good selection but it was the same food most days- not a problem as we weren't there very long. The PIZZA was amazing!!! Only thing that could have been better was the walls were not well insulated and we could hear people talking next door to us and hear them having a shower in the morning other then that no complaints at all! The hotel is quite out the way from everywhere else but there is a free shuttle bus to two different locations a new town and an old one both interesting especially the old town. I wouldn't recommend staying more then 4 nights as there isn't much to do at the hotel itself except lounge by the pool and too far from anything else to go out at night.

I've read recent questionable reviews and can only think that the guests are just fussy people! The majority of staff ate friendly a little effort to speak in French or even trying Arabic goes a long way! The animation team are fantastic and super friendly we participated in the plethora of activities on offer and enjoyed it but if you just want to chill by the pool they're more than happy to leave you be. The food is a little repetitive but there's always pizza if you dont fancy what's on offer - saying that it wasn't often that there wasnt something to suit. The rooms are clean and tidy with a daily housekeeping option. The slides are an added extra. I would recommend this hotel without a doubt and would love to return!,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Grimsby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gemwez95

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Carole P wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Fantastic few days,After reading some of the reviews here on Tripadvisor I was keeping an open mind but not expecting such a fantastic experience  First impressions were of the beautiful entrance and pool views the room was of a good standard -one point is I should have asked for one with a balcony and but it was spacious very clean and had a lovely powerful shower  The food was interesting quite a few Moroccan dishes that were delicious but on the days I felt like something more simple there were salads and soups and even good quality pizzas from the pizza oven and chips !  Don't expect a full english breakfast but there were freshly cooked omelettes and eggs  plenty of continental fare and fleshly cooked pancakes.  The evening entertainment was acceptable a show or a live singer karaoke and fun with the entertainments team  The pool was not the warmest but it was early February and we didn't use the aqua slides -but it seemed the people that did were having great fun- there is a quiet pool if you just want to relax away form the animated areas  The staff were friendly and helpful and the shuttle bus a nice touch to get to and from the center of Marrakesh  We cant wait to go back next year or before and would recommend this hotel to anyone not wanting to be too far from the center and hustle and bustle in a quiet quarter of the city,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Dorchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolep994

The entertainment staff were fantastic and the staff in the restaurant could not be more friendly. However the reason I didn't give my review 5 stars is the attitude of the ladies on the reception desk and the pool bar staff. I would suggest a customer service training course for them.  I was dreading the food as the reviews were bad for this. I found it to be of good standard and a good variety.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Susan Jagnarine wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Wonderful Stay!!! Will 100% stay there again,To the beautiful people of Labranda Resort! You have made my journey to Morocco the most fantastic experience of a lifetime. From the time I arrived at your resort getting out of my airport transfer you treated me with class. The bell boy Bob was amazingly kind and welcoming and helped me from that day forward. I was there at this resort for 7 days and each day was an adventure. Stepping into the lobby of the resort felt like home. I remembered feeling so special with the attention and caring from the staff. I read many reviews both positive and negative and I can not speak for anyone else but my own experience. I have discovered the most effective way to enjoy my stay at any hotel is to be kind respectful and friendly to the staff. This was not difficult at all to do at the Labranda Resort because the staff was a ray of sunshine. I entered this resort with a great attitude and respect for the staff and in turn I received much more. Salma thank you for cleaning my room and always asked if I wanted my room to be cleaned. This is when I have my sign hanging on the door ‚Äúdo not disturb‚Äù. She will make sure I did not need anything such as towels toilet papers and so forth. Every day I see her she smiles. Chakib in public relations what a gem? He made sure everything was okay with my room and the services I receive. I had a bit of an issue with the people upstairs pulling their beds late at night. Chakib was on top of it and he sent me a basket of fruits to my room. The kitchen staffs are just so wonderful hard-working and still managed to smile and asked how I was doing. Thank you! The guys at the bars oh my god these folks are so busy but remembers me very well. I only need to stand at the bar and I am been served. I remembered once there were no water bottles left at the bar closed to the dining area. I asked the bartender and he said to go to the next bar not too far but I was lazy and said aww. He left the bar and quickly came back with a couple of bottles. Wow!!! Thank you!  Yes yes the kitchen does run out of food for a short moment until they can make it or refilled the containers. Well what does that say? The food is delicious and the demand is much greater than supply. People are loving the food! These hard-working individuals can only produce so much food at a time. So please be patient! Lastly I want to say a big thank you to the animators this team of a friendly and energized bunch of people will make a rainy day filled with sunshine. They spent from 9 am to midnight trying to make the guests feel welcome. Can you imagine having to jump through the hoops to put a smile on some people‚Äôs faces who are just not encouraging? Well these folks will try. I have observed around 10 at night some of the guys seem tired dancing or trying to be funning but they will not give up until the end. Great job guys! Don‚Äôt let the negative comments discourage you! You are awesome!!!! Thank you! Special thank you to Charaf one of the animators and my favorite person. Labranda you are lucky to have him aboard. He is a valuable asset to your establishment. Don‚Äôt forget it! He made my stay and my friends stay a pleasant and joyful time at your resort. He is respectful and genuinely caring.I can't imagine him not there. The last night when my bag was stolen in the dancing room by two foreigners (UK) he was amazing. He took charge and helped catch the culprits. The manager and all of the staff including the animator team stayed and helped. When I was shaking in shock Charaf held me and comforted me. That was a terrible experience but everything turned out great because Charaf assured me  everything will be okay and give me updates while it was chaotic for a period of time. The resort has cameras so yes everything turned out great!!! Thank you! Charaf was in the lobby to say goodbye the next morning at 9 am even after going to bed at 4 am dealing with my crises. Charaf you are awesome!!!!! In addition I saw a lot of comments about no wifi in the rooms and the resort is not a 4 star. Okay for whatever reason it is that the internet service is not great in Morocco I can‚Äôt say. I bought a sim card from Orange and still had issues with the internet from my room. Many places that do provide internet in the rooms read the reviews not good. Please buy a sim card for 10$ for 10GB and stop complaining. A four-star hotel for me is the vibe the smiles the attentiveness and services. Pay more money and you may get what you want. Also oh my god I saw a review said there were no snacks in the hotel. Are you kidding me? I couldn‚Äôt stop eating at this place. All day long there is food. Breakfast starts at 7am and food is all through till diner is done which I think is about 10:30 pm. There is a snacks bar at the pool side with sandwiches fruits veg all kind of drinks from 3 pm to 5:30 pm. You can take whatever to your room because there is a fridge. Didn‚Äôt need to. Then you go inside for more. I am now detoxing from eating so much. I am wondering if I went to the same hotel with many of these people with negative reviews. Thank you Labranda!!! Charaf I miss you keep up the good work! You left an impression on my heart. Salma keeps smiling!. Labranda lookout I will be coming again!!!,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Venice, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanjjacobson

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Zahedul I wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Average Hotel Not sure how they advertise it as 4 stars.,We arrived at the hotel at 22:00 the receptionist was very friendly and welcoming.  after a brief check in she advised us to leave our luggage in reception and to go an eat first and then she will complete all the checking forms. ( which was an lovely gesture )    PRO'S:    Spacious massive resort  spacious rooms  Fridge in the room (empty at all times)  TV works  heating/ac system works well  Free safe/locker  Free shuttle to old town and new town and returns  Nice lounge located withing the reception area  Well secured premises  Warm showers  Excellent hotel for Vegetarians as most food was vegetables    CONS:  AVERAGE PRICE FOR TAXI COSTS 100 DIRHAMS TO OLD TOWN.    YOU HAVE TO WALK FOR 10-15 MINUTES IF YOU WANTED A LOCAL TAXI AS THE RESORT IS QUITE A BIT FAR OUT.  NO late night entertainment  NO HAND TISSUES (even though there is a box fitted)  The hotel closes everything at 23:00 paying bar closes at midnight  EMPTY FRIDGE ( THE LEAST THEY COULD DO WAS FILL IT UP WITH SOME WATER BOTTLES)  NO KETTLE/ TEA IN THE ROOMS  All inclusive bar SHUTS AT 23:00  THE FOOD AT THE RESTAURANT THEY START TO PACK AWAY 30 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING TIME AND THAT APPLIES FOR BREAKFAST/LUNCH AND DINNER.  THE FOOD THAT IS TASTY WOULD NOT BE REFILLED AS MUCH AND THEY SAY SORRY ITS FINISHED AND THAT'S WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF RESTARUNT OPENING.  GYM? ONLY COUPLE OF RUNNING MACHINE.  INDOOR POOL? 10 EURO FOR ONE HOUR    Hotel excursions are way too expensive the local agency's located at old town were half the price.    Overall good cheap hotel but I WOULDN'T go back. would only book as a last resort!,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaheduli2017
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Neil Macdonald wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Half Marathon Retreat,Just back from an amazing week here.    We stayed here as part of my wife's 40th celebrations where we done the Marrakech Half Marathon.    On arrival the reception staff were very welcoming helpful and attentive. The porter was a great guy showing us where everything was.    The hotel in general was always spotless and the staff worked tirelessly to keep that standard high. The room was basic but nice at the same time had all we needed for the week and was always clean and tidy    The meeting point team were very helpful when we required a taxi to and from the marathon and it took a great deal of worry away from us. The free shuttle bus to town was a pleasant surprise.    The restaurant staff were brilliant too always chatting and ensuring you were looked after. The restaurant manager (sadly we didn't catch his name but he was always sharply dressed) was probably the hardest working man in there. Non stop always chatting and helping he was often on the bar when it was busy later at night.    The entertainment team were really what made this place even better. Samy has a fantastic team and should be proud of them as they worked hard to get everyone involved and have a good time. Mousse Sef Nani Amine Ricky and Loco were absolutely brilliant fun the welcome show was hilarious!    I do want to mention Ricky though as he was a really lovely guy. Always made time to chat with people and he was genuinely interested in learning about people and where they were from. He does need to run breakdancing classes in the summer as it would be a real hit with kids!    All in all an amazing holiday and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.

But what shocked me the most in this hotel at breakfast we sat down to our table had some coffee and were served some bottles of water by the very efficient lovely waiters. Shortly after around 8:30 a very old rude manager had a blue top came over and started shouting at the staff in arabic which we fully understood and felt extremely sorry for them. I can‚Äôt praise his staff anymore they were really fantastic the way he was talking to them was very unprofessional and looked like SLAVES. We spoke to some members and said he was the boss.    The food was not bad! But every day run out after one hour. And all inclusive did not mean all inclusive at all. The room was ok but not 4 stars. No WiFi in the room.

Very long queues every dinner time for pizza corner as well as bbq for lunch time.    Most plates chipped + a lot of the time we had to wait for more plates to be put out to use.    Staff were all friendly and pleasant.    Kids club great staff & activities.  No ice cream for children had to buy them from the shop every day.    Slides & swimming pools great. A lot of wasps at the bars + swimming pools.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sushimirin wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Bargain winter break,Excellent food many varieties of vegetables prepared in different ways to complement the authentic meat chicken and fish tagines or to stand alone.  Clean and reasonably comfortable rooms beds were a little hard.  We liked being a little bit further out as it gave you a real feeling of peace and tranquility.  When you chose to visit old or new town on the free shuttle bus remember the last free bus back is about 8pm therefore if you want a proper night out you will have to book a taxi from reception in the hotel. This is a good service and you wont get it much cheaper by haggling on the street.  On the Sunday evening the whiskey ran out... but there is always good quality wine or beer instead.  We would like to suggest they open the shop all day or get a vending machine for a packet of crisps/chocolate bar for the evenings.

The staff were all amazing kind and eager help with anything they could. The food was gorgeous. Before going we seen a lot of reviews about the food saying there was no variety. We didn't think this at all. Yes it's all traditional morracan food. But who wants to go to morroco and eat like you do at home? Kinda defeats the purpose in my opinion we always found something we enjoyed. And even if you don't yes there's pizza and chips every lunch and dinner. Yes as many others have said the pool is FREEZING!!. Still didn't put us off going in. The slides are sooo much fun especially the orange one which is super fast. Yes the hotel is situated a little outside the old and new town but again the free shuttle bus is more than efficient. The animation staff were super attentive when you lie round the pool always chatting to guests and asking if your having a good time or just messing about and having a bit of fun. Either way they go out of there way to make sure all are included in the fun.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,1965claire wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Not 4 star,We booked a long weekend it was not expensive but never the less this hotel should not be described as either 4* or close to Medina. The room we had was big but tired looking the mini bar did not even have water in no tea making facilities which I would expect as a minimum for 4*. It is also about 20 minutes from centre the shuttle is a very nice coach but only runs at limited times and must be booked in advance not helpful if you don't arrive until midday and only there for a few days as it gets booked up quickly and that's low season. All inclusive is also a bit of a stretch more like full board with drinks as food is only served at set times one afternoon they did stretch to a poor selection of bread and some biscuits. There is one dining area filled with managers who all have an air of self statisfaction why is beyond me as the staff are lackadaisical to say the least no cutlery and more than once no bowls for soup/cereal. Very limited choice of food definitely not 4* in quality or choice and made worse by staff not topping up or replacing empty pots even when empty they had to be asked and at no point was anything actually hot even when it came straight from the kitchen they couldn't seem to manage to light the heaters under food either. Did she complain I hear you ask I fear this would have been pointless as others did so to no avail personally I'd get another manager that was able to see what was going on infront of his own eyes and cared enough to act on it paid far too much for doing little judging from his flashy clothes! One saving grace was a very good massage many thanks ladies!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,KBLSM wrote a review Jan 2020,20,Mixed Review,We recently stayed here with our two children in January 2020. I will start from the beginning please mind this could be a long review.    We arranged our own transfers to the hotel with the hotel wanting double the price on transfers from the hotel. We used a company that was fantastic and friendly.    We arrived at the hotel around dinner time on arrival to the hotel no one was available to greet us from the hotel we made our way to reception were staff basically shoved a form in front off our faces to fill out. No help given to fill out the form just left too it. Also they kept changing tourist tax prices at the desk.    We was eventually taken to our room which was well spaced for two adults and two children. It was cleanish. We had issues getting a towel for every member off our family for the room but eventually it was sorted.    The hotel public areas are clean and well maintained.    KIDS    We booked this hotel because it seemed to be a family hotel offering kids entertainment and kids park.  The children‚Äôs pool with two little slides in seemed to be dirty and locked up. No children were able to use the slides. The big slides rarely had a life guard watching children despite mentioning online there suppose to be on site. Kids club well the first few days we was there we was told it was cancelled. We spoke to guest relations who in the end sorted it out so it was on due to pools being ice cold and nothing else for kids to do. The woman her self was miserable. We signed a form regarding safety off children and we ticked the box to say one off our children was unable to go into the pool without armbands. Whilst sat watching them around the hotel whilst in the care off kids club my child entered the pool alone.I went over and intervened because this was not acceptable no apology was given she rarely turned up at the times allocated for children‚Äôs club. Night time entertainment for kids is 3/4 songs lasting around 10 mins for kids entertainment.    FOOD  Whilst we was at the hotel the food varied every day at lunch time there is pizza chips salad pasta etc comes evening meal and it‚Äôs all food without the thought off children took into consideration. The food is cold a lot looks like mush. Even occasions off RAW/UNDERCOOKED meat espically chicken. Breakfast is pretty much perfect with different types off eggs beans pancakes breads pastries cereal and omelettes. Whilst we was at the hotel many complaints were placed about the food. It seemed to cater for more adults in mind then any consideration for children. On the plus side the hotel to help you organise a takeaway to the hotel .    I‚Äôd like to just day a personal thank you to Guest Relations Chakib and the new member off staff who‚Äôs job role I think was managing the restaurant Saied (think I‚Äôve spelt that wrong apologies if I have). They both went out off there way too try solve the issues we had and tried there best too ensure my children were catered for.    Overall    I‚Äôd say I‚Äôf you didn‚Äôt have children with you you would be fine visiting this holiday destination it certainly is not a family friendly 4* hotel even a 3 would be pushing it. Majority off the staff need to learn to smile and speak politely although one off the entertainment staff was complaining there made to work 14+ hour days. And as for the hotel meeting point guy your attitude needs to adjust telling me to leave the hotel if I‚Äôm unhappy is not brilliant customer service and I will be taking your comments further.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KBLSM

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ron M wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Remote oasis,Remote location with nothing local to see or do. A free shuttle bus is provided every two hours into the old town with the most amazing market and bazaar area and newer shopping areas of Marrakesh. This takes about half an hour and has to be booked the previous day.  The complex itself provides plenty of amenities and choice of pools. Plenty of sunbeds at this time of year (January).  Food was plentiful and catered for general tastes.  Staff were generally cheerful.  Drinks were readily available although brandy was not. The local wine was quite drinkable.  In parts the carpets were stained and pits and dips in the floor were obvious.  No tea/coffee making facilities were provided in the room. Fortunately we took our own (as our e-mailed question was not answered) but getting cold milk was an issue.  Bottled water was provided in the fridge and readily available free from the bars.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Crackington Haven, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronmuckleston

We were there only for 3 nights as it was a birthday surprise for my brother. The staff prepared a cake and the entertainment team played ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù for my brother for free.    All I can say is that we were surprised how clean was the hotel and how hard the staff is working. The beds were very comfy and pancakes delicious.    Chakib from Public Relations was very helpful and friendly as all the other staff from taxi drivers to management.    Many thanks everyone and hope to seeing you again soon!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,m. k wrote a review Jan 2020,20,Very Average Hotel,This is definitely not a 4 star hotel to begin with. It could possibly pass for a 3 star.  Postives:  The premises are very clean.    The chefs are friendly and try hard to accommodate requests. The only decent meals are the breakfasts.    The guest services agent was very helpful and always accommodating.    They have a nice sheesha lounge and the pools are good.    Negatives:  The food is very poor hardly any variety and always cold. They have a microwave for those who want it hot (1 microwave for a whole load of people).    The management are very unfriendly and seem not interested with guests.    It is very difficult to deal with the housekeeping as they hardly understand any English. Any requests for extra pillows or anything does not get dealt with.    The entertainment is poor and if nobody is around in the lobby after 11pm they actually shut off all the lights.    The hotel is a 30 min ride from town and the last shuttle is at 7.30pm after which you have to rely on expensive cabs.    The worst part of the hotel is the spa! Do not use it at any cost. They will rip you off and provide with the worst service ever. There was no use complaining because the spa manager really does not care. There are better hamam places in town for half the cost.    Being an all inclusive hotel they should provide snacks all day but these are limited to only an hour between 4-5pm    The hotel itself is nice but there are a lot of things which can put people off from returning back.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mk9334
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,S R wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Mr,The food is terrible especially dinner it was like dog food. All the food was cold. There is no table service. The staff at Reception were not polite or not helpful. The hotel is more then 5km from the town centre and taxis would exort us out extra dirhams because of how far it is from anywhere of signicance. You have to take a taxi wherever go. The staff are not helpful the hotel had a shuttle service that did not notify us about and encouraged us to use taxi that conned us everytime we used it. Eventhough my stay was all inclusive whatever opportunity they could get to scam me out of money they did. The girl at reception couldn't care less. Even when we raised our concerns with the duty manger he could not less too. So we tried to contact the Hotel manager which was apperently away. AirCon in the room was terrible and did not work corrrectly. I requested my money back due to the hotel withholding services that they promised. I will never come back here. I cannot believe this place is 4 star. My stay was absolutely diabolical. I have had more comfort in 2/3 star. Never again at this hotel.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8676ERsr
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Leanne wrote a review Jan 2020,10,It‚Äôs not their problem!,Good points: The cleaning staff were lovely and if it wasn‚Äôt for the omelet guy we would have all starved. Erm that‚Äôs it.    I treated my mother to a trip with my 6 year old and 4 year old daughters. We opted for the all inclusive holiday with this hotel In particular because of the huge array of children‚Äôs activities and entertainment available.    On arrival we were taken to our rooms and that was it there was no information available as to what times things were to happen  meals clubs entertainment or anything. When we did ask it became apparent this was because there was nothing to tell us. The kids club wasn‚Äôt running there was no entertainment the water park was closed and The bars or restaurants were all hit and miss as to whether they would be open or not.    The room it‚Äôs self was lovely although there was no internet as advertised and there were no towels or face cloths etc There was broken glass in the shower and my daughter cut her foot we went to reception for a plaster and were told there was no nurse available (who you have to pay if you need her) and it wasn‚Äôt their problem they wouldn‚Äôt give us a plaster which lead to a huge row as you can imagine the staff were beyond rude.    When it came to meals there were no kids options just grown up slop which was rarely even warm  there was a pizza station where you were allowed 1 slice per person . Beverages were only available at certain times of day and weren‚Äôt to be taken from the restaurant. Snacks were available 3pm to 4pm and consisted of stale bread with tomatoes and lettuce. This resulted in a week of shopping being done off resort and ordering of takeout from the local KFC. We spent approximately ¬£400 on food for the 4 of us whilst on our all inclusive holiday.    The first morning we headed out for the kids club and really struggled to find anyone who could help us eventually we were told it was closed and wouldn‚Äôt be open all week in the evening the animation team were also cancelled so the children were board senseless. There was on one evening a duo singing in the bar but for some reason there were very few seats and people were having to sit on the floor.    The slides were switched off and the pool was freezing cold this wouldn‚Äôt have been too much of an issue if the kids could have used the inside pool but children were not allowed and it was chargeable so we headed for the ‚Äúon-site park‚Äù which was a little tykes slide and sand pit so sadly the kids spent most of their time colouring in their room.    During one of my many conversations with the staff there were others complaining too one family having just arrived weRe told if they didn‚Äôt like the facilities check out and find somewhere else to stay!    Finally I spoke with the manager and requested we had a late checkout as our flight was in the evening and I was told no I said I‚Äôd had the worst holiday ever and it was the least they could do but they said it wasn‚Äôt possible .    We were fobbed of or plain lied to daily and the complaints were DAILY if not hourly.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hall-leanne
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,SJH B wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Holiday Horror,From arrival it was apparent we had made a mistake. My daughter cut her foot on broken glass in reception to be told there were no first aid boxes in the hotel. No towels or toiletries in the room and rude staff. It didn‚Äôt get any better. We booked this for our children‚Äôs birthday and found all the kids clubs entertainment was cancelled the restaurant was closed except for evening and the food was absolute slop. No WiFi in rooms  no slides it was the absolute holiday from hell. We had to do a weeks shopping to eat even pay to use the bathroom.

Any advice or questions we asked Amine he was happy to answer and always gave us the right advice.  Meeting Point met us at the airport and brought us to the hotel. On departing meeting point took us to the airport. Meeting point are reliable and very professional.  All the reception staff at the hotel are very professional and friendly. The porters the cleaners the restaurant staff all work hard and have an excellent attitude.  I burned my hand with a hot drink someone from the kitchen came to my aid and put some gel on the burn. I don't know this young man's name from the restaurant I would like to say a special thank you. You helped heal my burn immediately. I was in so much pain but with your help and the gel I recovered quickly.  Nothing is too much trouble at this hotel the staff care about your well-being and attend to your needs immediately.  Special thank you to the shuttle bus driver who took you to new town and old town. The driver is very reliable and friendly. Everyday this gentleman drives you to new and old town a few times a day.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Konstantin N wrote a review Jan 2020,10,My first 1-star review: read and avoid,I consider myself as an experience traveler i.e. more 2-3 times per year at least. Usually I don't send any reviews but coming back home I feel a need to warn people about this place.  The hotel located outside of the city. You cannot go out. The shuttle bus is available 5 times per day. You need to book it the previous day. The drive time is etwa 30 min to the market.  What was good:  - omlet and the cook who cooked it  - the bakery.  All other were bad very bad or very-very bad.  The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful. I was always ignored when I approached the reception. Suddenly all the people became busy and started talking to each other. If you greeted them the don't react. Never seen such an attitude before! Unfortunately every day one or two of the door cards stopped working and I needed to visit the reception. Nevertheless the management also didn't react at any requests.  The food choice was quite limited. Only one type of chicken fish and meet. Lamb was served only once over the week. The food containers are small. Normally you need to point out the staff and wait for your piece. After lunch no food was available except 4pm simple snacks that run out in 20-30 min.  The bars and barmen are the worst experience. The alcohol choice is limited and you need to communicate with the rude young people working there. When I asked to add a bit more gin my cap (a plastic cap! All cocktail are served in plastic caps) was just overfilled with gin! I felt lost offended unsafe. The bar is rather simple and often full with kids after dinner so you need to stay outside. At 23:00 everything is closed and light off. Go to the bed baby.  The room was small for three adults. It was always too cold inside. The air conditioning system produced some sound but I was unable to heat the room up. Maybe it was broken as the room phone. The TV picture quality was like on my first smartphone. No internet in the room even for money. There was also dark even when all the lights are on. So that you cannot read a paper book.  And so on......  PS I'm surprised to see many five-star reviews. I checked few of them. Most are the first-and-last contributions and of a similar style. I doubt the hotel current rating is fair (my personal opinion). The Tripadvisor might want to perform a statistical or AI check.  PSS I'll not go to this hotel again even for free. Labranda network is also out of my consideration since they manage such hotels.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bern, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/konstantinn500

You can eat and drink whatever you want along the day.  - Everyday there was an entertainment.  - Excellent staff. Always available and able to help.    Points against:  - Quite far from the old town. Although the hotel provide a bus shuttle timing are not too often and plus you have to make sure you booked in advance.

We had great time. staff very friendly standard rooms are good and they do connecting rooms which is brilliant as we are a family of 6. Loubna the manger has always been extremely helpful.    We have visited the Labranda Targa Hotel a number of times and each time it has been fantastic. Everyone is so friendly it actually feels like coming home. The Hotel is exceptional throughout really clean rooms brilliant power showers and we had a lovely pool view.    The entertainment is fantastic and the entertainment team were fantastic and friendly during the day time and night time entertainment. The bar had a wide variety of drinks and best of all the kids loved the slides. We have been twice in December February and in October and the weather has been good 30 degrees in October.    All the pools and bars are nearby so we can relax back and don't worry about the kids as we can normally see them everywhere on slides the bar the football courts etc as its a nice family resort but not too big that you get lost.    This resort ticks all the boxes and would be getting 5 stars but the only thing that needs improvement is the food which i would say is 3 star. Still not bad always find something as i am not fussy but my friends and kids didn't enjoy as much as me.    Would defo return as more pros than cons nice hotel overall.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farahshain

All inclusive resort with a very repetitive menu & tasteless dishes. All crockery was chipped very small selection & food being recycled. The front office was uninterested to listen to your concerns. All drinks served in plastic cheap cups even coffee served in disposable small Nescaf√© cups. Only decent thing was breakfast with fresh omelette & flat fried bread other than that rest of the meals were very bland & recycled throughout different meals. Hotel is mostly clean. Has swimming pool & slides. Water was real cold & hotel has few stray cats in them you see them drinking water straight from the pool. No wifi in rooms.

To be honest it was a place I'd wanted to go for a very long time & this was a relatively cheap price. I've done all inclusive before so kind of know what to expect....however this was a surprise..a very good one. Arrived at the airport & their security measures are very reassuring. I booked private taxi's which were easy to find ^ took your luggage to the taxi. Arrived at the hotel & ok didnt realise about the ""taxes"" but ok ¬£20 quid it was. Are luggage was taken by the lovely ""bob"". Are room was fab. Exactly what we'd asked for. A twin room with a garden view & balcony & a big bathroom with a nice hot shower. Oh & a fridge. It was cleaned & made everyday which as hospitality staff we appreciated. The whole hotel & gardens were very cleaned manicured & watered & rubbish free. The staff well most were amazing. We thank especially RickyArmenLoco Sam & Maria & Charib! You all made are homiday special. The food ok its wasnt fabulous bur we never went hungry & there was enough. I asked the restaurant staff if it was possible for grapefruit & next morning it was there. There was soup meat dishes & traditional Moroccan oh & a bbq everyday. The pool all bit it cold was fab. Didnt try the slides but looked great. Shuttle bus fantastic & the money exchange in the hotel really good. My only complaint would be the AI bar which ran out of everything but whiskey by our 3rd night & regularly lager & wine but as we didnt stay till the end didnt really spoil our fun but could imagine it would if you did.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jenna P wrote a review Dec 2019,10,AVOID this awful hotel!,My partner and I booked a 2 week stay at this hotel after having to rebook due to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Having been to Morocco before we were really looking forward to our holiday which turned out to be absolutely awful and resulted in us paying an extra ¬£170 to come home early.    The hotel is in the middle of nowhere which means you can't go out without using the free shuttle that runs during the day and means you are stuck in the hotel and have to eat the food which is horrendous. The selection is small for an all inclusive hotel and we found ourselves struggling to eat at some meal times as there was either nothing we liked or it had run out. We also couldn't get a table a few times when we went for dinner as they either don't reset them when people leave or it was just full. There was another area which they had blocked off that would have solved a lot of problems had they actually opened it. All of the bowls and plates are chipped and they take forever to bring clean ones out so there was often no crockery.    The cosy bar (the free bar out of the 2) was as advertised - very cosy. Definitely not enough seating for the amount of people staying here. The drink selection wasnt great either. The bar staff often stand chatting to each other and leave you standing then proceed to make drinks how they feel like it instead of how it's meant to be. Lights go out at 11pm and you are just left sitting in the darkness so there's no option but to either pay for your drinks in the sports bar or go and sit in reception.    Staff are rude throughout the hotel often ignoring you when you are waiting to be seen. Our door card kept having to be reset as every time we went up at night it wouldn't work. It also went missing from the room twice while we were out which leaves you to assume the maid is lifting people's key cards. They would come and take our towels but not replace them or clean the room. We got back to our room at 5pm after a day at the pool and the maid was only just cleaning 2 rooms down. Our bed linen wasn't changed until our 8th day either. It was apparent that she had been going through my belongings and food items had gone missing from our room too. Upon speaking to the rep in the Meeting Point centre she took us to reception and spoke to them in Arabic and asked us to sit down while they looked in to it. After 5 staff standing speaking for about 10 mins she came back over and said it wasn't possible and we must have left our room door open allowing someone else to go in and go through our things. We were offered to be moved room which we said no as we were leaving in 4 days and didn't see the point. She then turned rude so we decided enough was enough. ¬£170 later and we booked flights to go home the next morning as it was just unbearable.    The animation team were about the only good thing about this hotel. Their jobs are made SO much harder due to everyone else in the hotel not caring about the guests so they do an excellent job of trying to get everyone up and enjoying themselves. Well done and thank you to Ricky Loco Anime and Yousef especially for making at least some of our holiday enjoyable!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,ASLtraveller wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Great holiday. All ypu need to know.,Rooms are lovely hotel is clean. Staff friendly and helpful. All inclusive is a must as this hotel is quite far from shops.  Food is good with an adequate choice..there is a microwave to heat up if required but we didnt need to..and there are snacks during the day too. Drinks on AI were great! Choice of cocktails (alcoholic and virgin) local spirits ie whiskey vodka rum. Wine and beer were both good...no queues at bar and big measures of alcohol!  Entertainment was great..staff are very friendly and try to get you involved plus everything is in English so no problem understanding.    Waterpark has four big slides open all year. Yes the water is cold in winter    We had no trouble with staff trying to force trips on us as other people have mentioned.  Free coach to old/new town is brilliant. Driver is not very helpful due to his English not being great but other passengers helped us with information.  In all we loved this place and staff (especially Seph who was always friendly and helpful) and had a wonderful time.    A holiday is what you make it and you are in North Africa and this is a poor country. Yes there will be flies cockroaches (we saw only one dead one)cold pools in winter beggars and pushy sellers if you venture to town and the odd language barrier. Please be respectful with clothing and cover shoulders and knees outside of the hotel..also read up on what to expect in the old town..there are lots of scams you need to be aware of..never accept anything for free!!    Small improvements that could be made...  Welcome drink while filling in forms on arrival pool towel cards should be given on arrival reception desk girls sometimes make you feel like your questions are bothering them (but other times are friendly). The older guy who changes money should give a receipt to ensure mistakes are not made.    Finally..dont drink the tap water..we had no problem with upset tummies.. there is free bottled water all around the hotel in fridges to take or ask at the bar.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASLtraveller
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Babita K wrote a review Dec 2019,30,You get what you pay for...,After reading a few reviews I was not looking forward to my stay here. However they say you get what you pay for and with this hotel that's spot on! It's a cheap getaway so I guess we can't really complain too much. The hotel itself was very clean rooms were huge and the shower was amazing! However upon our arrival we checked in and were given our room keys only to find someone else's luggage in the room. This was the case with 2 out of 3 of our rooms for our party. This was resolved quickly by the reception team though I'm just glad we didn't walk in on the guests!  As for the food (breakfast lunch and dinner) we ate loads! We had a vegan in our group who had a great variety of food she could eat and non of us got sick so all good!  The drinks were very limited and served in plastic cups which wasn't great.  The snacks served between lunch and dinner were awful and covered in flies I spoke to the hotel reception staff about this as my dad is a diabetic so needs to eat at regular times they just shrugged their shoulders and said dinner is at 7! There was nowhere local we could walk to for food as the hotel is quite far from anywhere we could access food or drink from outside. This was a real let down. For me when I book an all inclusive I expect food and snacks to be available throughout the day and food that is edible not covered in flies.  The pools were freezing so we couldn't take a dip which was a shame. But overall we had a good holiday but that was more down to the company than the hotel we chose. You have to be prepared to take the good with the bad with this one.... Like I say you get what you pay for....,Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BabitaK3

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jenny D wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Clean and beautiful hotel,First time visiting Morocco and can say it has been great. The rooms are very clean and big although the balcony view was of trees luckily the weather was mild so didn‚Äôt have any bugs. Food was good something for everyone. There are many pools to choose from shame the indoor pool is not included in the AI as the outdoor was rather cold and limits use at this time of year. Hotel would probably increase spa sales if it was free. Only issues I had was having bed sheets thrown over the balcony onto my head and my iPad broken by the housekeeping staff. Unfortunately no responsibility was accepted by the hotel. The bus service into town is limited so booking early is recommended.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyD1535

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,orrycorbin wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Beautiful hotel,Visited Morocco for the first time. Pulled up to this beautiful hotel. Bell man takes your suitcases to the lobby. U have to fill in the form so that u can pay for tourist tax with is not a lot. The currency conversion rate is really really good in the hotel. The staff is nice especially the ones in the restaurant. Family room is massive with kitchen double bed and two single beds. By the pool area has the best staff in the entire hotel. Sam and loco is the best hands down. You can catch them by the pool. Really cool guys. The guys in the snack bar can be rude at time. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt want to serve you and always mumbling in their language. There‚Äôs a guy on the reception desk with glasses he can be very rude at times and I always try to avoid him. The food is alright nothing really special. Some days was nice and some days was kfc in town. The hotel is very limited. After breakfast there‚Äôs u can‚Äôt get a snack till lunch or when the snack bar opens. At the snack bar I get cake croissant and sandwich everyday. It‚Äôs the same everyday. There‚Äôs a water slide that‚Äôs open till 12:30 pm then closes till 14:30 then closes at 17:30. Breakfast is very basic. Pancake omelette and some other yellow bread the fry in front of you. Everything hot during breakfast is made in front of you. But for a busy hotel the food food don‚Äôt flow fast enough. U have to end up waiting till it comes out. There‚Äôs a queue every morning for omelette cause one person is making it. No bake beans no turkey sausage or turkey bacon. No juice during breakfast. There‚Äôs a bar the serves alcoholic drinks but is very limited. 4 different types of cocktails with alcohol and abut 4 mock tails. Nothing really fancy that‚Äôs gonna wow u. I almost forgot. It u hate wasp then please do not go to this hotel. The pool area has wasp everywhere. I even got stung in my knee by one. Wasp are attracted to sweet stuff so your drinks will be attracting them. They are in the pool all over the food at the snack bar they are everywhere. The shop in the hotel is very expensive. A pack of Cheetos is around ¬£3 and don‚Äôt let me start on the ice cream. U will get bored after like 2 days. They do offer dessert excursions which is really good. Full package which includes camel riding quad biking 4x4 passenger ride dinner show and belly dancing for around ¬£80 which is really good. U can get a free shuttle bus into old town or new town. Old town is really run down and it sad because there‚Äôs a lot of people who beg there. Really sad place to go if u got a heart. Especially the women with kids begging. New town is more develop. Shopping centres name brad stores and many more. So basically if u wanna go away for like 2-3 days yh but for a week NO. I was bored after 3 days but that‚Äôs just me and also my kids wanted to go game and that not like them. Of yeah there is entertainment at night time which is really good and also kids club from 10:30am till 12:30 then lunch and starts again at 14:30 till 17:30 in which parent can chill by the pool on quickly go into town. That‚Äôs all for now until my next trip somewhere else. Bye now,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orrycorbin

Hotel has no first aid kit and empty doctors room with nothing init. Reception staff googling ice pack and hotel manager calling 24hr nurse to understand how to deal with a bumped head. My 1 Yr old has a black eye.    Food:  Poor and repetitive. Very unhappy looking catering stuff not helpful waiters. Asked for an ice pack after my daughter (1yrs) fell off a dining chair which she had to sit on due to the hotel only having 5 high chairs. I asked for an ice packed and they had nothing we waited 10mins for a bowl of half melted ice.    Shuttle to town:  The driver can't tell the time and drops and collects guests in the wrong place. Although he is very friendly and helpful.    Drinks:  Cocktails sweet and watered down alcohol.

Strangely again I encountered some very curt and short conversations and wasn‚Äôt overly impressed by their public relation skills 2*/3*  Room was relatively spacious  clean as you would expect  Beds 2* really really hard and not at all comfortable  Shower was a huge plus and was hot and powerful 5*  Restaurant was clean 3* and ok but on a few occasions no plates were available at all I waited nearly 5 mins for plates to be bought out not a good advert for your restaurant  Food was again hit and miss  it ranged from 2* at dinner to 5* at lunchtime and then 3* breakfast  yes we were in Morocco and you expect a small amount of local traditional food but even for me as a ‚Äú I‚Äôll eat anything ‚Äú I struggled to find a meal that was even 3*+and so I plumped for pizza which was stone based cooked and very nice  I saw many people with fast food bought in or delivered and I‚Äôm not really surprised  The alcohol is poor to average not a great deal of choice at all and actually makes you wonder if there is alcohol in it especially the very poor cocktails they offer  lager seems to be the best option and gin and tonic as a short  5* is the pool  tennis courts table tennis  water slides  gardens  grounds  flowers& trees and the animation lads & lasses who work tirelessly all day and are very friendly good fun and always having a laugh  WiFi is free but will only reach around the foyer and around the outskirts of the bar  You have to pay a hotel tax on arrival and varies depending on the length of your stay  Airport is about 30 mins  And the hotel offer a free shuttle bus which is very handy because your at least 20/25 mins from the old and new city  It‚Äôs ok for a 4/5 day break but personally I wouldn‚Äôt like to stay any longer than that,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wirral, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mccarianp
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,miahmoo06 wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Very Average,Very middle of the road review with this hotel. I knew it was out of town but it is literally in the middle of no where and you either need to pay for a taxi or u at the mercy of the free bus at hotel. The free bus going to new town or old town has to be booked the day before and on a few occasions we couldn‚Äôt get the time we were looking for on one occasion we tried to move our slot to be told the time we wanted was full but yet other guests informed us there was still free seats ! The food was ok sometimes it did feel luke warm and I witnessed a few people using the microwave to heat up their food. The drinks are given in small plastic cups and they refuse to fill it up when you are having a beer on some occasions you would think the bar staff were paying for it we asked for them to top it up and you got a dribble but still refused to fill it. The plates and cups could all be doing with getting replaced nearly every second one had a chip or crack on it. However the hotel is clean and the maids were in our room every day cleaning it. We did have one occasion to complain we went to breakfast one morning and came back to our room to get a shower and get ready to go to old town for the day and a workman was in our room grouting the bathroom !!! I know these things need to get done but not when I am paying for that room do it before I arrive or when I leave do not stop me using the facilities I have paid for. When I complained I got sent to public relations guy in reception who came and looked at room then got maid to clean the grout up so we could go for a shower he didn‚Äôt seem to quite get it that I did not pay to come in holiday and have my room taken over with workmen then he asked me the next day did you get your fruit we left for you ?? Said no so we were obviously meant to get fruit as a sorry never got that either ! The free Wi fi is only available in the hotel itself and not in your room which is not ideal.  The rooms are very spacious clean and comfortable.  There is just nothing that excites me with this hotel and I wouldn‚Äôt rush back.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miahmoo06

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Andy wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Dec 19. 4 day break.,Hotel is a good 30mins drive out of the city free shuttle is great however does get booked up at the peak times of the day. Rooms are great clean spacious and bathrooms are good shower pressure is incredible. December is quiet which is nice. Food is typical of AI hotels and it can be a free for all when things like chicken come out fresh but this is a reflection on the visitors not the staf food can go cold on the serving trays but again its AI so not going to be perfect.  Bar is good Shisha is good however Karaoke and live music goes on (very loud) til 11pm our room was right over the bar which meant we heard everything it did prevent us getting an early night before the early AM departure but it did stop at 11pm if it had been every night or of we had children it would be more of an issue.  Cant comment on the spa as we didnt use it or the pool.  The hotel was a base for 4 days of city tour it was fine for this but I'd imagine can be very busy on peak months.  We spoke to several people who had disappointing tours and excursions with the hotels resident tour company we did get invited to a welcome meeting/ sales pitch but already had booked our trips. We used Get Your Guide and found each tour to be very reasonable and well organised without fault we did a night tour of the Souk a day in the atlas mountains and a two day hop on and off bus tour. All were great and wirth every penny.  Hotel is fine staff are friendly and it's all very clean. Ideal for what we wanted.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shrewsbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/af5391
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Lewisr2456 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Wow was we in for a surprise,Firstly this is an honest review and my personal opinion.    We arrived at the airport after been up for nearly 24hours we was tired cranky and needed to relax. We found our way through the airport security is a lot compared to what we have in the UK we was greater by the transfer team who met us with a smile and a hello.    While we was on our way to the hotel we was a little apprenhisve about the hotel due to the reviews we was in for a surprise. We arrived at the check in the staff was lovely they told us to go Get lunch and they would check us in once we had refreshments and something to eat this was a lovely touch. We went for food and due to the reviews we was a little cautious we found the food to be warm and varied. After having a lunch and a chill we went to check in and was met by the same lovely staff.    They called someone who took our bags to the hotel room which was a nice touch. We arrived at the hotel room and was very very surprised with the room it was spacious and light and airy there was a big double bed a nice walk in shower it felt a comfortable room. We thought quick shower and let's get down to the pool to explore down at the pool we met some lovely people who we stayed friends with all the holiday and have kept in touch with since. One piece of advise save your sun loungers.    There's 5 pools the main one an adults only pool which is set away from the main pool 3 water slides with there own pool and another pool next to the main pool.    The animation team came up and introduced there self's which was nice and would try to remember you and always said hello (these people work from around 9am until 11pm at night and always smile)    As the week went on it was one smile after another we never had a bad at the hotel. We did go on a couple of trips I'll go in to further detail below. There is free transfers to the new and old town which you can book a day in advance.    The old town they drop you off just outside of the old town its only around a 5min walk so not an issue.    The old town is nothing like we have in the UK the people can be rude and try to pressure you in to buying things. If you've got kids they will hand them toys knowing you'd have to pay for them. You'll have people coming up to you offering to give you a tour ignore these people as everyone has a price.    The new town is essentially a modern day town with shops you'd expect.    All in all if you want a week away from the world you can't go wrong with this hotel and marrakech.    We are already planning another trip to explore where we missed.    If any of our group saw this I hope you have great memories like us.

The hotel is beautiful clean rooms and towels everyday. The staff are all AMAZING especially the entertainment team made my children feel like royalty. Yes the pools are cold but what do you expect in December? The food is hit and miss but so is every other holiday. If you want English food stay in England. Have loved every minute of our stay!!! The staff really make this place what it is! The tourist tax was only ¬£20 for a family room for a week. The free bus into the old and new town is great. The staff have a lot of time for you and organise great pool games and the shows in the evening are fabulous. The shop is the only bad point as things seem to cost different amounts each day but is still reasonable. The food seems to be catered to whatever nationality the majority of guests are but there is pizza and chips and pasta everyday if you are not keen on the other choices. Every member of staff have been excellent. I honestly can‚Äôt fault it at all. 10/10 for labranda and the staff. Will definitely be back in the warmer months. Ignore the bad reviews none of us have been poorly or sick. Overall fantastic holiday. VERY HAPPY! Fantastic staff hotel and amazing entertainment. Big culture shock but we‚Äôve loved every minute!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,alakim wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Winter warmth!,We visited here as a family of three in early November. First impressions of the hotel were good reception looked nice. As soon as you arrive ( before even checking in)you get dragged into a room by the tour company to try and get you to book excursions which isn‚Äôt ideal. Once we got to check in reception staff were great really friendly. Room was nice clean and spacious. Restaurant served a good selection of food at mealtimes only downside was veggie selection was always lukewarm instead of hot because of where it was located. Pools were nice and clean although far too cold to use at this time of year. The outdoor bar was good although afternoon snack needs a re think as was covered in wasps as soon as it is put out. As it wasn‚Äôt overly warm it would be nice to have an indoor option/bar to use during the day a shame it only opens in the evening once the other bar closes. It‚Äôs also quite a small place usually all inclusive places have a little more walking space gardens etc feels a little enclosed here and in the middle of no where so can‚Äôt go out for a wander. The free bus into the city is good though. A lot of people appeared to get ill while we were there we were okay in the main although I seemed to get it on the day we went home and for a couple of days after. An okay stay but wouldn‚Äôt come here again.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alakim
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Martin wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Great Resort,Just Arrived back from 10 nights 8 of us in total. Ignored the negative reviews and decided I'll make my own mind up. All round fantastic clean good entertainment day and night. Food and drink brilliant and tasty.    Annimation team fantastic they really are a credit to your hotel. All round majority of the staff are pleasant.    Only a few negatives pools were cold I really do feel that the resort could benefit from some form of pool heating especially in the winter months. This is the only reason why I may not consider going back here.    Had an issue with the bar manager in the cosy bar regarding the showing of a particular Champions league football game. They'd advertised a certain game to be shown but there was no interest in the guests watching it myself and several others requested that one of the other games be shown and after a period of back and fore with reception and the bar manager. He refused to change it felt like it was a power struggle by himself rather than looking at keeping the many guests that wanted it changed happy.    Food in the restaurant is sometimes cold at the buffet and guests are having to use the microwaves to heat it up. Not sure how this is happening as its even with new lots of dishes brought out from the kitchens.    All in all though a good resort especially at the bargain price we had of ¬£250pp for 10 nights including the flights.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M55RTD

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,muffinn2 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Two weeks greatly enjoyed in this excellent hotel. A superb base for exploring the region.,Overall  We had a wonderful two weeks in this hotel during November 2019. The hotel is comfortable secure and maintained to high levels. The staff are almost all hardworking conscientious and friendly. The hotel bus is extremely useful. Marrakech offers a lot especially if you come with some background information. We thought the hotel could offer more in terms of information maps etc about Marrakech itself. Visitors particularly build up quite a bit of knowledge about where to go and what to see. There is very little in the way of this sort of information available.  Location  About half an hour on the bus from the old town. The hotel bus is very reliable and strictly ticket only and you must book times with care. The driver was excellent. We managed to crack the local Alsa buses. The number 16 is a pleasant 20 minute walk away costs 4mad a single trip bought from the driver and runs every 15 minutes to the old and new town. We appreciated the great flexibility of this.  Rooms  I'd hate one anywhere near the bar as the music is too loud and dominates the area and the foyer. Our room was near the good gym and was large warm and comfortable. We brought a small kettle with us which was useful. We found the light a little dull for reading. It was cleaned and restocked very thoroughly every day. Our towels were generously changed every day even though not recognised by leaving them on the floor when we wanted them changed. No WiFi in the rooms but where it's available in all the public areas it's good and reliable. We requested 1¬Ω litre bottles of water to cut down on plastic waste. We appreciated the free easy to use large room safe.  Meals  We ate very well indeed! The meal times are generous the menu options were varied and always interesting. The vegetables and salads were superb. There was always a mix of Moroccan and other cuisines available. The bread was always excellent. Fresh fruits were always available The barbecue lunch option was very much appreciated. Our vegan daughter stayed for a few days and she ate well. Labels of the dishes were helpful but sometimes mixed up e.g. no label on the tripe dish coconut labeled sugar etc. The salad and dressings need also to be labeled.  Drinks  The wines red white and rose were Moroccan and very good and readily available. Spirits and cocktails were not so good. Perhaps the bar could offer glasses in the evenings as the plastic is wasteful and unappealing to drink from. We appreciated the carbonated water on tap at lunchtime.  Staff  Nearly all were first class. Particularly the table staff the chefs the cleaners the maintenance men the gardeners and most of the information desk people were faultless ‚Äì always friendly helpful and well-mannered. The only exceptions were one rather grim man on the front desk and the man in the trips office who took ignorance and not listening to a new high level! The desk staff were very helpful in chasing up our airport transfer and also printing our boarding passes. Ryanair passengers beware the Ryanair app only allows you to check in it does facilitate electronic check-in as the Ryanair desk insist on a print out and you only gather this on the day before you leave. The answer is to download a PDF of the boarding pass email it to the desk and they'll happily print it for you. Thank you for this service  Trips  We were put off booking through the hotel as the man in the office was lacking in listening skills and seemed very uninterested in my custom. We booked trips independently to the Atlas mountains ‚Äì excellent but be aware that the temperature when we went was 5 degrees in November and Essaouira on the Atlantic coast ‚Äì a 3 hour ride each way on reasonable roads but worth it to soak up the atmosphere of the countryside and then the amazing fishing port beach and more relaxed souk.  Entertainment offered was not to our taste  We only experienced the team at work during a couple of evenings. The Moroccan cultural evening was frankly embarrassing! Morocco has much to be proud of and we were intent on learning and appreciating what it offers. Instead despite Moroccan acts being involved we were subjected to mindless clapping to whip some frenzied atmosphere followed by exhortation to shout loud if we were Brits or French ‚Äì what about people from the many other countries? Despite a good sound system and lighting rig the music faded in and out fairly randomly we sat for periods in the dark this was particularly hopeless when the belly dancer performed with candles ‚Äì it needed some light not the occasional silly disco flashing lights. There was no effective introduction to the facets of the culture being introduced so people were not impressed and the audience leaving in droves spoke volumes. Sorry guys you need some real professional advice to make this less than very disappointing! The Cozy Bar was not cosy not comfortable or well lit the music was too loud to talk and football or sports on multiple screens. Most escaped to the rather cool foyer or their rooms to escape. A room or area to chat play cards or read would enhance indoor facilities. A book exchange facility is available at most holiday hotels.  Pools  The main ones catered well I'm sure for those wanting activities and music. The adult only pool was wonderful. Well-maintained clean comfortable. A lovely peaceful place to be.  Recycling and plastics  We were rather horrified by the great quantities of plastic being generated especially glasses for drinks and small water bottles. In today's climate this needs some consideration.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Worcester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/muffinn2

And I have to say we really did. Staff were helpful the rooms were lovely spacious and were cleaned beautifully everyday. They had a kids club which our kids enjoyed everyday an was also a nice break for us adults lol. All of the reps we came across were very friend and nice I didn‚Äôt know all of their names but Nani was the one who ran the kids club she was amazing then joined later on by Rasha who was also great with the kids. My husband got on very well with Sami and spoke very highly of him. The only negatives I have to say about the hotel is there was no iron u had to request it from reception but u wound b lucky to get it as sumtimes other guest would have it so ud b lucky to even get it to use at all. The food was repetitive but @ the same time there was a lot of variety to choose from. And it‚Äôs ashame that there‚Äôs nowhere nearby that‚Äôs walking distance but @ the same time the free shuttle bus that takes u to the old an new town was good.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,ward_j16 wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Great holiday.,This was our 2nd visit to this hotel in Morocco and again we had a lovely holiday.    The hotel gardens and pool area are very well maintained and spotlessly clean.    The bedrooms are large and cleaned daily. The beds are firm not a problem for me but I accept they could be too firm for others. The showers are huge and very powerful.    Mr egg man as we called him at breakfast is fab. Fried eggs and omelettes made fresh to order delicious.  Lunch time and evening meal The food is morrocan in style with a variety of different tagines. Every day there was meat chicken and fish and several vegetarian dishes as well as rices couscous and lentils. I do agree with other guest comments regarding food temperatures. The hotel does need to address this issue. For the less adventurous palette there is a pizza and pasta station.    We enjoyed a wonderful evening in the onsite morrocan restaurant which for a small charge was definitely worth it.    If I had to complain about anything it would be lack of seating in the bar in the evenings and as this was november it was not really warm enough to sit comfortably outside at night.    In all this is hotel offers great value for money when compared against other hotels of similar price.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newton Le Willows, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ward_j16
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,northerngurl84 wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Honest,I was a bit wary of staying due to the issues around the food hygiene. We never had an issue with being ill  The hotel is immaculate and couldn‚Äôt fault the cleanliness of the room or the grounds  The food was a big disappointment. At first I thought it was just me who got bored but other guests felt the same and were fed up towards the end. On the flip side other guests said they really enjoyed it so I guess it‚Äôs simply down to personal taste.  Lack of cutlery and crockery was an issue  I‚Äôve no idea what the kids lived off  No ice cream unless you want to pay ¬£2.50 in the shop for one  Reception staff are a mixture of pleasant and rude  Constant issues with key cards not working despite not being near mobile phone as the receptionist insisted was the issue  Drinks are poor and they ran out of lager at one point. Local beef or from a bottle. Do t expect a nice ice cold beer because it doesn‚Äôt exist.  The seem to pick and choose when rules apply or when they can and can‚Äôt be bothered with things. The glasses provided for your drinks at meal times are literally a mouth full so be prepared to go back and forth several times to the bar  No issue with getting loungers  On arrival we were asked to pay tourist tax which was ¬£10pp for 7 nights Again this seems to change as other couples were charged ¬£15pp for 7 nights.  Will I go back? No  Did I get sick? No  Was it with the ¬£400? Only just  A lot of potential for this place it‚Äôs just a shame the food wasn‚Äôt up to scratch and the alcohol was a huge let down  A positive being the entertainment team do not hound you and are very respectful which is rare these days,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Carlisle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/northerngurl84
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Denise C wrote a review Nov 2019,10,Poor food standards,We stayed a week in early November. Overall hotel is ok and I wouldn't have given quite such a low score if I hadn't been ill 5 days into our 7 day break. Awful diarrhoea shivers and stomach cramps. I had to take a week off work when I got back! The food offer is not bad but there seems to be very poor food hygiene generally. None of the hot offers were hot and the cold offers were warm. We saw a member of staff pick up a roll from the floor and put it back on display- if that happens in plain sight what must be going on behind the scenes? I believe many more people ate in the hotel and became ill. I have written to the hotel and had no response hence my delay in writing a review as I was waiting for the hotel to give assurance that they were taking action to prevent this happening to others. Food hygiene really needs to be addressed.  On the plus side the animation team were brilliant.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseC712
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Lyn P wrote a review Nov 2019,20,An honest review,We have just returned from a 5 night stay. The hotel itself is clean and the rooms are a good standard. The grounds well looked after. We were given a room without a balcony but our friends had one with. We didn‚Äôt mind as our view was lovely. The staff we came across all seemed cheerful and helpful especially the two guys at the pool bar and on a whole this is where my two stars come from.  Unfortunately the whole point of an all inclusive break is the food and drink which I must stress is awful. I look forward to trying new foods and have been to Marrakesh before enjoying many tagines etc but at this hotel ALL of the food was tepid in temperature and of very poor quality. We even spoke to the head chef to raise our concerns. I have never seen salad before chopped up into such an array I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was and there is nothing to accompany the salad such as cold meats or cheeses. The bread station is fresh but there is such handling of the bread from guests as there is only one bread knife to which I often found the handle sticky. The hot food is of such short supply there is a constant dash for it with utensils being dipped from one pot to the next. I even saw somebody use their own fork.  As four adults with relatively open palettes we struggled to find a meal each night to which we could agree was good.  The drinks are very poor even the lager no taste to anything and a few times tasted of chemicals to which the last two days we didn‚Äôt bother. The gin I asked for to taste neat as I couldn‚Äôt taste it and I can assure you what I tasted wasn‚Äôt gin.  Finally 3 out of 4 of us have had terrible diarrhoea and it came on the day after we decided to brave a salad! I myself am now home and still bad.  We only ate at the hotel. I will return to Marrakesh but never to this hotel.

The rooms are really nice but the beds are quite firm the grounds of the hotel are quite small which is great as the pictures make it look like the the grounds are big.  The staff are very friendly and polite including the animation team.  The food is something to be desired I'm not a fussy eater but I am really struggling your ok if like veggies and cous cous or fish the children are really struggling with the food and although they do pasta and pizza the pasta is never cooked enough I have been living on chicken and rice or meatballs and vegetables.  Both my daughters have had dioreah and I have just started with it the food isnt kept at the correct temperatures and you can touch the warmers they are that cold I have been trying to eat food off the grill or freshly cooked everyone has to use the microwave on the end of the counter to warm up food.  It's no wonder a lot of people have been ill gone home ill and some are still in the hotel ill.  Morocco is a lovely place but I wouldn't come back here unless the food situation improved it's not good when your mum or children have to go to bed hungry!!,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellbell135

The room was spacious clean and with a spectacular sunset view each evening.    The inclusive food was mostly authentic Moroccan which totally suited us (neither of us are keen on hotels that purposely cater for British menu). It was obviously fresh and the restaurant staff were both friendly and helpful.    The hotel decor was beautiful enhanced but lovely artwork. The grounds pools and gardens were really pleasant and included an outdoor bar near the pool.    Included in our ""all-inc"" was shuttles into either the Medina or Nouvelle Ville the last returning late enough to allow guests to witness the stunning sunset over Jemaa El Fna (the world-famous square near the souks).

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,atayo2013 wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Nice hotel but be careful of the slides,Let's start positive. We had a lovely short stay here and if I am honest after staying in Marrakesh before we wasn't expecting a five-star hotel.  On arrival we were pleasantly surprised even arriving late we were offered a snack and a drink. Breakfast was limited but enough choice the same we could say about the dinner etc but am not too sure what I would have said after staying a week. You get what you pay for I guess! The entertainment team works so hard and are a major credit to the hotel. We would extend that to the staff here too.  Here is the negative. While we only stayed for 2 nights we saw at least four people fall down and hurt them self‚Äôs badly around the slide area. It gets wet and is very slippery. My wife fell and broke her coxic bone yes we agree it was an accident but one we feel can be avoided in the future. I did email the hotel twice to ask if they will do something about it to prevent further injuries but was ignored.    Overall our review is not meant to put people off this hotel but we want to make people especially with children aware of the area near the slides. Hopefully now the hotel to do something about it!.,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atayo2013

On arrival we found our room had no pillow cases on the bed and only 2 towels for 3 adults also Toiletries for 2 people. They promised to sort but never did so we used beach towels to dry ourselves after showering.  The food is Buffet style which is poorly stored. Serving spoons are covered in cold leftover food which the next person dishes their dinner with hence contamination of hot n cold food. The food to start with comes out cold. So many queue for the microwave. Never seen this in any hotel.    The drinks are awful. So few choices cheap n nasty fruit juices cocktails out of a machine that taste so artificial. The alcohol doesn‚Äôt taste of anything the worst drinks I‚Äôve ever had. The best drink I had was Coke or Shandy. Hot drinks are also out of a machine nothing remotely nice tasting.  They do have another option - you can go into a bar opposite the ‚ÄúCosy bar‚Äù where you purchase drinks and omg they are completely delicious. The difference is really unbelievable but what a con. Making more money out of people. This bar had lovely scenery nice lighting lots of chairs and not more than 5 people in there.    We did a trip organised by the hotel ‚ÄúMarrakech nights‚Äù costing ¬£44. We were never told the meal didn‚Äôt include a drink so bare this is mind. Food in the Riad was awful but guess you pay for the scenery which was beautiful.    My mother of 75yr got ill on the 2nd day and still is. We have the doctor coming out today. Severe diarrhoea with shivers my daughter also had this on the last day. It‚Äôs too much of a coincidence that so many get ill when they eat at this place. Yes plates cutlery etc are all not very clean. But the food is my main concern. I tried a bit of salad but it tasted of cleaning fluid. I stuck to bread pizza and chips. I ate so little of each and came home lighter than when I went which speaks for itself.

Staff were very friendly & most spoke good English if you are polite to them this attitude is returned to you. The food was great & if you have an issue with it not being hot enough then a microwave is provided. The freshly made ommelette's for breakfast are amazing. The bar can get busy with sometimes a very long queue but they will serve you extra drinks so you don't have to visit so often. They did run out of alcohol late one night but we found this more funny than some !  I upgraded to a room with balcony & was not dissapointed believe we had a junior suite as along with the double bed there was also a single. Large walk-in shower but sometimes water wasn't hot enough for me. Brand new hairdryer & toiletries provided. TV with 3 English film channels & 2 news. Good fridge we took our own kettle but as the hotel shop doesn't sell milk we had to fill an empty bottle every morning at breakfast. The evening entertainment was ok but the bar & outside area needs more seating.  The shuttle bus into town is easy to book & very efficient. Don't be scared to go into the Medina/souks its a great experience & a fascinating area to visit. We felt very safe there & didn't get lost.  We took a trip into the Atlas mountains which we booked through tripadvisor but we spoke to the lady trip rep in the hotel & found her very friendly & helpfull.

First of all the receptionist dont even smile much or help much  The manager was okay the cleaners and waiters were really good.  The rooms are really nice with a excellent shower. There is no wifi in your rooms but it is available in the reception were most people are as the entertainment is not the best. It is mostly music every night and a quiz once. Everything finishes at midnight. The bar closes at 11pm without warning even if you have been in the que for ten minutes. They have a free shuttle bus Which is good if you want to go to the old or new town.  The food is not really good for English people and really nothing for children except pizza and also chips but chips are only at lunch time.  The hotel is located in the middle of nowere. The exchange only opens at 15:30 which aint ideal but the rates are okay. There is not really anything to eat as snacks. So if your hungry after 2.30pm you need to wait until 7.30pm for dinner. They do some kind of snack bar at 4pmtil 5pm but its like croissants and sponge cakes. Drinks are available all day.  We have had a coat trainers and towels go missing. We have asked lost property and reply is no. Nothing here. It really is good if your a french national. The water slides and pool are good.

You need to think about how much you‚Äôve paid if your holiday wasn‚Äôt extremely expensive you aren‚Äôt going to get high end food. So many fellow Brits at the hotel were moaning about the food but I enjoyed it and it was better than I have had in some other all inclusive holidays I‚Äôve been on that I was also happy with at the time.    The hotel provides a shuttle service in and out of Marrakech this was a saving grace as initially I though we would be paying for taxis.    There are a few pools at the hotel the adult only pool was peaceful and a decent size.

We arrived at half 3 and went to the check in desk where we was told to leave cases and go to lunch as it was shortly shutting as lunch time was over. We came back and had a smooth check in - rooms are beautiful we had 2 single beds very comfy and the rooms were spotless cleaned lovely everyday smelt lovely and had a great view of the main pool. Breakfast lunch and dinner food was great the breakfast we mostly enjoyed ! Option of meat fish salad and fruit crossiants and rice such a lovely mixture. Entertainment team were great in the day time all the boys and girls were so fun great with children. The guys who run the front shop where you book excursions were very helpful even printed our boarding passes off for ya before we left as I forgot ! WiFi - pretty much over the whole of the hotel - free of charge. Night time entertainment was okay music quiz and shows for all. We are 28 we went to Nikki Beach to celebrate our birthday would definitely recommend this is a 20 min cab ride from the hotel great day out for drinks and food. Sun loungers everywhere so always had a decent seat for the sun! The only down fall for us was we had to check out at 12 and didn‚Äôt get picked up until 5.30 pm - we asked to extend till 3 but this wasn‚Äôt available due to the rooms being needed for more arrivals that afternoon. Hotel is so stunning the decor was amazing ! Would stay at this hotel again any time a** the morrocan restaurant on site is amazing only opens on Tuesdays and Fridays it‚Äôs 200 dirham for 2 people which works out ¬£21 each 5 course meal lamb chicken tagine and cous cous was so nice and so was the wine ! This hotel is suitable for any one any age kids or no kids.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,sulleqa wrote a review Nov 2019,10,Worst EXPERIENCE EVER AT A HOTEL,For anyone thinking about booking this hotel. DONT. The WiFi is practically non existent. There‚Äôs no such thing as hospitality. They charge you for anything you ask for like to borrow an iron. Can‚Äôt enter the spa until you pay for a treatment. And everyone at the hotel got sick with a ‚Äúbug‚Äù or food poisoning because of the lack of hygiene in food. The food is disgusting as it is and they made me sick for my whole trip there. I missed out on all the experiences I had booked because Me and every one of my friends I went on holiday with were bed bound. It‚Äôs been a week and I‚Äôm still sick and everyone I met at the hotel was also suffering from the same stomach bug. Ruined my whole holiday.

We would like to extend our thanks and privilege to Mr. Nabil who was often at the hotel to provide any service or assistance to all customers.  Yes this person has a great energy of high morals and has great experience in this field  which makes us see him in the morning noon and night to provides all the services requested by the customer.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,CATHERINE G wrote a review Nov 2019,20,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend,Until reading the last review I didn‚Äôt realise why I had been really unwell from the last day of my stay until now! I‚Äôve been in bed with temperature and stomach bug for 4/5 days since.    It‚Äôs really not a 4* hotel it‚Äôs isolated and generally the staff are lacklustre to rude (especially reception staff). There is no real presence or leadership at all.    The building itself and the rooms are nice but it seems like thats where the management team seem to focus their efforts rather than engaging with people etc.    The animation team are their saving grace they are amazing. As is the Resident Service Manager (who they should be letting lead a much needed transformation in service)    The all inclusive offer is designed to make it as difficult as possible to have any decent drinks or food away from serving times. With no facilities in the room and a really poor and overpriced shop it can make things feel awkward and isolating. There are no shops nearby and the shuttle takes 30 mins to Marrakech.    We‚Äôve stayed at a few 4-5* All Inclusive hotels and resorts and this just doesn‚Äôt compare at all.    I‚Äôd have said the food was good until it made me ill!,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J2531WYcatherineg

The hotel is in the middle of nowhere its its ridiculously overpriced but most importantly myself and our whole party as well as over 100 other guests were poisoned !! Extreme cramps rampant diarrhoea and vomiting. This hotel needs shut down and health inspectors called in.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,J.E wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Let down hotel experience. Marrakech brilliant!,Me and my partner have just come back from an all inclusive weeks holiday here and to be honest it was very unsatisfying. I‚Äôve wanted to go to Marrakech since a young age and after months of looking we found this hotel and saw the huge complex and what it had to offer and booked it straight away after changing from another hotel we had in mind.  First of all it is very segregated from Marrakech although advertised saying shops and things are near it is far from the truth... it‚Äôs only near when in a car/ coach. The complex is massive and had a lot to offer looks wise we was put in a lovely room in the outside rooms and had a lovely garden patio. And between us and the other guest was a main feature of a fountain which I loved seeing every day leaving the room. But this place isn‚Äôt for couples to be entirely honest we was bored and would end up back in our room in the evening by 9/10pm; but it is not the animation teams fault they work all day and night and put on so many events but it‚Äôs more suitable for families personally. Before the negatives I would just like to say that the restaurant staff men in the reception that help with the luggage and especially the cleaning staff are fantastic! They couldn‚Äôt do enough!  I never write reviews but the reason why I am leaving this one is because unfortunately my boyfriend was ill for 5 of the 7 days.. from both ends he literally was so weak and couldn‚Äôt eat anything. As a hotel all of the guests should be informed it anything is going around because we was made to believe that it was just him... it wasn‚Äôt until the end our trip when he would go to get medicine and it was run out that 60 other people (probably more) and the animation team were all severely ill. As a hotel it should be informed via a letter in the room or something?! There was no care in the world to be honest it was just bringing in a doctor or a pharmacist with little medicine. But everyone who paid money for there weeks worth of all inclusive literally use a day of it. The same people that arrived as us all caught it the same day it seemed odd as first it was the food or the water but how can the animation team who are from Morocco get ill miraculously from water they drink all the time? Then someone from reception said it was all around Morocco which was a lie as no other person from a different hotel knew about it? It was just in our hotel.  I want to say that Marrakech is beautiful and please visit but make sure you find a hotel that can be situated near. But there is nothing worse than being in the middle of nowhere not being able to walk to a pharmacy.  I‚Äôm sure other reviews will say about this but my main issue is with the people that book the trips you want. It was a specific person that saw green in his eyes and just cared about the money he got us to book two trips for the anima garden for ¬£30 each and a quad biking for ¬£50 including a dinner and a show. We found out a free shuttle takes you to the old and new town and you book it the day before or it you‚Äôre lucky on the day so we visited the souks via this. When it came to our quad biking day my boyfriend was severely ill he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to walk around let alone go on a bike and have dinner and then show till 9 at night. We went to the guy at 9am and he said he will contact the place to try and change it now you cannot get a refund after 12.30pm... he longed it out until 12pm we was there the whole time as it‚Äôs a lot of money; my boyfriend wanted to know what he was going to do either a refund or change or day and he got short and said you need to give me time. When it got to 12 I found out what he was trying to do so ( wait till half 12 so he couldn‚Äôt refund) we went back in and said what‚Äôs going on we want it sorted now. He then magically called and got it sorted to just do quad biking two days later and give some money back within.. this was within two minutes on the phone? So we waited three hours for nothing. When it came to the garden trip we woke up and was ready for the 9am leave getting to reception at 8.30 my boyfriend feeling better to move and was told that the trip was cancelled as the two other couples where ill. The man had this information early and knew our room number in which he could‚Äôve called our room to inform us so we asked how he could sort it out so we could still go as we‚Äôve paid for it. After cleaning another persons desk walking around the complex and trying to get other people to book he then told us that he could get a private shuttle with the ¬£60 already paid but we would have to pay again for tickets to get into the garden. We laughed it off and got our money back he was reluctant to give and tried to give less than what we paid. We found out that within twenty minutes of researching that we could get the free shuttle to the old town and then a free shuttle is provided by the garden from there and you could buy tickets on there website for ¬£10 each so we done that saving ourselves ¬£20 each because the man in the suit wanted to rip us off. And it was the best decision made we had a brilliant time. The only thing that went smoothly was the quad biking trip which was rightly so. We had so much money taken at the start of our trip from him and ended up doing the same trips for less and with more in our pocket at the end. I want to say that if you do go there is one person from that team that is not included in this his name is Muhammad and he the most genuine one the guy who ruined our trips/ didn‚Äôt care was the main boss and we over heard he‚Äôs done it to five other couples and every time the only person to listen and sorted it out to make the customers happy was Muhammad! He cared about your experience and sadly he would get it in the ear because of someone else‚Äôs stupid mistakes. Also to add the boss man kept putting the wrong dates on our slips and said we was meant to be at reception at 9am on a day we didn‚Äôt plan then saying ‚Äúoh it must‚Äôve been another couple i must have got confused‚Äù which i find a cover up as I realised he put the dates wrong so he was covering his back.  He was so depressing and rude that I didn‚Äôt want to walk past him or even see him.  The resort is very covered you have this beautiful landscape of mountains but you cannot see it! The first night me and my boyfriend went all around the hotel to find views and amongst all the open balconies provided trees where in the way or buildings. We found a window which showed a small gap to see the Mountains so I started to feel quite trapped and overwhelmed with the same walls and trees everyday it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs own world locked away.  I had a great time out the hotel but inside it was dismal and predictable one thing I would say to the reception staff or whoever is in charge for asking for something to be fixed to be more quicker with time. The whole holiday the hair dryer didn‚Äôt work and after asking no one came to fix it (lucky I have short hair so doesn‚Äôt take long to dry in the breeze outside) it took two hours to get a pillow to the room but it‚Äôs hit and miss as when Needed more loo roll it was given within 30 minutes.  Overall I do believe a lot of us need to be compensated for the holiday because there is something going on in only that hotel we kept eating take out and it wasn‚Äôt effecting my boyfriend at all. And that‚Äôs the last thing we wanted to do after paying for an all inclusive.  So right now avoid this hotel cause I would hate to see more people go through it but most importantly if you can book your own trips you will save sooooo much! And get better service. This was the first time I‚Äôve looked forward to being home which is a shame.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JE1412
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Erika C wrote a review Nov 2019,10,2 teenagers 2 adults- 5 night half term break,We are were a party of 4 my brother had booked this as a treat for us. We had two twin rooms booked as per our Expedia reservation.    My brother called the hotel a week prior and confirmed the rooms and they reassured us it would be twin rooms BUT on check in we were faced with a grumpy chap called Mohammed who challenged our reservation saying that he has two separate bookings and not 1 (who cares about your internal system we are the customer and we have it black and white our booking) our bags were lost at the airport and we were all tired & could not believe the lack of basic customer service! We accepted the 1 twin and 1 double and said we would check availability in the morning.    Due to our lack of clothes we asked if we could book a cab to the souk but wanted change as only had big denominations. The front desk Mohammed sits next to a big sign saying cashier and change! I asked for this and he said as it had been a two day holiday he had no change I found this odd and said in this big hotel you cannot find change for 200MAD? He then got irate snatched my notes and threw the change over the counter - I was mortified!    Next day we asked a staff member who was in charge they pointed to a lady at the guest relations desk we asked to speak to her she was very courteous and asked us to sit. During our conversation others joined her including mr Nabil. The purpose of this was just to highlight how we felt and that maybe they should consider having a more professional front of staff. To cut a long story ( we did feel they wanted to put things right but had not understood the crux of the issue). They apologised and offered us a meal at their ala carte restaurant and a complimentary spa hamam. Which we accepted thinking that was a great gesture.    But .... this was when things deteriorated we had to keep chasing them! The meal happened it was ok. But the spa treatment apparently complimentary to mr nabil means discounted! My brother had to speak to him and chakib to sort this out eventually they agreed to book us for a free hamam! Again we go down the spa two ladies make us change then send us into the hamam rooms give us their small shampoo and shower gel and leave us! I call out nobody answers my brother shouts out to me from the adjacent room to put my robe back on and find the lady! We do and she says very sheepishly that‚Äôs our hamam! We are livid a shower in our own and you charge for this?? She pretends she does not understand we point at her price list and takes about a scrub and oils she shrugs her shoulders. We leave my brother lets mr nabil know he ushers him to talk to chakib. Chakib then tries to smooth things over but by now we have had enough and as he offers more treatments we close him down and say NO thanks.    In summary the boys had a good time on the slides and the pools were fine if a bit cold the staff in the restaurant were wonderful the food was ok but we did eat out from time to time. I concur with other reviewers that the rooms are tired.    My issue is the management if you can‚Äôt follow through on promises then don‚Äôt offer stuff to customers! Your reception staff should act like ambassadors for the hotel they should consider asking how guests journeys were on check in and smile ( it‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs welcoming) don‚Äôt lie! Do the basics and you will be rewarded!    Honestly hope the hotel takes this feedback on Board.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erikacA9408JN

The airconndioning didn't work the first nightbut was told it would be working the next day. 3 days later it was working. Met some really lovely people who all had the same thing in common - We all had diarrhoea. There was at one point over 60 guest all sick and that's only the ones who went to see the nurse.I did try and go into marrakesh for diarrhoea tablets but couldn't get any. However apparently the doctor came to the hotel and said it was gastroenteritis but most people would have disagreed with that. It really needed health in and sort the problem out. There was a nurse Who did give out powders for the first 2 days but kept running out and having to get more tablets and powders. The food was ok and quite a good variety with different meats daily. They had free bottled water in the hotel that you could help yourself to.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Trailblaze wrote a review Nov 2019,10,Avoid at all costs,We arrived midday for a 3 night stay we booked into the hotel spa as on arrival it was overcast and cloudy.    We paid ¬£70 for 3 treatments including a scrub a facial and a full body massage and headed down.    They complained it shouldnt have been booked as no space so they agreed to do the scrub and we would return 2 day later to complete the treatments.    It was not a great scrub the haman was cold and the whole experience a let down.    The room was ok shower good food looked ok with a lot of variety pool area nice although full of wasps that they claim are bees but hey ho.    We booked a trip to the Souk the following evening and felt that ¬£35 each was very pricey I questioned a few times but was reassured it was a great trip with a guided tour of the souk.    We boarded the coach to be met by the guide who informed us we were not going to the souk and that we had instead been booked onto the Marrakesh by night trip!    We were herded into an underground restaurant for inedible food belly dancer and a man shaking some cow bells we were the led to a small square that sold juices and given 30 minutes free time - not requested nor wanted we were then put onto horse and carriages for a ride to the palace.    One of the ladies tried to take a photo and was told off you dont actually see anything other than the guarding wall it was crao to say the least.    On leaving the palace grounds our carriage was in collision with a mopedthe rider was thrown into the wall and the bike went another direction he laid motionless on the road while we begged the carriage rider to stop and go check but he refused.    I shouted at him to stop and he told me to shut up heard he was likely drinking whisky he just sped off.    We got back to the hotel in a state of shock and I complained to the manager of the hotel he was more angry we did t visit the souk than the death of the rider!    The next 2 days were spent in bed sick with food poisoning I later found out around 60 people were suffering af the hotel and its believed there is a case of Norovirus.    The whole trio has been just awful the hotel to trips the food    Best thing about this trio is the journey home!

And not to worry about the fact the hotel are doing everything they can to keep this quiet.  Unfortunately you haven't heard the last of this..

We couldn‚Äôt have asked for any more from them the best team EVER!!  Food was lovely rooms were clean. The decor could do with being updated though especially in the corridors of the second floor as the carpets looked worn and old.  Most of the staff were friendly and helpful. The odd one or two were rude especially one female in particular who served in the on site shop with her bright red lipstick; she was rude ignorant and unhelpful whenever she served you. My daughter had to complain about her due to her rudeness on a few occasions!  The guest relations manager however was very friendly helpful and supportive at all times especially so when we informed him of my nieces phone being stolen. He went with my brother in a taxi to report the theft and to translate for him as my brother had been unsuccessful in reporting the incident at the first police station he went to due to the language barrier.

Free shuttle service into the town.  Unfortunately the negatives out way the positives . The bed was so uncomfortable mattress was hard. Trying to get a twin room for me and my mum was a nightmare  so settled for the double. Landing carpets smelt and were very worn. Aircon does not work.  Food choice was very limited and all seemed the same for a week quite difficult if you are vegetarian too which I am.  All hot drinks come from a machine and are really poor  coffee is weak and watery. Alcohol definitely watered down all served in plastic cups  cocktails just like syrup. You have to pay ‚Ç¨12 to use the indoor pool  luckily it was hot enough to not need to. Most rooms do not have a balcony.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,steven wrote a review Oct 2019,30,never again.....ever,Arrived here as a family of 5. Given rooms quite small nothing to shout about felt more like 3 star than 4.After complaining about the stairs (mum is 71) a rep got us moved into 2 suites. Happy they did so and all rooms on ground floor great result. The food in this restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. Not much choice very repetitive. The staff were very friendly and helpful we except moody mohammed on reception. So rude and curt and clearly suffering from delusions of self importance. The hotel is clean and well kept although when i showed them a picture of cockroaches in our room they just shrugged and waved me away like the cockcroaches had paid to be in our room. very mixed feelings about this place.,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72thesign
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Mambo B wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Not recommended,Food on that hotel is disappointing nothing for kids and is it family resort  In all inclusive bar 4 type of drinks and 3 of them is the same taste just pinacolada is different taste and after 3 days pinacolada finish and was out of stock till the day we flight back home how is that possible !!!  Something positive from that hotel is that there was all time animators and they try to find some game for adults and kids and every evening they make some program and we have some fun so if its not there animators is it boring for 7 days and to be honest not English people are welcome there cause most of the time they speak just French and this was really unprofessional I am sure our family will not going there anymore,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariobB6271EB

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,sawyerr1447 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Great stay,Me and my aunt stayed here for 9 days recently we arrived back last Friday .  First and foremost I have to say that everyone that works at this hotel work tirelessly from very early morning to late at night well after all guests have gone to bed to ensure all guests get the best out of there stay from the gardeners who keep the property in tip top condition to the friendly bar staff the amazing cleaners the receptionists that are happy to help with even the most silly of questions the management who sort out issues straight away but a very special thank you to the awesome animation team that made the holiday that bit more special whatever these guys are paid its not nearly enough they definitely made my aunts holiday getting her involved with the many activities they have going on every day they‚Äôre evening shows are a definite must they‚Äôre super entertaining and I really don‚Äôt know when they get the time to put them together they work so hard . The animation team do you proud that‚Äôs for sure they took a resort holiday and made it one we‚Äôd remember forever  The hotel is lovely the grounds are gorgeous the pools are super clean of which there are 6 they also have 4 water slides which was fun if people tell you the white ones the slowest they lie it‚Äôs not but very fun none the less .  I found the food was good and there is plenty of choice with a lot of pretty healthy dishes rather than fast food trash plus plenty of sweet choices for those with a sweet tooth and different dishes every night .  drinks are pretty standard for an all inclusive wine beer vodka whiskey rum brandy gin with a few cocktails they do have a non all inclusive bar if you want imported drinks but I was perfectly happy with the all inclusive ones .  All In all a great holiday and I would absolutely recommend this resort to anyone and look forward to returning .,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sawyerr1447
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,AishaGS wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Great for families! Four & a half stars*,This hotel was outstanding value for money. We travelled as a family of five including son 14 son 12 & daughter 10.  Hotel grounds:  Gorgeous very spacious with so much to so including mini golf football & tennia courts.  Indoor heated pool was bit on small side but with massive watwepaek and three huge outdoor pools could not complain although these were freezing. On site spa was expensive which was a shame as we paid for all inclusive so expected to be able to use the facilities for free.  The waterpark was phenomenal-better than some off site ones I've visited & most of slides were working which sometimes doesn't happen & can be disappointing.  Rooms were lovely beds not the comfiest though.  Grounds were very safe so kids could go off & explore.  Restaurants:  Food was amazing & fresh - they brought in different chefs to cook the different cuisines ie: Indian to make authentic tandoori chicken.  If you are looking to only eat chips then you may be disappointed as those ran out quickly but for our family we were very happy to try the different cuisines including delicious authentic Moroccan tagines.  All inclusive gave us access to frequent pancake/waffle/pizza breaks which the kids enjoyed!  Service:  Staff were great drinks were hit & miss but effort was there.  The animation team doubled as the evening entertainment & although we normally run in the opposite direction of this they were so endearing & lovely we found ourselves enjoying all their offerings including live snakes one night!    We had a wonderful time & would definitely recommend Labranda & Marrakech as a must visit!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AishaGS
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Anne-james1967 wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Pros but CONS honest review,My daughter and I have just returned from spending 10 days at la Branda Targa Aqua Park in Marrakech and I must say we have mixed feelings.  I will start with the staff the reception team need to learn what a smile is most of them they not very helpful or friendly we had a problem with the aircon in our room and it took 3 days for someone to come and have a look at it the room was barely cool and the aircon definitely wasn‚Äôt on during the day. We kept our windows and curtains shut to keep the heat out.  The bar staff at the beginning of the week were rude and quite abrupt though we did manage to get a smile and better service by the latter part of the stay (mainly because I spoke both French and English). They were certainly not very welcoming in the beginning. The drinks were served in cheap plastic cups not good for the environment I understand they would not want glass around the pool areas but there are many other alternatives also the choice of alcohol for all-inclusive was limited and if you wanted a cocktail you needed to specify you wanted alcohol and the all-inclusive bar stopped serving at 11pm. Most of the guests we spoke to shared our opinion on the staff.  The PR manager Chakib was an absolute delight you could not ask for a more friendly or helpful person. He made a point of speaking to as many guests as possible listening to feedback both positive and negative with the same friendly helpful attitude. If you have any issues then Chakib is your man. Thank you for your smiles and friendly manner you are a star!!  The animation team were also so much fun animation is not my thing but their friendly manner was infectious I was especially impressed with Sousou a young girl with only a few months experience she was just the sweetest kindest thing I saw her several times playing with young children taking them for food in the afternoon always smiling and laughing she was just lovely the rest of the team too especially Asmine Loco and of course Sam!  The food was in my opinion great lots of choice of salads as well as hot food and most days the best patisseries yum. The fruit was a little disappointing.  The grounds of the hotel were beautiful as a gardener I especially appreciated the beautiful trees and flowers and the pools were immaculate.  The room were ok clean but nothing special and if you want a balcony you will need to book that most garden rooms do not have balconies so that was a disappointment.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne-james1967

I had Booked a garden view room with a balcony and we needed 3 beds as I were traveling with my mother and son. We were given a room with 2 beds NO balcony and pool view in the noisy area. As it was 2am when we arrived we had to make do with what we had. Come the following morning we went to complain about our room. The reception staff wasnt very interested at all and told us nothing else were available. And if we wanted to move we would have to pay an extra 200O MAD Approx ¬£180. (PAY EXTRA FOR A ROOM WE HAD ALREADY BOOKED AND PAID FOR) Over the next few days we had realised that we were not the only british people experiencing this problem. In fact upon speaking to many people while we were there we found the best rooms were given to the French and Arabic.  The rooms were very basic and the beds were rock hard.    The food was disgusting there wasnt much choice and mostly undercooked or cold. No fresh milk offered for a cup of tea apart from in the mornings. My mother and I were both Ill while we were away. And whats with only getting 1 knife and fork to eat all of your food. McDonald's Quick and KFC were a god send.    There were loads of Wasps ants and cockroaches to be seen all over the complex    A separate complaint with photos of evidence has been sent    PLEASE PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,blackpool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angeleyes33

We had to book a holiday last minute as another was cancelled (Thomas Cook) Well we were so lucky to end up here!! We had the best holiday the team at the hotel are incredible especially Amine and Ricky who were chatty helpful and entertaining at all times! We stayed in room 1223 which big but basic I was disappointed we didn‚Äôt have a balcony but the room was really spacious. Food was good lots of tagine food which after a week gets a bit boring but they have a pizza and pasta station if you feel like having that kind of food. The pools are great there‚Äôs so much choice! We spent most of our time around the main pool as this is where the entertainment happened. Plenty going on darts water polo aqua gym Zumba and we even did an Arabic lesson! Plenty of bars and options to drink. We didn‚Äôt go on the water slides (my biggest regret!) In the evening we had a shisha outside and there is always something on - from a Moroccan themed night to a welcome party! Reception do not speak a lot of English so just be prepared for that. Most people speak French here. We visited the spa twice which again was good although the women didn‚Äôt speak much English and spoke a lot during our treatments so I felt like we were being spoken about (sure it wasn‚Äôt the case) but made the relaxing massage not particularly relaxing! Beautiful spa though. We used the in house travel company called Meeting Point to go to the souks which I 110% recommend going with a guide then alone as you‚Äôll get lost!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Charmaine M wrote a review Oct 2019,50,IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS ON THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,We spent a week at the Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc at the end of September.  The hotel is very clean and tidy and the gardeners and maintenance staff work very hard. Every morning as we arrived at our sun lounger a member of staff came round and washed all of the tables down and the pool area was spotless.  With regards to people moaning about the food...... what do you eat at home?!?!?!?! There are lots of options at all meal times. Breakfast - eggs toast cereals pancakes yogurts pastries and fruits aswell as breads cheese and ham. Lunch + Dinner - Pasta salad pizza meats couscous various tagines rolls and desserts.  Whilst were at the hotel we took advantage of the spa package - came out feeling amazing.  The entertainment staff work very hard with their activities and mini games around the pool and the shows and entertainment in the evenings.  The bar staff work ever so hard also.  Our room was always cleaned to a high standard and the shower in the room was AMAZING.  As I said at the start ignore the negative comments I would definitely return to this hotel for another week in paradise.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Seething, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51charmainem
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Marianne12041972 wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Not a 4 star hotel,Really disappointed in the hotel. The only positive was the room which is the only place that air conditioning however no WiFi in the rooms which is unheard of in this day and age and there was a free shuttle to the medina.    The restaurant was so hot and you were dripping with sweat. They provided bottled water in a fridge which was warm everyday. The food was absolutely disgusting apart from breakfast which was bearable.also the lack of cleanliness in the restaurant was appalling they had mats on the table which were dirty and there was never a clean table to sit down at we were always asking the staff to prepare a table as they were just standing around. Also there is only one restaurant in the whole complex which again is ridiculous for the amount of people.    The rooms were cleaned everyday however not to my standards once I made the cleaner come back and re mop the room.    The pools area and beds were disgusting wasps everywhere they should have constant cleaners around the pool luckily I had swim shoes on so I didn‚Äôt put my feet on the floor.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Leah wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Not for the English,I will start with the bad and then finish on a good note.    The reason I have given a 2* rating is because this hotels services and facilities are definitely below average.    This hotel is not an aqua park it just has a few slides. We chose this hotel due to the good recent reviews however there is a labranda rose hotel just around the corner and I believe some of the reviews get mixed up between the two hotels so be aware of that.    The Moroccan standards are far below the English so if you want an above average experience then you will need a 5 star hotel in marrakech.    There is not enough funding and training for staff they are expected to work 14 hour days and only have 1 day off a week. A lot of pressure is put onto the entertainment team especially when evening entertainment cancels/doesn‚Äôt turn up. One evening was meant to be karaoke and the speakers laptop and projector screen would not work properly so they had to use their initiative and find something else to do which wasn‚Äôt particularly fair.    The air-con doesn‚Äôt work properly the rooms are not cleaned efficiently (if at all on some days) the food was nice for the first few days but one day my boyfriend had eaten raw chicken when we showed the waiter mustaphia so he could let the chef know to make sure the rest of the food was cooked he made a joke about us (in french to the french vacationers sitting next to us at dinner) and said that if we don‚Äôt like it we can stay at another hotel.  We found this a bit upsetting as we weren‚Äôt being rude and didn‚Äôt even make an issue out of it although we had every right to so because of this my boyfriend took the chicken directly the chef to show him it wasn‚Äôt cooked and needed checking but all he did was shrugged his shoulders and gave him two more slabs of chicken.    The ‚Äòall inclusive‚Äô alcoholic drinks are watered down. We were both ill for the last few days and can‚Äôt work out if its because of the food or the drinks.    The entertainment team carry this hotel if it wasn‚Äôt for them we wouldn‚Äôt have stayed here although towards the end of the holiday the attitude towards the English guests are a bit shocking. There seems to be a very different mindset between cultures and a miscommunication/lack of understanding when it comes to the guests needs.    There seems to be no boundaries (touchy/feely) and when my boyfriend said no that‚Äôs enough they continued to do so and it felt almost as if it was on purpose trying to cause aggravation and then they were shocked when another couple we had met on holiday got involved and said no means no to make them let go of me.    The evening entertainment is 80% in french or for the french guests the children‚Äôs entertainment is only for the french children. The staff don‚Äôt really speak much English so it makes it hard to build any kind of relationship.    The positives are that most of the staff are friendly initially the gardens and hotel grounds are particularly well maintained and that when the food is cooked properly it is nice.    I had my nails painted in the spa and the lady most definitely was not a level 2 qualified beautician but she was very nice and tried her best. We would also like to thank the staff that did try to make us feel welcome especially ricky loco vitamine and anime.    Unfortunately for us we will not come back to this hotel or to any other Labranda Chained hotels for that matter. If you want to stay in marrakech you need a 5* hotel.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahh386

What makes this hotel is the staff. Our room was spacious comfortable and cleaned every day any request was dealt with immediately. Chakib our customer liason was extremely helpful and the Animation team are second to none. The hotel is a bit dated and parts are in need of a refurb. I would particularly recommend that the stone stairs leading up to the first floors have hand rails fitted as I feel they are a hazard. The food was plentiful but not a great variety. For me breakfast was the best meal with the option of fruits yogurts breads omelettes pancakes etc. but the lunch and dinner were traditional Moroccan with a main dish of both meat and fish. There was a good selection of salads. This hotel is not for people who want traditional English food or burger and chips. There was a good supply of bottled water and we didn't think the ice creams in the shop were too expensive as mentioned by some reviews. The alcohol was very basic but you could pay extra for cocktails etc. in one of the bars.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Halifax, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471silverlady8

Clean modern with aircon Everything worked as expected and they were tidied every day. The hotel itself eg. lobby pool area were always clean. There is a place where you can book excursions should you wish although i booked mine on Viator before i arrived. They also have free a bus that goes into the new town and old town if you want to explore    The slides kept my daughter entertained for hours along with the rubber dingy we brought from the hotel shop (which was pricey but hotel shops always are.) Towels were available at the poolside and we had no trouble finding a sun lounger.There was also a kids disco every night followed by adult entertainment.    The food was good lots of veggies fruit juice and Moroccan dishes and there is a little corner with pizza if you're not that adventurous    Overall i have no complaints and would recommend this hotel particularly for families and couples,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robynjustine
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,CharleyJard wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Nice hotel,Currently staying at this hotel and our final night. Hotel is clean the rooms are cleaned everyday and the reception area is also very clean. The adult pool isn‚Äôt cleaned properly everyday and pool water is only thrown around the pool area. The adult pool area is quiet and able to get a sun bed any time of the day which was good as the weather was 40¬∞. Perhaps a bar at the adult pool but I don‚Äôt know whether this is because we were out of peak season but the other bar is a bit of a trek and to carry the drinks back. Did not use the main pool so cannot comment on this pool but there were plenty of sun beds available there too. Maybe not during peak seasons. Cannot comment on the day time or night time entertainment. Did use the slides though which were good however could perhaps have a sliding mat as it does get quite slippery and probably in main season has more people which could be dangerous. Staff are nice some on reception not exactly welcoming however can deal with this. The shop shuts at 5pm and is quite expensive and there is nothing about locally to purchase anything else so can only buy at the shop. One lady in there is rude too. Money exchange is a available at reception. We had the hamman deal at the spa would recommend as was a really good deal.    The food is nice and a good selection for vegetarians. Different food everyday for lunch and dinner however did get bored towards the end of the stay however this is normal when going all inclusive and doesn‚Äôt reflect the food at this hotel. Always plenty of veg and meat and fish if you eat that. Desserts lovely and lots of fruit too. Restaurant is clean and the staff are friendly. Perhaps have some dairy alternatives such as coconut milk would be the only Criticism but only a little one.    A star has been lost due to the fact that tonight at dinner guests complained about the cats being in the restaurant even though they were causing no harm and the guests made the waiters chase them from the Restaurant. The cats have not caused any problems the whole stay and have been fed by guests without any complaints throughout the hotel. Cats were not pestering and guests were often feeding them and stroking them throughout the hotel grounds. For this reason I have reduced the rating as it would have been five stars and perfect.    We would stay at this hotel again. Perhaps not in peak season.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleyJard
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Anna A wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Not 4 star,A decent hotel but definitely not 4 star. When we arrived our room door was opened the floor hadnt been mopped and there was no water in the taps. I went to reception to complain as no one told us that you must dial 9 to get through to reception. The receptionist's attitude was exactly what I expected. She was very nonchalant I guess because she was new? Nevertheless the floor didnt get cleaned until housekeeping came next day but water was in the taps shortly after I complained. There is no fridge kettle nor iron. So do all your ironing prior to visit or wear all wrinkled clothing. No fridge or kettle was not ideal as I had a baby. It would also be helpful that the people who book the excursions give you more detail. For example: telling us that the activity will be half day but not mentioning that they would pick up passengers from other hotels on the way. It would be nice to know considering we had a baby with us. However the excursions were quite good nontheless. Definitely recommend camel ride. The food is good. Shower is amazing. The staff were ok. I think they catered mostly for french speakers. I will recommendthis hotel if you are a teenager or mid twenties with no kids. Definitely not suitable for babies. I met other mumsat the hotel and we all agreed that it is not baby friendly.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annaaR4698ZM

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Daitwice85 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Excellent Hotel and Amazing Staff,What an amazing experience! On arrival the receptionist was very welcoming and checked us in promptly. He even had food prepared for us as we arrived in the early hours! This was far beyond what we have experienced in other hotels and was a pleasant surprise.    We were assisted to the room by another friendly member of staff. The room was spacious modern and clean. It was a decent size for a family of 3 and could have easily fitted a few others in comfortably.    The animation team made the holiday for us and our toddler. They made a huge fuss of him and got everyone involved without being pushy at all. They all put such effort in to their jobs and it really shows. The entertainment and activities go on all day and in to the evening. We would like to say a special thank you to Loco and Amine. They have made the holiday an extra special one for our toddler. They went the extra mile to make sure he was enjoying.    Now for the food there is plenty of choice for dinner and evening meal with fresh food being brought out regularly. Breakfast is your typical continental style breakfast. Most of the dishes are local dishes but as a family we are happy to try new things. For the more fussy eater they do have plainish chicken rice potatoes pizza etc.    The only thing I would have like to have seen is ice cream to be included in the all inclusive package. Although it's not overly expensive to buy them at the hotel shop.    They have 5 pools but one being an adult only pool. They are clean and well maintained. The main pool is a decent size and most of the activities are centred around this. There are plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas but we got up early to find ones with the most shade for our toddler. The 4 slides are available all day and are extremely fun. The adult pool is situated a good distance away from the main pool and activities which makes it perfect for relaxing.    The bars are situated close to the main pool and the staff are always happy to serve with a wide selection of drinks.    We stayed mid September and the weather never dipped below 30.    There is also security dotted around the hotel which was reassuring. They were friendly approachable and hardly noticeable in the background.    Overall a massive 5 stars from us! We will definitely be returning!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bridgend, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daitwice85

Big shout out to Salim Amine vitamin Sam loco Rachid and  Samy. You all deserve a pay rise!    Night entertainment was just as fun. From pool parties karaoke African drummers bingo and lots of dancing. They also do themed nights like white night and red and white night.    Food was amazing! Being a pescatarian I was in my element with all the fresh vegetables dishes they had to offer. Lots of verity to chose from. Just a shame they don‚Äôt have ice-cream or lollies available.    The hotel was always cleaned and kept well. Although we had to keep asking for towels.    We will definitely be booking up for 2020 and it will be longer then a week this time.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Collins Family wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Fabulous fun!,We stayed at this hotel last month a family of 5 with three teens and we LOVED it! The best thing about this hotel is how much fun it is - the entertainment team are superb. I'm somebody who usually keeps my head down when asked if I want to take part in pool aerobics etc... here I was doing Aqua Fitness Aqua Zumba (so funny) poolside darts silly pool games quizzes bingo dancing with African drummers...you name it I was doing it! Big thanks to Loco Ricky Samil Sam Amine and Vitamin - you guys make this hotel! There was also a brilliant pool party - a bit too much splashing for me but the kids loved it.    The food is great unless you're the sort of person who likes to pile 85 different cuisines on your plate and needs chips with every meal... and I bet they have a lot less waste than other hotels. Amazing breads and salads lots of vegetables and interesting Moroccan tagines to try barbecue meat or fish at lunchtime pizza and pasta for the kids a great choice of desserts - my only request would be ice cream please!    The hotel is kept brilliantly clean the staff are friendly and put up with my schoolgirl French the pools are really nice and you can ALWAYS get a sun lounger and the rooms are a good size. Marrakesh itself is amazing - lots to do and see and we went on a fantastic night trip to the old city plus a horse and carriage ride which was really good and arranged from the hotel.    Our kids all made friends and are begging to go back next year...maybe we will!,Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CollinsOnHoliday
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Beks wrote a review Sep 2019,50,I now have the holiday Blues :(,Recently came back from visiting this hotel and now I have the holiday blues.    What a fantastic hotel.    What makes this hotel great is the entertainment team. They are energetic entertaining and full of fun. Especially Amine Ricky and Loco.    The hotel is immaculate. The pool side restaurant and rooms are always kept clean. The staff are always attentive and happy to help. I couldn't fault the services.    The food is traditional Morrocan food. If you enjoy fresh vegetables and authentic food you will love the food here. Me however I am slightly fussy so found most meals I had the bare minimum on my plate.  There is a wide variety but mainly traditional.    The shops are a 30 minute walk away if you prefer to buy snacks gifts or other food which is a bit of a trek. I suppose it's whether you wish to make the journey on foot.    There is a shuttle bus that you book the night before to take you into the old or new town. I highly recommend this experience. I enjoyed the old town I just advise that you stay in a group and keep your bearings about you.    All in all a fantastic holiday!!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Davesfamily2014 wrote a review Sep 2019,10,IT'S NOT AN AQUA PARK!!!!,Having 3 Kids (1113 & 14) who are all obsessed with swimming we booked this place as we couldn't get in any of the other Aqua Parks in the area. We've been to Marrakesh before so thought if we can't get in our preferred aqua park then we'll just jump into the next but it's not an aqua park!! If the place was in a more developed country the trades descriptions act would tear them apart! They have 4 small water slides (made to look huge on their photos) and that's it. Our kids were bored within an hour. I can only assume the hotel owners have never been to actual aqua park (like the Aqua Fun Club or the Aqua Mirage Club all local to this one)  The food was boring (mountains of cheap dishes like pasta & rice) weird food like vegetable based stews cooked with lamb bones (but no lamb to be found) Zero effort to cater for kids if you think kids could take their pick from all the all inclusive classics then you are wrong. No burgers chicken nuggets hot dogs etc.. (you get the picture) its ALL traditional Moroccan food. Me & the wife were fine but the reluctant kids survived on bread for 10 days but by day 5 I finally cracked and went to McDonalds (I was the best Dad in the world that day) The entertainment is predominantly French & Arabic with very little English translation which was frustrating but to be fair most of the guests were French (its a very French place.),Date of stay: August 2019,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davesfamily2014

Firstly want to say the animation team were absolutely amazing so a big thank you to Salim Loco Amine Vitamine Rashid and Sam. They all work so hard to make your stay lively and fun. Best animation staff I have met!    Check in was smooth at reception but then had to wait 2 hours for the room to be ready then when we were escorted to our room it still weren't clean so housekeeping were cleaning our room around us!  The room was smaller than expected as we had a family room booked but that wasn't a problem as only saw the room to sleep and get changed lol.    The hotel and the grounds were clean and well kept although I wouldn't say it's a 4 star. The pools were clean and plenty of sunbeds. Air con could have been better.    Food wasn't the best not enough variety especially for children.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,3008travels wrote a review Aug 2019,20,Terrible housekeeping and customer service.,The hotel has some lovely features such as a nice entrance beautiful pools and the aqua park element is very nice.  However there are quite a few elements that definitely need upgrading such as the sofas in the lobby peeling and almost all the plates being chipped.  My biggest gripe was the customer service the receptionist was very dismissive when dealing with our queries. We requested two rooms next to each other and we were given two rooms consecutive in number but not next to each other. We requested several times for this to be changed and were treated each time like we were a massive inconvenience. Now there actually being no rooms available next to each other would have been highly understandable since they were quite busy however what made the experience very unsavoury was watching a set of local families can moved into new rooms instead of us.  House keeping also seem to forget to replace towels this is another thing we were made to feel like an inconvenience when querying in the end we had to retrieve our own.  The entertainment team were very lovely though the most attentive people in the premises by far.  Overall a very ok hotel but I would not recommend I have been to much better in Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3008travels

We had lots of fun and staff have and always have been excellent! Our room the food drink and entertainment was brilliant! It even rained at one point but most stayed in the pool and the animation team soon joined us after finishing their break and carried on with their games/activities. A big shout out to the animation team who deserve soo much praise and a big huge paycheck for always doing their very best and always going above and beyond! Rachid Loco (bestfriend) Sam Vitamin Salim Amine and Bossman Sami you guys are excellent and I wish you all the best in everything you do!  Big shout out to the bar staff Achraf Zakaria Monier and Ahmed(Superman - he looks like him) and the lifeguard khamari for being the best at what they do!  Your staff are what make the hotel what it is!  The only downfall is your security!!  Me and my friends have been to your hotel 4 times now and have NEVER complained but what happened on our last night was ridiculous. It made me and my friends feel very uncomfortable. We thought it being our last night we would go for a walk through the hotel grounds and got followed the whole time by one security man called Yousef. Yousef then carried on following us to our room and had then come up to me asking me where did my friend go to when she had gone to the toilet. Some may see this as minor but anything can happen in the dark.    Other than that we love your hotel and we hope this gets sorted as we do want to come back. Before this situation happened we had happened to meet the boss of the hotel and had told him how we love the hotel.

The food was good although the snacks could have been better and the wasps were all over them. Room was nice and kept clean although a few ants..

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jackie M wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Very nice hotel,I have just returned from a 10 day holiday here. Check in was quick and easy you have to pay ¬£15 per person tax on arrival. Make sure you get your wristbands because they forgot to give us ours and 2 days later one of the bar staff refused to serve us! All the staff are friendly and helpful. We had a large family room which was nice with a garden area to sit out in. We thought the food was good with plenty of variety.its of salad and veg dishes usually chicken fish and beef dishes to chose from all Moroccan style as you would expect. How people can moan about not enough food is unbelievable! Surely 3 meals a day is enough for anyone! There is a guy cooking pizza all evening. He can only cook one pizza at a time and if someone takes the whole pizza then you can expect to wait. Im my view why go to Morocco to eat pizza?!! If you have fussy children you can usually find pasta rice chips and toasted chicken. The afternoon snacks at the pool bar aren‚Äôt particularly exciting (if you‚Äôre still hungry after lunch and can‚Äôt wait for dinner!) they serve salad cakes and pancakes. They put out jam and honey got the pancakes which obviously attract a few wasps! However we didn‚Äôt find wasps a problem anywhere else. I can honesty say I only queued once at the pool bat behind 2 people there was always 2 Barman. If you go to the cosy bar just by reception you will find no queue at all and it is just yards from the pool. They work hard to entertain guests both during the day and evenIng. Always a kids disco followed by a singer or dancing snake charmer etc. The main pool is very lively. If you don‚Äôt have children you will leave the peace and tranquility of the adult pool. We found on occasion that some French families thought it was ok to bring children in this was very annoying As it quickly became noisy we had to complain to reception who sent someone down to speak to them however It didn‚Äôt stop them from returning. With so many pools I fail to see how some people can‚Äôt follow the rules. Overall a very enjoyable holiday.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kayaxx wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Fantastic Holiday,We have just returned from a week stay at this hotel. We travelled as a party of 6 myself my friend and our 4 kids. I must say I was worried at first from some of the bad reviews I read before travelling but I was proven wrong. This hotel is a fantastic family destination that we all enjoyed so much. The hotel is nice and clean rooms cleaned everyday and new fresh towels restorked everyday. We requested an interconnecting room as our boys are teenagers and needed their space. The reception staff were polite and helpful and managed to give us the rooms even though it was short notice. Ikram from guest relations made our stay so enjoyable. We met her on our first day at their meet and greet afternoon and everyday she would look for us either in the restaurant or bar only to ask if we needed anything. Most evenings she would sit and. have dinner with us which was nice. I know a lot of reviews complain about the food however I don't think it's as bad as people say. The  breakfast was really nice with freshly made bread and rolls. always some nice cheese and ham always lots of fruit and veg different yoghurt flavours and in the hot buffet section you always find eggs fried boiled and scrambled crepes with fresh organic honey. Some nice grilled tomatoes and anything else the chef would have prepared. Lunch and dinner we felt it was a bit of hit and miss but I think it's mainly because most of it was their Moroccan dishes or the way of cooking which I didn't think is that bad. We actually enjoyed the beef stew and tripe. When in Morocco you do or eat what the Moroccans eat I don't see why people expect full english breakfast and Sunday roast. You travel to experience the culture and different foods. The only thing to criticise is given how hot it was the water in the fridges was always luke warm and not nice to drink in that heat and there was no ice cream at all on the dessert menu or at the pool bar as an all inclusive item like most hotels offer. I think this is something the hotel management should think about and invest in an ice cream machine. A lot of young kids visit this hotel and ice cream is a basic treat for kids. The shop at the hotel is very expensive.  I must say the animation team (Salim was my favourite) are the best there is and they make the stay enjoyable. They are non stop engaging with the holiday makers young and old there is always activities going on with a smile on their faces. The pools are clean and the water activities we enjoyed so much. The water slides add to the entertainment of the kids and even us the adults had a few gos. Overall we loved our stay at this hotel and looking forward to coming back.

We were directed to customer service and was rudely told by Khaleed that we were being transferred!!! Another couple and family had turned up (was on the same flight) and was also told the same!! The hotel was double-booking the rooms and not telling the agent. I refused to leave and advised this was the product I purchased and I will be staying here. They continued to say they had no room and our only choice was to transfer to their sister hotel Labranda Rose - not even a 1* hotel!!!

Got to the hotel and had to pay an extra ¬£30 on arrival just to get in to our room. The food was not to bad if you like fish.. Chicken.. And rice a lot. The pool was nice and clean. They had four slides at the park which were poor for an aqua park. The bar staff there...... Well.. 99% of them were rude. You would ask for a larger and what you would get is a small glass under half a pint. When you asked for 4 largers just to try and make up 2 pints they would turn funny and tell you to bring the glasses back. The bar staff couldn't find a bottle opener so they would use their teeth to open it and pour it into your small glass and expect you to drink it. Would not recommend this hotel.

There are so many positives; they have many pools and sunbeds available you do not need to get up early to put towels on them to secure one. we were up at 8.30 every morning.There are several slides which the children enjoyed. There is a free shuttle service to and from the old and new town regularly each day. The entertainment staff are friendly talk to the guest and encourage them to join in. The rooms and facilities are clean. Check in was quick and easy. I am not a fussy eater so there was plenty of meat fish and Salads etc for me but the variety for children is very limited particularly for evening service. There is not food available all day lunch stops at 2.30 and then evening meal is not served until 7.30. During this time they serve snacks between 3 and 5 these consist of traditional cakes. The kids were always hungry or waiting for the next serving. A big moan is that there wasn't no ice cream during the day or at meal times. The only ice cream available in the hotel shop I paid ¬£15 for 3 small individual tubes of ice cream. There is only one small bar serving drinks usually with only one member of staff to serve all guests and the barman can be quite stroppy. This meant queues were large and wasps were plenty! Unless the children went to the kids club the pool side entertainment and games was adult based except the aqua aerobics which they could join in. Bingo cost ¬£10 but pens are not provided you have to pierce the paper to make a hole. I booked a standard room for 3 people on arrival was given a room with 2 single beds. I went to reception and was told standard means for 2 people. I explained I had a booking for 3 people and they said they were aware but this was an issue with who I booked with. They did provide a camping style bed but it was quite cramped in the room. The room itself was clean tidy and an enormous shower which was lovely at the end of the day. Fully air-conditioned but the WiFi could only be reached in the room if you put your phone out of the window. The beds are very hard but I suffer from backache so were very comfortable for me. The biggest issue we found was at 11pm everything finishes bars close and at the same time all outside lights get turned off which we found very annoying as we like to sit out and play cards for a little longer. Good tip at 10.50pm order lots of drinks and that will last you through to midnight.    Overall the holiday was lovely and the hotel was great just those little annoying things that after a few days start to get on your nerves. If only the hotel would alter theses things then 4 to 5 stars I would have given.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Thatcham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8951ARrichardw

My 15 year old was bored for 10 days we have visited other aqua parks in Egypt Turkey Cypus and Greece and this was the worst one we have ever visited. Luckily there is an adult pool and this is where we stayed for 10 days. Food was terrible and very long queues for Pizza when you nearly get to the front the people in front take all of the pizza to give to their family and you then have to wait for more to be cooked. The food was the same most days and massively over cooked. The chicken dishes were tough the fish was dreadful. Food is not all inclusive it is not available all day and the snacks are terrible and are served by the main pool and are left overs from breakfast and bread & cake. No ice cream available for the kids and they are massively overpriced in the shop. No snacks available for the kids and crisps are also hugely expensive in the shop also. No Wi-Fi in the rooms only the public areas. The alcohol available is very limited and is served in small plastic glasses and the kids drinks are served in tiny espresso cups.We met other people who had arrived and there was no room available for them as they had overbooked the hotel and they were sent elsewhere until the next day. This happened three times during our final day. Entertainment is in French! The rooms were clean and we had fresh towels everyday. The pool towel station opened at 10am by 10.45 all of the towels had gone luckily I took some of our own. The usual happens here and you have to be up early to get a bed round the main pool.

Very friendly and attentive staff who always try to help you with anything you need. There is always a good selection of food and the restaurant staff are lovely. The bar staff are great and are always happy and remember what you have to drink so big thank you to Mohamed and all the bar staff. The best part of the holiday was the ANIMATION TEAM Samy Salim Rachid Vitamine Loco Sam & Kiki these go out of their way daily to include everyone In the activities which are great they don‚Äôt stop from morning till night they really do an OUTSTANDING job and are a credit to the hotel.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,284natasha wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Would definitely go back! Miss Morocco!,We spent the best 11 days in this hotel. Food is very healthy a bit limited for a 4 star hotel though. If you are into chips and burgers - this place wouldn't be for you. I enjoyed the freshly squeezed juice or an apple and melon smoothie in the morning. Pancakes with semolina are the best. Yes they queues are long if you have breakfast at 9am or after. The food is mostly Moroccan which I loved a lot.  The room was average always very clean the air con worked perfectly well.  The best part was the animation team. You won't be bored during the day if you want to do aqua aerobics zumba water polo etc. The guys are so much fun and definitely made our stay unforgettable. Many thanks to Rachid Loco and Salim! We miss you guys!  I agree with the previous comments about paper/plastic cups wasps in the pool bar the A/I drinks are of a very poor quality...  I would highly recommend a Desert Safari Trip which cost ‚Ç¨100 pp and it was worth it.  We had the best time ever and I would love to return!,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284natasha
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,clea1 wrote a review Aug 2019,20,Wouldn‚Äôt return.,Stayed at this hotel for a week 2 adults and 4 teens/kids.  Aged 141312 & 4  Hotel is very clean and it‚Äôs well looked after.  Located in the middle of a building site. Literally nothing around it.  Food is awful kids were hungry most days chips only served at lunch time pizza served lunch and dinner but ques were always so long as seemed that was all the kids were eating when burgers were served the que was at least 15 minutes long and you were only allowed 2. Some days waited 10 minutes for cutlery drinks served in small paper cups  Only 1 bar open during the day and that was the pool bar which was swamped by wasps and yes they do sting!  Room was lovely but no aircon which was first thing I noticed on arrival in my room. When I went to complain to reception was told aircon doesn‚Äôt come on until 6pm! Well temperature of my room didn‚Äôt change at all during my stay.  Hotel shop is extremely over priced. Nearly ¬£3 for an ice cream hotel doesn‚Äôt have ice cream as part of their all inclusive.  Between lunch and dinner (I believe from 3-5pm) they have what they call a snack bar it‚Äôs just pastry and cake! Apparently sandwiches too but I never see any during my stay no hot food served apart from at meal times in restaurant! Which usually resulted in my children being hungry which is the first time we have experienced that on an all inclusive holiday.  A few quests I spoke to were also suffering with upset tummy‚Äôs.  Guest relations is useless she doesn‚Äôt care in the slightest just writes all your complaints down in a note book! She told another guest at the hotel they cater for the locals! Which would explain why quite a few British people were unhappy during their stay!  Went to the new town but found the locals very unwelcoming.  Entertainment was OK apart from the evening singer before the kids disco they had the same guy nearly every night! Boring!  VItamine from the entertainment team is a lovely guy and always made time for the guests.  Would I return? Defiantly not!,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clea1

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Somaiya wrote a review Aug 2019,50,BEST WEEK EVER !,I came back from this amazing resort 3 days ago. I wish I had booked a couple of more days extra!  Pros of the resort:  AMAZING and when I say amazing I mean AHHHHHMAZING entertainment staff!! Always ask the people around the pool what‚Äôs going on for evening entertainment because there is always something amazing going on. While I was there we got to see a snake show Moroccan day African performances and even a show held by the own amazing entertainment staff.  The entertainment staff put so much effort and commitment into their job for the whole 5 days that I was there I saw them from when I woke up to when I fell asleep always having friendly conversations with the customers dancing around doing aqua Zumba or some sort of game at the pool checking up on customers or even having a meal with them. I don‚Äôt know each one of their names but each one of them deserves both a pay rise and some sort of reward for their efforts. They‚Äôre always smiling even though they are constantly working long hours ! When sister was upset because she wanted to go and touch the kittens and play with the kittens (yes the hotel has 5 lovely kittens and 2 cats) but we told her to stay alongside us susu an amazing girl from the entertainment team  Came to cheer her up and asked her to dance with her. When my little brothers ring floaty got stolen by another older boy one of the other members of the entertainment staff (he knows who he is) he went over to translate the situation to the mother who refused to give the floaty back so when he came back he offered to purchase another one from the same shop for us. We ofc said no it‚Äôs fine. But it‚Äôs the act of kindness that he had shown.  The food was really nice with a large variety of deserts and soft and fruit drinks.  The bar was always open to grab water or drinks and the timing of the food schedule was perfect!  We had actually surprised the kids and they didn‚Äôt know we were coming here because it was their first holiday!  The receptionists are so nice and welcoming!  Definitely recommend using the shuttle bus services and staying for more than 2 hours. I‚Äôd book coming back for around 4 hours after. I‚Äôd recommend going to the old city because it has beautiful things you can purchase. The new city is a normal place with a large H&M Zara etc the highlight is ofc the halal mc Donald‚Äôs!  In regards to the pool life guards are also absolutely amazing and on point. The slides are so much fun!! I‚Äôd recommend as soon as you wake up to go and put your towels on the chairs near the pool because everyone saves their chairs like that and you won‚Äôt have a chair if you go after breakfast. You can get towels for the pool side after 10am all you  have to do is give your room number.  The only complaint we had was the beds and room service.  The beds were very very hard we would wake up with back and shoulder pain that would go after around 1 hour. We had paid for 2 rooms for 2 people but were given 1 room for 3 and 1 room for 2 when we told them they said they would add a bed but when they did it was a foldable very uncomfortable one. Room service is really slow there was a time there was no towels in our room and we had just come from the pool wanting to have a shower and there were no towels  they took around 4 hours to bring the towels the same was shampoo I had told them the night before that we were out and only when I told reception the next day did they put some shampoo in our room. Besides that the rooms were always clean and amazing the cleaners are very dedicated to their jobs and are amazing !    Overall it was an amazing experience and almost perfect !!,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/somsam
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tour792078 wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Where do I start,After reading the reviews I had mixed opinions on the destination. The Mrs persuaded me as it was inclusive and it said it was a water Parc and that it would be great for the kids so hence why decided to go here. On arrival at the hotel at about 1200am the receptionist was rude didn't see us booked in for the hotel so showed him the details on my phone and rudely he said email them to the hotel. (The staff need to cater for English speaking customers)So I did. Finally got the room sorted asked for food as kids were hungry we were given 4 plates of salad... More like left overs from the evening meal. The room needs loads improvement as it is not a 4 star I can assure you. The pools are small and the slides are slightly bigger than the ones at our local park. The food got tidious after 2 days the kids didn't like it so we started to eat out from KFC burger King and McDonald's etc. The worst part was they ran out of milk n tea bags on a few occasions and I was told to go to the bar to get milk Crazy. The holiday representives charged us ¬£30 for a taxi fare to and from minara Hall... Seems all the employees and the taxi firms are in it to rob the tourists. The free shuttle bus was good but needs to run till late. The haggling at the shops is more like an argument... When you disagree with their prices they get quite annoyed and start cussing in French. I don't think I will be returning to morroco again and I feel this experience has really let my expectations down. Guys this was my experience but I hope you have a better experience.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour792078

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kay528795 wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Better for families not couples,Booked this hotel for a couple of nights after staying in the hectic M√©dina area for 5 nights. We wanted an escape from the city a place to sunbath and relax. We chose this hotel based on the price for All inclusive which was reasonable. We found the adult only pool (no frills but in its own nice garden) which was situated at the far end of the grounds away from the slides main pool kids pool and entertainment but this was also far away from the only bar. The bar served the usual all inclusive nondescript brands of spirits and beer the Gin was ok but other spirits taste like flavouring you would add to your baking! It‚Äôs worth trying a few to see what suits your pallet. Some bar staff were better than others but considering they were serving all day in swarms of bees (yes can confirm that they do sting!!) you had to be grateful to get a drink at all. Food not that great to be honest. Very repetitive and when they serve chicken or burgers or bbq sausages you had to queue for ages to get any and the whole bun fight was poorly set out. The rooms/bathrooms are huge modern and clean with air con. Towels changed daily if required. Hair dryer provided. We paid ¬£45 pppn which was ok but pay much more than this and I think you maybe a little disappointed especially with the poor standard of food in particular. Check in and check out was very simple and swift. We arrived 11am was given our wrist bands pointed in the direction of the bar and told our room would be ready by 12pm it was so all good there!!,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barnsley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kay528795
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,ASCOM137 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Extremely Enjoyable!,My partner and I just got back from a week at this hotel and we had a thoroughly great time. The staff were all fantastic from the receptionists the animation team to the kitchen and bar staff. We really felt like the staff cared and made a good effort to get to know the guests. One waiter in particular remembered our drink orders and made sure they were ready and waiting at our table while we went up to get food.    The room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. Massive shower which was extremely powerful which was great. The adult pool was nice and quiet for relaxing and it wasn‚Äôt too far from the main pool so you could easily go back and forth without it being a big hassle.    Entertainment was great and there were a lot of fun activities to participate in around the pool. We had the added joy of there being six kittens bounding around the pool area and being adorable.    The only faults we had were that we thought the shop should be open longer. It closed at 5pm and we found it a little inconvenient but not a massive problem. We also felt that the waits for food were too long. I had to wait 15+ minutes for two chicken breasts one night and it was pretty much guaranteed a 10+ minute wait for pizza.    But all in all fantastic hotel. I would 100% recommend!,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASCOM137

The only negative was the all inclusive pool bar queue. Only one member of staff. Queue was long. Lots of Wasps!    The hotel had a shuttle to take people to the madina.

Easy to find sun beds round the pool and it‚Äôs very relaxed. Kids loved the slides my only issue is that the pool itself had lots of bugs and dirt in it even thou it was cleaned in the morning and the dirt behind the sun beds wasn‚Äôt very nice think if the staff lifted the beds at night they could clean the tiles better.the music is so loud round the pool So bring ear plugs if you want a snooze.    Grounds are well kept and food was good but I was so annoyed at a lot of the waste of it by guests tables filled with plates of food that weren‚Äôt eaten and just thrown away. Lifeguards are lovely and kind.    The staff In the shop are so unfriendly and not very willing to help at all. Bought floats told to blow them up ourselves?! Asked for price of ice creams and was just grunted at lol it was an experience at least!    Used the spa wasn‚Äôt really impressed booked for a 45 mins massage was given 20 mins the lady kept leaving the room and the door was left open! They didn‚Äôt understand English kept asking if I spoke french so wasn‚Äôt able to explain my disappointment well they thought I was telling them I was happy when I was telling them I was disappointed.

No sitting in a lobby waiting hours to get into your room the hotel has room attendants who assisted with locating you and your luggage to room.  Ok not a bang up to date state of the art room but clean comfortable with air confridgebalcony in a garden setting with lunch green grass and palm trees.rooms cleaned and restocked EVERY day. 6 Pools 2 X main pools with entertainment and music 1 X slide pool for the 4 slides that run twice daily and a relax adult only pool for those guests trying to avoid the noise.  Food is buffet style with a slight difference as they have live cooking every meal time BBQ item at lunch and a pizza and pasta bar every lunch and evening meal an absolute god send for this with fussy eaters.  Moroccon restaurant for those of you wishing to experience the local specialties.food is of a very high standard as is the cleanliness.  All management and staff all levels friendly and professional an absolute delight to be around. Morroco it self is still building to what will become a delightful country over time would recommend a visit to Medina market but be aware this is a busy place so safety of children and money a priority also ignore local reps when u arrive follow the rest of people.  I had a misconception prior to my visit that maybe my wife had selected a country that maybe is a little unstable especially as it's proximety to Tunisia and the recent concerns they have experienced were factors for my raised concern but I couldn't have been further from the truth this hotel is within a secure complex with 24 HR security although not required.

Me and my friends all being girls were very sceptical about going Morroco as we haven‚Äôt heard the best stories about the place being safe but honestly we had the best 7 nights ever!    We made best friends with the staff here who made our stay extremely pleasant! Starting off with all the girls and guys working on reception. We didn‚Äôt get their names but everyday they were always more than happy to help with any sort of query we had. Silly ones like asking them everyday to put my bracelet on for me as I couldn‚Äôt with my acrylic nails lol!    Now the tour guides at meeting point. we are so blessed to call Asma Khalid and Mahmood our friends. We could sit for ages and talk to them and they would always be open to talking. They always helped us with what activities to do and always advising us which places to visit. Seeing them everyday made our days and for them to just be so welcoming since day one played a big part of making us enjoy our stay. Thank you for always checking up on us everyday to make sure everything is okay. We miss you all already!    Animations team were amazing! Brad Salim and the rest! From 9am-11pm they would be on the feet making sure everyone is having the best time. Always getting everyone involved in activities and also making it feel like we were THEIR friends. They always said hello and spoke to us if we crossed paths around the hotel.    Entertainment near the pool hosted by the animations team every night was amazing. It would be a different theme every night they would always get the crowd involved and honestly I wish I took more of my time out in the evenings to sit and watch their shows. Truly amazing in what they do!    Rooms were spacious and cleaned everyday and food was decent with lots of options for breakfast lunch and dinner but also could get a little repetitive.    All in all from our stay we will miss all the staff the most and thank you for being so welcoming for us young three girls and always going out of your way to make sure we are comfortable and safe!

TeaTime very simple snacks  gone within seconds.  No ice- cream for children have to buy from shop ¬£3.00 each.  Tea/ coffee and non alcoholic drinks come from machine queue up behind counter this should be placed near counter so customers could help themselves.  All drinks are in throw away cups and not given in glasses during the day.  Mangers should visit another resort like Aqua mirage or Aqua fun club in Marrakech to see the difference between alinclusive food and drinks so they get idea what this means.    Book free coach to old medina and new a few times a day but won‚Äôt get lift back even though you booked it a few days ago driver very rude to customers .  110 Dirams for taxi to come back to hotel .  You need to experience souks and market to experience Marrech.  Hotel rep for day trips excellent .  Staff work very hard at this resort  Please sort out food / drinks very big let down otherwise would have rated more.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazamiaman20

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sabina Y wrote a review Jul 2019,10,"Please ignore any positive reviews regarding about the food, location and customer service. This hotel was literally 1*",Me and my sister had booked this for 5 nights after reading the reviews we thought lets go there... on our arrival we notice that the hotel was at the outskirts of the city.. around a construction site .. meaning that there is no local shops so if you needed anything you would need to buy it from the hotel store where the prices are ridiculous compared to a local shop. For example a coke would be 20dirhams and in a local shop it would be 3dirhams?    When we checked in we was not told anything about the hotel we were just given a map :| once we moved off to our room we noticed there is NOOO WIFI atall. The staff also confirmed that there is no wifi but only in the pool area and reception which i found ridiculous.. imagine if there was an emergency we would never know unless were at the pool?    as we got into the room it was a btec furnished room. Honestly it looked like i was in low budget hotel the hair dryer was VILE full of mould and everything was just dirty and was done half heartedly.. empty tissue boxes etc. I complained regarding about the dryer and even the fact the hot water wasn't working properly.. the staff literally looked at me dead in the eye and couldn't care less.    The food was awful i was genuinely surprised how people even ate the food was either sooo bland and watered down or there is soo much salt and unbearable.    Do not bother getting all inclusive it will ruin your system as we had stomach issues when we got back to the UK.    overall would i book here again? NOOO way. Worst experience ever and tbh this was my third time in marrakech.    The only thing i could say is that the staff in the taxi service were the only helpful people and very nice.    the hotel staff were not friendly except one and the cleaners.. wow .. just expect to have random dirty towels that doesn't belong to you.. like we had!!!!!!    absolute filth.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sy931

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,mazmoz1971 wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Could've been better,The weather was gorgeous sunshine every day so great destination if you're after a lot of sun.  Hotel was clean and so were the swimming pools with several to choose from. Advertised as a family friendly resort so baby pool was full of little ones all day but there is a quiet pool if you want to get away from the noise.  We struggled to get full fat milk for the 22 month we had you can get milk at breakfast but you need to ask in the buffet restaurant if you need it later in the day. But there is a limited amount!  Some people complained about the food but we thought there was plenty of choice and great flavours lack of flies (big bonus) meant none of us ended up with dodgy tums.  There are a lot of Wasps but we all agreed it was better than lots of moscitos.  The entertainment team tried really hard during the day kids disco at 9 pm followed a variety of acts. The cabaret was so bad it was hilarious and I would recommend it purely for the chuckle factor.  The main thing they need to improve on is drinks service there is no pool side service you have to walk and queue up at the bar. It's the same at night but the bar that's open at night is further away from the stage. Most of us don't go on holiday to stand waiting for a drink only to be given a nasty plastic glass and have the bar shut at 11pm.  Would I go back to Morocco? Yes but not too this hotel unless it improves,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mazmoz1971

We were taken to the restaurant where there was fresh food available for us. Our room was then upgraded from a standard twin room with no balcony to a bigger room with a balcony.    The food was excellent lots of choice variety and was always fresh. Lots of veg which I really enjoyed as this is sometimes lacking at an all inclusive hotel.    The pools were large and clean the entertainment staff were about all day doing aqua aerobics volley ball etc. There was also a quiet adults only pool which we enjoyed. All the staff were very helpful the shuttle bus in to Marrakesh was great and very easy to use.    We had a really great week in Marrakesh and this hotel I don‚Äôt usually want to return to the same hotel but I do here.

The hotel itself is lovelythe pools were great the animation team were energetic friendly and hysterically funny. The majority of staff are very helpful and friendly but the pizza guy and some of the bar staff were just plain rude. We stayed in a garden view family room which was spacious comfortable and clean with 24/7 air con. The only down side to the room was there were no tea and coffee facilities and the towels were a tad small.  Dining was not quite what we expected from an all inclusive holiday children were poorly catered for and coffee tea etc with lunch and evening meal could only be had in paper cartons proper cups were only available at breakfast.  Drinks were in short measures and depending on the whim of the bar staff the majority were served in cartons as well.  Wasps / some type of bees where rife and ruined poolside drinking as whenever a beer or sugary drink ( coke orange etc ) was produced they swarmed round we drank bottled water after the 1st day as my Grandaughter was stung so we didnt dare risk it happening again.  We booked a full day trip into Marrakesh its self via the excursion lady at the hotel which was fabulous I would advise comfy shoes and cool loose clothing as theres a lot of walking in scorching heat.Our guide was fabulous and we felt safe walking round the maze of stalls and shops. We were only aporoached twice the whole day and a firm but friendly french "" non "" sufficed. The hotel have a good range of trips out.

Animation team are really good encouraged everyone to take part but didn't push too much if you didn't want to take part. Evening entertainment was mixed but was good overall Thursday night is games night and was the highlight of the week.    Food and drink is where the hotel falls short the hotel doesn't serve any draught beer which means that the beer is always warm other than the restaurant all drinks are served in plastic glasses even in the evening there is also only one bar open at a time meaning there could be long queues at times. The cocktails were ok as far as all inclusive hotels go and the soft drinks were branded as well rather than the rola cola you can sometimes get. The food on the restaurant was the biggest disappointment whilst we expect the dishes to be limited we have never experienced it to this extent roast chicken and beef stew were twice daily dishes the pizza station was slow and unless you quede you wouldn't get any the pasta was always overcooked and half of the time there was no signs to show what was available.    There was an improvement in the food within the last couple of days after multiple complaints and if the food improved o would definitely return.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stretford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damienf128

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sioned J wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Long weekend in Marrakesh,Me and my friend stayed at this hotel for a long weekend in June 2019.    Arrived late morning to the hotel to be welcomed by a member of staff who checked us in and gave us the wifi code straight away! We were told our rooms where no available until 2pm however when we asked about towel cards to go and sit by the pool they said our room was actually ready early so we got the key.    Room was lovely. Spacious clean and fresh there is nothing to fault with them. only a handful of rooms had balcony‚Äôs but ground floor rooms had terraces! So if you haven‚Äôt paid extra for one.. don‚Äôt expect one!    There are a number of pools. A big one for kids and families which does get noisy at times as there is always some sort of entertainment on! But if you‚Äôre an adults only party i would strongly recommend you head over to the adults only poor around the back. This is sooo peaceful!    Food is nice. Nothing special but a standard all inclusive buffet style restaurant. We could always find a table and didn‚Äôt really have to queue for anything.    Evening entertainment was pretty average. First evening was ‚Äúcabaret‚Äù (not sure men dancing around in toga‚Äôs are classed as cabaret) A karaoke the second evening and live music the last evening.  Kids disco every night between 9-9:30pm.    We had issues with our transfer on the way there not showing up which to be fair the tour organiser sorted out in the hotel for us.    Woman in the shop was very rude. We were told at hotel reception that the shop accepted euros however after trying to purchase crisps and ice cream the rude woman begrudgingly took the euro‚Äôs after kicking up a fuss and trying to tell us to go and change them in reception to dirhams!    Overall a nice relaxing holiday nothing major to complain about! I would recommend to others for a long weekend but couldn‚Äôt spend a whole week or more there as you can‚Äôt walk anywhere from the hotel and wouldn‚Äôt feel safe outside by ourselves!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,colin c wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Great Hotel however it is too far from places of interest.,This hotel has the ability to be rated higher but is sadly let down by silly little things and acts of nature! I have looked at most of the recent reviews given about this Hotel and would agree with about 80% of them especially the bad reviews about the bar management and cleanliness ( or lack of it ). Come on Labranda get a grip 3 people behind the bar with all of them working ( not talking and sending emails ) is going to sort out 75% of the problems. The bees are a different problem but they are not aggressive and generally stay behind the bar until after closing time. I know of 2 people who got stung in our week there and both agreed it wasn't the bees fault. They put their hands down on the bar on top of the bees. Easily solved look where you are putting your hands! Btw there are hardly any flies and I didn't see 1 wasp in the week I was there.  Hotel rooms were great but no balcony on ours. Walk in shower with adequate space. fresh towels daily. Cleanliness is up to an acceptable standard. Safes are in all rooms. WiFi not accessible in all rooms the best place to get it is Reception!  Food I can't fault it overall. I enjoyed it although I did hear a few complaints from other guests. There is a large choice at all meals so there must be something for everybody. ( obviously not though ). A plentiful supply of cutlery and cold water would help to improve the dining experience!  Outside area. Immaculate the pools look clean (5 of them ). Activities take place in and around the pool area daily. Plenty of sun beds and towels if needed.  Location. This is a big let down for this hotel. I disagree totally with the description in the adverts. It is advertised as close to the Medina. I don't call 5 miles away as close. It's 20-25 mins in the coach. Admittedly there is a free coach service throughout the day. Return trip is 1 hour you be the judge. There is only building work around the immediate area of the hotel but it doesn't cause a disturbance. Walking to the shops etc is out of the question for most people.  Staff. Personally I thought they were very friendly and good fun. Najet Kiki and Salim deserve a special mention along with all the staff in the Reception area aswell as the chefs in the dining rooms. Some guests did clash with bar staff and had legitimate complaints most of the time but in some cases it was down to bad management of staff numbers! ( I'm barred from returning now ).  Recommend. On the basis of value for money cleanliness activities and staff friendliness and general efficiency it's a definite yes from me. I would return tomorrow. However it's not to everybody's taste.  Overall we had a great time. This hotel has the potential to raise its rating!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinc551
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Andy6466 wrote a review Jun 2019,20,Let down on the All inclusive,Just returned from here.  Good points.  Beautiful grounds well maintained. Great pools with five to choose from with water slides in one. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms large and clean with walk in shower and maid did a great job. Free bus into Marrakech to old or new town running all day. Animation team kept everyone lively during the day. Clean pool towels every day.  Bad points  Beureau de change for money mostly closed due to no money.  Air conditioning in room kept it hardly cool.  Pool bar in day time full of bees don‚Äôt sting but intimidating. Barman very rude and if on phone took time to serve. Witnessed him serving alcohol to animation team. Glasses plastic and only rinsed in water each time major hygiene issue.Main issues with both bars is the serving time it could take ten minutes to get served due to the fact you get your drinks in plastic glasses or paper coffee cups with about under half a pint of beer in a plastic glass and other drinks in a small paper cups meaning you have to go back to the bar every few minutes to wait in a line again. Water had to be asked to get at the pool bar with one fridge in the cosy evening bar and two in the restaurant never cold always warm and fridges always needing restocking.To me all inclusive means free flowing food and drinks served all day not having to wait in line time and time again.  Restaurant served lovely food but variety was lacking it was Tagine after tagineincluding cauliflower tomato lentil turnip you name it they tagined it. It seemed what was left at lunch was tagined at night. Had a pizza bar with one man cooking and always had a que. needed more staff here. Always lacking spoons for some reason. They had snacks on a afternoon 4-5pm sandwiches and cakes which went in ten minutes needed more.  Needs variety and thought in all food and drink areas.  Shop on site is very expensive with ice creams about ¬£3 each and doesn‚Äôt have a lot of stock. There is a carrefoure supermarket half an hours walk out of gates second roundabout turn left half a mile on right if needed as hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere.  Kids club advertised but closed should be stated only school holiday time. Only kids entertainment was 9-9.30 kids disco too late and too short for a so called family resort. To me this is a lovey resort with a potential to be a great resort but issues with the drinks and food let it down. When we go on holiday we like to be pampered and relaxed not having to join a line to get a drink every fifteen minutes and having a variety of food.  No doubt the customer relations manager will answer this by saying he will address these issues and pass them across. No he won‚Äôt as these have been raised by several holiday makers before and nothing has happened. Sadly it seems the management are happy with the way the hotel is running and are not willing to change anything.First time in Morocco and loved the country the people and the culture Will we return yes will we come back to this hotel sadly No,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ripon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy6466

We would rate this as 4.5 but I have bumped it to a 5 due to the animation team who were all absolutely superb and a credit to the hotel.  Vitamine Salim & Brad thanks for making our holiday a great one. We miss you guys already!  Dari Sami & Kiki also done a good job.  They all worked so hard from 0900 to 2300 providing entertainment around the pool aqua aerobics etc and then the evening entertainment! They always try and get you involved & take time to get to know the guests and chat with them.    Location was good 20 mins from the airport.  First thoughts on hotel were clean and tidy.  We were seen to by reception team straight away and they were friendly.    Food was lovely!  Breakfast fresh croissants and fruits etc along with delicious omelettes - the omelette chef was friendly and remembered your order every morning.  Lunch & dinner was different tagines fresh salad veg pizza etc. Bbq at lunch which was tasty.    Room was large and spacious with aircon & safe cleaned daily with fresh towels.    The outside area is very clean the staff are up early cleaning and maintaining the gardens.    The reason I was going to give a 4.5 instead of 5 was because of the afternoon snacks - these could be improved. There was a small amount of salad and left over croissants served outside near the bar. More pizza / chips would have been nice.  And also the pool bar could do with a dishwasher / actual sink with cleaning products so the barmen aren‚Äôt just rinsing glasses in warm water and giving them to other guests it‚Äôs a little off putting especially with all the wasps.    A Free shuttle service to the old town provided daily. It was a nice morning out.    All in all myself and my friend had a fantastic holiday. We don‚Äôt generally return to the same place twice but we are very much hoping to return here.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Britt27 wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Some very good elements and some not as much,Well the all inclusive element is great as it takes a lot of stress away from the holiday.    The visual aspect of the hotel is very nice. Vibrant modern and big.    The staff: Some were nice and some not as much. When we arrived we were greeted warmly and attended to quickly. Little did we know that it was by the excursion staff taking us into a room (before checking in) to sell us different days out/activities. Upon realising we felt very rushed into decisions. With all that being said it did make booking safe trips possible and easier for us. The majority of the receptionists were very dismissive of us and did not attend to us properly. We had to make our own way to our room as they supposedly assigned someone to take us there but we were left for an extra 15minutes waiting. (on top of a 30 minute wait). The animation team were very nice people and got people in the mood for activities such as volleyball and aqua zumba etc.    The Room: Very nice room. Spacious clean and the layout is great. The only issue is all the rooms do not have WiFi. We had a front porch but even in that area WiFi was hard to attain therefore going further out is the only way to get WiFi.    The food and drinks: Yes they are all inclusive. (apart from the late night bar) If you are use to very flavoured food - this food will not satisfy you. I would say a lot of the food was bland and some not as much (salt is available on the table). It made it hard to pick lunch and dinner from the buffet. Additionally sometimes a certain food is available on one day and not on others. (Nice to know: you can order food to the hotel - ask at reception) Drinks: The cocktails are machine made so are very weak and VERY sweet - however some other guests did enjoy them. You can bring your on alcohol and they do not feel a way. The wine is nice. Normal hot drinks water and fizzy drinks are available and are nice. If you bring your drinks outside there are a lot of wasps.    The pool: Four pools with varying sizes so it is nice. The water is very cool but if you go when it is hot in Morocco it will feel nice. The opening times are not clear and do not make sense. This is also true for the water slides. When speaking to some staff about it you hear one answer then another answer from someone else. Not the cleanest but far from dirty. There are a lot of sunbeds available.    Excursions and activities: The Spa was lovely. We also went to the markets using Labranda's bus service and Mustapha was a great tour guide - he kept us safe and took us to good places. We went to Ouzoud Waterfalls and due to the excursion staff rushing us into decisions he did not tell us the correct attire for the trip. We did not know we would be walking down bumpy muddy hills to get to the waterfall. We were wearing Sandal and dresses. It meant that people in trainers rushed ahead - the tour guide rushed with them and 7 of us (I only knew 2 of them) were left behind which we were upset about as it was dangerous.    Overall: I spent the majority of my holiday in the hotel and I enjoyed it. The hotel is nice but some stuff let it down. Realistically I'd give it a 3.5 but I rounded up because I did enjoy myself.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brittshx
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tasnim Salah'uddin wrote a review Jun 2019,10,PLEASE STAY HERE IF YOU WISH TO BE A VICTIM OF THEFT,Please be aware that although I am very frustrated and upset whilst writing this post everything is all the truth.  I‚Äôll start of by saying that I go to Marrakech every year and when we had booked this hotel we had high expectations due to the reviews. This was not the case when we had arrived. I must admit the aesthetics of the hotels are beautiful but it is the service and shambolic and embarrassment that they call staff that ruined the entire week of our stay. Upon checking in we were taken to our rooms which were absolute filth. The room had not been cleaned since the previous hotel guests. The toilets had fecal matter smeared on the toilet bowl the beds were not made at all. We were told at reception this would be rectified.  We also noticed our safe was BROKEN and amongst 6 people we were given 2 towels to share. I then took to reception and complained about both issues. However the receptionist had only noted down about the towels. Despite this it still took 2 days to get more towels. Having had a broken safe to our shock my friends purse had been stolen. Between the hours of 3pm and 4pm we had used the hotel spa facilities and when we had come back the room was cleaned and beds made ect. This impliedly points the fingers to the cleaner responsible for our room. We complained about this to the staff and they were unbelievably unhelpful. They had acted that they cared and genuine but really it was to shut us up. The guest relation staff Mahmood had told us he informed the police and the police were awaiting our visit to the station. On our final night we decided to go to the police and report this. Of course the police had no information of this and were disgusted. The police then escorted us to the hotel and demanded to speak to manager of the hotel who had no clue of the incident. The police informed us that this issue should have been reported by the hotel the very moment we complained. To make matters worse the staff found our situation funny and were very passive aggressive and sarcastic about the issue. They made plenty of rude comments so far to tell us that it was a personal issue and not theirs. Mahmood perhaps mistakenly told us that this has been an ongoing issue for 4 month and they had have caught culprits going through the room balcony and stealing stuff and leaving as normal. He also told us he had checked CCTV but to the police he told them he had not. Pathetic really. The lack of sympathy was disgusting.  A fellow guest at the hotel had also informed us that his money was also stolen but he didn‚Äôt complain about it.  The sad part of it all was my 2 year old daughter had to suffer in the midst of all this. She was given a dirty and broken cot leaving her to sleep with myself in a single bed.  Overall the food was basic and repetitive the shop was very inconsistent with their opening times the currency exchange is almost non existent as they never have money their security measures are horrible the location means no taxis near by so you‚Äôre left to use their taxis at ¬£17 pounds each way! (A regular taxi could be ¬£6) and ultimately the staff ruined what could have been a great holiday hotel.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TSalahuddin

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Leah wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Amazing holiday,My boyfriend and I were here from the 8th - 15th of June and had an amazing time.    We booked through LoveHolidays and the photos on their website do the hotel no justice it was much nicer than I was expecting. We had a massive room with a kitchen 2 single beds in the living room and then a double bed. There is no balcony which is clearly stated when booking however I believe you can pay extra for a balcony room.    The choice of food is rather limited however there is always something to eat and I'm a really fussy eater. They make fresh eggs/omelette/pancakes etc for breakfast. and fresh pizza and pasta for lunch and dinner as well as other dishes. They had a BBQ on for lunch a few days that we were there but not every day. They always replenish the food and if the hot plate is empty you can simply tell the chefs.    The animation team were absolutely amazing during the day they have morning gym aqua aerobics volleyball water polo aqua Zumba games French bowls Arabic lessons Moroccan tea lessons and we even did a fashion show round the pool in traditional clothing.    For the night times I found this a bit boring the animation team would put on a show and then play music however at 11pm/11:30pm it would be turned off and you are left in silence. You can get a free shuttle to the old town or new town throughout the day and the last bus is 7:30pm but you have to book a space just in case it gets fully booked.    The only problems I had was with the reception. We booked to go to the a la carte restaurant and they failed to tell me there would be a charge (most all-inclusives allow 1 free visit per stay). Luckily I had the money on me and the food was gorgeous so I wasn't too bothered. It was only ¬£20 for both of us and you got mezze starter main dessert tea and wine. so it was worth it. Our other problem was extending our room. You need to check out for 12pm. It is ¬£20 to stay until 3pm or ¬£30 to stay until 6pm. I went the day before we left to extend the room and was told to do it the next day. I then went back the next day to which they told me they were now fully booked. They also have no shower room available so I had to spend 7 hours of my day fully dressed sitting in reception.    Overall we had an amazing time and I would highly recommend visiting. This was our first time in Morocco and we got a very nice impression,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahGuerra

The food was ok. Always found something to eat. Restaurant very busy unless you went as it opened. We used the adult pool everydaywhich was great as we had no children with us but disappointed that guests were using it with their children found this disrespectful to the guests and msnagement when they were told. They are 4 other pools to use this is adult only. This was our only issue. We had a good holiday and would recommend it.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Diana A wrote a review Jun 2019,10,What depends on personal has a big room for improvement,Rooms are clean pools and slides provide a lot of fun buuut:  - Internet is available in the lobby restaurant and main pool. Not In the rooms  - the personal need better training everywhere (operations management): reception has a not enough English level so the guest‚Äôs requests are not fully understood. The same for the shuttle here no English is spoken and the driver gets very angry with you guest after showing no willingness to help (call a colleague who speaks the language); the restaurant is often missing dishes beverages and even forks and knives but cockroaches you find easily!; house keeping changes towels daily even though they are not in the floor plus they remove towels in the morning and bring back in the afternoon (we had twice no towels after bath); the animators call you lazy when you do not accept to join their activities; maintenance employees work during guests are in the pool and stare the guests in bikinis  - the drinks in the all inclusive package are very much dirty water: tastes like nothing and are served in small doses    We tried not to make our week there a stress but it was for sure not a hotel to advise to anyone. I will surely never comes back.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stuttgart, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/505dianaa
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Humairah wrote a review Jun 2019,10,DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL,Absolutely DISGUSTED by the way we have been treated i was there for a full week and the service was appalling!! I arrived with 4 friends and my 2 year old once taken to our rooms we found them dirty toilet used and bed sheets filthy!!!! I then had to walk back through the hotel to request the cot which should of been ready and to my surprise i am bought a FILTHY BROKEN cot with no matress??? I then told the women i did not want it so she went called a man and bought a matress the mad managed to yank the cot pieces into place then left wen i moved the cot to my bed once again BROKEN! On arrival our safes (2rooms) were both not working so we went to reception and told ‚Äòmohammed‚Äô a bald man with glasses the issue and he said okay waiting for someone to fix this we had no choice but to lock belongings into our cases one day my friend left her purse on the bed forgetting and came down to the pool side as the maid had come upto clean... surprise the purse was STOLEN we asked the hotel to investigate as the safes were still not fixed which is there DUTY to provide but no the blamed us and the man on reception refused to take responsibility when he is the one who did not do his job just sat there with a face one being useless the whole week. One the hotel said they could not help we asked them to contact police to investigate we were told by ‚Äòmahmood‚Äô meeting point guy with glasses from egypt he had contacted the police and they would be investigating.. 2days later we hear nothing so visit the police station who say nothing was reported and they visit the hotel and speak to the HOTEL MANAGER who had not even been informed by his own staff off the incident the two women mohammed from reception and mahmood from meeting point should not be trusted mahmood laughed at us upon our departure because we allowed the police to check our rooms saying we were wasting time. Worst hotel ever and i visit every year do not visit this hotel unless u want to be stranded amongst thieves. Also a tip do not book taxis through ‚Äòmeeting point‚Äô or hotel staff once u are in the city ask a local taxi driver for his card and call him or whatsapp for collection it is HALF THE PRICE of what the hotel are giving.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Humairah27
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Nicola_Marie wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Amazing Break,I stayed at this hotel with 4 girlfriends from 14th - 18th June in room 2101 and 2114. The rooms are basic but spacious and clean with a nice balcony area refrigerator and safe. The rooms were cleaned daily.    We were warmly greeted by Soufiane from meeting point in the reception and he remembered us from our visit to another hotel we stayed at last year which was really lovely. You can tell that he really loves what he does. We booked the Ouzoud waterfall trip with his colleagues who were also lovely. That was a great day but a very long coach transfer! The hotel receptionist was very polite and efficient.    Breakfast was good cereal eggs pastries etc.. The lunch was very good and varied with lots of lovely Moroccan tagines and salads. The desserts were amazing! Evening meals were not as varied as lunch times but you could always find something to eat. The Pizza was painfully slow and always had a huge queue I feel that this needs to be reviewed. All restaurants staff were very helpful and attentive and they work so hard.    The bar was a big downside. The queues were so long around mid day they had to have help from the animation team. The plastic tumblers are really small and they constantly ran out when this happened you are given paper cups which are smaller. It‚Äôs very hot so you need larger glasses I believe this would cut queues too as people would not have to go back for refills so often. The staff on the bar were also pretty grumpy. The drinks were pretty good though. Running out of bottled water is also not good in the heat and also on the Monday morning when they opened there were no clean glasses ready! This should have been ready before they opened! One day I gave up on wine and had a beer as the attempt to open three different bottles of wine failed! Trying to open a bottle with a spoon or pushing the cork in with your finger is not going to work! Perhaps invest in a few bottle openers!!    Pools were very clean and plenty of comfy sun beds with a good variety of ‚Äúholiday‚Äù music. If you want it quieter there is an adults only pool tucked away which was nice to relax.    The animation team were brilliant! They were always keen to get people up and joining in with the activities. I‚Äôm a bit lazy on holiday and like to chill so got a bit of friendly teasing! Salim gave my friend a very good shoulder massage around the pool! Haha. The whole team are a credit to the hotel particularly Vitamine Brad and Salim. They were always chatting to guests of all ages and so much fun. Their communication with guests of all nationalities was amazing and even at the end of a long day they were all still happy.    The spa was terrible a friend had a massage and it was the worst she has ever experienced! The door was left open so everyone passing could see in while she was half naked! The therapist didn‚Äôt do a great job and didn‚Äôt even cover my friend and tell her she was done. She was just left in the room !    All in all we loved this hotel and will definitely be returning,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicola_Marie

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tracey M wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Oasis in the desert,We have just returned after a 3 night stay. We arrived around 10am and our room was ready.Upon arrival reception was helpful & polite. They had men waiting to take our luggage to our room who were very nice. Our room was very spacious and clean we had a garden view room 2101 on the corner I can't fault the room aircon worked shower was clean and towels hanged.  The pool was clean with no bits in it when I was naughty and went down early to put towels down they had a pool man cleaning the pool. I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH HOW WELL THE GARDENS AND HOTEL IS KEPT. Every morning someone was trimmingcleaning.this place in general is just so nice. They provide a free shuttle service to old/new town which is great and collection is the time they say so make sure your ther at the meeting point other wise it's a 2 hours wait for the next collection. The slides are a plus by the pool with lots of grass area for the extra sunbeds when busy I assume. Life guards are nice as is the animation team. Collect your free pool towel pass at reception on arrival Now the only part I can fault that is not major problem-The food was average at best. Not much variety for breaklunch or dinner BUT what was served was nice. So its lacking variety not flavour. Now the 1 and only real problem that is why it got a 4 over a 5. The ALCOHOL it's so weak its unreal. Included are house winesbeer and selected cocktails & house spirit. Any cocktail you have will taste like KIDS juice theres not a hint that you are actually drinking a alcoholic drink eventually I asked for double the alcohol & even then it was hard to taste the rum. I did mention it and the bar men seem to laugh it off. Think they knew as they must of got a few comments. Would I recommend this place definitely 100%. The hotel itself is very much secluded from anywhere no shops or bars in walking distance its literally a oasis in a building area (at time of writing) what I have to stress you cant tell unless you leaving the hotel,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceymL3589SL
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jill R wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Amazing animation team! Hot weather at exceptionally cheap price!!,We arrived and got through passport control quickly. Had book a taxi transfer so when we arrived we were only guests checking in. We were given a room on arrival at approximately 10.30am    I was given a room without a view promo room. Considering how little we paid the hotel for 4 nights for 2 of us all inclusive this didn‚Äôt bother me. (Around ¬£220 for both of us) it is possible to upgrade room on arrival and had we stayed longer I probably would have. Our only concern was to discover the staff we staying in rooms next to us! As much as we loved the animation team I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs appropriate for guests and staff to be housed next to each other.    The animation are FABULOUS especially Salim. The others including Jimmy Dairi & Vitamine were also excellent. We arrived on last day of Ramadan but they were still full of energy. However the following day all staff were extra happy! The guys at the towel station were extremely friendly & life guards did an excellent job always spotting young children left unattended out of their depth in pool. If you fully engage in the entertainment there will be no escaping it but you‚Äôll have fun for sure.    Bar staff were friendlier than I expected after reading many reviews. They are under pressure on their own most of the time however I only really found long queues when afternoon snacks arrived.    Food was okay most days the worst day was Wednesday - Moroccan day! There‚Äôs a varied selection so found something most of the time. As busier times guests can be rude and don‚Äôt respect queues especially at the pizza counter where grown men barge in for pizza before you! Also during busier times guests take plates full of pudding before they‚Äôve eaten there dinner and it can be slow for them to be restocked.    If you have a late flight home you can request late checkout but they weren‚Äôt happy proving 6pm and getting 3pm was a slight battle. Reception are the least friendly staff at the hotel & could improve their customer service.    Rooms were clean and well made with big walk in shower. Air conditioning in room works well. The fridge didn‚Äôt really chill the water much.    Beware if travelling as a young female as men will pass you there phone numbers requesting you call them even at the airport as you are leaving.    Overall it was a very cheap holiday cheapest I‚Äôve ever been on for all inclusive. Weather is fabulous maybe a bit too hot at times use factor 50 sun cream.    Staff work extremely hard entertainment team are on site 14 hours a day 6 days a week & live there too.    We didn‚Äôt leave the hotel so can‚Äôt comment on old or new town experience. There‚Äôs no where to wander nearby.    I would hesitate to recommend.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O995PZjillr
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jit Joshi wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Great Hotel poor service!,We stayed here at the end of May 2019.  We wouldn't visit again as the hotel was good in terms of facilities cleanliness and activities however the service and attitude of staff really lets this hotel down. I would start by suggesting the lady who works behind reception (no name badge so no way to identify her) should work as the person taking peoples bags to there rooms and the Ahmed who takes bags to peoples rooms should work behind reception!  The service is appalling from the moment you arrive reception staff find you a chore and treat you as if you you wre staying there for free the catering staff do the minimum they have to if you have a question or query this will be brushed off and no attempt to help you. All the hotel bars only have one person serving at all times regardless of how busy it is! waiting 20 minutes for a drink in 40 degrees is no joke and then the drinks are served in really small glasses. The worse part is the excursion team who will tell you everything you want to hear to get your money but you'll have to rely on luck that the excursion goes smoothly both excursions we booked were ridden with problems our trip to see some waterfalls was overbooked and we had to wait and extra hour for them to get a bigger coach and therefore lost one hour at the place we visited the second excursion fantasia (dinner and show) was cancelled 15 minutes before we were due to be picked up (apparently the driver cannot make it!!) incredibly the good news according to the staff was we would get a refund!! which took us 2 days to get and that was after making a complaint to the hotel manager about the excursion team manager Nabile (who only apologised to us after we reported him to the hotel manager).,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jitfit

I have just got back from a 6 night stay at the hotel and was nothing but impressed. It is a hot country and admit that the inside communal areas could do with a bit more air con but they were never too hot and still a welcome escape from the hot outside. The room we had was an amazing size with a double and single bed as well as a sofa. It also had a great walk in shower. The air con in our room was lovely and as cold as I needed it.  The food was full of variety for someone who doesn't mind trying new things. Each day for breakfast I could choose from fresh omelettes crepes pancakes cooked items such as potatoes tomatoes beans a huge variety of fruit yogurt breads salad and cakes. Lunch and dinner consisted of approx 3 choices of meat and fish based tagines with a huge variety of vegetables salads bread and normally rice couscous and potatoes. For the dossier eaters there was fresh pizza and a pasta station. Drinks were plentiful. I especially liked that you could help yourself to unlimited water (although they could do with a fridge in the pool area maybe)  The pools were great and the activities team worked hard to make sure that those who wanted entertaining were. People are always going to find something to moan about but for the price I paid I was delighted.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottesI1538CB

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sharron H wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Excellent family hotel,I was a bit dubious about this hotel as it is not the sort of place I would choose to holiday in as I prefer a more traditional family run riad but I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed my stay here. We chose to stay here as we had my 12 year old grandaughter with us and we did not want her to be bored. I can vouch for the fact she was not bored the hotel pool and slides kept her busy while we were on the hotel site. The pools did close at 6pm though which I thought was a bit early but we were there in May so maybe they open longer in the summer also there was sometimes a queue at the pool bar but the staff worked tirelessly to serve everyone. We just doubled up on the drinks when we went to the bar. We also played Boules which was free and there is a volleyball site. There are 5 swimming pools one fairly noisy with activities such as volleyball zumba etc one has various slides with an adjoining pool there are two child friendly pools and a quiet adult only pool. There are pool towels available for a monetary deposit which is refunded on return of the towels. The food is good and there was always a good selection to suit all tastes. There was a barbecue at lunch time and lots of lovely salads on offer. The rooms were clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. Some people have mentioned ants and we did have a few sometimes but as I live in the countryside I did not find this a problem. We booked trips with Meeting Point who have an office in reception and they were very good although watch out for the Agafay desert safari as we were ripped off for the prices of the drinks I will write a different review about them. WiFi is not available in the rooms but is available in communal areas but this did not bother me. The hotel has a shisha area and a traditional Moroccan restaurant which you can eat at for a supplementary fee of 10 Euros. The hotel did mess up our booking twice but made up for it by letting us have a free meal there excellent customer service. The food was delicious and plentiful.The hotel also offer a laundry service and I had some clothes ironed that were returned within a few hours. There is a free shuttle bus to Marrakech that operates about 5 times a day which you can book on a day in advance. There is entertainment in the hotel throughout the day and on an evening. Tea and coffee are available in the restaurant I suggest you take your own kettle if you want drinks in your room as they are not provided. Bottled water is free and toiletries are provided. all in all I would definitely recommend this hotel for a fun family holiday.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharronh551

I bought my daughter goggles from the shop which broke within the week. When I took them back the woman had a huge row with me and basically told me all the stuff in her shop was rubbish and if I wanted good quality I should go somewhere else.  The baby pool with the little slides was filthy and not cleaned once.  I just don‚Äôt understand how and all-inclusive can get their service so wrong??

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Alisha-Jay wrote a review May 2019,30,May 2019,Arrived at this hotel on 23rd may for a 6 night stay. On arrival we were greeted by a contact who gave us wristbands. Our rooms were ready early by 12pm. The bellboy was very helpful and took our luggage to the room. Our room was by the main pool upstairs on 1st floor there are no lifts so we had to carry it upstairs. On arrival to the room we had 3 single beds and a balcony. The room size was good but the third bed had not been made up so i had to request this. Also there were only towels and toiletries for 2 people although there were 3 of us after contacting reception this was then modified.    The bathroom was ok fitted with a large walk in shower and basic sink and toilet. The hand tissue in the bathroom was empty and we had to request at reception for it to be filled several times. There is no iron at the hotel either so pack flowy clothes that need no ironing we hung ours out in the shower on the washing line to try and steam them out.    There is no wifi in the bedrooms although there is wifi in all other parts of the hotel. There are hundreds of flies everywhere.    The food was very repetitive breakfast lunch and dinner consists of roasted potatoes. Breakfast there is no form of bacon or sausages i expected turkey or beef but there was none although there were eggs in every shape and form.There is a variety of breads fruits and fresh juices. Chips are only served at lunchtimes. I was shocked to find that at dinnertime when I requested two pieces of chicken the chef informed me it was only one piece each considering this is all inclusive i didn‚Äôt expect a limit on the amount if meats i was allowed. There is a bbq some lunch and evenings which is enjoyable and a change from the repetitive food.    Kfc and mcdonalds can be ordered easily at main reception and they deliver. The alcoholic drinks taste watered down but the gentleman in the hotel lobby bar seems to work his magic to make them taste nice.    Afternoon snacks are served by the pool bar but go pretty fast. The pool bar always has a queue and one member of staff on at peak times!    Kids club for children is good although children can only access the childrens pool if they are at kids club. The slides and main pool are good there are activities though out the day at the pool including aqua Aerobics and other activities. The entertainment team are great and keep everyone entertained all-day.    All in all I wouldn‚Äôt rate this a 4 star hotel more a 3 star with the basic facilities. Great stay for kids though who just want to swim and eat pizza all-day in sunshine.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alishajaytravel
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Lisa L wrote a review May 2019,40,Week in the Sun,We have just returned from a week at this hotel. Overall I would rate it a 3* hotel with some elements of it closer to 4 and others a low 3.  On arrival we were greeted at the entrance by a staff member and bell boy relieved of our suitcases and taken to the welcome room to complete the paperwork. When we initially arrived (after booking private transfers from the UK) we realised we had standard rooms that come without a balcony or terrace. I asked for these to be changed and we were quoted 20 euros per night/room. I refused to pay this saying it was too expensive. A manager (I assumed) came forward and offered to put us all in a suite for the first night as we were family and then move us to 2 adjoining balcony rooms the following day free of charge. Obviously we accepted this offer although slightly concerned that at check-out we would receive a bill. We didn't so well done Labranda Targa for great customer service with our rooms!    The suite was lovely however we can't fault our other rooms either. They were spacious and clean and our balconies overlooked the garden to the side of the main pool. The rooms were cleaned daily and you could have your towels changed each day if required.    Towels for the pool were issued on production of a towel card and could be changed daily or kept for use the next day. I noticed one reviewer mentioned that the towels had to be returned by 5pm but that the pool remained open later. You didn't need to return them if you didn't want just change them the next morning if you wanted clean ones.    The pools are all situated close to each other apart from the adult only one which was further away from the activities and therefore noise. We didn't use this pool as we were happy to sunbathe and watch the games or just sunbathe. More unbrellas would be good as they were hard to come by when the sun got too unbearable. We did manage to have one every day though. It started to get busier towards the end of our stay as half term began and you could tell with the number of guests in the pool so I imagine it could be difficult to swim during school holidays.    There is just one pool bar with usually 2 members of staff on duty and another collecting empties from around the pool so at times you could be queuing for a drink but not longer than 5-10 minutes at most. The bar staff can be a little ignorant at times but I did manage to get a couple of smiles on occasion. A lot of reviews mention the wasps. They are actually bees and although are attracted by your drinks and can be annoying don't 'attack' you like wasps do. There are traps dotted around to try and contain this issue but not a lot else can be done about it. I didn't hear of anyone being stung and I'm petrified of anything that can stab me and I coped with them.    The animation team were brilliant! They work tirelessly every day from 9.30am - 11pm with a short break over lunch and always have a welcome smile. I don't know how they do it but they even remember names! The activities were good and when a programmed activity didn't take place it was due to guests not wanting to participate rather than a lack of effort on their part.    The food was plentiful and edible. Breakfast was the same each day but with a lot of variety to choose from. The omelettes went down really well and were made to order with ingredients of your choice. Lunch and dinner tended to have 3 or 4 different mains of meat and fish each night but with the same sides repeated daily. There was always soup on offer usually 2 varieties although again the same soup repeated each day. At lunch french fries were always on offer. They had the bbq on at both lunch and evening meal and there was a pizza/pasta bar available if the food wasn't to your liking. Again you could request a pizza of choice and have it made specially.  There were always glasses at the table but only coffee cups at breakfast. At other mealtimes your hot drinks had to be in cardboard cups.  The staff did at times struggle to keep up with demand in regards to tables ready once vacated plates and cutlery. However if they saw you go to a table they would come straight over and re-lay it for you.  Bottled water was available in fridges all the time; in the main restaurant and cosy bar you accessed this yourself in the pool bar you had to ask for it.    The evening entertainment was on the basic side but fun. They had a singer outside by the pool until the kids disco and then the main entertainment was either outside or in the theatre. Again it varied nightly through the week. There was a Morrocan themed day half way through our stay which included a small market Morrocan food at mealtimes and invited guests at the evening (snake charmer and drum band).    The hotel is laid back with no dress codes for the restaurant or evening apart from theme nights when they asked you to dress accordingly (all white one night Morrocan another and black and white another). Not everyone took part in the dress code but it wasn't a problem they just liked you to join in. Shorts were acceptable at evening meal and swimwear was acceptable at lunch.    Being laid back did have its disadvantages though - the shop didn't always adhere to advertised opening hours nor did the infirmary (nurse on duty at a small clinic on site).    My son changed money at the hotel and got a really good rate so wouldn't hesitate to recommend that. We changed some in the old town and again got quite a good rate.    The free shuttle buses were great and frequent. You do get harassed as you get off in town by 'guides' who say they are with the hotel but aren't. Just say no and they will get the message. The souks are unbelievable. We had read reviews and listened to advice but nothing prepares you for the reality. Certainly not to be missed! We went during the day and again one evening. We got there at the night early enough to be there for breaking fast. It was amazing and had quite a party atmosphere to it. We did get lost in all the alleyways and ended up in a local area. That was a daunting half hour or so trying to find our way back but certainly glad it happened albeit it accidentally. The taxi back to the hotel was 100 dirham but friends of ours knocked them down to 80. During the day we paid 50 Dirham. The taxis are only licensed for 3 people so bear that in mind if you are travelling with children.    Overall a good holiday and if visiting Marrakech again would certainly stay at this hotel.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/345lisal
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Bethany hart wrote a review May 2019,20,"Some photos are misleading, this is not great review.. but a must read",Visited morroco on a number of occasions and this trip was by far the worst as soon as we got to the hotel we had to wait over an hour to get a room once reaching the room we realised that there was no balcony whi h when booking the hotel it doesnt state that rooma do not have a balcony we went to reception to see if we could swap rooms and we got told to come back in an hour because they had customers?? We are customers ourselves. If we wanted to have a balcony we had to pay an extra 90¬£!  The food there is not a variety at all and not a lot of english food (however we dont like to try new things)  Animation team do a good job by the pool doing activities however the entertainment for the evening is very basic.  Someone from animation smashed the back of my phone and i got told by the english rep there is nothing they can do. Fuming.  On one of the days we got asked to move our sun beds by one of the animation team when we were in the same spot the day before and nobody said anything to us. We were not in the way but were demanded to move for no reason we asked to speak to the boss who apparently asked staff to move us but he wouldnt come over.  There is two bars for all inclusive however only 1 person is working on it so your standing waiting for around 20/30 minutes to get any drink. Alcohol soft drink or even a bottle of water.  Every evening at 11:30/12pm they turn ALL the hotel ground lights off with no care for guests sat outside having a drink. Its not customer friendly at all.  I would definitely not come back to this hotel. The only plus side is the heat.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bethanyhart
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Alun J wrote a review May 2019,30,3 star not 4,Came for 3 nights 4 days to this hotel for a quick getaway. Never been to marakesh or morrocco before so did not know what to expect. The trip from the airport is another story just be aware the taxi drivers are all over you when you get out of the airport lounge. Best to get a transfer to be safe and easy. Got to the hotel about 8 45 PM foor stopped being served at 9 30 PM so had to throw bags in room and go straight for something to eat. Food was fine but not much left at this late time. Good mix of food something for everyone. Its get your own food and drink no waiter service. Hotel is clean but in my opinion not a 4 star. Nice gardens and pools which are salt water which can be cold even when it was 38 degrees. Not much to see outside the hotel so dont go for a walk in day or night. Hotel does a bus to the new and old town which is okay but traffic is something to see for yourself it's madness. Had a few problems in the food hall no spoons most of the day at all meal times which is very odd had to ask for some each time. We only paid ¬£350 including flights all inclusive so not to bad for may. Worth the money but would not go for longer than 3 or 4 days to be honest. Dont know if I would go back to that part of morrocco again as had a few problems with the local people they are all out to take money off you.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Northwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/257alunj

Not a great choice of food at the lunch / dinner buffet was eating mostly the same food every night. The entertainment was good for families with kids but we came as a couple and found it very boring each evening not a lot to do we were going to bed early each night which is really not like me! Would recommend but more for families with children rather than couples. On the downside me and my husband did have bad tummies throughout the entire holiday even though we definitely did not drink any tap water.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasminevince
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Adrianna M wrote a review May 2019,40,Really enjoyable stay,"We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and I must say we have enjoyed the stay a lot.    The food was great the animation team worked really hard to keep everyone entertained. The rooms were good but nothing special although I don't really pay attention to them as I'm never in the room apart form sleeping :) It was very useful to have the shuttle bus to get the the Old/New town however they don't tell you that it need to be booked 24h in advance.    Negatives I would say would be not enough umbrellas by the pool as not everyone enjoys constantly sitting in the direct sun the fact you are supposed to give back the swimming pool towels back by 5 PM although you can use the pool by 6 PM and when I tried to exchange some money at the reception desk they told me its closed and they ""maybe"" will be open later on. Last thing was the mattresses in the room was very hard and it made sleeping a little bit uncomfortable but not unbearable.    Over all had a very enjoyable stay and would happily go back.  Please bear in mind if you go during Ramandan that you will hear prayers after sunset and before sunrise so they can wake you up.

Hotel was clean pools where clean and rooms spacious. Aqua park was great for kids and adults.  Lots of entertainment for children my daughter loved it.  The spa is also lovely and reasonably priced.  Food is basic (as any all inclusive is) however plenty of selection and you can always grab a pizza if your not feeling the main menu.  The staff were welcoming and always happy to help.  I wouldn‚Äôt rate this hotel as a 4 star however it was lovely get away for a week in Marrakesh.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Claire G wrote a review May 2019,40,Beautiful hotel,I rarely write reviews but after visiting this hotel I felt compelled to.  Just retired from an amazing 4 day break.  Airport was well organised on  Arrival but you have to fill forms with details like name passport number and reason for travel etc ...takes a few mins so not really an issue.  The drive to the hotel is a bit of an eye opener...as you drive through what looks a building site along a dirt track what feels like in the middle of nowhere ...and you think to yourself ...what‚Äôs going on here.... but don‚Äôt panic as once you get to the hotel there is no looking back.  The hotel is clean and tidy set in beautiful grounds. The staff were swift at booking us in...and we were taken to our room by a helpful porter ...and surprised at how spacious our room was.  Fridge with cold water on arrival plenty of wardrobe space and mirrors plus hairdryer.  Shower was big enough for 4 people üòùplenty of hot water and fresh towels daily.  Bed was a bit on the hard side but I like that so found it really comfy with a nice duvet..which was perfect for me as I feel the temp drop at night even in Morroco!  Food was amazing...seriously good grub!!  I‚Äôm a vegetarian and I was able to try delicious tagines cous cous rice dishes roasted veg morrocan baked beans ...there was salads galore and fresh breads. Breakfast and lunch were better than the evening buffet but there was always plenty of yummy food about and you were never hungry.  The lunch time bbq and being able to sit outside to eat was a real plus for us ...and the pizza corner was good after a few cocktails :) if you didn‚Äôt want too much in the evening.  Drinks were ok wine was bottled and surprisingly good for All inclusive as were the cocktails.  Beer wasn‚Äôt great as not cold enough but you can‚Äôt have it all. Fridges located in the restaurant with bottles of water so you were well hydrated!  Pools were clean and water was a nice refreshing temp.  Main pool With entertainment was lively with a great animation team who did lots of fitness related activities!!  Water slides perfect for kids not that busy and well organised and quiet adult only pool was ample if you wanted to chill completely!  Never got to use the SPA so can‚Äôt comment.  Gym was poor ...that was only negative really 3 exercise bikes and one had a broken saddle so shouldn‚Äôt really be in use.  Cross trainer was broken and 2 ok ish treadmills - no weights...but ok to have a little burn off if you are only there for a few days like me.    All and all I would definitely recommend this hotel super value for money gorgeous climate and food. I would without a doubt return!!!,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z4486RRclaireg

Total let down...,To start....    1) Paid for garden room view room with terrace and told only room available was facing a brick wall at back of hotel...    2) friend was served raw chicken !! Whem staff were shown they quickly threw it away and then said 'you wont get sick it's just normal chicken'    3) lady fell over in restaurant on spilt drink. Staff made aware and failed to clean... two more people then fell and went down quite badly.    4) poor vegetarian choices and all food contaminated with meat dont stay If intolerances or allergies....    5) entertainment staff good for children... and also for harassment of adults who just want to chill... although if your aim is to come abroad and pull one - I'm sure they'll be up for it...    6) the spa had mould on the ceilings and after a half hour massage staff left me in the dark room to chill for the remainder! Given that they exfoliate the (WHOLE) body and then rub the sponge on our faces I am not guaranteed they are trained and totally unhygienic!    7) staff at no point tried to rectify any of the issues. They simply didn't care.    Please dont waste your money here. I wont even go into the *entertainment* show when staff hit each other with pool noodles whilst chasing each other around a darkened lecture theatre with a fake gun.... hmmm...,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Henfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmagK3834IC

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jolie B wrote a review May 2019,20,This is not a 4* hotel,The hotel lobby and reception area are probably the nicest places in the whole hotel. This is definitely not a 4* hotel.    ROOM  My room (1101) was right above the kitchen so the smells would come into the room. also when i was out on the balcony the heat from all the extractor fans was unbearable. The room itself was dark and dull. the beds are relatively small and the tv was small too. the floor felt grimey when walking around bare foot. we spotted a number of ants each day. one day i left a cup with a small amount of fizz in it and came back a couple hours later and it was full of ants.    HOTEL  The floors in the corridors are uneven.and you can see the dents through the carpets. The lifts were also very temperamental. You can only buy currency from the reception with cash. you cannot use your card to by currency. The shuttle buss need to be booked in advance. the wifi does not work in some parts of the hotel.    POOL  Getting a sunbed was fine although there were a few people stealing umbrellas. The pool area itself could do with a good clean. for a 4* hotel i would expect a clean pool area but the edges of the pool were grimey and discolored. the water slides are ok for the kids but once you have done them they get pretty boring.    ENTERTAINMENT  The entertainment team are very friendly. they provide some good fun activities round the pool throughout the day but the night time entertainment is really not that great. the hotel has a 'theatre' room where they put on a show a couple of times a week but there is no bar in this room and it is layed out like a lecture hall. there are no tables. just rows of chairs.    FOOD  The food option is tagine tagine and tagine. there is a salad bar bread station and fruit normaly but there really isnt a lot to choose from. i was abit sceptical about some of the foods as well due to the amount of flies around the food. for a 4* hotel i would of expected a lot more.    ALL INCLUSIVE  All inclusive includes breakfast from 7.30-10.30. lunch from 12.30-14.30 and dinner from 19.30-22.00. any food that is not used up through the lunch time are put out by the pool bar but i never ate this as there were flies all over the food. The bar shuts at 23.00 so there is no drinks service after this time. unless you use the sports bar where you have to pay for your drinks. the pool bar only had one person working so there was always a que to get a drink. the beer and bottled water were not cold.    All in all i was really disappointing with the hotel. i would not rate this hotel a 4* in a million years.If you are looking for something cheap and cheerful then this hotel is just that. as long as you are not fussy about your food etc.. you will be fine. if you are looking for an actual 4* hotel this is not for you.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JolieWoe
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Charlottegshortland wrote a review May 2019,30,Lovely hotel adverage staff and food,We have just returned from our trip to Marrakesh and we stayed at this hotel for a week when we arrived it was in the morning we thought we would have to wait for our room as it wasn't check in yet they said it would be an hour we left it like 30 mins and went back and our room was ready which was great it was 42 degrees when we arrived it was so hot but so nice weather. The pools and hotel grounds are kept lovely.The room we arrived our fridge in the room didn't work. That didn't really bother us but we had a lot of ants in the room around the bathroom and in the bedroom one evening we came in and there was some ants in the bed. The food was the same everyday pretty much breakfast lunch and dinner it was nice food but the same everyday the salad is really nice and fresh. The staff at reception I wouldn't say they are rude but they don't have a smile with service but then its the middle of Ramadan so I don't know if that I down to that. The entertainment staff they do them same songs dances games day in and day out they only choose who they want to speak to mostly girls can tell they are there for the girls and money only it was bad customer service compared to other hotels I have stated in. The pool bar which is open pretty much all day until 5pm they are under staffed and there is normally a big queue to get a drink which was quite annoying. They need more staff around the area. The best information we received you can get KFC McDonalds pizza hut and dominos delivered to the hotel. we did this and it was really good you order through the reception also the shisha bar which is meant to be open until 1am wasn't open once while we was there so everything shuts down at 11pm and then its pretty much lights out. Also they have a Moroccan restruant which also wasn't open once while we was there. But on the upside its a good hotel for the money we spent on it we had a nice time because the weather is so nice you can also get a free bus from the hotel to the new and old town which is good as this saves you money on the trips and they was very good with their timings.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlottegshortland

There is 1 song ""Summertime"" played on loop throughout reception and in the buffet restaurant all day every day. The song itself is fine and creates a nice ambience but I feel very irritated hearing it constantly. Please add more variety of music!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ryan L wrote a review May 2019,40,7 day holiday,We visited this hotel in the m very hard to keep up with demand.  iddle of May as a couple when we arrived we were greeted by reception who were very friendly and our bags were taken by a porter to our room. We had to pay a ¬£20 resort tax for the 7 days which is just under ¬£3 a day.  Our room was clean very nice ground floor and just outside the adult pool so away from the main pool area where it can get quite noisy depending on the crowd.  The food was varied on a daily basis and had lots there to suit many tastes not being a vegan or someone with food allergies I can't comment on how some would feel about the foods. My wife is quite fussy with eating but still managed to find something to eat at each meal. I've seen some reviews to say about the pizza counter always having plenty there but most of the time there was people waiting for the chef to cook more but in all fairness the 1 chef was working.  We spent most of our time at the main pool which was clean usually always some sunbeds available and if your lucky you might get a parasol but you have to be up early for that privilege. The staff at the pool bar seemed very miserable and not seeming to want to make any effort there was usually a very long queue at the pool bar and 2 bar staff but for some reason only 1 serving while the other just sat there talking to them which was very frustrating to those in the long queue. Their biggest issue seemed to be a lack of glasses to seve drinks in and they had someone going around collecting empties from around the pool area so when you went up to the bar without glasses because they'd been taken away by the staff they sometimes said you couldn't have drinks unless you bring your glasses back. We usually had a drink then waited a while but for those who went straight up this wasnt an issue.  The hotel has 4 water slides which are fun they aren't always on but never seem to be too busy. Bit of a novelty in a hotel really but still good.  The animation team were brilliant always wanting to interact with people around the pool to get them to join in with the games and activities they had going on throughout the day as this was a total relaxation holiday we didn't really take part in much of these but they were very good. On our last night the animation team did a cabaret show and it was very good and funny too. The entertainment other nights was a guy on a keyboard and and female vocalist who were very good but only for a short time. They had other things going on like a quiz and karaoke etc and they always tried their best to keep guests entertained.  Overall the hotel is beautiful and clean staff could be a little more helpful with new guests but not a big issue. There are a few reviews saying about things not working in the rooms but it sounds like we got lucky as everything worked in ours but met a few people at the hotel who had to report aircon issues and TVs and hair dryers not working. The shuttle service into the city is pretty good but again they don't tell you anything about where the pick up is etc.  For the price you pay for the stay at the hotel you dont expect 5 star luxury but it's like a little bit of paradise at good value. I'd recommend this hotel but remember you get what you pay for so dont be expecting a 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanl433

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,mickeybluejeans wrote a review May 2019,30,"A rough hotel with wasps, free drinks & queues",I‚Äôm not sat in the airport having just left this hotel I will not be returning. We stayed all inclusive and truly believe they set everything up to limit how much you eat or drink by creating queues you will queue at mealtimes and every time you want a drink.    The bar staff are so rushed any quality control goes out of the window and so does any service the soft drinks are so fizzy that if you let them settle you only have half a glass and if you ask for a top up the barman looks at you like you have asked him to lick your boots.    The services is truly terrible.    In the room The air conditioning is just slightly cooler than outside and cannot be adjusted lower the fridge I think is just a light that comes on when you open the door it does not cool anything you put inside.    The only good thing Is the powerful shower and they only charge ¬£30 for a late check out until 6pm.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Aya wrote a review May 2019,40,Nice hotel and lovely atmosphere,This was our first trip to Morocco as a family with a young child (age 5). The hotel is perfectly suited to families as they have all the facilities: kids club water slides baby pool swimming aids pool entertainment evening entertainment for kids.    Food wise there is one restaurant where breakfast lunch and dinner is served all in a buffet style. There are different cuisines but mainly Moroccan tagines there is also a pasta/pizza corner. The food becomes a bit repetitive if you are all inclusive as we were as it doesn‚Äôt change much.    There is a spa/hammam for adults. We left our daughter in the kids club for 1 hour and went to the hammam which is cheaper to purchase at the front desk in the hotel than with the spa directly oddly. It was a lovely massage and scrub I would highly recommend this.    The hotel bar is your average rowdy evening crowd. There‚Äôs also an outside lounge area where you can smoke sheesha. The sheesha was not great however if you haven‚Äôt tried it I would recommend it.    Overall a nice resort clean and friendly staff.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aya-sof
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Loulewis4 wrote a review May 2019,40,Lovely resort,We are currently staying here and have been since Friday we have already agreed that we would like to return and I have checked the prices for August. Initially I was a little cautious at some of the comments; however on arrival we were treated to our room available and ready a little warm and the safe not working but the a/c doesn‚Äôt come on until 17:00 hrs. Even after not a lot was happening so reception sent an engineer immediately who fixed the issue - could be cooler as it is quite warm for sleeping. We are still waiting on the safe so will remind them later.  The food is absolutely delicious- you shouldn‚Äôt go hungry last night was a little limited in selection which is kept quite small - but fresh and delicious- I am eating fruit and salads which I bet have not traveled 10 miles to get to me. Water is available at every turn we bought reusable bottles but it is just help yourself and by the way we had 2 large bottles in the room fridge on arrival.  The main pools are a little rowdy for us but great for the entertainment and children. The quieter Adults pool is smaller and whilst several brollies are available we are camped out under the olive trees that offer great shade.  The hotels clientele are mainly European and it is lovely to hear a plethora of languages and accents- I forget how universal a smith and laughter is.  Our only main small gripe is that the a/c could be cooler which would aid sleep.  Ooops nearly forgot - there is a basic gym; treadmill cross trainer bikes and plenty of room for exercise. Again a little warm so my recommendation would be get up and in there before breakfast and the heat of the day.  Will further update once our trip is over,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Providenciales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loulewis4

Our room was on the first floor a twin double room which was very nice and clean. It had a fridge that worked well as did the air con  we had a walk in shower which was massive. We were very happy. The food was good with plenty of variety.The rooms were kept clean every day. The pool area was clean and there were five pools to choose from. The animation team and the shows were great a special shout out to Mimi and Salim two special people who no matter where we were would always acknowledge us by name which made us feel special.

We were badly riped off by their resident excursion reps. 'Meeting Point'. You are better off booking via another provider. We paid ¬£230 for a tour I later asked the lady later at reception what time the tour left the following morning and she gave me a time which is 15 mintes too late! The next morning we missed the trip as a result. The 'MeetingPoint' manager said its my word against hers and that he had told me 7am.  He said to wait for that receptionist to turn up for work which was that morning and i waited half the day and still she wasnt at work. They made so many promises such as substitute the tour or refund me. None of those were kept.  awful customer service.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,DerbyVic wrote a review May 2019,40,Nice hotel for a warm Easter break,We stayed at this hotel as a family of 2 adults and 4 children for 9 days and had a generally enjoyable time. Most of the staff we encountered were friendly we were met with a very reasonable welcome at 3am when we arrived somewhat later than anticipated! Bar staff sometimes got a bit grumpy over glasses at the pool bar as they seemed to be in short supply!  Meal times tended to be quite busy with a shortage of cutlery glasses and clean tables at peak times however there was generally a good choice of food. The egg/omelette chef was speedy and efficient at breakfast combating queues quickly and providing tasty food. Lunch always seemed to have an excellent choice with plenty of salads bread taglines and a bbq. The evening meal often had a carved joint of meat amongst other things but didn't seem to be quite as good a choice as lunch. Chips were only served at lunch which is quite enough as kids would eat them for every meal if they were served. Pizza and pasta is available at lunch and in the evening for the fussier eaters along with a choice of desserts.  The main pool area was clean and sunbeds plenty with a choice of pools to sit around. The waterslides weren't too busy and provide some entertainment for those using and watching. There was the usual mini discos for kids and a singer in the bar as well as karaoke. The bar didn't seem overly busy in the evening which meant getting a drink easier!  The rooms were cleaned to a good standard and towels and bedding changed frequently. Public areas including the toilets were cleaned frequently. Any problems we had were dealt with swiftly.  The hotel has everything you need but if you're looking to walk anywhere else this isn't really possible. A free bus is available into Marrakech and there are plenty of trips and activities that can be booked in the reception area. I would recommend visiting the atlas mountains particularly Ouzoud waterfalls. Whilst this is a long journey the waterfalls are pretty spectacular and have restaurants overlooking them with great views and the wild monkeys are amusing with their antics.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerbyVic

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Zaeir wrote a review May 2019,10,Labranda Targa Aqua club,The hotel was very bad  AC was not working in day or night and never worked during entire stay duration with hot weather in morroco it's essential. Reception stated AC is not working on all of resort. The Safe in the rooms were broken and promises were broken three times for it to be fixed by reception and managers sitting behind a computer at reception. No towels in room on first day . Check in was as if they were rushing us through the doors and into rooms without any information on stay or towel cards for the pools etc. Reception just did not know the meaning of customer service. Waiters in food hall might as well had not been there as they did nothing at all except clear plates off tables. High chair for babies were 6 in entire food hall on a resort!! Quality of food was terrible and variety was non existent. Most nights I had to order in for my family. It felt as if Food was being rationed at the resort as everything would run out one hour after opening of food hall for breakfast snack time and lunch and dinner. Worst experience from resort I have seen .    WiFi is only in lobby and not in rooms.    We took a spa package for two inside the hotel .well let's say I stood most of my spa time at the spa reception because no one was around. When someone finally came round they were confused as to when my booking was same with 4 other guests standing at spa reception . Spa massage might as well have been giving by my two year old and the professionalism was not there. Masseuse kept leaving massage room to sort issues out and coming back in . Jeccuzi was a health hazards as was the room jecuzzi was situated in with mould on ceiling and walls . Jecuzzi itself was oily from previous person or persons using it.    Only plus points for those who still wish to go to this resort is that it has a shuttle which takes you to the new city for shopping and a shuttle to take you to the markets souks .both destination have a shuttle back which you have to book before you leave for destination with driver . Both destinations were 10/15 minute drive from hotel .    Second plus point is that it has many pools for all ages and can spend the day by poolside with plenty of sunbeds.    Hope this helps with your decisions .,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z-hasSeen

The guy just ignored us and dealt with about 5 other people whilst checking us in. Didn‚Äôt tell us anything about the hotel. Gave us a room which wasn‚Äôt ready so we‚Äôve got a room with a rubbish view when we paid for garden view.    Went to get some food the chef was cooking chicken. I ate half of it before I realised it was raw. Tried to tell the staff but no one really cared. In fact they laughed and said something along the lines of having a strong stomach I‚Äôll be fine..    Went to grab a towel but was told I need a card from reception. (Why wasn‚Äôt that given to me on check in?) so walked all the way back to reception then back to the towel place.    Went to grab a drink. Wasps everywhere and in abundance! There must have been at least 100 wasps at the bar. Got a drink none the less.. wasps galore. They got to my drink before me so I didn‚Äôt bother with it. Left it and moved to the other side of the pool. I‚Äôm at one with the wasps now.. sort of.    No WiFi in the room.    See photos of wasps and raw chicken!    On a lighter note they have been playing a Christmas album throughout the hotel all day.    If any manager would like to speak to me I‚Äôm here until 08/05/19 but I highly doubt it as no one has really cared so far..

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Beth9332 wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Very average hotel,Check in was very smooth at this resort and we were welcomed to the rest by a happy lady our room was even ready for us at 11am!  The rooms were clean and basic but we don‚Äôt go on holiday to stop in our room so this was fine. The air condition was very poor and didn‚Äôt make any different to the temperature of the room and the water wasn‚Äôt hot for having a shower at peak times.  Mealtimes were interesting! Luckily we are not picky eaters as there wasn‚Äôt really that greater choice and the food quality wasn‚Äôt really there! Also the food wasn‚Äôt replenished in time so there was often large queues of people waiting.  The restaurant was absolute chaos if I‚Äôm honest at times they ran out of plates the staff were not there to offer you a drink but to  Clean up after you‚Äôve gone which was fine by us but wouldn‚Äôt suit a lot of people.  The tables weren‚Äôt reset straight away so you could be a while walking around looking for a seat. This was the most stressful part of the day and it doesn‚Äôt help that children are going around the restaurant on hover boards!!    At the resort there is one pool bar this couldn‚Äôt keep up with the demand of people at this hotel. Often there would be 10-15 people in front of you waiting to be served. At the most there was two bar staff on but often one. What did alarm me was watching the staff clean the plastic cups that had been used they were simply rinsed out with water from the top left on a draining board and they would be used from there for your drink!  I also believe the pool bar opened too late it says 10am on the information about the resort but it didn‚Äôt open till 10.30am but when you‚Äôve been for breakfast at 7am it‚Äôs a while between drinks. It also closes at 5 but when many people stay around the pool till 7pm you find yourself traipsing inside with your swimwear while other people are dressed and ready for the evening.  We opted to stay around the adults only pool during the day which was lovely and peaceful! The main pools were so loud with different activities and music (with not age appropriate lyrics) but this is what many people like :)  All in all not a bad hotel but could certainly improve!,Date of stay: April 2019,,"Scunthorpe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beth9332
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tt wrote a review Apr 2019,40,We didn‚Äôt want to leave!,Firstly! I want to say that the animation team make this hotel amazing! Other staff members are hostile however the animation staff keep everyone active throughout the day 9am-11pm. Even if you don‚Äôt want to join in they are still friendly. Jimmy goes above and beyond for every holidaymaker he sits and talks and even remembers each individual family. He is such an asset to Labranda and deserves more recognition!    The location of the hotel is far out from most things however transport is so accessible to the airport new town and old town.    Our room was huge a double bed and 2 day beds with a dining area and kitchenette. The main issue with the room was the smell in the bathroom and the drainage issues with the shower. The water just fills the shower.    There is no wifi in the rooms only in the public areas of the hotel.    I‚Äôm usually a fussy eater but I found the food to be more than good. It was the best all inclusive food I‚Äôve had in a while.  There is so much variety for everyone however I was disspointed with the pizza corner. There was so much cross contamination and no labels for ingredients.    Omelettes were the best things for breakfast made to order but again they use the same utensils and bowls for pork fish and veg.    The drinks are not so good but I did enjoy the san francisco cocktail. Very sweet but it made do. Always a long queue at the pool bar.    Even though the hotel was super busy there were always enough sunbeds and we had our same spot every day!    Onto the night time entertainment the pool closes at 6 and dinner starts at 7. Entertainment doesn‚Äôt start til 9 and finishes at 11 sharp. All inclusive is completely stopped at this time and there isn‚Äôt a lot to do as the hotel is so deserted.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Megan wrote a review Apr 2019,40,FAB apart from a few issues!,I stayed at this hotel from 22nd - 29th April we booked 3 double rooms in total 2/3 rooms were spot on! When I arrived into my room the beds were twin - I didn‚Äôt mind this however the beds weren‚Äôt put together properly please see in the attached imagine. It was an easy problem to fix as a relaxed person this weren‚Äôt an issue however there was a half full bottle of water on the desk we didn‚Äôt have a fridge the safe was not secure which made me laugh actually what‚Äôs the point in typing a code in when you can just pick the safe up and run away with it anywayüòÇ. We had a dirty towel in bathroom with shower gel spilled on basin. My air conditioning also didn‚Äôt work and there was a constant loud noise from the vents from restaurant. So I decided to take some pictures and tell the reception. The lady was so helpful and instantly got cleaners up there. When I went back up to check we still didn‚Äôt have a fridge and the safe weren‚Äôt secure so I told her again. Besides this the room was gorgeous! She told me they would move us in the morning though this did not happen.    The food was gorgeous. There was so much to choose from plenty of salad meat & plenty vegetarian options the only issue was I regularly found myself queuing for the food.    The variety of entertainment was awesome and if the pool area was too loud there was a quiet pool. The animation staff were amazing! Plenty of them too. I loved the free shuttles to the old and new town!    The only other issue was when we were checking out they said there was an outstanding bill from the spa treatment we had even though we paid it. As it was 6am we were being picked up it was a bit annoying however the staff again were helpful and asked us to fill a form out and then we went on our journey to the airport!    Overall it is a very good hotel and the weather made it even better! My advice to anyone is to not book trips with the hotel. The hotel wanted to charge around ¬£50 for the waterfall trip. I got it for ¬£20 in the old town!,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meegruss
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Melanie L wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Second visit,My husband and I went to Marrakech 2 years ago and stayed at the same Hotel. We had a fantastic time and decided to bring our grown up children back with my son's girlfriend this year. There has been quite a lot of changes since our last visit for example the moroccan restaurant had closed due to lack of use so the receptionist told us. What a shame because the atmosphere was lovely and so was the food. This time the variety of food was good at each sitting (the pizza chef could do with extra help as so many people were complaining about the wait for the pizzas). Our 3 rooms were clean (our bathroom ceiling was repainted during our stay!!) with fresh towels every day. Tip here: room 3008 is next to the kids club (Maxi club) which we did not hear a peep from until our last night when we had to go to bed early as we had a 6 am pick up for the airport. At 9.30 pm there was suddenly loud music and shouting coming from next door to us. My husband knocked on the kids club door and asked them to kindly turn the sound down please as we had an early start. The lady who answered the door said very sharply it was the kids movie night. She turned it down for 5 minutes then put it back up again. This went on till 11 pm (surely movie night could be scheduled earlier in the evening). The other change was the free shuttle bus. Last time we had no problem getting on the buses we wanted but this time it was a nightmare. Most of the currency we changed at the airport which was for souvenirs was spent on taxi fares to get out and about as most attractions are not within walking distance from the Hotel. The taxi fares are far more expensive here than when we went to Agadir last year. It was the first time in Morocco for my daughter son and his girlfriend and they all said they would definitely go back to Marrakech. My husband and I will definitely be back but probably will stay in a more expensive hotel closer to the Medina so we can walk to the attractions and not pay for extortionate taxi fares.

We are a family of 6 and booked twin rooms but were not placed in adjoining rooms which was at first a problem as the rooms we were given were on different floors which would have meant my husband was in one room and myself in another due to the ages of our children.    We did speak with management and were given adjoining rooms on the 3rd day of our holiday which made the rest of the week much easier.    The animation team are great and keep everyone entertained but there's no pressure to join in if you dont want to.    The grounds of the hotel are lovely and the hotel feels spacious.    I celebrated my birthday whilst there and staff brought a lovely cake and sang to me in the restaurant.

Straight off to lunch and then an afternoon poolside. As is the norm with my reviews I will say as I find starting with any negatives.  Signage to find the dining room and also identifying the various dishes was lacking and on some the food could have been hotter. The outside area had a bbq every lunchtime but this was slow and people continually took too much - filling their plates we never once got any food from the bbq.    As we had 2 days rain the bus to the market was fully booked and we had to book a taxi. We arrived at 1.30pm for the taxi only to be told it would be 20 minutes late. When it arrived we found we were sharing with another couple who had booked for 2pm - double bubble .  The indoor bar was very dark and the seating layout was not really suitable.  Much of the accommodation exterior walls had flaking paint and needed a tidy up.  Postives - The room was large - ample storage a nice balcony walk in shower and good air con. The room was cleaned well daily with fresh towels available on request.  Generally the food was good always a choice with lovely bread. Beer wine and fizzy drinks available with meals.  The pool was cold but not as cold as other pools we have visited in Marrakech. The animation team are beyond superb - every one of them. They work tirelessly to make your holiday enjoyable. Non stop activities 3 daily water based aerobic classes. step class water polo football darts  volleyball twice a day petanque and many silly games.  On my penultimate day I slipped on a wet floor cutting my head - I was happy just to rest up but the hotel insisted on a visit to the infirmary where the nurse cleaned the wound then suddenly a doctor arrived to stitch a small wound service above and beyond.  From arriving with reservations this turned into a superb holiday and we WILL be back soon.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,tonbridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonbridgeStevef
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,dcasitis wrote a review Apr 2019,30,I would have given 5 stars however.,Just returned home from a 3 night stay at labranda. I wouldn't call it a 4 star hotel more of a glorified 3 star!  To begin we arrived around midday just after 11 and were told that no rooms were available until 12:30 so we had nowhere to change and had to sit around the noisy bar with nonchalant staff members and drinking cocktails from a machine. Sitting in this area after a very long flight with nowhere to rest or relax in peace and quiet wasnt my first idea of how we wanted to spend our short break. At 12:30 we were then told our room wouldn't be ready until 13:30 (as we had a special request) we booked a terrace room which cost more therefore you have to wait longer apparently.  Once we were finally able to get into our room we were welcomed with no towels in the room no tea or coffee facilities and our aircon was not working very well. So it really wasnt the best start.  However we didn't want to let that affect our judgement and we wanted to just relax and enjoy our break. On the second day we decided to try and book a couples spa treatment at the onsite spa attempted to book it through the onsite agency who then proceeded to try and charge me ‚Ç¨7200 rather than the ‚Ç¨75 I was told. When I questioned the amount I was then given a very hostile response from the lady and we proceeded to argue about the amount. She then stormed off as I was not having any of it her attitude was disgraceful. Admittedly she did apologise to me the day after which was somewhat of a better gesture however it put us off using the onsite agency.  There is no wifi in the rooms which I would prefer rather than having it in the public spaces but I also understand the cost of doing so and cannot always be feasible.  The bar area at night was often very loud with children running around and screaming at all hours of the night after being jacked up on fizzy drinks and loud music until 11pm.  The best part for us was the adults only pool which was a blessing. Very quiet and peaceful!  On reflection I dont know if I would return maybe if i had children i could see how hard the animation team worked and to give them their dues they were so friendly and energetic probably the saving grace of this hotel.  I would advise the hotel to speak to its staff members and ensure that most of them are at least friendly or courteous towards the paying guests and to also make sure that the rooms are ready for arriving guests.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Whiteley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dcasitis

If you are pleasant they respond accordingly.The rooms are clean spacious and comfortable. The food is varied and fresh.As for the comment that the hotel is not environmentally friendly that same person was complaining that the pool should be heated because it was too cold for the children. The water is lovely a bit of cold water never hurt anyone. The animation team does not stop and are an excellent bunch of people. Some people are not happy unless they are miserable.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Amelia V wrote a review Apr 2019,40,"Fantastic Animation, Get what you pay for","By all means this hotel is not the Ritz however in Morocco for a family hotel this ticks all the boxes.  The Reception is welcoming and we had pool View rooms which were not noisy at all. They were cleaned every day and had fresh towels no issues here. Lucky for us the weather was glorious and this meant the pools were nice and warm with a great atmosphere.  Food is adequate lots of variety however can be a bit similar and repetitive. nothing bad and there was always pizza and pasta if there wasn't something to your taste.  Alcoholic drinks are fine its an average all inclusive so don't expect amazing drinks but they were enjoyable and nothing to complain about at all. The red wine was actually really nice.  The real highlight of this hotel is the Animation team. I have stayed in more expensive hotels previously and never seen such high quality of day time entertainment. They really make an effort to talk to you and get you involved in all the activities which happen all the time. Occasionally they get everyone up for a dance which is great fun even for adults. Salim and Chico really made this holiday great and talked to us a lot throughout the week. I understand its their job but they really make you feel special!    This hotel has one extremely bad down side the Booking agency in the reception ""meeting point"". I don't want this to take away from the hotel itself being a great place however do not book with these people. They blatantly lied to us and said it was a 30min coach journey each way which turned out to be 4 hours each way to our exclusion!! when questioned we were shouted at despite other travellers being told the same thing.    Travelling to Marrakech again I would return here as there really was nothing major to complain about.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,RJR wrote a review Apr 2019,10,The worst hotel experience!,This has got to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in! We arrived at the hotel just after midday and were told to go for lunch as our room wasn‚Äôt ready. Once we got to our room we realised there were only two towels. Being a family of four this was obviously not enough so we called the reception to ask for more towels. This only took another two hours to arrive so we had to make do with hand towels in the mean time.  Moving some of the furniture around in the room we discovered lots of dust dirt and dead ants! Clearly they don‚Äôt clean the room thoroughly! The next day we started finding ants in the room. After contacting reception they came to spray a deterrent. Around 1am the same night hundreds of ants were coming out from behind the headboard and making their way around the room and on to my bed. Especially with a 6 and 2 year old this is just not acceptable so I called reception. Their on duty manager was less than pleased to have to deal with this and told me they had no rooms available (which I don‚Äôt believe at all) and there was nothing he could do till the next day). They sprayed the room again and just expected my family to sleep amongst the live and dead ants!! After speaking to reception the next day they finally moved us to another room just above where we were. To our disgust this happened again we were again sharing a room with ants. More spraying and fumigating later the ants were still making their way to our room. On our 5th day in to the holiday we were finally moved to an ant free room...hooray! We were compensated with a 30 minute Hammam simple (just sitting in a warm room)!  The food in the restaurant was boring and extremely repetitive and lacking in choice for vegetarians and children. They had no concept of vegetarianism everything was contaminated with meat. Literally staying here if you have a serious allergy could be dangerous! Due to poor hygiene measures we have ended up with upset tummies!  The majority of staff with the exception of Sana Najad and one other smiley lady in reception were rude and miserable and made me feel uncomfortable if I had any questions or queries!  Overall the hotel was pretty and has potential to be better. The poolside entertainment team were excellent and the other activities such as tennis and badminton the slides and all the pools although cold were great!  If I wasn‚Äôt there with a group of friends I would have definitely moved hotels! Would I recommend this hotel to friends...NO! Would not class this as a 4 star hotel more like 3 star.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happyholswithkids
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Raj wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Most awful hotel. Avoid,We were there last week with my 2 yr and 5yr old. I would not call it a 4 star. More like 2 star. On check in day we got our room at 5pm (5hrs after the time we were told) and no apology. Got the room as was from previous occupant so had to ask reception 2ce for them to come and clean the room. Room had only 2 towels and we were a family of 4. Had to beg for the towels which arrived 2 hrs later! When we moved the beds together for our kids found remnants of food from previous occupancy. So cleanliness is very low there.  Food is very repetitive and aweful for vegetarians as it is all contaminated. Even the pizza when specifically asked for a veggie pizza had meat in it. The chef then proceeded to pick out the meat and gave it to us! Same with other food in the buffet. Chefs and staff are very rude and do not understand english. Ended up with a tummy upset due to poor food hygiene.  Pool areas are ok and the entertainment staff were good. The only saving grace for this place. However the lady running the mini club was very rude. Took my 2 yr to play in the sand and was told to go away as only above 5yr allowed. She proceeded to take the spade and bucket away from him. Kids dont understand that. He was causing no harm and I didnt understand that rule seeing that I was right there looking after him. On another occasion took my 5yr old there as her friends were there and we were turned away as you have to register by 3pm even though there was space there. We were late by 10 mins. Do not understand registration timings rule either. I would have understood if the club was full but not when there was space there.  Overall avoid this place as kitchen staff have no concept of hygiene and safety. Found all staff rude unhelpful and never smiling.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wonderlustmama

Yes it would be quicker to go to reception yourself but if it‚Äôs a clean towel that you have been waiting for...  The food was fantastic everyday except for Sunday- it was a bit lacking in variety. The restaurant staff bend over backwards to help and the chefs are generous and proud of their food.  Our accommodation was clean and fresh and airy. The bedding was freshly laundered and changed whenever we requested. The is no mini bar ok. There just isn‚Äôt. WiFi is only in the reception area which is a bummer. You have to get dressed and go sit with everybody just to check emails.  There‚Äôs a shuttle bus that goes back and forth to old and new town. It‚Äôs worth going on them more than once especially to old town. Everyone is trying to give this impression that once you get off the bus you will be bombarded with evil Marrakesh men trying to steal and deceive you. Just don‚Äôt be an idiot learn ‚ÄòNo thank you‚Äô. In Arabic and say it a lot.  Have a great time.  The entertainment at night could sometimes be a little boring and you are pretty much expected to go to bed once the bar closes.  There‚Äôs food at five I mention this because it‚Äôs usually something light and tasty.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jacqui R wrote a review Apr 2019,20,Not the best of hotels,I spent 3 nights at La Branda Targa hotel early April with a friend and our adult daughters. Whilst we knew we had a bargain and didn‚Äôt expect luxury for the price we were paying the hotel wasn‚Äôt wonderful!    We didn‚Äôt feel the staff were very welcoming on the whole (the bar cleaning and buffet staff were somewhat better). The food was ok (salads very good) but fairly limited in choice. However we certainly didn‚Äôt starve! The all inclusive drinks were not the best. Cocktails were too sweet and out of a machine. Gin and vodka were fine but a slice of lemon would have helped! From the bar by the pool plastic glasses were used and they need replacing. We also had plastic glasses in the bar in the evening (not all the time) and we would have preferred glass in the evening! Cardboard cups for coffee in the buffet restaurant was also disappointing. In the evening there was entertainment in the bar but it really was so loud and the seating so poor there was no way we wanted to stay there! We found it a little quieter in the corridor outside the bar sitting on a couple of settees. This quieter area was spoilt however by young children screaming and running up and down the corridor in and out of the ‚Äòconference‚Äô room with little supervision by parents. This went on until at least 11pm. We were unimpressed!    The rooms were ok. Clean and the beds were comfortable. For the price we paid they were absolutely fine.    Outside the pools looked inviting and understandably as it was April they weren‚Äôt very warm. We found the music played in the main pool area way too loud but there is an adult only pool a short walk from the main pool area but a long way from the bar! We found one umbrella holder and one umbrella. We presumed more would appear in the summer.    We didn‚Äôt use the free shuttle bus into the city as we didn‚Äôt realise until too late that 24 hours notice to use it was required.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tasha A wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Very chilled hotel,I was here last month and had the worst holiday blues when I came back home!!    The hotel rooms are cleaned everyday with new towels which is good. You can also get free towel for the sunbeds and change them everyday.. Just don't loose your card they give you.  The pools are lovley. The main pool is where the animation come round and try and get you to join in the activities. Saying that the two remake entertainers did not speak to me the whole week which I thought was weird but the guys are very friendly. The food was not the best but was very healthy I actually think I lost weight coming home from being here as I was eating a lot or peppers and grilled chicken every night. The lunch was my best they have a pizza bar too which was nice.    The all inclusive drinks were okay the red wine was lovley but the cocktails were too sweet as made out of a machine.    The entertainment and bar closes dead on 11pm. We would sit outside with other holiday makers and then the hotel turns its lights off outside which I think is quite rude.    The staff work very hard around the clock and I mean even staff like gardeners etc.    I did like this place but the location was far from anything really.. There is a free bus that goes to the old town and new town which you book the day before you want to go.    The security here are very intemidating at night like if I sat on a sunbed chilling on my phone they would just keep staring at me üò≥    Anyway apart from them little nibles it was a nice relaxing stay I will come back to Morroco in the future.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Clacton-on-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tashatheexplorer
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Holly C wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Meh,We arrived 2 families at the hotel with children the rooms were not ready for another 2 hours so we had to wait. We booked 2 family rooms but was offered a smaller studio room which was ready as the family room that was promised to be ready in 30 mins still wasn't. The receptionist then said they were both ready one was upstairs and one downstairs and they had given me the downstairs room but i was under the impression I paid for a pool view with a balcony and as i had a small 2 year old i wanted the balconyor patio with railings so he couldnt run off if the door was open. when they took us to the rooms both were infact upstairs but they had still confusingly put me in the smaller studio room. I came to the desk to ask why i wasn't in my family room and she said it was still being cleaned and i said i was happy to stay in the smaller room as it was ready and my baby was tired but they would not reduce the bill. I asked to be put in a family room upstairs and she said she didn't have any so i decided to stay in the studio due to the railing issue but they still refused to reduce my bill - funnily enough i saw someone else in the room i paid for.    To summarise the rest of the holiday the buffet isn't the biggest and the food doesn't always go together well. The chefs seemed inexperienced especially when cutting large amounts of meat with huge knives towards a customer. If something runs out you wait quite a while for them to refill causing ques and should be ready and prepped before hundreds of guests come into dine. It really is DIY and service isn't really included in the price all the staff do is clear up after you and you have to find help which sometimes you get a great response and other times staff look at you as if your stupid or mad.    Towels run out in the towel station the dinner is from 7pm and not always suitable for children they have a small snack bar in the afternoon from 3-5 but the choice is small and sandwiches have limited filling. Coffee and Hot drinks in tiny paper cups so grab more than one at a time and children's activities start from 9pm which can be far too late for little ones. Don't be ripped off by the in house activity organisers the price is way higher than booking yourself. They offer 2 towels for a family room and 1 for less than that and are very crispy on the skin.    Overall its totally budget and does what it needs but we just stayed for the kids to finish the holiday but wasn't a great all inclusive experience compared to so many i've stayed in before. Its just OK but not one to remember.    I've worked in hotels and hospitality in reservations catering events and revenue almost every part of a hotel for the last 15 years and unfortunately from experience it wasn't great. I feel that the start left a bad impression as the reception staff sort of had a its not my problem attitude which even if your having a bad day customer service is everything even if someone is a pain in the bum.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyCadogan7

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,DanW wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,Both myself and my girlfriend stayed here for 1 week and have just returned today.    Food was 10/10. Of course it is very hard to satisfy everybody's taste buds bit they did a very good job of doing it and I love my food!!!    Cleaniness - The hotel was always kept clean and to a very high standard from the restaurant to the bar to the pool areas they were always clean.    Location - the free shuttle bus to and from the old/new town to the hotel was so handy and we made use of this service everyday. You can choose from multiple times (I think they leave every two hours approximately from 9:30 to 19:30) sometimes we would just get the shuttle bus out and instead of arranging a pickup time we would get a taxi back for 80-100MAD from old town and 60-80MAD from new town.    Staff - The staff were brilliant and very nice people in general. The entertainer Dari is great and a very nice person as well Chico but all entertainer staff are great and try and get everyone to participate in activities.  I would also like to mention the cleaning staff as our room was spotless each day and it was good to put your feet up after a long day and a fresh and spotless room.    Rooms - the rooms are big and spacious. The bathroom/Shower is large also with walk in shower. The aircon could to with some work as it never really cooled the room down maybe by a few degrees. It was very loud also but I'm sure with some quick maintenance this wouldnt be an issue.  The room had a safe/fridge and tv which are all good additions to the room.    Entertainment nights - The entertainment team put on shows each night and are well worth going to if you want to have a chilled night in. Most are for kids but all the adults still have a good Laugh too.    The only big downside to this hotel is the booking agency that is located beside the reception.

The animation team have been amazing so friendly so funny so many activities every day involving everyone. All hotel staff went above and beyond and could not fault this holiday one bit. Will definitely be back with the whole family next time. The hotel rep offered lots of different excursions and he sold us the quad biking as it was something we wanted to do over here accessible to the old and new town via a free shuttle service provided by the hotel.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Cherie Foley wrote a review Apr 2019,10,DO NOT BOOK TRIPS IN HOTEL,Do not book any trips in the hotel the travel agents have the most disgusting attitude and cannot help customers. Our alarms did not go off for an early morning trip and they never rang our hotel room or tried to get in contact with us even though they took our room number! When I went to complain I was told that they DO NOT CARE and that it is NOT THEIR JOB! The 3 travel agents talked amongst themselves in Arabic so I could not understand before talking back to me! I was given no refund and I was not apologized to. The travel agents just want to take money and not look after customers. DO NOT BOOK ANY TRIPS FROM THEM!!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Clare H wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Beautiful hotel. Poor food and drink,The hotel and all of the staff are absolutely wonderful at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and the team will go out of there way to help you if they can.  But Labranda Targa is in the middle of nowhere and i mean 25 mins drive to anywhere. so the only place to eat is the 1 buffet restaurant (the other was closed) and 1 bar (the pool bar until 5.30pm then inside). The drinks are not very nice at all. The vodka is like nail polish remover and the food is very repetitive and I was only there for the long weekend.  There is 1 other bar that serves all known branded drinks but you are looking at ¬£6 bottle of bud ¬£8 for a grey goose vodka.  Tip 1 - buy a bottle or 2 in the UK airport before you arrive and just have the free soft drinks to mix with at the hotel.  We got a large bottle of Stolli vodka for ¬£14.  Tip 2 - the easiest way to work out the money is to drop the 0. So if you have a 200 dirham it's close to ¬£20 20 dirham is ¬£2.  The hotel do put on coaches to the market and they provide tour guides to meet you as you get off the bus. We never had a guide and I regret it now. I have never felt so vulnerable in my life.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClareH1618

The room we had was large and towels changed every day. Free safe in room and towels for the pool were free ask at reception for pass. If all inclusive you can eat and drink all day. Two free busses to take you into town one for old town and one for the new town where the shops are. Staff we found were friendly and helpful. Change some money at the airport so that on arrival you can pay the tourist tax which was ¬£11 per week per person. Unfortunately there is nothing outside of the hotel grounds worth seeing lots of sand and poor buildings.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Debra A wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Short break,1st visit to Marrakech very impressed! The hotel is clean & staff friendly. Good choice of food & free water. It would be nice to have proper cups for morning coffee rather than paper ones. Pool areas good there is an adult only pool if you want some peace as there's music activities & slides going on at main area but we didn't use it too far from bar! The bar at night was ok with some good entertainment on (not often you get pink floyd played live!) Only gripe was not enough staff on only got more help when someone shouted after being fed up queuing & people were doubling up on drinks which obviously meant it took the poor barman even longer. This needs sorting before it gets busier. The rooms are cleaned daily not sure why theres a note about saving the planet & reusing towels as even when when we hung them up they were replaced! We had twin beds rather than a double not a problem we've been married a long time! May be for someone else tho if not expecting that. Free shuttle bus is great. We went to the Medina to visit the souks yes you get people trying to show you around or sell things before you get to the square but if you just politely say no & look as though you know where you're going( even if you don't) they will leave you alone. Amazing crazy place! We took an excursion to the desert where we had camel ride quad bikes & jeep safari finishing with a lovely meal in Bedouin tent & traditional entertainment which they encourage you to join in with plus shisha if you want it. Some things are extra which they don't warn you about like the scarf you buy to cover your face with for the dust wine & beer available but that's not cheap as they do not drink themselves. French lady who is in charge was very good & attentive.Overall was a great day out. We crammed a lot in over a few days so not much time for relaxing would love to go back for longer & see more things & the hotel is a great base for this,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kettlewell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debraa74

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,JuveyChick wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Chilled week away in the sun,Like it says on the tin chilled week away for 7 nights 8 days as we had the benefit of a late checkout (200MAD) so could use the facilities for the majority of the last day (until 3pm)  The lobby is huge and spotless with lovely decor to give a great Moroccan feel. Desk staff are friendly and helpful. The restaurant is big with lots of choice although seemed to repeat a lot of rice and tagines. There was always a freshly cooked and carved meat or fish each night. Limited choice for coeliac or gluten intolerant and nothing labelled. Chef is willing to show you what you can eat if this helps. Pretty much nothing for coeliac for breakfast other than fruit or omelette (made to order) so rarely bothered. I however was fine and could choose from pastries croissants toast grilled items etc etc. Bottled water available in restaurant and bars and is included in A.I. No problems with the alcoholic drinks - plenty of choice including cocktails - the ‚ÄúMarrakech‚Äù and ‚ÄúPina colada‚Äù were really nice! The pool bar is open daily until about 5pm - the staff are nice and one barman in particular (young) very friendly and always singing. I try to learn a few words eg please thank you and hello in the local language and this is appreciated :) the water slides run at set times in the day the steps are steep to get out of the pool and no rails however other pools are fine and have ladders or gradual steps in/ out. The pool is cold but not unbearable.  Pool games are played daily - if you sit near the lifeguard chair you will get wet or hit by the ball when they play water polo - we learned this after the first few days so moved abit further down.  The entertainment staff are really nice (Carlos MoMo and Vitamine!) and try to get people involved but don‚Äôt push if you don‚Äôt want to. We wanted to chill so didn‚Äôt do much. They work hard and do entertainment in the evening too - i enjoyed the dance show specially the Michael Jackson tribute at the end! Also enjoyed the show where MoMo dressed up like Whitney Houston in a dress and a wig üôÇ very funny. They also had karaoke and other things going on. Sitting outside is cold and no heaters so take jumpers and jeans etc. The shisha bar is abit warmer as undercover and secluded a little. Shisha costs 150MAD and they only have 3 flavours (unless you mix them) the shisha man is helpful and you can have shisha sat by the pool or outside in the evening if you wish.    We used the hotel bus to visit the market square and spent 2 hours. We were shown to the leather market after locals hyping this up greatly and encouraging us to go see it. It wasn‚Äôt our thing particularly - awful smelling lots of walking and steps but if you are interested in seeing the process to make leather then go for it. They take you to a shop at the end where the leather items are sold - again not my thing but depends if you love real leather!! The locals wanted paying for everything - to be shown around (even if you don‚Äôt ask for this) to use toilet one lady forced her henna onto my hand and wanted paying to remove this even though I repeatedly said I didn‚Äôt want it. In the end I walked away and washed it off in a cafe with some tissue she got aggressive and swore at me but I didn‚Äôt look at her or engage any further. She was the only one who really bothered us and luckily it was on the way back to the bus stop. After the market square you go down little cobbled alleyways and the locals in here don‚Äôt make as much fuss and are helpful at showing you things if you are interested. It is very busy and there are a lot of scooters. For some reason we were asked to keep to the right when walking as locals use the left...    I thought our hotel would be close to amenities but it‚Äôs actually quite secluded and off the beaten track so if you want to explore I would either organise how you will do this or choose somewhere closer to things. The area on route to hotel did appear to be very run down and poor with lots of street people and markets. Hotel was close to airport (20 mins) we booked transfer by taxi online prior to leaving UK and it was SO cheap (¬£17 return for both of us!) much cheaper than though easyJet or airport itself. You can get currency when you arrive at the airport but the queues are LONG! Also fyi - change your currency back before you check in for flight home - I made the mistake thinking that I could change it back once upstairs after security and check in - there are NO currency exchanges after you check in and you can‚Äôt change the Moroccan Dirhams once back in the UK.    The ‚Äúcosy bar‚Äù is the main A.I bar from about 5pm and in the evening it gets noisy! Not sure why it is called ‚Äúcosy‚Äù haha. You can sit outside where it‚Äôs less rowdy but as mentioned it‚Äôs cold. You can take drinks back to room / patio which is good or sit in the lobby or shisha bar. The pool bar outside does have bar stools and some tables under shade of you wish. Our room was 1049 ground floor opposite the adults only pool - we hardly saw anyone use it and the pool guy closes the gates around 5:30-6pm. Ground floor rooms don‚Äôt have a patio as such just a small area big enough for a table and 2 chairs. We didn‚Äôt use it much but was nice when we did and the gardens are lit up at night with Moroccan lanterns. The shower was amazing - so powerful and hot. The floor tiles in the shower itself and on the bathroom floor are matte which I would imagine is to reduce slips however the footmatt (with no grip!) against the tiles was a lethal combo so please be careful!    Be aware the flooring around the pool area is uneven with some of it sticking up. This caused me to catch my toe and trip over one day walking around the pool to go inside - lucky no injury just a scraped and bruised knee - so be mindful of this and especially if children are running or playing.    Would want to visit other parts of Morocco now I have been to marrakech and maybe the atlas mountains (few hours each way) but the hotel itself was lovely and would not hesitate to return if wanting another holiday to ‚Äúlie and fry‚Äù    Happy holidaying!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuveyChick

I would stay here again however and the free shuttle bus to the city centre was an excellent service which we made use of daily.

Our stay was from 20/12/18 - 27/12/18. Overall it was a very pleasant stay. The rooms were overally clean no quibbles and the cleaners visited everyday to clean and change the bedding. The food in the restaurant was generally good quality with wide enough variety; the chef even prepared some dishes on special request e.g. mashed potatoes for our 1 year old. The pools were well maintained and clean they are not warmed but then by mid-morning the sun was roasting (even in Dec!) and so the pools were a welcome relief from the heat. There are regular shuttle buses to the city the only negative is that there are purported guides who await the buses and they 'guide' you to the most expensive places no doubt they get some sort of kickback. But we all enjoyed our stay nonetheless and would definitely visit again.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Telford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DodoExpress263

They are very friendly and when they get you to join in with activities they make you feel like they are doing it because they want you to join in and not just because it is there job too . And on some nights they put on dance/acting/comedy sketch shows with all the team and they are very skilled dancers and Momo whitney Houston is hilarious .    MizoCarlos Vitamine were amazing and really made our holiday special and we cannot thank them enough!    I have been to a large number of resorts over the years ranging from 3 to 5 star and this is by far the best entertainment team by far hotel.    All inclusive was the best been to aswell variety of different food for all to enjoy:)    Overall very good holiday thanks alot :)    Only small issues was first few nights was cold at night and hot ac did not work and no wi-fi in the rooms but spend most the time not in the room anyway so wasnt a big deal    Hotel also offers free shuttles to the old town with markets and then the more modern new town .,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kbeckfor

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Lakeisha H wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Beautiful Hotel,I cannot fault the hotel at all it was beautiful and clean at all times not far from the airport or old town. The only fault i have to state is the reception staff i arrived in at night as a solo travel and the reception i received was not welcoming at all! Basically got told to come in sit down fill out a form and done. The restaurant & bar staff were really nice. The pools & bars shut early but i guess thats because of the time of year i went. The animation show was really cheesy but what i found funny was the fact they had Michael Jackson performances (clearly not up to date with the news)lool. But overall it was a nice hotel.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384lakeishah
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Mimi_M wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Amazing stay at Labranda Targa Aqua Park,Absolutely amazing hotel with all your holiday needs readily available on the spot. Loved the entertainment - had stuff going on around the pool during the day (exercises scheduled games and mini activities to mingle while you're not on the sun bed) as well as stuff in the evening (karaoke live music eves in the all inclusive bar). The staff was most helpful and polite and answered all our queries promptly and knowledgeably. Room was clean and spacious for its value. The hotel offers complimentary shuttle to city and that was a convenient bonus for sightseeing although we did not do much as our holiday was more relaxing type.  In addition food was gorgeous - catering quite a selection in their all inclusive lunch and dinner menus - with different main each day.  Overall the two of us had an absolutely fab stay would recommend the hotel to anyone considering going to Marrakech (me and my sister were first time goers). Really good value for your money as all inclusives go and offers access to sightseeing opportunities if wanted.

I arrived and had a pool view over main bar large room but so noisy you could not open windows no bath no kettle no outdoor apace I went back to reception to change advised I booked a type of room to suit my needs man from meeting point came over said he could not believe it people love pool view they said they only had one garden view left so I went to there but still no bath or kettle I asked for these told come back.later I did again told come back tomorrow. I went back they said they would phone me if they had either. Never got that call. Due to fatigue I spent most of two days in room . Could not soak legs after a trip and could not make myself a hot drink so lived on water also no satalite channels on TV. During stay hairdryer stuck on I reported it but 2 hours later had to send husband back to report again as no one had come it took 3 hours to get it stopped can you imagine the noise of a hairdryer on for hours. Everything this hotel did contributed to me not being able to manage my disability making it worse. This limited what I could do. This has ruined Marrakesh for me.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jackee wrote a review Mar 2019,10,Not as good as it seems,We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. First we were given a tiny room that smelled like bleach which really burned our eyes. After paying extra we got a slide better room. Unfortunately it got really cold at night and the heating in the room didn‚Äôt work. Dont forget your warm socks and sweater in the cold months.    In the first morning we had a roach in our bedroom which left the hotel room again underneath the doors since there is a slide space between door and floor that is open.    The rooms probably were never renovated after the first opening of the hotel. So all the furniture beds and walls look pretty used.    U just can‚Äôt compare those 4 starts with a European standard.    WiFi connection in the room is not available you have to be in a plublic area to use it.    The food was basic. There were no regular cups just plastic which gives the whole dining area a cheap ambience. So if you want to drink your morning coffee out of a nice cup that‚Äôs not going to happen here.    There are shuttles to the new and old town which is a nice things. Although be prepared when you go there (just Google about these areas before)    Overall I would recommend to save some more money and stay at a better hotel.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackee314

All the staff from reception to gardeners all said hello when passing. the food was mixed and varied very Moroccan so don't expect burger and chips with plenty of choice for all meals. AI drinks were ok with the local lager stork being cold and refreshing. the red wine was also very pleasant just be aware its a very limited range of local spirits. Plenty of sun beds available around all the pools although we just returned so quite quiet as out of season. if I was pushed to find a negative it would be the bed was very firm how ever this may be to some peoples taste.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Claudine D wrote a review Mar 2019,10,THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY BY CHARGING YOUR CARD FOR SERVICES NOT PROVIDED,I was dued to stay at this hotel from the 5th March due to unforseen circumstances I arrived on the 6th to be told a room paid for had been given away. After a very heated discussion we were given a suite. No that was not an upgrade it was a big room with a double bed which my friend and I were suppose to share. When we refused they told us one could sleep on the couch. Another debate took place with a very rude manager who was at home in bed who told me I'm lucky we have a room at all (regardless they have already been paid for the room). I then got speaking to some of the guests to realise that this hotel had a agreement with @easyjet Groupon and woucher. Now I realised just why this holiday was gonna be a nightmere it was barging bucket. Don't get me wrong so of the best holidays can be bargain this was not one of them. Upon leaving the hotel two days later thinking this has been the worst trip of my travelling experience it got better. I realised that they had charged my credit cards for a service which I hadn't recieved. CREDIT CARDS FRAUD. When I tried to get an explanation of whats going on and why they did this they pretended not to speak or understand English. After an hour of discussions I left the hotel without a refund. If you are looking for a stress free holiday good quality hotel accommodation staff who really care about the service they provide DON'T GO TO THIS HOTEL. I have noted they troll through their comments and leave very poor apologies its not worth telling people we hope we can make it up. People don't want poor excuses after we have gone home saying Hope we can make it up 'RUBBISH'. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE TREATED LIKE THEY DON'T MATTER OR ONCE YOU HAVE THEIR MONEY CUSTOMER SERVICE GOES THROUGH THE DOOR.

The pool areas were always kept lovely and clean with plenty of pools to choose from and even a quiet adult only pool of you fancied a bit of quiet.    The food was lovely and fresh with plenty of choice. They served traditional Moroccan food but also plenty of alternatives if that wasnt to your taste but it was great to be able to try new food.    All of the staff throughout the hotel are very friendly always give you a smile and wish you good morning and happy to help with any needs.    The animation team absolutely made our holiday.

There was a variety of activities all day long from 11am to 5.30 by the pool side with plenty for both children and adults to participate in everything from games to belly dancing Moroccan food demonstrations and Arabic lessons. There was always something on for entertainment in the evening as well again for both children and adults.    The animation team themselves are so much fun and always full of energy. They are very friendly and when they get you to join in with activities they make you feel like they are doing it because they want you to join in and not just because it is there job too.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,nalingi26 wrote a review Mar 2019,30,1 week stay in Feb 2019....hmmm,After vacating at a branch of labranda hotel in Turkey we were very impressed and chose the labranda hotel in Morrocco.    What a big let down in comparison.    Where do I start.  The food. So we were all inclusive but the food was a disappointment. There was not much variety or choice to the point I lost my appetite and felt that I had gone to a weight loss retreat. At times the food was being rationed. For example roast chicken was done twice in the week and the chef was carefully giving out a small portion. To be brutaly frank the food just wasn't nice. There were complaints from several others that we met about food not being ready ot put out in the early morning when they were going out to an excursion.    Also the some of the staff need training in customer service as they came across as unhelpful and unfriendly.    The room that we had was a twin room and I found my bed comfortable and the room was good. The Chambermaid was very thorough and did a good job in keeping our room clean. The clkeaning staff were all lovely. I did love the labranda shower gel and soap. The smell was lovely. I also loved the shower great water pressure.    The hotel is a beautiful hotel that needs a little care and attention in places. For example the carpet on the landings need a deep clean or replacing.    The hotel has a gym which looks good. However only 1 piece of equipment safely works. 2 treadmills and 1 only works. The bike seats are cracked and you are slipping off your seat as you start cycling. Guys please sort out the gym equipment.    The animation team were friendly and I could see they were great with the little children.    The hotel provide a shuttle bus every.2 hours into town  The drivers are efficient and friendly...and punctual.    On one particular evening in the lounge I was really surprised when 1 of the staff who works at the turning point desk but was behind the bar turned the television sets on and increased the volume up high on all 3 sets so as to watch football. There were customers in the lounge expecting to listen to music and chill out put for the evening entertainment. I found that really selfish and rude.    All in all it is a nice hotel but feels like 3.5 stars.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nalingi26

We always found a table and I especially appreciated the bottled water available at all times. A special mention for the afternoon snacks.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,TheSnakeCharmer wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Excellent value for a low cost all-inclusive,We booked through loveholidays.ie and I really can't fault the hotel the food and its facilities for the low price we paid for an all-inclusive trip for one week. Most guests we chatted to had paid similarly low rates so it's hard to understand how some reviewers seem to expect 5 star plus luxury for a budget price.    It's true that the hotel is a little run down (it would have been in perfect condition 10 years or so ago) and the owners don't seem to invest in the upkeep. But it is clean the staff work hard and are friendly and the food is excellent - fresh with lots of choice and brilliant salads. Though if you like to exist on pizza and chips alone you may find your choices limited but of course these aren't staples of the Moroccan diet:) And meal times seem to be never ending with breakfast swiftly followed by lunch afternoon snack and then dinner!    The all-inclusive alcoholic drinks are just fine - the local options are much better than I've had in other parts of the world. Yes the all-inclusive bar does close at 11pm but the staff don't mind you stock-piling your drinks! The nightly entertainment is hit and miss but this is just a personal preference thing and the entertainment staff work so so hard. Karaoke night was our favourite!    Bedrooms are a little run down too but again clean and large. We paid extra for a balcony (which was overlooking the 'quiet' pool) and I'd recommend this. Though the hotel should invest in some new outdoor furniture - our balcony had just a much worn table and two chairs but could have fitted sun loungers.    The pool area is pleasant and the water slides look like great fun for kids but as it was January and the pool was unheated (common in Morocco) most people just sunbathed rather than swam. The outdoor bar is close to the main pool and there is table tennis and a volleyball and tennis court right beside it too.    There is a travel desk at the hotel but you are better to book tours online through Viator or a similar site as the hotel agent is about 10 - 50% more expensive depending on the trip. We booked excellent horse-riding and spa trips through Viator - both trips picked us up at our hotel and dropped us back. You can booked airport pick ups and drop offs though Viator too - we got an airport pick up for 5 euro! The hotel offers a number of free shuttle buses per day into the old town (where the Medina/souks are) you need to book on to these in advance at the reception to get a seat.    All in all we had a great week at the Labranda Targa Aquapark - excellent value for money and a perfect place for doing very little for a couple of days.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSnakeCharmer
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Richardo1961 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,A gem of a find,Decided to choose Morocco this year as we fancied a change of scenery and culture. We had never been all inclusive before but we found an amazing deal online. At the time of writing we are nearly half way through our break I usually wait until I return home before reviewing but feel I have seen enough in a week to convince me that we made a great choice. Firstly as I have mobility problems I need mention Marrakesh Airport. The assistance on arrival was absolutely superb the young guy who help me was friendly and extremely professional.    Although our flight arrived a little later we found the Hoppa transfer easily and the driver was again amicable and co-operative. His driving was careful and safe.    On arrival at the hotel we were warmly greeted and our luggage taken to our room for us. Our first impression was very favourable it was 25 degrees and the pool looked inviting. We asked for a room reasonably close to reception and this was granted. The room itself was very clean and comfortable we had two single beds and views over the adult only pool and to the right the mountains.    The food has been a revelation. It is clear that the kitchen and waiting staff work hard to provide a varied and healthy choice. There has been a choice of soups to start plus other choices a range of salads hot dishes such as roasted chicken fried pork chop a fish course every day different rice dishes fresh breads pasta pizza the choice for each meal is great and all freshly prepared. My wife is from Asia and she feels the same. Since we arrived we have met people here from at least 8 different nations and the menu seems to have something for everyone. The only thing that I would suggest is a choice of ice cream as a dessert choice as there are quite a few children around.    The staff and management are amongst the friendliest and most dedicated I have met in my travels throughout the years both as a leisure traveller and career as a travel agency Manager. They really are an asset to the hotel always greeting with a smile and nothing is too much trouble. The room is cleaned every day and we are acknowledged everytime we pass a member of staff in the corridor. The only slight niggle is that our room fridge is broken and has not been replaced yet but this does not detract from our experience. The shower is superb a real power shower and plenty of hot water. The TV has about 20 different channels and has Sky News and Live football. The Sports Bar shows a range of games on a daily basis. There is entertainment each day although we did not avail ourselves of this yet. Tried the local beer which was rather refreshing.    All in all this has been so far a great holiday. The free bus service to old and new town is timely and the drivers are friendly and helpful too. The internet signal is strong in reception and we are lucky that we can receive it in our room too. The hotel arranged a taxi to the Jemma El Fna Market which only cost us ¬£20 return for the 4 of us. The Marrakesh traffic on a sunday afternoon is something to behold and the market itself is an eclectic mix of heady aromas a huge variety of produce and goodies stallholders who always have a wave and a smile. We never felt anything other than their warmth and their urge to be hospitable and welcoming. Marrakesh really is a place not to be missed it has everything including charm and great history. We have yet to return to any of our previous destinations as we like a different experience on each holiday we take. In the case of the Labranda Targa Aqua Parc and the beautiful city of Marrakesh I think we can say we will make an exception. We will be back.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richardo1961
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sophia1488 wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Family holiday..,We had a mostly lovely holiday staying at Labranda targa. The staff were helpful and very friendly. We were especially impressed with Mimi who runs the children‚Äôs clubs. She makes the stay very special for the children and she works very hard.. my little one adored her.. Samy Carlos and the other entertainment staff were lovely and chatty and made us feel very welcome. The chefs and maids all worked very hard to keep this hotel a lovely place..  the downfalls for us were some of the other holiday makers mostly from the uk. I would have thought this hotel was for families but it seems a few couples came over from the uk to take drugs get drunk and then continually argued even throwing things at the walls and playing very loud music.  We had reported this numerous times and told them about the use of drugs and were told security were dealing with it but they didn‚Äôt.. we kept reporting but the security didn‚Äôt seem to care and our last night was spent in bed wide awake listening to them argue and scream below us... we ended up having to speak to them directly as the security did nothing.. it was very disappointing and ruined part of our holiday.. so for that reason we won‚Äôt be returning..  the excursions are a total rip off - DO NOT waste your money.. they try to scare you in to not going to the markets alone.. we went alone and had a great time a few other couples went with a tour guide and hated it as they wouldn‚Äôt let you stop and look and it was all very rushed..  a lot of the excursions your better off booking directly with the company and getting it for a fraction of the price..  also at the markets be firm but polite and start haggling low..,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ilkley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sophia1488
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Cathy and Tom S wrote a review Feb 2019,30,Good stay but....,Quite happy with first impressions of hotel. We got there late and we were on all inclusive so it was good that the staff ushered us to restaurant so we could grab a bite to eat before we checked in.    The breakfasts were the best! Delicious Moroccan breads crepes and fresh yoghurt and freshly made cheeses( like they had come from local farm). Eggs made to your liking. Dinner wasn‚Äôt so great but we only did two nights as we went out into town. The local wines were very drinkable and none too shabby! Local beer Stork very good too!    Rooms were extremely clean. Quite a sprawling hotel. Had a very noisy crowd next door to us the first night! Obviously people who have no concept that they might have neighbors. But after a while there was a knock at their door and things quietened down! Mouse carries more than you would expect!    Lovely balcony with decent outdoor furniture.    The entrance to hotel was quite traditional and had a Moroccan feel to it.    The real downside was that it was about 20 minutes from the Centre. You have to book free shuttle the day before or get a taxi for about a 100 to 150 dhirams.    Staff were friendly and accommodating.

The staff are nice and helpful apart from a miss understanding with some excursions fees where we have got charged more than it should but it was sorted out fine and we have got a refund. To mention that the bar staff are becoming rude to a point where they just poured 3 quarters of spirits and a bit of a mixer drink which we had to throw them out as they were undrinkable. Nice live band and a club but they closing it a bit too early. The food was really good some days but some other days I had nothing to choose from as they were terrible. Entertainment team was good enough to give us a smile on our faces.  Also the little shop was closed within the opening hours which was annoying.  Clean and nice bedrooms and bathroom as well clean. Nice balcony and terraces.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Richard FC wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Cheap and dated,This hotel was rated 4star and the reviews on Trip Advisor we're all good however all was not as it seemed.  The reception staff are blunt and borderline rude. Staff on reception have never had customer care training.  We received a room overlooking the hotel air conditioning and we're told that was what we had booked. They would not change our room unless we paid another 137 euro for the week for a better view.  The hotel lobby was well presented but the corridors and bedrooms were tired and shabby. Paint peeling from ceiling and when was last time they got a refurbishment. Well over due.  The meeting point personnel were very friendly but only it appeared because they were selling over price day trips.  One trip to Atlas mountains cost 130 for a couple and lasted 5 hours with a very poor luncheon. Complained to manager but not at all concerned.  This hotel is about getting your money and then offering you little for it in return.  As for all inclusive offer. Food of a basic poor standard. Should get a better chef.  Alcohol was free. Very generous amounts served by helpful staff. The only problem is that for a family destination you find English french and Germans drunk at 3 in the afternoon and loud and messy.  Recommending this hotel would be a crime. Over priced and poor value.  Morocco appears open for business but only appears concerned about your money with no regard for service,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Triard12345

Swimming pools freezing as not heated . Buffets were good and something new and varied each day . Entertainment left a lot to be desired but there again was geared to a more youthful generation . Getting older now so probably us ..Hotel tries hard and staff generally efficient and polite . Downside is location as on edge of Marrakesh but a very good shuttle service provided free to two different destinations . On site excursions expensive . Go into town and you can negotiate prices approx 32% cheaper . Beds are firm but with the black out curtains and a wee dram sleep was good .

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,syscouk wrote a review Feb 2019,30,"Not bad, 3 star plus hotel in a isolated location",This is our second trip to Morocco and the wonderful city of Marrakesh. This hotel was located way out of the city centre in a strange and isolated area at least 25 to 30 minutes‚Äô drive from Jama Al Fana.    We booked 2 rooms and emailed them 1 month before and requested that the rooms to be next to each other. This was acknowledged by reply ‚ÄúThank you for your email we confirm you the room next to each other LOUBNA DGHOUTI | Reservations Manager. When we arrived at the hotel they had no information or knowledge about this and in fact we were placed in rooms really far apart so couldn‚Äôt keep an eye out for the kids. Rooms were also small and cramped. A day later we was given interconnected rooms which was much larger. The hotel had shuttle services which was rather reliable.    The floors where it had carpet felt uneven. The carpets were worn out as this was noticeable. Bathroom were fairly clean of a 4 star standard I would say.    Food was based on inclusive basis. Very limited range and virtually the same type of food every day. This is was one of the biggest downside. It was more like a 3 star hotel range.    Pools were nice but was overcrowded.    Loud noise coming from Music at night time made sleep impossible. This was like a club atmosphere. There was no duvet for the child bed despite requesting one.    Having stayed at various hotels around the world I can say that the Labranda brand is not fine quality type of hotel so don‚Äôt expect a 4 or 5 star services.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syscouk

He made our stay there even more pleasant. There were at least 3 free shuttle buses to the market which you must visit as you can get very good bargains. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and eager to please. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were placed daily. The food was very tasty and fruits were organic. There was plenty of choice in food and desserts. Wine was very good too. There was daily entertainment although I only went to one as I was very tired.

Beware that the locals know the times and when this bus is coming and departing so will try and make out that they are official guides. They are not so avoid them. The resort was spotless and the cleaning and maintenance staff do a fantastic job. As has been mentioned here previously make sure you get an early seat for lunch and dinner otherwise you might not get want you want to eat. The drinks are ok but the pool bar staff are excellent and very friendly.

Lovely staff and the manager came round to introduce himself. The food is brilliant with choices of meat fish salads and lots of local fruit and vegetables. You can choose a pizza or local dishes. The room was more than adequate for the price and the grounds offer lots of different options. Adult only pool is a great idea. However don't expect to swim in Jan/Feb unless you want to break the ice! A downside is that the hotel is 20 mins from the centre but the hotel has lots of free shuttle services to the old centre and the new.  2 slight criticisms. The foreign exchange offered is poor value and has a massive bid/offer spread. You would be well advised to exchange in town if you are there. The other downside is the man who runs the tour shop called ""Meeting Point"".

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,gregoryscat wrote a review Jan 2019,30,OK for a short break,We stayed for five nights. Our good-sized ground floor room (2002) contained two single beds and the bathroom was small but clean. The shower was a fixed head type so you need to bring your own shower cap if wanting to keep hair dry. Soap shampoo and shower gel supplied. The only natural light came from the double glass patio doors which opened onto a small patio containing a table with two chairs and also the path which meant we were totally overlooked by anybody walking to and fro. With no net-type curtains the curtains had to be pulled for any privacy. The room was dark with insufficient dim lighting. There was a desk type dressing table but no mirror above. I brought my own hairdryer but found it a challenge to use without a mirror. There was a standard hairdryer in the bathroom with a casing that as it had no screws to secure it kept falling off exposing the wiring. The light above the washbasin was totally inadequate and provided another challenge when trying to put on some make-up. The room was chilly at night and the heating/air conditioning unit system seemed unable to warm it up. On the plus side room cleaned every day fresh towels every day a tv with several English language news channels plenty of hangers in the wardrobe and a free safe. Fortunately during our January stay mosquitoes also were not a problem. The restaurant was a buffet with enough choice of hot food and a large variety of salads. Labelling could be improved to warn of surprise meat or fish in the prepared salads. There was a small alcoholic drink station where you could queue or stand and wait for someone to come and serve you a glass of (quite drinkable local) wine or beer to take back to your table. The soft drinks were self service. The main pool had around a hundred sun beds all lined up together with the odd small table between providing limited separation. There were only two parasols which meant that in warmer weather it would be almost impossible to find any shade. The adult-only pool was quiet but again all sun beds lined up together and no shade. The four water slides in the aqua park pool looked fun but the water was too cold for us to try. The daytime pool bar had ‚Äòa problem‚Äô with what seemed to be honeybees (not wasps) but they really didn‚Äôt seem to want to bother us and as far as we knew hadn‚Äôt stung anyone. There were two evening bars one free for all-inclusive guests and another that was a ‚Äòpaid‚Äô bar. The all-inclusive bar was busy quite noisy and had some live entertainment ( a duo with keyboard and vocals while we were there). With the evening temperatures quite cool or even chilly in January most people were inside. We caught some of the main entertainment performed by the animation team one evening which was quite good. The hotel supplies a free shuttle-bus service with a couple of destination options. Taxis can only be booked through the travel reps in their office in the foyer. They seemed to be twice the price of another taxi company whose details were supplied by a tour guide on one of the day trips. The one real downside of our experience was that on our last night my husband was quite ill with a stomach upset and the next morning when he was unable to leave our room I phoned to enquire as to whether we could pay to extend our room until 3pm (instead of the usual 12 noon checkout) and received a very curt ‚ÄòNo we are fully booked‚Äô from reception even when I explained why. I don‚Äôt know whether we could have received a bit of help here or whether it really was totally impossible but I didn‚Äôt feel that someone even tried or even pretended to.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregoryscat

We are both vegan and enjoyed the selection of food of course it doesn't compare to local restaurant food but for hassle free buffet style catering it was awesome I even made us sandwiches for our flight home. They offer a free shuttle into town which we didn't need but was good to know. The pool water was freezing even too cold to paddle your feet for a long time but we did brave the water slides... I went down one once but my boyfriend went down a few times. We enjoyed playing tennis and football in the courts and later had a couples massage together. I thoroughly enjoyed mine and felt amazing afterwards however my boyfriend said his wasn't as good as the ones we'd had in the mefina (I thought this was way better). In the evening we paid for shisha then had free cocktails till the bar closed. In the morning we got a taxi to the airport 3hours before our flight back to London. All in all a fun experience to end our stay in Morocco probably wouldn't stay there longer than one night but its great value for money.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Mom wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Great hotel in many ways...,A difficult review as until the last day we had really positive thoughts good food ( though better labelling of meat and vegetarian meals would be helpful as would hand gel facilities as hygiene issues arising from people picking food up with hands was a little offputting) staff were generally friendly and helpful the pools and gardens were also great. There was however an alarming use of disposable bottles and cups which ecologically was disappointing and could so easily have been avoided. My real reason for the lower review however is that my phone was stolen at the hotel on my last day. I discovered this while I was enroute to the airport and used my partner's phone to contact the hotel immediately . I also emailed the hotel 4 times from the airport. None of these emails were answered. When I returned home I logged into my phone remotely and could see it was at the bar at the hotel and that someone had tried copiously to use it. I again rang the hotel but the receptionist was unable to help me and stated that no-one would be able to look at emails until a manager was next in. While this incident was obviously not the fault of the hotel it was entirely my own for taking my eyes off it awaiting my airport transfer.

This year I talked more the the other workers such as the lifeguards bar stuff reception stuff cleaners and they were super friendly even helping me out with learning French the life guards where great specially Kamari wissam and youssef always was making me laugh joking around bar staff was the same always teasing me making me smile and being friendly to the family all day long cleaners would talk to you and ask you how you are when you seen them reception staff always were there for anything you need and always a smile the pools where great food was good drinks all day long from 10am to 11pm I enjoyed being back at labranda definitely would go back soon but was disappointed at the lose of anamtion team it‚Äôs a good 5 stars the bedrooms where always clean and tidy . Going for days out was easy to get done with the help from guys from reception. There was never a day I didn‚Äôt enjoy and the slides where amazing too . But there was a bit of let down for me when there was a customer that had been there before arrived and her and her mother was very rude to me at the bar when getting my drinks and was very rude when I was taking to stuff I didn‚Äôt like that as I felt very put out the stuff didn‚Äôt say anything about her being rude but they did still talk to me but that was only my last day but I enjoyed my holiday again .,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyparryy
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Susie K wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Lovely,Lovely lovely lovely hotel. The staff were so super helpful and welcoming. The food is lovely it changes slightly every day which made it more enjoyable.  One thing I would say be aware when booking the tours at the hotel as although both tours we did (old town and Ourika valley) were amazing they give you absolutely no information when booking it and when asked we were given completely the wrong information.  The rooms are good size although if you have loud neighbours above you it‚Äôll keep you up all night.  There is WiFi at all the pools and around them some WiFi reaches to the rooms as ours did. There are free shuttle buses to both the new and old town from this hotel which I recommend.  Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/782susiek
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Susan B wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Lovely short stay,Had a fabulous short stay at this all-inclusive hotel. my kids loved it and so did my husband. It was meant to be just a few days away during the festive season and the staff couldn't be more helpful. The food was freshly prepared and plentiful the bedrooms clean and spacious. The General Manager Mr. Jacques Peter ensured we were very much looked after. Since the hotel resort is a little outside the city it makes a perfect tranquil getaway. They have a shuttle service running everyday to the medina so you won't miss the hype of old Marrakech. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks to all the staff we came across.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129SusanB129
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Claidean wrote a review Jan 2019,50,"Magical, Mystical Marrakech!",Ignore the negative reviews! We had an amazing stay here. We were slightly apprehensive about the food as we had read the previous comments but it was great. It was beautifully presented so colourful! There was the same choice of salads and breads every meal time but the mains were different and varied. Breakfast was my favourite meal lots of pastries cereals pancakes hams cheeses. I'm not sure why people have complained I can only assume it's because a 'Full English' wasn't available but if you have ventured as far as Morocco then you are probably expecting slightly different cuisine. I loved that all the food was fresh and locally sourced therefore understood that a Cumberland sausage and black pudding weren't an option!!!  The staff were really helpful a fab young man was on the reception desk he was always smiling and sorted my phone out so we could email boarding passes to be printed off. The medical centre was also excellent I only had a headache but they were really nice and gave me paracetamol.  We used the free bus to visit the market when we arrived a man offered to show us around and we declined as we had heard so many tell us not trust anyone. However it turned out the hotel provides these guides at no cost to us. I imagine they take you to the same 'shops' as the tour was very concise and lasted approximately 90 minutes in time for them to meet the next bus from the hotel but to be honest that suited us for our first visit as it is an overwhelming sight. We got the rug lamp etc.. we wanted and the guide saved us from the attention from stallholders. We thoroughly recommend this hotel we felt really well looked after. Yes the pool was freezing but we enjoyed sitting in the sun and dipping a toe in occasionally to us it was a safe base for exploring and relaxing which was just what we wanted.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claidean
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Robert A wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Excellent stay,Firstly don‚Äôt believe the negative reviews. This hotel was lovely.  We stayed here for four days in January and loved it.  We were a bit apprehensive after reading some reviews but we were more than happy.  The hotel cleanliness was amazing with staff constantly cleaning. Everywhere looked amazing and clean.  All staff that we dealt with were polite and friendly from the cleaners to the management.  Our room on the second floor of the hotel was definitely the biggest room we have ever stayed in and was cleaned daily. We had a couple of issues with the safe but these were dealt with although you do have to stay in your room to await the maintenance man who comes from outside the hotel and is accompanied by hotel security.  Speaking of security have never felt safer in a hotel with security all around the complex.  On to the food. We never felt that there was nothing we couldn‚Äôt eat. I don‚Äôt know why there are so many negative reviews regarding the food. If you don‚Äôt want to eat Moroccan food why holiday in Morocco!!!!!  The breakfast omelettes were amazing.  Always plenty of choices for each meal from soups to salads and cooked food and always hot. Be warned the plates are cold but there is a microwave so warm your plates in there before getting your food keeps the hot food hotter for longer. Simple really.  The drinks are also good with the wine being among the best we have had on an all inclusive. The beer was also good and the cocktails lovely. My wife‚Äôs favourite was the Marrakech.  Yes the pool was cold but this was to be expected as it is January and overnight temperatures were down to about 3 degrees. It didn‚Äôt stop me getting in though as the temperature warmed up in the day to about 20 although the pool was freezing. Think I was the only one who got in while we were there.  You can also book various excursions from the hotel and they run a shuttle bus which is free to the old town or new town. This has to be booked the day before with pick up arranged with the driver on the day. We used the shuttle bus to visit the medina (see separate reviews)  All in all a lovely hotel and a great place to stay,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Matlock, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertaN1343TZ

Hot water at all times and shower really good.  Food was ok with a reasonable choice fresh omelettes waffles and pancakes for breakfast.  Jacques the general manager was available and introduced himself to the guests to check all was ok.  Minibus takes you to old or new town every two hours. We enjoyed old town better than the new town.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,hollycrocker20 wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Marvellous Marrakech,Firstly ignore the negative reviews yes there are 2 factors I would say that could been a reason for complaint.  1. The amount of wasps and flies around the pool bar.  2. The small amount of food choice sometimes.    Now for me the food was fine. I always found something to eat and maybe even a 2nd plate too.  Some people would argue there wasn't alot on offer but what was was delicious.  The wasps were an issue yes but what could anybody do about it. The staff still catered for everyone's needs at all times and did the best for everyone.  Now for the good points the rooms are very clean and the maid comes in every day without fail :)  The grounds are beautiful very clean and kept well. The lights at night time are lovely too :)  The choice of drinks is also very good. ALL 3 types of wine lager spirits cocktails. ALL of a good taste :) what else would people possibly want to drink?  Another positive there are large pools and a slide pool too. Plenty for children to do :)  The seating is also great plenty of areas during the day and the evening to enjoy the sun and then the entertainment.  ALL the staff work at there best to keep everybody happy and especially the bar staff during the day ;)    Overall I would say there are no issues with this hotel and me and my family loved it :)  Anybody with an issue clearly doesn't realise they are abroad and not in an english 4 star!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Haleema A wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Don‚Äôt know what to make of it???,I went with my husband in early January this year. Landed midday on Thursday arrived at the hotel. they took us aside our luggage shoved in the corner. We got taken in to the ‚Äúmeeting point‚Äù. Asked what our plans where in terms of seeing Marrachesh. We had already booked a camal ride and quad bike session for Saturday(through trip advisor btw was awesome definitely recommend that)  The guest services person at the hotel said why don‚Äôt you book for a spa and Hammam which was ¬£68 for 2 of us. Then he said why don‚Äôt you book for a tour to see the old town medina and see some religious landmarks royal landscapes and etc. Cost us ¬£40 each for the whole day thinking it‚Äôs was a nice way to see Marrachesh and eat in a local Riad with economic food. WRONG!!!!!!! Waste of money!  Best thing don‚Äôt book any extra activities. The spa was good. But the tour waste of money. 4 others couples joined us from other hotels. The hotels used the same tour company. The tour guide was a scam artist. He had no ID badge( unlike the other tour guides seen walking around ) .  We where told food and drink would be included in the price we paid. But nope we were taken on top of a Riad(hotel) to see the M√©dina. We had to pay to see the view. Then the tour guide took us to the medina we went to one carpet museum and then back to medina stoping for lunch( paid for the drinks again). Guess what back to medina again lol. He kept us going round in circles around medina taking us to his friends shops so we would buy there stuff. We all grew anxious we wanted to get out of the dangerous streets people threatening us if we did not buy we would be in trouble. We were followed people forcing us to buy. All because of the tour guide. ( going through scaffolding as well)!!  Told him that this is not what we paid for. We wasted the whole day because of this!!!! We were flying the next morning!!!!!!He said it‚Äôs the hotels fault. He said that the hotel will give us our money back. Instead when I complained the guest service people at the hotel they laughed at us. I got angry and said I need my money back. They then brought the guy who booked the tour for us . Instead of giving our money back he gave us Moroccan oil and spices and said it‚Äôs worth ¬£50. Tbh I was done by that point I took what I got and wanted to get out ASAP. All the people from the tour where from different hotels. Some got there money back and some got a free session of quad bike and camal ride but we got spices!!! Lol lucky us!  The hotel was clean and nice but they are crap. Very poor customer service.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haleemaa2019

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Gemma C wrote a review Jan 2019,10,Shocking service,If I could give 0 stars I would solely for the extremely bad customer service.    We received an email 2 days before your holiday to advice that the Labranda Targa AQUA PARC hotel would not be able to run the slides due to maintenance from 6th January for a period of 15 days.    Obviously we were disappointed as we booked specifically for the water park facilities however they kindly offered the heated indoor pool for free. A few days in we went down to have look and check this was the case the lady in the spa confirmed it was indeed free of charge. After getting changed we were informed we had to pay.    We went to the reception who were extremely unhelpful and just laughed at us. When asking for the manager they refused to call them. We then spoke to someone who looked more senior by the pool area who instead of listening to our issues argued with us and was very rude.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Alexa & Caleb wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Great Place for Winter Sun,We arrived on the 20/12/18 for a ten night stay. The hotel staff (all of them) were very polite and friendly. The place was spotless and the grounds were kept immaculate.The rooms were clean and modern though a little short on storage. We had one of the best holidays for a long time as all our follow guests were friendly and fun so it made for a great Christmas. Having 10 sunny days and getting a sun tan was a bonus. The mornings and evening can get a little chilly but only jumper/ cardigan weather. The food can be a little monotonous but there is plenty to choose from. I personally found lunch the best meal of the day. Marreksh itself is exciting and buzzing around the square. Just keep hold of your valuables and say a polite no and move on if you get a little badgering. Remember to haggle as they charge ridiculous prices go half the original asking price and you are about there. The only complaint I have of the hotel is during the winter months there is not enough inside seating areas and there is a sports bar which was empty the whole time we were there and a great place to sit and chat. However it was out of limits to guests unless they paid for drinks! This is.a real shame as even if It was a paying bar after 11pm they would have guests continuing to socialise. We felt excluded though we were all inclusive paying guests. Would I recommend it though A BIG ABSOLUTELY.....,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexaAstonriss
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Emma W wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Brilliant!,Visited this hotel for a long weekend in January and I was terrified after the reviews. We arrived and had been put in room 1102 which was PHENOMENAL. Amazing spacious room. The weather was amazing. Yes the pool was cold but for the love of God its January its going to be cold! The food is never going to win any Michelin stars and it's not piping hot but its warm and tastes fine. My other half gets an upset stomach walking past some restaurants and he was fine the entire time we were away. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Good selection of cocktails on the all inclusive - which to have cocktails on all inclusive to me is unheard of and was a very pleasant experience. No the spirits aren't branded but all inclusive spirits are NEVER branded. They taste like vodka rum whiskey etc etc. I literally have no idea what people have to complain about in this hotel. Adult pool was quiet and serene. Evening entertainment was just that entertaining. The hotel staff work tirelessly to entertain children and other guests. The one thing I do agree is that there are a lot of wasps. But they're not aggressive and if you swat them away they go away. But I do feel that more could be done to get rid of these. All in all I'm really looking forward to another visit to this hotel and my only complaint is that we didnt stay longer!,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smizzwba
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jill and David Kelly wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Best Christmas present,We booked a short break from the 7th to the 11th January 2019 as a Christmas gift to each other... we didn't need socks and slippers !!    Didn't know what to expect given the very reasonable amount we paid I even told family I was worried it might be very basic.... Well I was wrong.    From the minute we arrived we were met with very helpful staff including the General Manager Jacques Peter who welcomed us and offered to assist with my need for a gluten free diet.    He not only met us again at 7pm but personally introduced me to the Chef who then arranged for me to be advised on the foods I could choose and if needed cook me a fresh meal to suit.    Each day the catering staff ensured I had plenty of choice of the outstanding delicious food.    We enjoyed all aspects of the Hotel including the pool area lounges and bars daily entertainment and the spa it ticked every box.    The General Manager maintains a regular profile in all areas of the Hotel and is greeted warmly by Staff and Hotel Residents.    I feel this hands on approach ensures the standards in the Hotel are high as is Staff morale.    We would not hesitate staying again and would recommend the Hotel to anyone looking for a break in Marrakech.

They only allow ""big taxis"" to drive to the hotel. Cost us 500 Dirham's to get to the hotel so maybe add transfer to your booking. We arrived early to the hotel. Check in is at 3pm and we came at 12pm. Staff were very helpful upon arrival asked us to take a seat gave us all the forms and took the completed forms to reception. As no rooms were available they told us to go have some lunch while we wait. There is not much of a variety when it comes to food. After we ate they let us go to our room they didnt make us wait until check in time they tried to do everything they could to accomodate us. Staff are really nice but sometimes come across pushy. Theres a free shuttle from the hotel to the city which is good to look into as the hotels far out. Theres a disco in the hotel too where the dj and staff are once again amazing. It's our friends birthday so we asked the dj (usama) made our experience really good it's our friends birthday we asked him to get a cake for her as a surprise which he was more than happy to do for us.

We arrived in our hire car the first impression was no one helped us to bring in the luggage but it made up for it with a wonderful welcome from Sana and Ahmed.    They told us to eat our lunch first then check in and looked after our things what a clean and excellent place. Lovely staff food was good our family liked it. The coffee machine was a hit and miss but was fine you can take bottled water.    We were given a lovely room with a balcony big double bed and two singles plenty of clothes space good tv. Excellent bedding. Was no extra blankets so had to ask for one it went cold at night. Our balcony looked out near the quite pool and Olive trees.    The lady cleaned our room every day she was wonderful.    The resort is in a very private complex nothing is near if you like to wonder out you have to have transport as the hotel provides (can‚Äôt comment as we didn‚Äôt use).    Evening dinner is lovely the waiting staff are very attentive as for breakfast it‚Äôs different staff and sometimes I had to help my self with cutlery as the girls were always chit chatting. Breakfast was lovely eggs pancakes juices smoothies and herb water was lovely as I‚Äôm into that.    Can‚Äôt comment on the pool and drinks and the animation team as we went out all the time.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Shellwigan wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Good hotel get what you pay for.,We spent a week at this hotel just after New Year. We only paid ¬£950 for hotel and flights for family of four all inclusive so got a very cheap deal. We arrived around 8pm and the check in was quick and we got our bags sent to our room. Don‚Äôt forget you have to pay a city tax which was about ¬£40.    Room- We stayed in a family studio which had ample room for a family of four it had a double bed and two singles kits of storage and and a balancing wth a small table and chairs. We were right next to the main pool so we were in a good location. The room was cleaned daily and you got fresh towels. In the room is a small fridge and a safe which was free to use.    Pools - There were two large pools and a small kids pool along with a four slides. There is an adults only pool. Due to the time of year the pool water was freezing but our kids didn‚Äôt mind and enjoying playing on the slides. In the main pool area there is a volley ball court football and tennis pitch. There are two table tennis tables. You just request the equipment for the staff near the pool. The kids club was available most days and our children enjoyed colouring activities and face painting.    Spa - There is a spa on site but we did not use it. We did go for a look and it seemed really nice. There is a small pool in there but you have to pay to use it.    Food - you could eat in the main restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner. There are snacks at the pool mid afternoon. For breakfast there is a range of cold meats and cheeses. A selection of breads and a toaster which is hopeless. You can get omelettes main to order. Due to time of year we didn‚Äôt really queue but I can imagine in summer the queues would be horrendous. For lunch and dinner is was very similar. Chips rice pasta and pizza most of the time. If there were chips for lunch then it was rice and pasta at dinner and vice verse. There was lots of fish and meats in different sauces. Some days at lunch they put the BBQ on and they had burgers chicken kebabs and grilled fish. Food was good and we always found something to eat. There is no kids section at the buffet restaurant so don‚Äôt be expecting chicken nuggets fish fingers etc. We weren‚Äôt bothered by this but some families with young fussy children may struggle. Drinks could be got at the bar by the pool during the day and at night in the main entertainment room. You could get a range of cocktails and local brands of beer vodka rum and gin. Along with soft drinks and wine. You could only get wine or soft drinks in the restaurant.    Grounds- the hotel grounds are lovely and well maintained. The hotel is quite far away from anywhere so you can‚Äôt just have a walk out.    The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the old and new town you just have to book on it 24 hours before. We went to the new town which was about 15 minutes away. There are a range of shops and cafes for you to go to. We only went for a few hours as we didn‚Äôt really want to shop. We didn‚Äôt go to the old town but met a number of people who did and they said it was worth the visit but could be very intimidating with children and that it was extremely busy and had very narrow streets. The locals have snakes and monkeys for you to have your picture with.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shellwigan
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Hipposunday wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Loved it - need to pack warm clothes for this time of year!,I have just returned after a lovely stay in this hotel. The staff were helpful and friendly. The food was lovely - I have seen the comments about poor food variety - but for me it was about controlling what I ate. If you ate everything on offer every meal then the food was the same but if you disciplined yourself to have say soup and fish courses one night and salad and veggie courses another then there was plenty of variety! Some people just took everything every meal! And lots wasted food they took.  The rooms gardens and pools were very clean. However be warned it's winter in Morocco too! The temperature overnight and before mid morning is COLD! Hence the pools were freezing! I did brave two lengths but the pain of the cold forced me out - so don't expect top reap the benefits of the 5 pools at this time of year. Take more warm clothes than summer clothes and layer up.  We felt safe in the market and used the excellent hotel free minibus. We did a tour to two gardens but I didnt feel it was value for money and we could have done it ourselves cheaper. Things were very cheap in the town to buy and in the cafes.  At the hotel we went into the paying bar a couple of evenings for a more 'adult' bar environment. The downside was that people smoked in the bar and I found that difficult to put up with. It would be better if it was no smoking - we would have stayed for more than one drink.  I have seen comments about the room service - tip is to put the please clean my room card out. They do have an odd process for cleaning - they do some things and come back later to do towels etc. If your room is half done midday put the card out again.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Leanne wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Amazing Dec/Jan winter sun NYE holiday,We have just got home today from a weeks holiday. Two adults two children. I was apprehensive reading some of the reviews but honestly we had the best time! The hotel is immaculate clean and well kept. Our family room was modern exceptionally cleaned every day with fresh towels and linen and had the most amazing view of the Atlas Mountains from our balcony! The staff were super attentive and friendly. The food was plentiful and lots to choose from and so were the cocktails! The weather was lovely. Chilly early mornings and evenings but a perfect 70 temperature in the lazy afternoons. There was lots of activities for children and adults of all ages. The evening entertainment could have been more varied but as we met such good compony it didn‚Äôt seem to matter to us really. The staff went all out on NYE with a wait on service and entertainment but unfortunately the food was served late and people were getting hungry. I believed this to be down to a chef/staff issue however most people were in good spirits by then and either went to eat in the main restaurant or just persevered! A trip to the medina and souks via the free hotel shuttle bus is a must it really is an experience! This hotel is amazing for a 4 star and for what you pay value and Marrakech is amazing too! Go try for yourself! One thing to note is that the airport is super security check wise so expect alot of passport checking and waiting including completing a visa form on arrival and departure so allow plenty of time. Personally I‚Äôd rather a hyper secure airport so it didn‚Äôt bother me but it did others. You change money on arrival at the airport and this was simple too. At the souks and medina be careful of the locals trying to escort you around for money. Simply ignore and navigate your own way around unless you prefer an organised guide which thecgotel can organise for you. Overall a brilliant holiday we will definitely go back! üá≤üá¶‚ù§Ô∏è,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coustravels
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,jplummer93 wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Perfect spot for winter sun.,"Hi all. Me and my girlfriend stayed here both 25 from the 16th-21st of December here is my review:    WEATHER:  The weather was AWESOME I was a little worried but it was at least 23¬∞C every day. Swimming shorts all day. Jeans and a hoody in the evenings as it was cool.    FOOD:  This is a big thing for me. I am vegan and my girlfriend is vegetarian so I was a little worried about the food but was just hoping for the best. I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Breakfast - for me it wasn't very good I had to resort to eating croissants (I know butter) but there literally wasn't anything else I could have apart from fruit. If you're looking for a full English then you're going to be very disappointed there was an egg station I think.  Lunch - fantastic always had two plates full. The majority of the food there was vegetarian it seemed lots of vegetable dishes soups bread pasta (no allergen labels though).  Dinner - not as good as lunch but similar options (always the standard stuff). I never went hungry.  Snacks - awful small table of food (sandwiches). I couldn't eat any of it anyway.    This was the first all inclusive resort I've been to since going vegan and there was significantly less overall choice compared to other places I've been to I can see why others aren't happy. There doesn't actually seem to be enough space to have more food. If I ate meat I think I would have been disappointed with the food. I remember looking round thinking there's not many meat dishes. I ate wonderfully though! **Eat less meat anyway it's good for you**. Oh there is a pizza station I don't know why people are saying you only get one slice we went up there and I asked for a pizza without cheese just veg and tomato he did me a massive one was amazing and just walked off with it we had two over the holiday!    ROOM:  Room was lovely what you'd expect from a 3/4 star. Well kept and towels/bedding changed daily. The shower was a large walk in one and it was incredible! Easily the best shower I've had abroad. Heating also worked for the evenings by adjusting the dial on the wall. There was a safe which we used.    SERVICE:  Great can't complain no issues at all. Oh when we arrived we had to pay a city tax this pissed me off as no one through booking or reading reviews had told me this. It was something like ¬£15 I can't remember now. We were also asked to attend a welcome meeting on the first night which we just didn't bother going to I knew we'd just sit there for an hour being sold excursions when we just wanted to go to the bar. When we left I was able to email my boarding passes to reception and they printed them off for me! Really happy with that.    ALSO on I think our 3rd night a couple we met leant us their playing cards but my girlfriend misplaced them. On the welcome brochure it says the shop is open til 11pm. This is wrong it's only open til 6pm so we wasn't able to get any cards. However as we were sitting in the bar a man came round to each table introducing himself as the hotel manager asking about our stay and if we were having a good time. We said yes thank you but we've lost our cards! He said ""give me one minute"" and came back with a deck of cards for us that we could keep what a legend! I think his name was Jacques.    ENTERTAINMENT:  The animation staff (Hanna & co) do a great job. They tried to get people up during the day for activities but didn't have much luck due to lack of people or with it being December people just wanted to relax. There was music on round the pool (repetitive but fine). There were shows most nights a dance show a Moroccan drum show a comedy one (which I got roped onto the stage for) and a quiz night. All were very good especially the drum show we were all hammered and all got up dancing with half the hotel and the reps was great fun.    LOCATION:  The hotel is in the middle of nowhere. Took about 25 minutes from the airport. We did get the free shuttle to the Marrakech souks. This was easy to book at reception. Upon getting off the bus we were greeted by guides we ignored them and walked into town to take some pictures where there was another guide. I thought yeah why not lets go with him and to be fair he took us lots of places we wouldn't have seen. He did however take us into his mates carpet shop and I ended up buying a carpet for ¬£45 I didn't bloody want (seemed no way to say no he wanted ¬£500) but oh well. He then took us to the main market and we saw the snake charmers and monkeys (this is disgusting DO NOT go near them) we thought na lets just go back to the bus. Be careful though cause a couple we met said they put the snakes round your neck when you're not looking and won't take it off until you've paid to take a picture with it on. Marrakech town is horrible really I'd only see it once. Egypt/Turkey are fine but this is another level in the summer it must be awful. I gave the guide ¬£5 at the end and he was more than worth the money (minus the carpet).    POOL  The pool area was always clean the pool itself was freezing the only time we went in were forfeits for losing the card/drinking games. The slides were great also! One thing I can't believe no one is mentioning is the wasps or honey bees. They were EVERYWHERE this is the one major fault of the resort. You never felt that they were going to sting you but if you had a drink around the pool (especially lemonade) they would surround you. They were very annoying.    GYM  We had planned to use the gym most days only used it once. There are two treadmills (good ones) and some exercises bikes. Some free weights would have been perfect. Collect the key from reception.    BARS  There was a pool bar (matey was trying to serve whilst surrounded my bees) a cosy bar which had 3 big screens which was always showing the football (happy days) and sports bar which had one huge screen but was always empty as you had to pay. They all closed at 11pm which was really annoying so a couple of nights we ended up in the sisha bar (next to the shop) which was great you had to pay but it closed at 1. Standard spirits vodka whiskey rum etc. Rose red and white wine. Lager was Stork and was always out of a bottle not tap. It was lovely! Nice light lager.    Hope this little (large) review helps. We met two 3 amazing young couples and had a fantastic holiday. (Give the reps a pay rise).",Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"King's Lynn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jplummer93

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Lisa D wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Christmas 2018,I visited this Christmas for one week with my son and daughter. We really enjoyed our stay and had a fabulous time. The hotel grounds are well kept the rooms are a good size and spotlessly clean. The Animation team are excellent they all work really hard as do the bar restaurant and cleaning staff.    The pools are lovely and clean but cold the hotel could do with one heated. To be fair I went on the slides several times and the cold water was tolerable but not for swimming.    The shuttle bus service from hotel into city was excellent. Marrakesh is a great city and the Souk was a great experience especially in the evening. We also ventured up the Atlas Mountains which we thoroughly enjoyed booked through hotel and the price was pretty reasonable.    The Christmas Eve Gala dinner was good fun and thoroughly enjoyed.    The reason for giving 4 stars was the food was bland and limited. But I understand it is massed produced for many different nationalities. One night meat loaf was labelled roast beef? The drinks available are also limited though the red and white wine and Stork beer are all ok and drinkable.    A great point is that the hotel attracts many different nationalities which is great if you get chatting opens your mind we met a lovely German couple.    Finally we met several other families and decided to have a night out at The Souk together so we asked the lady on reception to recommend a reasonable priced restaurant which she did and she also offered to book it for us (14 people) However when we arrived at the recommended restaurant it was very expensive cheapest main course around ¬£22 cheapest drink around ¬£8. We had 6 children with us so it did not make sense to pay that much so we had to move on. I had eaten at a different restaurant in The Souk a couple of days earlier and paid only ¬£25 for 3 Excellent Tagine main courses and 3 drinks.    Overall I had a great time and would return.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ian G wrote a review Dec 2018,40,There's a great hotel here trying to get out,We spent a week here in December we got a cheap price and were not expecting a lot but just went for a week of sun before christmas. We actually got much more than we were expecting in most cases.  The hotel is a pleasant modern building set in extensive beautiful grounds which are well kept and the rooms are dotted about the grounds in what are referred to as pavilions.  We arrived and were taken to a large attractive room on the ground floor which turned out to be very comfortable and clean with a good bathroom and a separate wet room containing probably one of the best hotel showers we have ever experienced - plenty of hot water which never varied throughout the week.  The room was one the ground floor which gave us a nice private terrace with table and chairs and not overlooked with a pleasant view of the grounds - well pleased so far.  We were not expecting good food at the price we paid and it certainly lived up to our expectations in this respect !  In fact the food is the one thing that lets it down - All buffet style with rows of heated containers (some pretending to be tagines which they were not) and as you lifted the lid of each you were greeted by (in the main) an unappetising mess. In fact most of the food ranged from just acceptable to stuff that I wouldn't feed to my dog.  It also suffered from the two evils of most buffet restaurants - lukewarm food which was cold by the time you get it back to your table and non-replenishment of food when eaten (so first come first served).  However not all bad - we never once failed to get a table as soon as we arrived so well done to the staff who cleared and set up tables very quickly the bread and rolls were plentiful and always good soup mostly ok and on one evening they produced a really tasty lasagnia proving that they could produce good food when they tried.  Don't think either that you can rely on the pizza kitchen to get you out of trouble - it only serves slices never whole pizzas and the chef is only allowed to use one topping per pizza (or so he claimed) so the result is cold and tastless.  Our best meal of the week was lunch in a chinese in Marrakech town.  All-inclusive drinks were limited to 4 spirits (locally made) - white rum whiskey gin and vodka. Ok if your only wish is to get and remain drunk as quickly as possible (which seemed to be the ambition of most of the Brits there) but the local wine seemed quite drinkable and was freely available.  The animation team seemed to have very little to do but just poseand walk around chatting but they seemed pleasant enough and I can see that in the summer with the pool in use they would produce a lot of fun activity.  The hotel is quite isolated so popping down the road for a drink or a meal is not possible - they do however offer free shuttles to Marrakeck town and the old town.  Wi-fi in public areas was easy to use and quite fast.  We had great weather all week and were able to sit in warm sun all day which after all was what we came for - cold at night though so bring a jumper.  So to precis the hotel experience  If you have a young familycome here there's plenty of facilities for the kids and you'll all have a great time.  If you hate holidaying surrounded by screaming kids or like fine dining best pick another hotel.  But lets not be churlish about it we had a great weeks holiday in a good hotel with lovely grounds and glorious weather for a very reasonable price - we were well pleased. Just a shame about the food.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ian_gadsby
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Gabriella wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Lovely hotel,A fair review of our experience we stayed here 20th-27th December. We absolutely loved our time here and exploring Morocco the free shuttle bus is great but needed as the hotel is alittle far out of the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh but me and my partner didn't mind it takes 20mins maximum to get to the old or new town and picks you up where your dropped off. The hotel is gorgeous very well looked after by maintaince The spa was very relaxing apart from the Jacuzzi room full of mould and broken light hanging from wall the entertainment staff are great fun and the restaurant staff work very hard! The reviews about this hotels food we don't feel are very fair the food is hot but some people forget to close lids and that causes the food to cool the selection isnt huge but there is a different variety of warm and cold food one thing is for certain the food was always fresh and the staff are friendly and work hard. Evening entertainment was fantastic very talented guys me and my partner both enjoyed listening to his singing and saxophone. Our room was big and shower/toilet very clean the shower was one of the best pressure showers ive used. On our last couple days my partner lost his driving I.d card and when asked reception if it was handed in the lady very dismissively told him no nothing had been handed in without looking or asking for his name so a couple hours later when somebody different was at reception he asked again and when they looked it was found we thought the first lady at reception was very rude.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jennifer A wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Fantastic week away but room for a lot of improvement,Myself my partner and 1 year old daughter stayed from 12th-17th december. We did have a lovely time away but like I said there is much room for improvement. Anyone wondering if the weather is good in marrakech in december id say apart from 2 cloudy days every other day was around the 25 mark which was perfect for us.  I think the thing that made the stay most enjoyable was the hotel staff abd their hospitality. They made us feel so very welcome and each and every one of them adpred my little girl and played with her.  I think the main disappoinment it ddoes have to be said is the food!! Breakfast and snacks are hands down the worst ive ever experienced in an all inclusive the best thing about breakfast is the omlette but be prepared to wait in line for some time to get one. I was also so so disappointed there was no ice cream available I know it sounds stupid something so minor but I've never been to an all inclusive without any available before.  The entertainment is poor and definitely could definitely do with livening up but the entertainment people are all fantastic and make all the effort in the world with your children. I wouldve liked a proper kids club with some childrens music i do understand its quiet season and not as many children but there will still a number there and shpuldve been catered too.  The room was fantastic and cleaned every day. the hotel was clean abd well maintained however the childs play area has much room for improvement and the slides etc are very outdated.  All in all lovely friendly people who will look after you and i would recommend to any one to visit just like i said there is definite room for improvement.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferaN9812NA

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Trip522404 wrote a review Dec 2018,10,Holiday from hell,Firstly my friends and I got to the hotel and was welcomed with both rooms apparently not ready (at 14:00!). During the wait we were told to go and have something to eat in the careen. The food was cold and when seated the waiter took about 20 minutes to bringing our drinks. Also they seem to take your plate away without asking if you had finished yet. Anyway after lunch we returned to see the hotel rep who proceeded to bombard us with excursion after excursion even though we told him we had not changed our currency over yet he was so persistent that he said pay by card we refused and he started being rude. (Apparently this seems to be what they tell the guests as they come to the hotel as everyone we spoke to said that there rooms wasn‚Äôt ready and that they too were given the good sale for their excursions!). We finally went to our rooms which we we‚Äôre told had balconies but did not see this when we entered the rooms (this place is a joke). Their are no daytime activities for guests and the outdoor pool was to cold to use but we did use the indoor pool for ¬£8 that is. Please please please if you do go to this hotel look around for others offering deals for activities such as camel riding quad biking etc as we found a company charging half the price of the hotel ¬£35 for picking us up waiting while we did the camel ride and quad biking while the hotel wanted to charge us ¬£80 each!!  The drinks in the hotel also seemed to be watered down and many times they ignored us when we went up to the bar for drinks.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trip522404

Maids keep the rooms clean and provide fresh towels everyday. Comfortable beds and power shower. Lobby has plenty of large sofas. Reception staff are friendly and helpful. It's in the middle of nowhere but there is an excellent shuttle service - just remember to book in advance. 20 minutes to the old city. Pools looked fantastic but too cold to venture into in December. Restaurant staff also very efficient and friendly.  The biggest problem is the restaurant management - seem incapable of providing a decent variety of sufficient food for guests. Regardless of the number of guests there was only ever one guy making omelettes - even when they had a sales conference with 200+ delegates there was only one guy making omelettes.  In summary yes its all-inclusive but the bland food runs out very quickly and the management take ages to refill it. Other than set meal times it's not possible to get a snack anywhere in the resort grounds. Hygiene is also a bit hit and miss as some serving staff feel confident using there un-gloved hands to serve food.

On arrival I was checked in straight away and was given a room on the ground floor looking towards the pools The rooms are quite large and the hotel is very well kept and staff are very friendly. The pool areas and gardens are superb. However the food was something other. It was either warm or cold. I even tried going in as the restaurant opened so that all the food was fresh and hot not so most of it was as stated either warm or cold. On two occasions I complained to staff and even asked to see the restaurant manager after waiting 5 minutes know body came so I left On my second day I was so fed up with the situation in the restaurant that I went and asked reception if I could speak the the General Manager. After a short while I met the very man whose name is Jaques Peter a very nice person. I explained the situation and he apologized and said he would speak to the chefs. On my last day and after meeting with him I went to the restaurant on it opening time of 12.30pm and as I passed through receptionthe General Manager was there and said "" Hello Jeff I hope the food is hot for you but if not there is a microwave there to heat it up"" I thought he was kidding but he wasn't. The food was as it had been for the length of my stay. On my last day he sent me a plate of fruit and cakes wrapped in cellophane which I presumed was a thank you gift.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jessica W wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Two girls in their 20s. 1 week Dec 18.,Myself and my friend who are both 27 have just got back from our week stay here. We stayed from the 4th-11th December 2018. The weather was okay it varied from 16 to 20 degrees till around 12pm then was between 22 and 27 till around 5pm then cooled back down again in the evening.  The hotel is lovely the rooms are spacious and get cleaned and new towels provided everyday. We were staying on the second floor in room 1234. We had a very spacious room and it was lovely. We did have some noisy neighbours however that was only on one or two of our nights. People dragging chairs in the restaurant or downstairs early hours of the morning was a bug bare.  The hotel food is good however more options of meat would be a bonus as myself who is allergic to sea food I was struggling some days and was living mainly off carbs such as rice bread and pizza.  Alcohol choices are limited; Vodka Gin Whisky Brandy Wine Beer. So if you're not a big spirit or wine drinker bring your own Malibu/ Archies/ Ameretto from the airport like I did :)  The all inclusive is good you have breakfast till 10:30 lunch from 12:30 snacks at 3:00pm-5:00pm and then dinner from 7:30pm. The only downside I would say is there is no ice cream on the all inclusive and you have to buy this from the hotel shop and their variety is very limited.  There is 5 swimming pools all of which are FREEZING. Heated pools would be a bonus especially in the cooler time of year. There is 4 water slides and one in the child's pool.  The animation team were friendly some more than others but all helpful if asked. Between them they also speak a wide range of languages.  Changing your currency: Well we was told prior to departing we could only get the Moroccan dirham once arrived so we brought English cash to change. We got to the hotel and it took us 4 days to get our money changed as reception staff were very unhelpful and kept telling us 'It's closed at the moment can you come back'. One of the hotel managers ended up converting it on his phone and giving it me out of his own pocket after I complained. So top tip: change your money at the airport.  We did not leave the hotel for the full week due to horror stories we were told about it not being safe for young girls on their own (told to us by not only other holiday makers but also some staff) which obviously then made it hard for us to do anything with us being alone as two girls. We were told the Old City is mainly cultural things such as markets and etc and can be a little hectic with moped's and motorbikes. It is also advised that you don't go into the square unless you actually want to buy something as it can be hard to get back out not just from being pestered but also finding your way out! We were also told that the New City is where the majority of the restaurants and things are such as shops and etc. This is where the locals tend to go for nights out and etc. too such as bars and more English places. I've been told there is a McDonalds and a Hard rock here (Can't confirm). I would just recommend researching your trips and speaking to as many people as possible for recommendations.  We got speaking to a group of men from Bradford who managed to leave the hotel most days and said they had a good time at quad biking and also at a club however they did mention the club was expensive to get in and get a table! They also mentioned their English money was stolen from their safe in their room around the time the cleaners were in the room. This is known due to the time they left the room and the cleaner entering and the safe logs entries to reception. Was hard for them to report everything to the police due to the language barrier of them only speaking Arabic & French and very little English. They told me they have ended up having to claim it back on the holiday insurance.  The hotel Wi-Fi works throughout the hotel rooms and pool area however obviously some places such as the far pool can be slower. It is also free! they will give you the log in details on arrival.

But shocking food and cleaning/room service staff",I recently visit labranda targa on the 27th November on my family holiday as the week start it seemed to be a amazing holiday and the animation team got to know us we was dealing with a great team. Hanna is amazing and fantastic with the kids esp our lil one. As a couple of days in went by I realise things where happening as my safe was open when I walked in this I just took a blind eye to and thought it was me the next day I asked my girlfriend where her ear rings I bought her when we 1st got together was as I put the on the sink in the bathroom in some tissue as I returned to the bathroom I realise and so did my girlfriend that the tissue was there and the ear ring where missing. I didn‚Äôt say anything as you can‚Äôt just blame a person it couldn‚Äôt be. On our 4th day in we visited the old town market and arrive back to the room to notice their was a phone on charge with my charger that wasn‚Äôt ours. I then received the knock on the door to be presented with the room maid disconnecting her phone from the charger. I address the reception who was then on the phone I returned to the deck about 30 mins later to be approached by one of the managers who addressed that I had to sack this women ( I did not do that as this women may have a family to feed) she was presented with a warning.  The food seem good at the time and was happy eating fresh but since being home on the 4th on December us as a family have lost over 400 pound due to child care and wage with what seem to be Diarrhea as I‚Äôm aware friends of our have been in hospital with is food poisoning from the hotel.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Anon wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Review of Marrakesh Labranda Parc,The hotel and staff were exceptionally kind and went beyond the scope of their job even going as far as sharing food with me in the middle of the night.m after the restaurant had closed. Everyone was kind. I‚Äôd recommend for a nice break even for families with children or just friends. The food was good and had a good variety while also providing a nice salad course with every meal. There was a bit of limitations on what drinks are available with juice only available during breakfast but that didn‚Äôt prove to be a problem with the bar open late nightly. The entertainment was good and engaging. While it was difficult to get certain points across as a non-French speaker it was still useful and staff remained long for the entire trip. The room was comfortable and the layout of the hotel was quite nice. Meeting fellow residents was also good. For younger guests there is a club nearby and even though the hotel bar closes at 11 drinks are still served past then for paying customers. With numerous excursions available there‚Äôs never anything lacking to do and the slides are amazing. Mall is also within walking distance. The WiFi is both good and bad.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,influence20182018 wrote a review Dec 2018,10,Stolen Property by Security Officer,Stayed with my partner at this hotel in November 2018. From the car to the hotel there is around a 10 foot walk. I was on my last day before leaving when I left my partner at the door of the hotel whilst I went into the city. After saying goodbye I then looked at my mobile phone to check messages as I was using the lobby wifi.  (I was standing outside the hotel) I then turned and walked towards my car (10 feet away) which is covered by CCTV. I then got into my car and realized that I must have just dropped my phone as I was wearing shorts that were opened pocketed. I went on my journey as I thought maybe it fell out of my pocket into the car. This was not the case as I will explain. The same Security Officer (tall bald man) who was begging from me on the previous day was still there. He was very interested in my movements. He looked in my opinion to be very nervous. As a person who works heavily in the security business I am aware of body language nervous speech deceit and cover-ups. He looked guilty as hell. I asked the hotel manager if I could access the cctv. I was told to come back later which I did. I was then twice asked to to come back later. On my last attempt I then demanded to see the images of my walk from outside the lobby to my car. The Head of Security was being very vague and standoffish. I demanded to speak to the manager. She came after 45 minutes and asked me to come back in half an hour. I did. She then took me into a room and said 'oh is it this phone.(lets just remember that nothing hand been handed into lost property and no description had been given of the phone) Somebody has just handed it in'. She then left pretty quickly....  Now I know that the Security Officer stole the phone and was seen by the manager on the cctv picking it up and placing it in his pocket. To limit damage as I was refusing to let it drop the only thing they could do was to get it back off him and hand it back to me. Had I not have been aware of my right to cctv (which they refused to let me see) I would have been told to go away. Sad thing is that the previous day this guy was begging me for money. I never gave any as I could see there was something odd about his character but I did comfort him in talking about the privileges that he does have over some of the Moroccan population who have nothing and live in pure poverty. Such a shame as this completely wrecked my holiday which was a surprise for my partner on her birthday. Not Good Hotel Labranda. (I will add a picture of the guy who stole my phone. Hopefully the hotel will deal with this matter accordingly!!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/influence20182018

I mean they were amazing at their job üëèüèæüëèüèæ Especially KEZ & HANNA! My daughter loved them.    In terms of the hotel it‚Äôs beautiful but staff not so much that! Reception staff lack customer service. Whilst I was there I made two complaints to the reception regarding my room in which none were attended to.  When I would call reception to speak to someone I would be calling for ages and when someone finally picked up it would be a rude non English speaking male who could not help me as he didn‚Äôt understand what I was saying.  No kettle in rooms even though I specially requested for one as I would be coming with an infant.  Bar staff were okay cleanliness of drinking cups not great!  House keeping worked half hearted there was always something missing like not replacing hand towels etc.  Food was okay but bland at times so constantly adding salt to food. I feel they don‚Äôt cater for children/infants which meant my daughter did not eat for the 7nights we were there as the food was too rich for her.  Overall my stay was okay but not sure about returning especially with an infant.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374cillad

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Shak-Clare wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Winter Sun,The hotel is about 5-7 miles outside Marrakesh centre. The hotel put on two separate shuttle buses. One takes you to the old city and the other to the new city. These run every couple of hours and are very reliable. You have to book In Advance as they can only seat about 20 people. I can imagine this would be a problem in peak season.    Reception are helpful. Housekeeping is fantastic. The rooms are more than adequate and the bed was comfortable. The restaurant is clean but they will not be winning any prizes for their food...it is food and okay I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs nice.    The evening entertainment consists of a small bar which hosted karaoke one night and a mediocre singer another.    Overall the hotel is good in terms of cleanliness and service. Drops a couple of points for lack of imagination for food and evening entertainment    I was concerned about the sliding windows in the rooms. It was only three foot from the floor and the entire window slid open. I went with friends so it wasn‚Äôt an issue however I would be very cautious if I went with children as it‚Äôs quite a drop from there and an easily accessible window for young children.

After a tiresome trip through the airport we arrived about midday all looked good children were excited by the extensive waterpark.  Reception proved to be a nightmare resulting in everyone in the wrong rooms. We had to sort it out next day ourselves.    The food was good something for everyone even Ryan the fussiest eater in the world.    The water park was outstanding the children spent hours in there. NOTE the water was totally unheated and quite cold.    The staff in the bars and restaurant were outstanding nothing to much trouble.    The rooms were comfortable and clean and well prepared daily.  The maintainance was a bit amateurish. The window in the bathroom door was held in by two self taping screws plus we had no hot water for about three days (reported via reception never managed to get it fixed.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Dona J wrote a review Nov 2018,20,Not a 4* experience,My friend and I arrived very late (2.5 hours wait in immigration) at the hotel for a 5 night all inclusive break. The room we were allocated did not have the twin rooms that I had paid EXTRA for. By the time we got another twin room it was past 11pm. The hotel had left a plate of salad and cheese with a bread roll for supper in the first room which we had to go and get as the staff by this point had all left. In addition the receptionist did not mention at check in that the all inclusive bar closed at 11pm. We could not even get a cup of tea without having to pay for it. The receptionist was very unhelpful and surley at my request that we should be given some soft drinks from the other bar. Our request was denied.  The bar staff in the 'Cosey bar' were in the main uninterested and on a few occasions rude.  The hotel is looking tired and is in need of a makeover. The rooms are basic without any extras like tea/coffee making facilities.  The food was plentiful but same almost every day. The waiting staff in the dining area are more concerned about serving alcohol to the non all inclusive guests than in dealing with us.  The entertainment staff are very committed and did a good job.  The hotel transport to the city is good and always on time.

After a long journey we arrived at the hotel around midday to be told we can't check in until 2. I asked to pay extra to check in early as we was shattered was told no. We asked if there was somewhere to change and was directed to a dirty room where people left cases. We decided not to.    Wi-Fi may be free but it's rubbish. We stayed in room 4011 and we didn't get Wi-Fi in our room or around the pool. You had to sit in reception area to use it. So this is where a lot of people spent their time.    My room had no kettle or microwave apparently other rooms did. We had a tiny fridge that never shut. We had one double bed and a sofa that my son had to sleep on. Beds and sofa were solid woke every day with bad back.  The cleaners used to take the towels out and forget to replace them so we was forever ringing reception to ask for towels the same happened with our bed sheets also.  The tv had 2 English channels that repeated rubbish films over and over. The picture quality was terrible extremely fuzzy all the time and when it rained it didn't work.    The pool area is dirty full of wasps and the pool was like ice. Never felt a pool so cold.    Whenever we tried to book a bus into the town we was told they were fully booked we never got to go in the end. The reception staff were so unhelpful and made it clear they didn't want to help. I asked to order a taxi I had to wait 20 minutes to speak to the only man there that can order the taxis and then he told me we had to wait an hour for the taxi.    The food was basic. Not much to say about it. Was a bit hit and miss. The breakfast was the best part. Considering we went October the dining room was packed under staffed and tables were never set or cleaned.  No one wanted to help. We was told not to sit in a certain section of the restaurant but the waiter kept letting others sit there. Was a bit of a shambles.  The staff in the shop are rude. Constantly on their phones and made me feel awkward to ask for help.    We had a dead bird outside on our patio for 3 days...we asked on the first day to get it removed took 3 days!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,mrsbrown1987 wrote a review Oct 2018,30,"Very Average, Nothing Special!",We have arrived back after staying for five nights at the Labranda Aqua Fun. First of all the weather wasn‚Äôt on our side so that did dampen it for us slightly (excuse the pun!) The hotel itself is what we described as just average. The water park onsite was good great for kids although we did suffer from some particular lifeguards on the slides not allowing our son on even though he hit the height of 120cm which was frustrating. Some it was fine with and some not because he wasn‚Äôt ten (he‚Äôs six) but it didn‚Äôt state the age anywhere just the height which he stood against and was suitable.    The hotel itself is very clean. We had fresh towels daily and room cleaned.  The food was basic. I‚Äôm sick of rice now I‚Äôm home! Seemed to be the same food every day in just a slightly different sauce or something. We got bored of it quickly. There is one main restaurant only and one snack bar which serves the same food as the main restaurant but only between 3-5pm. The ice cream was disappointing only available between 3-5pm one or maybe two flavours and served in a flimsy plastic drinking cup.  The all inclusive drinks were poor. There was just four cocktail choices with a splash of alcohol my favourite mojito included (I‚Äôm now sick of) one type of beer or wine that tasted awful. The only spirits available are what is used in the cocktails gin vodka or whisky. Not branded (which is fine) but that is all. All served in flimsy plastic cups. Soft drinks available are coke fizzy orange 7-up or juices via a machine. Also hot drinks via a machine. Being in the resort all day and night the drinks again got very boring very quickly. I understand it‚Äôs not their culture to drink but it is in resorts for tourists so expected better with the start rating of the hotel.    The staff in the restaurants were lovely and helped our son when he threw up all over the dinner hall one morning at breakfast!    We were unable to get into our room three times in two days each time having to wait for maintenance to change batteries. By the third time I was really annoyed and had no faith every time I got back to our room whether we would actually be able to get in. I complained the reception on the third occasion to be greeted by a laugh from one of the gentleman which infuriated me.    The animation team were great always trying to pick everyone up which must have been really hard for them when it rained for days.    We went into Marrakesh using the hotel shuttle which was good for free. Although Marrakesh is chaos. We got hassled massively and it was stressful especially in the middle of a big thunderstorm too! We‚Äôre pleased we went to experience Marrakesh Old Town the M√©dina and the souks but I wouldn‚Äôt fancy going again.    I‚Äôm suffering from Norovirus for the first time ever after returning home yesterday not confirmed what from but possibly from my trip.    This hotel is supposed to be a 4/5 star but it‚Äôs more like a 3 star for sure.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,BlackpoolNikki wrote a review Oct 2018,40,A great cheap getaway,Maybe I had low expectations but I just don‚Äôt understand these people saying it‚Äôs 1-2* and to avoid the place.    I am here on my last day it‚Äôs thundering (not hotels fault!) so thought I‚Äôd share my review while I have the time.    I have travelled as a single mum with a 14yo and 4yo and have had a lovely time especially for what we paid (around ¬£850 for three people for a week all inclusive in half term) I have never felt at all unsafe as a single woman travelling with kids everyone has been very friendly.    I stayed at the Labranda Aqua Fun (sister hotel) last year and have enjoyed it here more even though this one is cheaper. The Aqua Fun is much bigger and of course the pools and slides are better there but the food and hospitality are much better here.    The best bits...    * Animation team. These guys work tirelessly speak like 7 languages never seem in a bad mood and always upbeat. If you don‚Äôt want to take part they aren‚Äôt at all pushy.    * Kids club. My 4yo son cried when I picked him up! It is open 10-12.30 and 2.30-5.30 every day except Sunday and they have their own hut with a sand pit and pool. They do face painting and games and the kids love it. The girls are natural with children and you can tell they love their jobs. They‚Äôre a credit to the hotel.    * Bar staff. Despite being understaffed and having queues of 15 people sometimes they always remembered what I drink. They would say ‚Äúred wine or G&T today?‚Äù How do they remember that when there‚Äôs so many guests?! They are friendly and work tirelessly - big shout out to mehdi who is also a credit to the hotel. Management - dont let him get away!    * Food. Other people have said it‚Äôs awful I can only assume those people live off chips at home. Every meal had chicken fish pasta pizza a huge salad bar with capers olives peppers carrot beets.... literally everything. The bread is fresh and just beautiful. Yes it does get a little repetitive but what all inclusive doesn‚Äôt? Some people have said they‚Äôve been sick - if this is true I am sure it wasn‚Äôt from the food. The manager was always present always changing spoons the staff wore gloves which I saw them change frequently so they are practicing safe food handling because I‚Äôve seen it. It isn‚Äôt the fault of the hotel if people touch the serving spoons after going to the loo without washing their hands and then you touch the spoon and then pick up your bread. Take antibac handwash and just use it after you‚Äôve handled the the communal serving spoons and you won‚Äôt get sick.    The bad bits....    * The shower was always cold between 6-8pm. That annoyed me as I‚Äôm a woman with long hair and kind of wanted to wash it and condition it not do a mad dash in and out every day.    *The pizza station. For the love of God management if you are reading this please plan this better. Pre-roll your bases and stack them get an assistant use your fastest worker - do something to get those pizzas out a bit quicker! The woman rolling them has one speed setting and that‚Äôs slow slow slow. Queues of 6-7-8-9 people waiting for one pizza every one takes 3 slices and it‚Äôs gone in 10 seconds. Could take 15 minutes of queuing for a slice (I stand and pray it‚Äôs an olive one she‚Äôs making because the kids all hate it and don‚Äôt take any so I can queue jump!)    * The evening bar - just get an extra pair of hands on the bar between 9-11pm and everyone would be a lot happier. One guy serving a whole complex by himself is frustrating for everyone (yet he still manages to be fast and polite) Such a simple solution would reduce complaints - us English can overlook most minor annoyances if we have a beer in our hand!    Overall this hotel is very clean has a great team of staff and we have had a lovely little cheap getaway.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Holly D wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Enjoyable stay,Wonderfully presented hotel cleanliness standard was very good. Everywhere was cleaned daily and smelled fresh. The food was delicious and fresh pizza and pasta served every meal time for fussy eaters. There were a lot of bees buzzing around the outside of the complex I guess it was due to the time of year they didn't sting any of us and easily wafted away. The hotel staff were very pleasant and polite. Alcohol selection is minimum but adequate when taking into consideration the culture of the country. Beer and standard spirits are served along with some basic cocktails. The slides are great for the kids and there are 4 swimming pools one is situated further away for those who want to enjoy a more private or quieter experience. Shuttle buses run throughout the day into late evening which are free and transport you to the old and new town. Over all a very enjoyable experience I would recommend to families and couples and would definitely visit again.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/278hollyd
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ellie P wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Loved our stay,I stayed here during October half term for a week with my mum and sister. we enjoyed our stay the hotel was reasonably clean and the staff was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. It‚Äôs about 40 minutes from the airport we used a transfer company hoppa which I recommend. We had to pay tax when we got to the hotel (about ¬£10 each). The rooms was cleaned daily was spacious and well equipped. The restaurant seemed to be low on cutlery & cups and there wasn‚Äôt enough staff to keep the tables clean ect. but that could be because we went in half term there was a good mixture of food pizza pasta chips rice & soup daily as well as different meats and veg and breckfast was a mixture of pancakes toast croissants yoghurts fruits & cereals. There was variety of soft drinks spirits cocktails and beer which you can help yourself to thoughtout the day and many fridges that stock bottled water. There was daily activities and the staff included everyone the hotel is really deserted so the hotel run a free daily shuttle service to the new town and the old town there are nice shops in the new town and is quite modern. If you like to see different culture i reccomend the old town and seeing the souk market however I would becarful as sellers can be quite forceful and being 3 young women it made us feel quite uncomfortable but there are nice resturants outside the markets if you fancy a change from the hotel food. We wanted a taxi to menara mall (nice restaurants supermarket & fountains) I would not book a taxi through the agency in the hotel as the man was very rude when I explained this to the manager ( Jacques Peter) he was very understanding and helpful and drove us there himself and advised us on the best way to get a taxi back and gave us his card if we needed help which made hs feel at ease. We didn‚Äôt book any tours but I heard it was cheaper to book online before look into the atlas tour and quad biking.  Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we did.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478elliep
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Emma Mc wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Great value for money hotel,Very impressed with this hotel as i was unsure due to the low cost and some of the reviews. We stayed here two weeks.  Rooms are clean spacious and we also had a balcony (some rooms don't) and fridge. Our room was located near the quiet pool which was fab as we then had Wi-Fi on the balcony!! Cleaners were great and did great jobs.  Pools were great bit chilly so could maybe do with some heat in October time. Towel attendant very friendly and helpful. Adult only pool slide pool 2 large pools and a baby pool. Plenty of Sun lounger but did get busy the 2nd week due to half term so a bit of a scramble. Pool area can get very slippery so something to bare in mind.  Great selection of food - always something to eat whether it's tagines/salad/pasta. Some nights it was a bit hectic so we left it until 830 to eat On Moroccan night people didn't seem to enjoy the food so large queues for pizza so perhaps have a 2nd chef in this area to help the poor guy! Also a lot more plain cheese pizza for the children needed lots of groans from the line when peppers and Tuna came out!!Night time waiters especially 3 younger guys on Tues 24th ( one of their names was Waidia i think) were very friendly and polite and efficient noticed they were always working fast at clearing tables providing cutlery etc. Breakfast wasn't always so lucky and sometimes a treasure hunt to find cutlery! I don't understand people's comments about limited food choice there is someone constantly making pancakes waffles doughnuts omelettes fried eggs. Dinner there is at least 6 different dishes. There is some European food but don't forget you are in Morocco so naturally there is going to be Moroccan food!!  Animation team worked their socks off from early morning to night. They were very friendly made sure to speak to everyone and if you didn't want to take part there was no pressure. I was disappointed with the kids club no information on what they actually did it seemed to be more a creche where you drop them off for 2 hours but needed to book the day before. We would have preferred a programme e.g. 10am arts and crafts 11am games etc. that we could pick and chose. So we didn't use the facility. Moroccan night entertainment brought drummers in and they were very loud but fantastic!  Reception staff very helpful and friendly as were bar staff. Great cocktails and mocktails.  Location wise it is out of the town nuts suited is as we found Marrakech hectic so it was nice to escape. There are shuttle buses free of charge every 2 hours or so to the old and new town. Also 20 minute walk through a neighbourhood gets you to a Carrefour and kindercafe.  Overall a great hotel and for the price we paid for a two week all inclusive we certainly got a bargain!,Date of stay: October 2018,,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EM1227
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jayne R wrote a review Oct 2018,50,"Great food, great staff, fantastic holiday",We stayed here this week 12th - 19th Oct and we had a fantastic time.  The Animacion staff were top notch and really helped to make the holiday. Those guys really do work so hard to make us all have a great time. They deserve a pay rise!!  The rooms were very spacious and very clean.  The hotel in general is a very well kept hotel. All staff work exceptionally hard to maintain a good standard.  I found that the food was really excellent. I have been in many all inclusive holidays and this was up there with some of the very best.    There were a couple of small issues that I am sure the hotel management can fix pretty quickly.    - Lack of cutlery. Spoons were not always available at breakfast and found myself constantly asking for them.  Cutlery also not readily available at evening meal if you chose to take a later sitting.    - Seating around the entertainment area. This was very limited and people ended up using the pool loungers. A few more tables and chairs would be great.    Overall a great holiday made by great people.  I would recommend to stay at this hotel.

Nice celection of the alcohol drinks. It's unusual for all inclusive resorts but wine and beer which I tried was very good.  Food is the special subject. The taste is to die for. Be ready to gain some extra kg because you just can't stop to eat. Local dishes wixed with european and healthy stations. But my fav was couscous with baby shrimps sauce grilled fish and Pizza....

After being shown to our room which was very clean & had a double bed we got changed & headed to the pool. There is a main pool which was like a rave everyday which wasnt for us so we took a walk & found the adult only pool which was lovely only downside was no bar & a good walk to it. We made good friends with everyone round the pool all seems like they thought the main pool was to loud. The food was poor breakfast was the best & the safest. Breakfast there was cereals fruits omelettes pancakes. Lunch was chips pizzaspaghetti Bolognese bbq there was plenty to choose from but you needed to check everything was cooked properly before eatting. Tea time was anything left from the day time & also cous cous salad which was wash with tap water spaghetti Bolognese which was left over from lunch. Me & my husband were both ill we didn't know if it was the food especially the salad being washed with tap water also all glasses were just quickly rinsed with tap water. When we spoke with other guests they were experiencing the same problem. One guest even found the chicken was still pink.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,RhiannonMc wrote a review Sep 2018,30,"Not four star, but a clean, comfortable hotel.",This is a decent budget hotel.  The rooms a good size and clean staff are polite and friendly and the calm pool (adults only) is a hidden oasis.  I have recommended it to friends who are looking for a cheap week away but with the following advice:    Tips for future guests  - DO NOT DRINK THE WATER - we were sick for the first few days until we realised this was a problem  - ask for a room by the calm pool we had no trouble with noise but were aware other guests were complaining  -make use of the free shuttle into both the old and new town but beware you can only book a day before and there are limited seats  - food was pretty good but can be very repetitive (especially when you can‚Äôt have the salad as it‚Äôs washed in tap water) so make allowances for going into Marrakech for a couple of evenings  -you have to pay for the spa but it‚Äôs definitely worth it  - don‚Äôt use the excursions company based in the hotel lobby do your research book online and you can get the same trips for half the price  - beware of scams in the M√©dina: people will tell you places are closed and try and persuade you to go with them somewhere else people will recognise your wrist band and claim they know you from the hotel (they will then want money for giving advice/directions)  - there‚Äôs a supermarket and bakery about 20 min walk away and cheaper than the hotel shop    Tips for the hotel -  - staff should knock before entering hotel rooms. Staff twice entered our room without knocking while we were in there which could have been very embarrassing/upsetting if we‚Äôd been getting changed/were caught in a compromising position. We had to lock ourselves in every time to avoid this.  -friendly staff but we had to ask a few times for more loo roll (given our digestion problems this was a problem!)  - no staff came to take drinks orders around the calm pool. Even one visit in the afternoon and morning would have been very welcome.  - there was clearly a problem with Brits drinking tap water.

Our family arrived late of night and were greeted at the front desk with a warm welcome and directed towards the closed restaurant which was opened for us to enjoy a needed drink and bite to eat.  The room we were shown was very large clean and unusually had a big double bed. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd been upgraded. Although extremely grateful I wanted an outside space to smoke. The next morning reception were only to happy to help. I was shown a room and it was perfect. I didn‚Äôt even have to touch my bags everything was smoothly transferred for us.  I‚Äôm sending out a big thank you for the kitchen staff. Although you don‚Äôt see them they work so hard. Every morning I would have diced fresh fruit and yogurt. Someone would stand there painstakingly cutting up mixed fruits. Delicious! Since I‚Äôve arrived home I‚Äôm really missing the cuisine. The food was amazing! So much choice. Everything I had was gorgeous. It was always very dignified in the restaurant. (Not like other hotels were you get pushing and shoving and long angry queues). The only queues I noticed were for omelettes and pancakes in the morning but never more than five people. If an item had run out you only had to ask and it was replenished almost instantly. The children enjoyed the fresh pizzas and pasta from the Italian corner.  The bar staff are friendly and efficient. Something I did notice at this hotel that was a refreshing change - No drunks!  Front desk staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. I had taken the wrong plug adapter with me. After finding out that the shop didn‚Äôt sell them front desk sent out for some. In no time at all we were charging our phones etc. Language is definitely not a barrier here. Polite smartly dressed competent staff which always assisted with a smile. Thank you.  The entertainment team are fantastic. I do not know where they get their energy from especially in that heat. They seem to be on the go day and night. Even when they aren‚Äôt doing a show or activity they take the time to chat with the guests. Sandy your time was appreciated. Vitamine and Momo the children love you. We all enjoyed the humorous element added to the performances and the dancing and routines were absolute quality. Labranda you have staff to be proud of.  There was always a lifeguard on duty and he was super vigilant. Well done.  My room was next to the adult pool which was nice and quiet. The room was kept clean and tidy with extra towels if needed. Beds are comfortable and we all slept very well. Great aircon! I took my own travel kettle which is a must for me. Tv and a cuppa when the children are asleep. There is a free safe which is easy to use. One little problem was the bathroom. It got so hot and steamy we would have to take breaks in between each of us showering.  If you choose to go to the market which is a lovely experience. Don‚Äôt take a guide when you get off the hotel mini bus. As nice as they are you will be guided to their mates shops/stalls and before you know it you‚Äôve spent a small fortune. Look for where the locals shop. There are bargains to be had.  The pools gardens and surrounding areas are kept to a high standard with staff working around the clock.  We were lucky enough to be staying during Eid and were welcomed into the celebrations. Staff and guests alike were convivial. A lasting memory. Thank you.  I‚Äôm trying not to leave anyone or anything out. This holiday was as good as it gets because of the hard working friendly staff.

But it was well kept and all the staff without exception were friendlyprofessional and eager to help from the pool guy gardeners bar staff chefs and reception staff . The only grumpy person was the girl in the shop .  There is a frequent shuttle but to old and new town just book it the day before you go.  You could always get a sun bed round any pool and the entertainment team made the holiday always up beat and friendly working really hard from 10am to 11 pm.    Unfortunately the food was hit and miss. I found the lunch time bbq the safest meal . I became ill on our 3rd day and my husband on day 6 (we were there for 9) I think there are probably a few reasons that contributed to this :-  1) some poorly cooked food we experienced pink chicken one evening.  2) using left over food from lunch for the evening meal -this may or may not be happening but often saw same meat etc in evening in a sauce or with veg etc.  3)Drinking glasses being hand washed at the bar . The water couldn‚Äôt possibly be hot enough and the guys couldn‚Äôt get to the bottom of the tall plastic glasses . They were then left to dry by the sink .    The other thing that was annoying in the restaurant was constantly having to ask for things to be replenished occasionally food but mainly cups  tea bags and glasses tables especially at breakfast  no one seemed that bothered to keep things topped up .,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,peterborough,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizgD2150OZ

Didn't even think in at the time but the bar staff weren't using any cleaning products just hand rinsing them and leaving the tall flute glasses discoloured as they couldn't clean the bottom of the glasses after they had been left around the pool with wasps in and out of them.

Never ever use the Meeting point excursions department in the hotel 2 trips booked and then they never showed up to collect us they cancelled them as not enough people bookedvery upset as I had arranged a surprise trip for my partner as I was going to propose and they cancelled it without telling us when I complained the agent in their office was extreamly rude and told me if I didn‚Äôt pay him for a taxi in to town I wouldn‚Äôt go ... and also told me to go away.  once I made a scene in hotel the reception staff were nice and got the manager to refund me my money I had paid for trip as the meeting point Agent told mehe was just Night staff and couldn‚Äôt do anything ... we were not the only people this had happened to lots of family‚Äôs were saying it had happened to them too it‚Äôs a down side to hotel and would never use them again.  We were also both ill and needed to seek medical attention after eating the fish one night there ill for several days and my partner slipped on a wet floor in our bedroom from water dripping from our ceiling and injured his foot reported issues several times took till last day fir them to fix it.

The hotel is very clean and the staff are very well dressed and spoken in different languages. The food is good and the drinks are sometimes hard to get as you have to queue a lot at busy times but your on holiday.

Food is amazing we didn't even want to go out for food drinks are very tasty and alcohol doesn't taste cheap or give you horrible hangovers and headaches. Staff is very friendly and polite but never annoying. Hotel is very clean and well maintained. Rooms are very spacious and clean. Kids have different pool and if you want more quiet place to read a book you can go to a different pool near gym as its usually quiet. Definitely recommend.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Declan S wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Superb Hotel,Overall fantastic value for the money and we loved the hotel. Do some research before staying and see if it meets your needs. If looking for marina late night action close to town and different restaurant etc its maybe not for you. From an all inclusive point of view it ticked all the boxes for us and proved a great base for Morocco.  Lots of people will speak French/Arabic so be prepared for this.    Pros: Beautiful extremely clean spacious hotel.  Water Slides plenty of good quality food and drink.  Nice staff free shuttle and excursion desk.  Great choice of safe pool and kids club.  Near the airport and spacious family rooms.  Large array of food and drinks.    Cons: 15/20 mins from town and nothing outside the hotel.  No wifi in rooms  Late night entertainment poor for adults  Restaurant a bit rush and grab at times but open for hours.  Tennis court a waste. Could turn sand based football and tennis into Astro.  No ice cream for some reason.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"County Cork, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/426declans
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sharon L wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Amazing,The hotel food and staff are absolutely amazing loved this holiday from start to finish wish we could of stayed longer. There are wasps round the bar due to sugary drinks but they do not sting unless you stand on a dead one bare footed. It was a bit mental to see at first but have to say this was one of my favourite holidays ever the food was amazing and never repetitive we stayed 2 weeks and it really wasn't long enough. The drinks(alcoholic were great red wine is never normally that nice jn all inclusive but it was lovely. The staff were really beautiful people and would definitely return. There was a group of us that went all different ages and every single person loved it. The bar and towel guys are outstanding they do everything to make your holiday fab the sunbeds are fetched to you and they will try their best to help in any way.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Lisa B wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Lively hotel,Our family of 3 (2 adults and 9 year old) stayed at this hotel for 10 days in a standard room in the main building on 1st floor which was a decent size with double bed and sofa which you take the cushions off to make a child‚Äôs bed but very narrow/small. Hotel did however provide us with a fold out single bed for our son after 2 days which was better. The beds are extremely firm and I mentioned this at reception and they kindly provided blankets to put on the mattress to make it a little more comfortable. Some rooms have balconies ours didn‚Äôt. We noticed a sign on reception to upgrade to a superior room for 20 Euro a night not sure if those rooms are ones with balconies worth checking when booking (we booked through an agent and didn‚Äôt realise this was choice/option). Overall hotel is nice and staff pleasant and help where they can.  The restaurant is ok with a lovely selection of food mainly Moroccan cuisine which is expected and appreciated with a lovely salad bar and bread selection as well as an Italian corner which is in the front section of the restaurant away from the main food selection. Not all the drinks machines were working which was inconvenient if you were seated at the opposite end. Sometimes hard to find a free table but staff efficient in clearing and re-setting tables when they were vacated. The guests however at meal times are inconsiderate and pushy making meal times an unpleasant experience it was like feeding time at a zoo. I‚Äôm not sure what the hotel/staff could do about this maybe allocate varied seating times for guests with designated tables and a queuing system or staff assisting with serving food up. Guests were piling up plates full of food often leaving little or none for others waiting a lot of which was left uneaten on tables and wasted. Dress code for meals was very casual.  Pools - main pool mini pool for tots right next to it and then slide pool with another right next to it set slightly back from main pool. That one wasn‚Äôt as busy but one set of steps had top rung missing so hard to get back out. Plenty of sun beds and whilst guests do as usual and put towels out early we always managed to find a sun bed. There is constant activities throughout the day around the pools with very loud music. Personally too loud for us at times we were battling to hear one another talking. I don‚Äôt mind music but this was just too much and didn‚Äôt find it relaxing which is what a holiday is all about. On a positive note the entertainment team certainly work hard and are very friendly and if you like it lively and loud you will love it.  There are a number of trips that can be booked at the booking office in reception area we did the Marrakech souk tour which was ¬£19 pp well worth it and enjoyable.  Overall not for us but have given 4 stars as I think that‚Äôs fair to the hotel and staff.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisabP7122RR
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,llovizna99 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Not what was expected,Booked a late holiday paying more than expected for something that we thought was ideal for the family.  The hotel is far from being 4 stars  a lot of improvements need to be done by the management team.  The main problem of the hotel is that is run by the visitors but not for the hotel team and that is the main problem if they want to succeed in this business.  My recommendations to the hotel:  1.Restaurant: Design rules for visitors better timings for food and also dress code  2. Have plenty of food to cater nearly 600 visitors  3. Swimming pool for adults need to be supervised all the time as some parents let their kids to join the pool and is really annoying when you want to escape from your own children and have some peace and quite.Make people to follow the rules and don't be scare to tell them off is your HOTEL!  4. The Gym should have more equipment  5. The entertainment for kids in the evening should be different  6. Kids Club: The hotel needs to have more than one adukt supervising more than 5 children. Be careful with this aspect!  7.Tell all your employees to empower their responsibilities and not to let visitors to intimidate them .  8. The Spa is scary not relaxing I wanted to book a session but the atmosphere is not relaxing. the paint is black or dark blue! those colours are far from being relaxing.    Overall I didn't have a good time I felt trap in that hotel I thought we could do more over there but the tours that we booked at the hotel rescued us for 4 days!    I hope the manager of the hotel value Fatima who is really proactive and always try her bets to find the right solution to make you happy.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Hay-mill wrote a review Aug 2018,30,Slightly disappointed,Me and my family visited this hotel in aug 2018 for 10 nights.  The hotel itself was very clean and well kept. I found there to be a slight langauge barrier as the locals speak Arabic or French. Lots of French visitors who seemed to get priority with the staff. The animation team and reps/excursion staff were very helpful and friendly.  The restaurant situation is awful. There is one buffet restaurant which of the food we ate was nice and well presented. Unfortunately the queing is horrendous. To sit as a family of 4 and eat together is just impossible. The locals had a blatant disregard to people queing and nor did they understand you or care if you mentioned to them about joining the que. The food was being replenished but not at a fast enough pace so it was a case of hunter / gatherer. Just get some plates of food where the ques weren‚Äôt as bad and sit and share. Leaving us everyday it felt like with the same plates of random food. Timing was key. If u were lucky enough to catch the restaurant at a quiet time you had more luck but being high season in August this was rare.  The hotel shop was very expensive. For example a magnum ice cream was the equivalent of about ¬£3 and as there are no ice creams included in the all inclusive option. We found ourselves buying these from the shop everyday for the kids. The room we had was a lovely ground floor large family room with lots of space and a kitchenette. It was kept immaculate thanks to the brilliant cleaners.  The wasps are another thing. The outdoor bar was riddled with wasps. You could not enjoy a Pepsi or cocktail outside without being surround by wasps. I was stung which left me with swollen itchy skin where the sting had been for days after.  The poolside music was loud during the day but entertainment staff very energetic hard working and friendly. The kids disco and evening entertainment was held most evenings in the hotel indoor conference room with chairs set in rows like a conference meeting.  The hotel is in the middle of no where so if you like to venture out of an evening or take a stroll this isn‚Äôt really possible.  The local area is still not very built up so driving out in a taxi or the hotel shuttle bus it seems very desserted.  When going into the old or new town I personally felt intimidated being with young children. Everybody wants money for something. Even getting off the shuttle bus in the ‚Äòold town‚Äô there are guys with ‚ÄòID badges‚Äô telling you they can show you round and they work for the hotel. They don‚Äôt work for the hotels and stay well clear. They may take you on a tour and ward off hassle from locals trying to sell you things but it seemed to all the places in the town of friends and family for you to buy things from them and then would want a fee for this service. I understand they are trying to make a living and the culture is very different but so so pushy.    Although the hotel was a nice hotel I would say it‚Äôs maybe more a 3* and the main improvements I would suggest would be to battle the wasp problem to maybe introduce theme nights in the restaurant for variety and a better queing system. I would also suggest making the entertainment a bit more varied and casual to watch. Maybe even to get some outside entertainers in for something different.    I personally wouldn‚Äôt visit this hotel again.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hay-mill

But the food and the queuing for food was disappointing. Not much choice at evening time and very little choices for children. If you don't like chicken you are in trouble because every night it was chicken. The bar closed at 11.00 pm on the dot but the entertainment carried on until 11.30 / 12.00 pm.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,rayna87 wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Brilliant family holiday,I traveled here in August with my partner and our four children aged 161286 for a 10 day holiday. Upon arrival at the hotel we where welcomed by a lovely member of staff who gave us our wrist bands told us where everything was and what time breakfastlunch and dinner was. We arrived about midday and our rooms where ready and we where pleased to hear we had adjoining rooms as we had requested them being a family of 6.  We took our bags up and headed straight down to the pool. We had no problem getting sun beds and there is a pool person on hand all day helping if people need sun beds or umbrellas over them.  The entertainment staff are amazing always walking round interacting with you making you feel welcome and generally doing a fab job of making your over all experience there brilliant. There was always some type of aerobics/fitness on in the morning aqua aerobics or aqua Zumba during the day along with silly games thought out the day both in and out the pool.  The entertainment at night was always funny sometimes they had something special there ie a performance from outside performers or a show they put on themselves and this again happened both at night and during the day.    The cleanliness of the hotel was brilliant there was never a moment that I was inside that I didn‚Äôt see some one hoovering polishing or generally cleaning. The staff even put little personal touches to our room by arranging our sheets or scarfs we had bought whilst out there in patterns on both the beds.  Any outside excursions you wanted to do could be booked again by very friendly staff at a mostly fair price and even with discounts for children. There is always shuttle buses you can book the night before to go to the old/new town and guided tours arrangeable for both.  Our overall experience here was lovely but the reason for the four star is as follows.    1.Even though the staff do a fab job of entertaining the adults during the day and yes there is a kids club I think more could possibly be done to have some child friendly games in the main pool/outside areas that they could maybe interact with the grown ups in or just have some games for them as a lot of them are based around the adults.    2. The snack bar I think would be more beneficial if it was available between breakfast and lunch as well as lunch and dinner as at the moment only runs between lunch and dinner and the shop only sells crisps and sweeties and yes we are on holiday but it‚Äôs not something I want my children eating often after breakfast.    3.I think the bar shuts a tad to early even if it stayed open till 11:30. I am aware that there is another bar where you can buy drinks but having payed for all inclusive and having been to other hotels their bars shut later.    4. I also think the Italian section would benefit maybe from some extra staff as there is often a massive que and they struggle with the amount of people who are waiting as people tend to take whole pizzas and your waiting a good 5-10 minutes for more.    Overall our experience here was lovely and we enjoyed our stay very much! If we ever came back to Morocco we would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ickenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rayna87

Our rooms were cleaned atleast 5 times during our stay and the staff will do their best to help you if you need anything- you just have to be a little patient!!  Only negative aspects of the hotel are the gym is a little run down- the machines are quite old and the cross trainer did not work. There is NO entertainment for teenagers even the football was taken off them as they have no staff to supervise them whilst playing. The manager was not very helpful regarding this matter and lastly our check out was at 12pm our transfer was not until 5.50. They had overbooked at the reception so we were hanging around the reception for over 5 hours as they had no available room that we could have. This caused a problem as we had 5 young children with us.    Overall it was a fantastic stay hotel was nice and clean and the kids had a brilliant time.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,tsparacha wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Great weather and great city to visit,I'll do my best to summarise my families trip to Marrakech recently. Firstly the hotel..    The hotel is clean and wonderful to stay at. The grounds and pool areas are kept clean constanly. You won't be disappointed at all in those respects. The hotel staff are friendly and do try and help where possible.    We travelled as a family of 6 so had two adjoining ground floor rooms near the pools. The rooms were clean and ok for a short stay.    The food hall was decent sized and various selections were out every day. However service is slow at times. Staff do bring things out but normally there's a queue waiting for popular items which isnt very good as you can imagine people push in... and thats were the odd argument starts. Which leads me to the final point that messed up our stay somewhat. On the final day a fight broke out between two teenagers then their mothers started hitting each other. Staff split them up but the fight continued in the main hotel lobby... the police were called finally. From what I could tell they were locals.. ignoring this final issue.. we had a great time there.    The hotel isnt near anything within walking distance... in fact you drive through a very run down area to get to it. This annoyed my wife who typically likes to go out for a stroll looking at local shops after dinner. If this is you then this hotel isnt ok for you... However they do run a free shuttle to the main square and to the new town. You have to book a place on it 24hrs in advance.    The main square is very busy at night time keep kids and belongings close by. The snakes on show will frighten anybody.....and I'm not sure steamed sheeps head is for everyone !    Do book a trip to the Ourika Valley and waterfalls. However its a 45min trek to the waterfalls with very dangerous drops either side. Book a local guide to help you. Worth it once there as you can paddle in the pool below the falls the water is very cold. The walk up to it is very narrow and people are coming the other way too.... be careful.    The airport... coming in took around 2 hrs to get through immigration fill out their cards and please take more. You will have to fill out another set when you leave. The final point here is... it took nearly 3 hrs to get through to the waiting lounge... its checks after checks etc... so leave plenty off time...

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Georgia wrote a review Aug 2018,40,The loss to the entertainment team & hotel,This hotel would be nothing without the entertainment team. Their positive energy is infectious & there‚Äôs never a dull moment when they‚Äôre around! I was saddened to hear about the mistreatment of these wonderful people which lead to the lovely Mehdi Hannah & Smiley having no other option but to walk away from a job that nobody else could do better. I have no uncertainty in saying that the hotel will struggle without these 3 as they brought the joy & happiness to the hotel. This is an upsetting situation as everyone who has met these incredible people will know that the hotel will be nothing without them. The hotel has lost the funniest most professional & kindest 3 members of the entertainment team who cannot be replaced.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiacolvinx
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sohaib D wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Pretty good hotel with fantastic entertainment,Overall my experience of this hotel was wonderful. It was a short drive from the airport and provided buses to take you into the city of Marrakech. The food was very diverse to cater for all ranges of people although a few more chefs are probably required because the wait sometimes got too long! A queuing system is probably also needed. The swimming pools were large and clean with a good number of loungers available. There was a very vibrant atmosphere around the pool epitomised by the excellent music played by the poolside DJ. The rooms were well conditioned and clean and the bathrooms had a lovely walk in shower. The bars are well staffed and the bartenders are very jolly and chatty. One small criticism of this hotel is probably the main reception staff who I didn't find were the most helpful. It's also worth noting that the WiFi is only for the lobby and doesn't reach the bedrooms.    However the absolute best part of this hotel is certainly the animation team. They are a group of 8-10 enthusiastic fun-loving people who work tirelessly all day to entertain the hotel guests. During the day they put on a variety of activities both in the pools and around the hotel. I particularly enjoyed the AquaZumba where I got to learn routines to some funky songs in a variety of languages. They do so well to include both adults and children in their games and always manage to get everyone involved. In the evening they provide entertainment for children and then adults performing a variety of dances and songs. They do everything with a smile on their face and really made this holiday special for me. I would like to thank Smiley Hannah Mehdi and all of the other members of the animation team for all their hand work and enthusiasm I hope to see you again!

All paperwork smoothly completed and was advised to get lunch as restaurant was about to end. On return rooms were ready.    No complaints with the hotel staff rooms food and a general thumbs up.  As a family of six including 4 teenagers we got 3 rooms (2 connecting rooms).    Pool - plenty of room and different types of pools. Sunbeds easily available.    Food- a good variety and plentiful. Endless drink throughout the stay.    Bus Shuttle - a very good added service which we used regularly.    Entertainment team. Fantastic and very energetic. A credit to the team.    Oh just one minor point I think it's only the British that que so you may have direct other quests sometimes with pointing your finger to the back of que.    Overall this Hotel and Service is a pass from me.    Hope these comments helped and you have a great stay here.    Last day today before heading back to the grindstone.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Angecarrahar wrote a review Aug 2018,30,family holiday,family holiday consisting of 3 adults and 3 children aged 10 7 and 2. check in was swift with no problems and the rooms are adequate with a hairdryer and fridge provided. the rooms are cleaned daily and towels changed everyday. there is a quiet pool for adults only large swimming pool pool for toddlers to play in and water slides. there is also a pool with small slides for toddlers but our 2 year old wanted to go on the adults slides and they were happy for us to take her on them which she loved. they have pool games during the day and put on night time entertainment we did not see any of the entertainment as it was all indoors and it was too hot to be sat inside. we had a child with multiple alllergies and met a lovely lady called Fatima who showed us the allergy information boards and explained that all the foods would have a label showing which foods it would contain. unfortunatley we had to ask most nights for the labels to be on show as this was not done. on a postive they did inform us that if there were no foods on offer for the child with the allergies they would make something else for us. the only issue we had was that there were no facilites to take a shower after room checkout. due to the hotel being full we were unable to have a late checkout which i understand but there was no courtesy room or showers available to use in the gym or spa. we were not leaving until 5pm and checkout is 12 noon. the children wanted to play in the water and when asked where we could shower we were told to use the showers by the pools which is not ideal. the hotel is not near any shops or bars but they do provide a shuttle bus to the nearest town which is not that great to be fair. we did on trip to the souke markets at night be prepared to be hassled to eat at every stall you walk past.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angecarrahar

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Paris S wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Hotel review,I have just come back from a weeks long stay at this hotel in Morocco! Staying at this hotel a week really is not long enough definitely do 10 days if you can afford it. I cannot fault this hotel one bit. I went with my cousin who is 18 and my aunty I am 19 myself. The room was great we had an amazing balcony that overlooked the pool on the first floor. Our room was cleaned everyday and was done very well. The cleaner even made a heart shape on our bed :). The food was lovely so much choice and cooked extremely well I ate so healthy the whole holiday. The breakfast for me wasn‚Äôt the best but lunch and dinner definitely made up for that. The hotel had amazing facilities with 4 different pools including a pool with great slides and an adult pool If you want to enjoy the quiet. Around the main pool is where they play great music and where you can take part in all the activities throughout the day! The reps made our holiday and we became close friends with all of them and the holiday wouldn‚Äôt of been the same without them. If you have young kids they will honestly love the reps. Overall I cannot fault the hotel all of us wanted to stay longer and will definitely be returning next year if not sooner.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/563pariss
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,kdyfoodie wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Superb Family Holiday,I'll try to keep this brief as possible and cover the main points.    Check in.    Arrived at 12pm and expected to not be able to check in till 2pm. Was greeted by a member of staff who sorted us out with our wristbands amd had is doll I'm the relevant forms. Paid the tourist tax which was 21 quid for 2 adults for 7 nights. Kids dont pay. We were then talen for a welcome meetimg im the little trip office. We were told where everything was and meal times etc. They told us of available trips but were not pushy at all. They offered to taken our bags tongue room so we could go have lunch but we had plenty of time so wanted to check the room first. From arrival this took perhaps 15/20 mins. We were shown to our room and showed the air con bathroom etc. Our room had a double bed and 2 singles in it. Was open plan 2 bedroom with a dining table lovely bathroom with great shower and a kitchen with microwave!    Food    Food was great the whole week. From fresh pancakes waffles fruit smoothies to order and omelettes at breakfast. Plentynof fruit bread amd yoghurts amd plenty fresh tea and coffee. Aside from a wide variety of dishes there was also a BBQ at lunch time which had everything from tuna steaks chicken wings and lamb. It was fantastic. Dinner always had something great to offer. From various tagines fish cous cous rice  pasta pizza chips salad bar bread fresh fruit choice of 2 soups and delicious desserts. If you dont want to eat Moroccan food don't go to Morocco!    Bar    Plenty of variety of spirits cocktails Local beer(lovely stuff) juice amd mocktails for the kids. Large fridges with bottled water available so you could help yourself. Bar staff were great and tried to teach me arabic throughout my stay!    Pool    Pools were spotless and never had trouble getting a sun lounger. Never went to the adult pool but spent most of our time next to the slides and kids pool. Also closest to the bar!  Honey bees not wasps were a pain if you had sugary drinks by the pool. Pro tip. Drink beer and wine and they dont go near you. Harmless anyhow.    Kids enjoyed the little disco and there was some great entertainment in the theatre room. There was also a keyboard and guitarist duo who played music on the terrace. Very good they were too!    Outside the hotel    Nothing there really. Not am issue as you book on the free shuttle bus which are always on time and takes you into either the new or old town. We went to the old town during the day and at night. Incredible experience. Yes people try to sell you stuff and show you around(for money). Be firm but polite amd wander around and get lost. It's part of the fun. Dont pay more than 10 dirham for a photo with a monkey or snake if thats your thing! Their first price will be outrageous! Beware of the henna woman. They can be quite pushy. But remember they're just trying to make a living. If you overpay for anything by a few quid who cares?    Do drink the juice from the stalls around the medina! It's all fantastic! At night the medina changes and there are dozens of food stalls. We didn't try any as we had booked dinner at Nomad. Highly recommended and they serve the best ice cream and sorbets I've ever had.    All in all a great holiday and highly recommend both the hotel and Marrakech,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kirkcaldy, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdyfoodie

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,deedeeLeicester wrote a review Jul 2018,20,Extremely rude reception staff spoilt our overall experience!!,Warning: detailed long review!!  Pros: good buffet despite the queues.  Cons: rude reception staff noisy overcrowded pools with overly loud euro pop music blaring all day. Stinging Wasps everytime you get a drink.    After an initial mix up with the booking and confusion with between Labranda aqua fun and Targa (after being dropped off to aqua fun) we were told our booking was actually at Targa aqua park.  So got a driver to take us there instead thinking it‚Äôs probably just as good.  Initial thoughts on entering... nice decor. However no assistance here with our luggage at all.  Check in minimal and basic. No welcome information provided by the receptionist only when i asked questions about meal times beach towel policy etc i was given information.  Was taken by the bell boy to the room who assisted with the luggage. Room 6102 Upon entering noticed the AC wasn‚Äôt working. He said wait for a while. Waited. Yep not working.  It was a studio room for two adults and two children with a kitchen ‚Äòarea‚Äô. Not that we even asked for a kitchen... as we‚Äôre All Inclusive?! Anyway kitchen would‚Äôve been useless unless you had packed cups plates cutlery kettle etc... i mean not even a teaspoon haha!  The kids beds were already made up which were small sofa beds. Well my 13 year old didn‚Äôt fit in it way too small only suitable for younger kids under 5 foot tall/under 10 yrs old!  So made my way down to reception to raise the AC and bed issues.  Spoke to Zineb or similar (hard to read her name badge as the text was so tiny!) she said she‚Äôll arrange for an engineer to fix it. No time as to when given. Explained the short sofa bed issue... she and a colleague didn‚Äôt understand so I explained they should come and see for themselves as they clearly didn‚Äôt believe me! After asking to me moved to another room with a proper sized single bed i was told the hotel is full ... no other rooms and was offered a folding bed.  I explained there wasn‚Äôt anything in the kitchen as to cups/plate kettle. And they just shrugged their shoulders and smirked.  I also pointed out that their own website says ‚Äòminibar (Inclusive)‚Äô and that the fridge in the room was empty not even a bottle of water! Their response ‚Äòthat means the fridge is included in the room we don‚Äôt fill it for you‚Äô!!  All this between check in 2pm-4pm  Engineer fiddled with something on the roof of the complex at 6pm  Came and said its working now. I said i dont think it is. It wasn‚Äôt. However he insisted its fixed.  Went down at 8pm again and spoke to Zineb again who now had added rolling eyes to her smirks. I politely said im not happy with room as the AC is still not working and the room was stifling hot.  All i got was smirks. And told the engineer had fixed it. So am i lying?  I told her to come and see for yourself. More eyes rolled at me.  I told her i wanted to change rooms and another slightly more helpful colleague said there will be a room available at 6am in the morning i can change after breakfast.  That night was the most uncomfortable night stay ever. Sweltering hot and with two kids too sweltering away not good. I had to sleep with the faux balcony doors wide open.  Next morning after no sleep was shown the new room. So much better. With cool AC blowing. I said to the same bell boy ‚Äò see this is working‚Äô. He just shrugged his shoulders too.  Happy with the new room i said to the kids were only here for two more nights (as we has spilt our week between a riad and here) so make the most of the slides and chill out.  On our first day they did not like the noise and crowds around the main and begged us to take them to the adults calm quiet pool instead! Which i did after asking permission first of course.  The food was in a canteen style buffet restaurant... busy noisy chaotic. Most mealtimes there were no tables no forks or no knifes.  Food was a good selection though although not many hot food items if you‚Äôre s vegetarian! Pizza man was good and helpful on first night and made me a whole vegetarian pizza. Subsequent nights other pizza people on was told its by the slice only. They made up random flavours and they came out one by one... from one oven again causing queues. Even though they had four ovens?! The pizza person was also covering the pasta station and seemed overwhelmed and clearly struggled to cope on her own.  Bar: good quick service down side: hundreds of wasps. Can‚Äôt relax and sip on any drink without being swarmed. Had to down it pretty fast and get rid of the plastic glass asap!  Water slides: four in the second pool. Only saving feature of the hotel to be honest.  Evening entertainment: way too loud and goes on till 11pm.  On our last day whilst checking out at 8am we had informed them that we had a private driver booked to take us to the airport and to let security gate know so they can let him onto the grounds. (As previous night he was denied access to the grounds when we arranged a sunset camel trek resulting in him having a full blown argument with the security gate men!)  Well my husband was approached by a driver and asked him ‚Äòare you waiting for a Airport transfer?‚Äô To which replace yes but its with MarrakechTravelService are you from there?‚Äô He raised his voice and shouted ‚Äòim from Marrakech‚Äô ‚Äò are you Mr Robin (or similar sounding name) going to Airport?‚Äô Husband replied thats not us he yelled back ‚Äòwheres your voucher‚Äô at this point it was clear he had us mixed up with another customer who had booked him. He started muttering huffing and clearly swearing in arabic. This was all happening within yards of the reception staff... yes Zineb was standing smirking away. The husband then approached her and said ‚Äòare you going to say something to him or what?‚Äô She just smirked more and shrugged her shoulders.  Finally Another colleague of hers on the cash desk then intervened and said to him leave it you have him mixed up with someone. His customer then turned up. I asked her does that driver work for this hotel? She hesitated to answer and then said she thinks he works for that travel agent over there (pointing to their in-house travel services who over charge guests upto 250Dirhams for a one way transfer!  If you‚Äôre still reading this ... Apologies for the looong review but i have to make it clear that it seemed obvious the reception staff treated british guest poorly over french/arabic guests. Most of them especially Zineb need a course on basic customer care. Even my kids commented on her smirking and rudeness! Would not recommend this hotel based on lack of customer service skills.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deedeeLeicester
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,robinthatcher wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Good and Bad,Ok so firstly apologies for the length of the review but I want to be thorough.    When we arrived I had no issues the reception staff are not as courteous as you expect they got interrupted whilst talking to us by people speaking Moroccon they certainly lacked manners. I had to ask 3 times for enough towel cards for each of us. We got to our room and it was suffice. We needed an extra bed made up and the adjoining door unlocking. It took 4 attempts at asking reception to get this. Bear in mind there is a city tax to pay too. That was ¬£40 for 5 of us over 7 days.    The hotel itself is nice. Nothing too special but apart from the amount of bee's that meant any drink containing sugar could just NOT be drunk by the pool the first couple of days were fine. BUT this was with the hotel at about half capacity. After 2 days the hotel filled up and then it just went downhill.    This hotel is understaffed for the amount of people. At any 1 point there is only 1 bar serving alcohol. I have been all inclusive before and they couldn't do enough for us. I didn't feel that here. The bar staff were friendly even though they get stung by bee's daily. The bar is like a beehive.  The pool is lovely and slides are good but when full getting loungers together unless you are up early is tough. Even then people take umbrellas from you if you are not there. We went to lunch and had an umbrella we were using for our kids taken.  The hotel do not really enforce any rules. We sat next to French people who seemed to think smoking in my children's faces was acceptable. Prepare for poolside battles.    The all inclusive had NO ICE CREAM for me it was criminal to not just have basic ice cream (other places I have stayed always have) but they do sell it for ¬£2.50 an ice cream in the shop. funny that.    Foodwise the hotel was good again the first 2 days. Then at full capacity the kitchen is hugely understaffed. Anything nice will leave you waiting in a queue for 5-10 mins. Once you have done this 3-4 times then it becomes stressful and annoying. And this is every meal. Personally I didn't think the food choice was great either. I couldn't believe it when you see something though and end up waiting for so long just for them to make it again. I was also very annoyed to find out that they set desserts out and then just don't replenish them so if you go to dinner early you get more choice compared to later when there is virtually nothing. We struggled to get a clean table at times and then finding cutlery near impossible. I cannot emphasize how understaffed the place was. My kids ate but the choice for them was minimal and again the waiting affected them. The rudeness of people who just ignored queues to jump in as well it appears that manners are out of the window in there. The tea was only available at breakfast and the coffee was some of the worst I have ever drunk.  Breakfast was the best meal for me and that was purely for omelette's and pancakes but it was exactly the same every single day. We went to breakfast on our last day just after it opened and there was much more choice. My shock with that is it appears you are penalised if you don't go to a meal as soon as it opens and when you've paid the same as everyone else just doesn't add up to me.    Our room was cleaned daily and to be fair that was good they always did it when we were at the pool so that was nice and easy.    I cannot emphasize this part enough BE CAREFUL BOOKING EXCURSIONS we went on the dessert safari the quad biking and 4x4 were excellent. But when we got there having paid ¬£230 for 3 adults and 2 kids. They told us then we had to buy a scarf for ¬£6-¬£7 each!!! we hadn't even bought cash so had to pay when we were dropped back later. This included dinner which was OK for me the portions amongst 5 of us were small and the 'show' was more a belly dancer and a band playing some repetitive music. The whole experience was nice having dinner in the dessert. Then the drink were ridiculous a beer ¬£5-¬£6 and coke was ¬£2.50 you are in a country where a coke costs 50p max and for them to charge that was annoying. The meeting point tour company never informed us of this. It just felt like we paid all that money and it was all about what more can we get from you.  This is a running theme to me.    The meeting point staff are nice enough but to me it was more about selling to you then how they can help. They did print our boarding passes for us.    The final annoyance to me was reception when I asked them to help with calling my transfer they dialled the number gave me the phone and then told me it would be about ¬£1 per minute. I couldn't believe they charged me when it would have cost them nothing.    The bar closes at 11 on the dot to early to me and then we were sat drinking and talking to have the door locked and lights shut out on us at 11:15 because they were closed. I was in shock at how rude it was this happened every night. It was just so unbelievably rude.    They had a bar that was open later the sports bar that you pay for drinks in.... again funny that.    Overall this hotel had potential and we met some nice people there. The lifeguards were nice as were the bar staff in most cases.    It was a nice week but I would not go here again. The bad points just added huge stress where there shouldn't have been.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinthatcher
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Leanne C wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Highs and lows,Apologies if this is long but want to cover everything ü§£    Got to the hotel to find the female receptionist was quite abrupt when we checked in she seemed to think that 2 pool cards for 3 people was sufficient and couldn‚Äôt understand that I didn‚Äôt.    Got to the room and was very disappointed to find 2 single beds and no sheets to make up the ‚Äòsofa bed‚Äô spoke to the same lady on reception and was told basically it wasn‚Äôt being changed so get on with it my 3 year old is only small so he can share. Decided to just make the best of it did ask again to be moved or for spare sheets and pillow later in the week and was told they were fully booked so no change.    The pool area was amazing lots of sun loungers a few different pools to cater for everyone the animation team round the main pool were ace getting everyone involved kids and adults alike. I barely saw my 7 year old during the day as he was on the slides or playing with all the other kids. The bees were a real pain especially round the pool you basically had to get a drink and neck it at the bar or you‚Äôd be swarmed with the things! My son did get stung while he was playing in the pool but the bar staff got some cream straight on it. Think they are used to people getting stung unfortunately.    The hotel had the most amount of cleaners and groundskeepers I‚Äôve ever seen honestly they worked like troopers all day the entire hotel was basically washed down everyday at least once. I cannot fault any of the cleaners they worked so hard to keep the place clean and tidy despite the raging heat and bees!    The food was hit and miss but the kids survived on pizza and chips for the week. Just a shame the pizza man has a constant queue with them only coming out 1 at a time! Breakfast was the best meal of the day as far as me and the kids were concerned. The drinks were all fab the bar staff were all friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you.    The evening entertainment was good some nights when it was outside not so good when it was in the conference room which was damp and dark. Such a shame to be sat inside when it‚Äôs beautiful outside.    Kidsclub was a bit of a wash out the level of English spoken by the staff meant my children and a lot of the other people I spoke to didn‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving their children there. It was mainly used by the French families.    We got the free hotel shuttle in to town which was nice as we did get a bit of cabin fever as there was nothing around the hotel to have a wander to.    All in all was a nice week but I wouldn‚Äôt return.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leannec127

Wished we had booked for 2 weeks as had such a lovely relaxing time and didn't want to come home. Room was clean & spacious hotel was lovely hotel staff are lovely & food was good. However the chefs & waiters need to be quicker on bringing out the fresh food to save people waiting around. This was a minor issue though as on the whole we had a great experience. Animation team were brilliant all welcoming and a lovely happy group. They were excellent with all the children and with encouraging adults to get involved in the days activities. They work so hard!! The male animation team also like the females visiting the hotel so just be aware they tell all the women you are beautiful you are my queen etc etc. Overall a great holiday and would definitely go back without a doubt! One more thing there are so many wasps that you cannot put your drink down uncovered. There needs to be alot more wasp catchers all around the pool to help this problem. Really don't understand why anyone would write a bad review about this place or the staff.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmac8597
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Wendy Rayner wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Girls Holiday,My friends and I had a fabulous time the hotel was same as on the photos beautiful clean and not far from the airport. The food was amazing different dishes every day quite a mix and the staff were so lovely especially the Entertaining Team and Brad was the favourite of my friend. So a massive Thank you to the whole Team at this hotel. Additionally the slides were the best so much fun.    And the cocktails were divine we missed them so much and the place as was so relaxing. However be careful of the wasp with them and I wish the hotel do something about the wasp problem they have at the moment as it is not fair for the staff and will be one of the reason of not taking my daughter there with me.    We also did excursion through the hotels which were well organised except for the Market Trip. We were not impressed as we were told that we will have 3 guides with us however we only had one and were told there to visit the market on our own and come back to the meeting point. Personally I felt vulnerable during this trip as the market was quite overwhelming. However the over excursion we did in the mountain was amazing the beauty of the country side was impressive apart from the 3 hours drive from the hotel.    But overall we all had a fantastic time.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Simon wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Cheqp and cheerful,We have just returned yesterday from this hotel after two weeks there. We booked a taxi transfer to the hotel through H &L taxis which was brilliant and only 35 euros return for four people. The check in at the hotel was very quick and reception staff were friendly. However I was disappointed as we had emailed twice to request and ensure we had two rooms near each other due to my disability and this was explained in the email. We did get two rooms in the same pavilion however they were up two flights of stairs with no lift. We were offered another room but we would have been separated and chose to stay near each other but not really acceptable to except a disabled person to go up and down the stairs every day for two weeks on crutches when we requested this in January at time of booking and again by email in June.  The bedrooms were spacious and clean with excellent showers and balconies. The cleaners are very good but they come at all different times and sometimes the room was not done by 5pm when we were heading in for showers from the pool to find no towels in the bathroom.    The food is repetitive and the pasta was often cold. I could not eat any of the bread or fruit except fruit I could peel myself due to the bees and flies being over everything sitting out. The barbecue outside is good but the queues are just too long. Breakfast is very good with plenty of choice.    The quality of the alcohol is not good and the measures are very strong. There are plenty of bottles of water in the fridges but often not cold. The all incljisve bar closes at 11pm and you have to pay for drinks after that so from 10:45pm every night there were long queues for the drinks as usually only one bar staff on duty. The soft drinks were fine but come in small paper cups so you have to keep going back. A big thank you however to the bar staff who put up with large crowds during the World Cup matches.    The pools are excellent and the entertainment staff work hard to provide activities. However I felt very uncomfortable with some of the animation staff. I witnessed the male staff being very over friendly with the young women around the pool and being very flirtatious even when the girls were clearly with partners who happened to be at activities or the bar. People do book sunbeds early every morning but there are plenty to go around. The bees however are a nightmare and our son was stung on the foot playing volleyball. Even if you have no drink or food near you they are constantly around you. The other issue around the poo are the cats. I am terrified of cats and they were always under the sun beds and jumping up on you. Two fought one day under our sun bed and one of them then had diarrhoea over everything disgusting. I pay to relax on holiday not to have to jump every time a bee or cat comes near me. Staff need to seriously sort this out.    The entertainment music stops at 11:30pm at the latest and then all the lights go out around the pool par area. This made me angry as it was as if we were children being told it was bed time. People used the torch on their phones to sit up talking however this usually ended by 1am. At night it is extremely dark around the bar area and walking back to rooms. For a disabled guest like myself this was very difficult.    The WiFi is only in the lobby and pool side but at least it I see something. Any time we went to reception the staff were more than helpful changing money etc. The other issue to be aware of is the hotel taxi service. This is a rip off. The hotel have a monopoly on this and you need to book through them as there isn‚Äôt nothing else around the hotel. The hotel taxi charged us 190 and the yellow street taxis charged us 100 for the same jounrney back so almost double. The tours from the hotel are very expensive but other companies such as H &L are half the price.    The only reason this hotel is four star is the facitiles eg pool slides and activities. The food drink and staff attitude are not of a four star hotel and this is from experience of all inclusive hotels in fifteen different countries. The staff comment on the reviews of guests and say that they will take these on board but there is little evidence of this as the same issues were written in reviews prior to our holiday as we experienced. This could be a great hotel but there are lots of issues they could improve upon. This was not an expensive holiday and you get what you pay for. I will not be returning again.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hull66

The food was amazing the hotel was clean the staff were lovely especially the entertainment team there was so much to do I never felt bored. They had activities running all day and different theme nights. I would highly recommend this hotel you definitely get your value for money. I stayed for two weeks and I really didn't want to leave it was that good! The only downfall is the gym only had cardio equipment and no weights to use so I was restricted. It is far from everything but the hotel provide you with shuttle buses and transfers so it isn't an issue if you want to go out of the hotel to visit Morocco and go on day trips etc. I felt safe in the hotel we were treated extremely well.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMC98

Use Atlas targa if book a taxi confusion with bigger hotel near marrakech .    We enjoyed a very Relaxing holiday in the labranda. Clean hotel ; lots good food ; fresh waffles and crepes ; pizza & chips for kids all freshly cooked but expect queues for this ! Warning Moroccan people whom stay there feel exempt from queuing !! It's a different culture so expect this and stay calm !    Rooms are cleaned daily Big spacious : we had garden view. Delighted with our rooms .    Bar staff very friendly ! Entertainments staff very friendly and fun . Lots to do ! Main pool is where it all happens . There are 2 quieter pools if u want peace . You choose .    Slides great fun kids . Staff man them daily : life guard on main pool also . Security is high in complex which is great too !    On site shop expensive prices can vary !!!! Go on free shuttle to carrafour shop market and get bus back ! No problem ! 5 mins away drive. 40 min wAlk .  You get 35 min there and bus pass back .    Old town is a experience be alert if kids with u . Do Not use bank cards of any sort there ! They get gobbled up and bank are of No help ! U need passport to get them back !!!!! Use cash only ### ..    New town is expensive upmarket shops. McDonald's etc . Free shuttle in .    We used first marrakech tours.com as taxi to & from airport and when it was needed!!! just text them . Excellent service !    We enjoyed labranda felt safe and relaxing ! But we felt abit compounded ! Nowhere outside of it .. 7 days max if we did go back not 10 days...    Again be aware of the culture diff with locals staying in hotel ... we are in their country . I do feel that tourism is not top of their list in Morocco. .    It was a relaxing enjoyable stay only for 2 /3 mishaps ! But all was sorted and it did not deter us from enjoying what Morocco had to offer !    Would I go back to Morocco ? It's not top of my list ; ..  but hotel stay made is positive and a maybe in the future !!!    Cigarettes 3-4 euro a box  Alcohol is not cheap in supermarkets.. buy on plane .!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jodie H wrote a review Jul 2018,20,Nice but we wouldn't go back,Arrived late and found our 2 rooms were on different floors of the hotel was told to check the following day to see if they could get us rooms next to each other we were lucky the next day to get 2 adjoining rooms. At no point were we told where to find any of the amenities in the hotel we had to find them for ourselves.  Staff seem to be very miserable and are very unhelpful the reception staff in particular made us feel like we were interrupting them if we had a questionthe entertainment team seemed to be the only group of staff who were happy to be at work and they do a great job. Kids club was very much only for the much younger kids.  Pools are nice and clean bees and flies are a problem if you leave sugary drinks around to attract them!If you want a sunlounger at the pool side you'll have to get out early in the morning to put towels out to reserve them. Beach towels can be got at the hotel tickets for them are given at reception.  There is an on site nurse in case of any sickness or injuries we did notice a number of people walking around with their heads bandaged up!!  There is a big selection of food in the restaurant and most of it was nice. The freshly cooked pasta and pizza was a bug hit with the kids. Flies around the bread section was a problem and I did find ants in my croissants one morning.  The on site shop is very poorly stocked and over priced. A good tip is to take your own inflatables for the pool as they are expensive on site.  Rooms are nice and housekeeping do a great job.  The free shuttle bus into town is great but do not let the locals who hang around the bus drop off talk you into them taking you for a tour you'll be gone for hours!! If you do want to use the bus make sure you book it the previous evening as it does fill up quickly.  We visited the Medina one evening and our 4 kids were petrified! Monkies were thrown into their arms and we were then told to hand over money for the pleasure!  Overall we had a great week but the 7 days were plenty as there really wasnt much to do as the hotel is so remote and our kids were too old for the kids clubs activities.  (One thing we wish we had of been told about prior to arriving in Marrakech which isn't to do with the hotel is the forms that have to be filled out before you can go through customs so if you do travel here make sure you have a pen in your bag otherwise like us you'll be waiting over half an hour to borrow a pen off someone!),Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodieh224

Had four awesome nights chilling by the pool enjoying lots of great food and drinks water slides and the in-hotel entertainment    Positives:    The staff are really friendly and welcoming The food is great. The pool / slides are awesome. There is a free bus to the city centre several times a day.    Special mention to the animation team a group of enthusiastic young people who work hard from morning to late at night every day to keep your kids entertained with choreographed songs dances and sports from pool parties to Lord of the Dance to Beach Volleyball. Shout out especially to Smiley Mehdi Hannah Brad Dany and Samy.    Shout out also to the bar staff especially friendly ismail (from the outdoor bar) and the pool guys / lifeguards especially Yusuf who made me feel welcome from day one.    Negatives    Fort me the only bad thing was the other guests. The people with bratty rude kids. The people who barge to the front of the buffet queue and take all the food for themselves (it's a buffet guys you can return in five minutes for more french fries). The people who put their towels out on the deckchairs in the morning and expect to have exclusive rights for the rest of the day. The person who stole my towel on day two. The woman who hid one of the communal pool toys under her towel during aqua fitness class thus depriving someone else of the enjoyment. These people should learn to respect others.    I would encourage everyone to visit this hotel but please be nice to each other.    As a last note my kid left a toy behind in the room if the manager reads this could you contact me thanks,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happywanderer101787
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Mayamah wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Dont forget to haggle!,Travelled in family of 11 for 5 nights.    Check in was hassle free you are greeted politely you do have to pay city tax which was approximately ¬£15 per room (5 nights) you are asked to fill in a small info card which then you will receive a welcome pack. All Staff including bar staff and animation team were so friendly and polite they really did try their best to accommodate your wishes. We spoke with one of the staff members who kindly made a complimentary birthday cake and brought it out to us at dinner. Do take advantage of the free shuttle busses which take you the city. On arrival there is a guide who can take you to the market however we didn't find much use of him as he took us to certain pricey shops. At the market you will come across few people who will stop you to tell you about the tours they offer including camel riding and quad biking. This is so much cheaper than what the hotel offer. If you are looking for a hammam or spa but find the hotel spa out of your price range you can ask the shuttle bus driver who can locate you you can haggle with spa owners located in the city who will bring the price down. When buying from the market they will take advantage of you being a tourist so make sure you haggle. Entertainment team were full of energy they led water sports 'aqua fitness' activities through out the day & at night danced with the children. However 'Maxi club' which offered activities aimed at older children such as darts was closed for some reason. As the hotel is located on the outskirts and if you have not booked any excursions you will spend majority of the day lounging around by the pools.    For breakfast chef would prepare wafflescrepes & omelettes. There was a wide selection of bread and fruit available. I found on a few days lunch and dinner did not offer much selection of food. A barbecue was situated outside offering different selection of meats however que could be lengthy at times. There were three fridges filled with water bottles two located in main dining hall and one in the bar. Being under the sun all day having access to water was so handy. There was also a bar located by the pools offering alcoholic & non alcoholic drinks. At snack which was located at the bar 3-5pm offered a small but nice selection of cakes paninis waffles crepes and baguettes. One of our family members did get a upset stomach this may be due to flies being near the food.    Rooms were spacious and were kept tidy by the lovely cleaners who would also provide toiletries daily. We were lucky to be given a balcony room & with there being 11 of us we were able to change the rooms to be closer to each other. Wifi is only available in lobby and rooms nearest to the lobby you are able to pick wifi signal.    Overall it was a pleasant trip perfect for those who like to lounge around by the pool.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayamah

Our stay at this hotel was good however we didn‚Äôt leave overly impressed with the holiday. The food was below average not very much choice and family‚Äôs with picky children would really struggle. The bread was stale and covered in flies and I did get an upset stomach towards the end of the holiday. The entertainment was good and the staff at the hotel especially the animation team where very nice however as a young couple we didn‚Äôt feel like we were taken seriously by the front desk staff be careful when booking ‚Äúfull board‚Äù as at the hotel this means that you are all inclusive but not alcohol to be allowed alcohol you must upgrade to a pink wristband which we where told by the staff at the desk that it would be 200 Diruhm per person per day however another couple we talked to managed to upgrade for ¬£80 between the two of them. We went on the Marrakech dessert adventure trip and it was okay however we payed ¬£180 between the two of us an it was no where near worth the money. We where told that it would finnish at 10 pm and we didn‚Äôt get back to the hotel until 1am  they say that everything is included however you have to pay for water which they wouldn‚Äôt serve us because they didn‚Äôt have any change which was awful in the 42 degree heat and you also have to pay for a 7 Diruhm scarf for the quad biking.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Christine S wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Nice but could do better!,Lovely hotel but there is plenty of room for improvement...  The hotel and gardens were very clean with gardeners working around the clock to keep it looking lovely. The pools could do with a bit of maintenance below the water line as they looked grubby!  The restaurant was a mish mash with little variety and not enough choice or just not enough prepared of specific things so you could never have a complete meal! The queues were on some occasions rediculous! My biggest bug bare was insufficient labelling for myself as wheat intolerant and my daughter as a vegetarian. They didn‚Äôt seem educated in wheat as an intolerance and this made our mealtimes on occasion tearful and fractious but when contacting the restaurant manager they did try to help! Breakfast was the best meal with lots of choice.  The rooms were ok but the maid service was inconsistent in timing and what she did ...sometimes we didn‚Äôt even get towels!  The bar service was good once you got there but it closed around the pool at 5 .. no good for us as we like a civilised gin and tonic at this time and had trouble getting one!  The overuse of single use plastic water bottles and straws was crazy... we spoke to them about water refill stations and paper straws and they did seem to be open to suggestions and listen ... we will see!!  The beer was only in bottles which seemed such a waste and was never cold as they couldn‚Äôt keep up with demand! Draught beer would easily rectify this?  The reusable plastic cups around the pool and throughout the resort was brilliant.  The entertainment staff worked tirelessly especially Brad who had so much energy it was in sane! Another 2 people worth mentioning were the chopping fresh fruit guy who always had a smile and one morning he changed to making omelettes and his speedy system made us laugh! The waiter Abdelmoula in the outside part of the restaurant in the day time had a great sense of humour and had our glass of wine ready for us as we always sat down at his tables.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,meganrayn0r wrote a review Jul 2018,10,Never again!,After a delayed flight and long wait for the transfer at the airport the first thing we wanted to was shower and chill.    We arrive at reception and get asked to fill in a form no problem. Then to pay city tax I wasn‚Äôt sure what this was and asked she couldn‚Äôt explain it and had to ask someone else to. Then we couldn‚Äôt go to our room as it wasn‚Äôt ready we had to wait or go and get something to eat. This was slightly annoying.    Cleaner late 5-6 in the evening.    Woman entertainer putting blunt side of knife to my throat as I was walking out of the restaurant. And she found it funny I was in shock and didn‚Äôt really know what to do.    Food isn‚Äôt hot not much variety.    Staff shortage they do not have enough staff to cope with the demand in the restaurant or the bar. Tables not cleared and relayed.  Cutlery and plates not available even when you go and find them yourself it‚Äôs empty.  Queuing for chips and you could be there for half an hour 40 minutes.    Best food is the Italian bar. Sounds great but all it is is fresh spaghetti and fresh pizza which there is always a line for and if someone takes half a pizza it‚Äôs another 20 minutes so you could be there half an hour or more. Only seen it with 2 members of staff there once.    The restaurant is open for 3 hours at a time not everyone goes at once but as it has got busier we were walking around for 10 minutes trying to find somewhere to sit. Then end up sitting at a dirty table.    Bar there is only 1 bar open at a time so expect long queues.  I have stayed in several all inclusive hotels now and I have never been told to bring back my plastic cup every time I want another drink. I understand that it‚Äôs courtesy but really???    Adults pool is great we found it after another couple who were staying near it had told us how to get there. Downside miles away from any bar. There is a hut there that they could even put a fridge with water would be great.    Entertainment is nothing to write about really other than its really loud you have to shout to speak to the person next to you. And our room is directly above the bar and outside entertainment. Finishes about half 11. One night there were a group of people being very loud outside our room till 3 am. We also had someone having a party one night till 2 ish.    WiFi poor connection causing myself to use my data minimally costing over ¬£250 3 days into the holiday    Night market terrifying! Do not recommend it to anyone. Myself and my friend were already pre warned. So we took what we really had to in our bras. All we wanted was a little henna tattoo and a cute reminder of Marrakech.  Overwhelming amount of people were there. Not an issue. We didn‚Äôt have a pre discussion before. A couple on the coach from the same hotel said they had a discussion and they said the tour guide would stay with the group. That didn‚Äôt happen got told to meet back at that point.  You get the hustle and bustle of a foreign market. Being hassled for money food and even cigarettes. That was frustrating but not as frustrating as what happened next being approached by a full term pregnant woman offering henna so we said yes she took us to a different place where they were set up there were 4 ladies but only one did the henna. We kept asking how much they finally said once it been done it‚Äôs normally 2000-3000dr which is roughly ¬£200-¬£300. We were shocked she said she would do it for a 1000. We felt very uncomfortable with handing over ¬£100 for a tattoo that wasn‚Äôt that great and wasn‚Äôt permanent. To get us out of that situation we paid and went to leave as I got up another woman grabbed my hand and started doing the other one after I said no serval times then did the same to my friend. Then asked for more money after saying We like you don‚Äôt worry. We then had to hand over another 600dr ¬£60. Every time we tried to leave they would make it impossible. We felt very intimidated and frightened. The tour guy apologised but that didn‚Äôt change the fact we lost a lot of money and didn‚Äôt feel safe. Lesson learnt just want to warn other people it should have cost ¬£5 50dr!  The horse and carriage after was good mainly down to our driver was funny and very talkative and settled our nerves.  When we booked the tour at the hotel the guy was happy to take our money and tell us what time to be at the meeting point but nothing else.

It was really clean with the rooms serviced every day. Staff were helpful and friendly. Food was amazing plenty of variety. The trick is to get there early or very late in the servings as the queues can be long especially for the pizza which my kids loved. A nice man changed our rooms when we discovered they were not beside one another. I would recommend this hotel for a family holiday. Not a lot to do in the surrounding area but you can take the bus into the old town. Be prepared to say no to people trying to sell you stuff and give you unrequested tours.

The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms kept clean with a spacious and relaxing poolside area with a water slide and activities for children to do if they please also. However it isn't located in a place where you can leave the hotel in the evening and walk around therefore be prepared to travel into the town to see the markets etc by taxi which you can easily be ripped off by if you don't have an idea of prices etc before hand! Also be careful of people prying on you being a tourist when you do the excursions as it seems tourists are easy targets to get money out of.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,kryswhiting wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Great hotel,My partner and I stayed here from 18th June - 28th June.    Hotel in general was great smaller than I had expected but that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing.    Food: was one of the best we ever had we always had a good choice of food and if you‚Äôre fussy then pasta and pizza is served everyday for lunch/dinner. Breakfast was the best meal with a choice of sausages scrambled egg etc omelettes which were made in front of you and to your liking and also a vast range of pastries. Lunch and dinner served the same type of food and changed slightly day to say. I think the hotel cater more for the French; the labels for the food we‚Äôre also written in French.    Drinks: soft drinks were free for all including and some alcohol and beer. Some cocktails you also had to pay for. You can have as many bottles of water you want just grab them out of the fridge I thought this was a fantastic idea.    Room: we didn‚Äôt have a balcony so ended up having to dry our swimming costumes on the desk in the room and also hung our towels up in the bathroom after we had washed. The room itself was basic but had everything we needed hairdryer and soap etc.    Pools: were fine again basic. They have a kids pool a loud pool an adults only pool and a quiet pool as well as the slides. We didn‚Äôt go on the slides as there was an incident with a group of friends when we went of whom one went down and damaged his leg due to either him being too tall of the water not being deep enough. Something maybe to be wary of.    Animation team: a bit wishy-washy. I didn‚Äôt think they were overly enthusiastic probably the worst we have experienced on holiday. Usually we end up doing loads of activities due to them convincing us (which we quite enjoy) but they rarely came up to us to ask us to join in! And we were by the loud pool! We only went to the evening entertainment a few times as most nights we waited for the shows to begin but after waiting an extra 15mins we didn‚Äôt want to wait anymore! The entertainment is suppose to start at 10!    Trips: we would recommend doing the waterfall trip absolutely stunning however a 3 hour drive each way.    Pros: the hotel is clean food is great and I love that you could have as many bottles of water as you wants!    Cons: there is a serious bee problem (I think there is a beehive by the bar) you cannot have anything but water at the pool or you will be swarmed by bees. A young girl (probably about 2/3) got stung by one too so be careful!    Also our transfer people gave us a list of trips with prices to do with them however when we got to the hotel this was taken away from us (we thought they wanted to sort out our return transfer). Immediately after we were told to join a meeting at 6 where the hotel tried to sell us trips FOR MORE MONEY?! I asked if I could take back our envelope with trips on from our transfer but was told they didn‚Äôt know where it was!! Probably in the bin!! I thought that was appalling.    Overall this hotel is good for the price.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kryswhiting

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,nessav87 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Wonderful All-inclusive Holiday!,"My husband and I had a incredible 10 day holiday at the end of June. We arrived at the airport and had decided to go for the private transfer. Highly recommend this option! Our driver was waiting with our names on a sign and we quickly got to our hotel stress free.    The hotel itself was lovely. We were greated happily upon arrival and quickly brought to our room. The room was beautiful big and spacious however we had upgraded to a pool view thinking this would provide us with a balcony. When we explained this to the reception staff they happily changed our room to meet our needs. Could not have been nicer! We found across the board in the hotel if we communicated our needs nicely the staff were lovely and worked hard to accommodate. Overall this made our stay very pleasant.    The only glitch that came up in the holiday involved the towel rental scheme that is offered. We left our rental towels on sunbeds--as is normal in a secure holiday resort-- and came back to find the towels gone. We noticed that two out of the four towel staff were gathering people's towels and returning them to the rental station before the day's end. The staff assured us they had not taken our towels when it was clear that they had. We spoke to management about this and when we explained the situation in detail they seemed very disappointed didn't charge us for the missing towels and gave us the impression they were going to fix this problem. Having said all that that was the 1% let down in an otherwise 99% wonderful experience.    Food was incredible every day! Lots of variety every meal all fresh made. Food staff all very friendly and helpful. Drinks are on continuous flow. No major waiting around. Good variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Bar staff friendly and only too happy to provide to your needs. There is live music every night by the poolside.    People mention bees are a problem with their drinks but just cover your glass. If you don't bother the bee it won't bother you!    Shuttle bus service is excellent. Friendly drivers and timely pickup. Best to be ten mins early for your collection. Visiting old town and new are both great cultural experiences. Watch out for ""guides"" that try to meet you as you exit bus claiming to be from hotel! They have nothing to do with hotel and will take you to the shops where they want you to buy things. Better off exploring on your own!    Room was nicely air conditioned so sleeping in the summer heat was never a problem. Seemed to also cater well for families with young children the animation team was very friendly and seemed quite enthusiastic and energetic.    For anyone on a budget looking for luxury we would highly recommend this hotel! Incredible value for money. All in all every need is covered helping to create a relaxing holiday you will always remember!",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nessav87
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,S-cronie wrote a review Jul 2018,20,Nothing like advertised ‚òπÔ∏è,On arrival following long waits for taxis following a 2.30am start we were then left to wait a further 2 hours for our room which was supposedly not ready. 12.30 we had to ask if we could go and eat as our 2.5 yr old was starving followingthe long journey.  No one told us anything or explained the where abouts of anything in the hotel.  Got room to find a filthy toilet seat broken and hanging off a dangerous slippery shower not suitable for a toddler a safe that wouldn‚Äôt close and not bed or towels and linen for our daughter.(time is now 2pm) we ended up complaining about the problems and it took 7 complaints of no bed for our daughter before finally one delivered to the room at 10.30pm by then she had been up since 2.30am had little sleep or food and 2 withering parents.  Finally called it a night to have a disco blasting out right under our window until early hours of morning so still no sleep.  Also we found little activity at the mini club for kids and the pool for the kids water slides was disgusting and not working.other Children‚Äôs pool on one occasion had a light fitting hanging in the water with bear wires showing.  The place was full of wasps (with allergies to them made my life hell)  Also no changing facilities for young children in any public toilets and if your room was up on top floor or room over back of hotel it made changing your child difficult.  Food was repeatative and Luke warm at times although a lot very tasty and good selection provided.  floors constantly slippery from drink spillage nearly braking my neck numerous times ( not the best when I have a back condition)  Staff pretty friendly sometimes over friendly.  Plus side main pool very clean plenty of sun beds and the pool staff very helpful.  Would be a lot better if throughout the day there were bar attendants taking away  Peoples empty glasses to prevent wasps and maybe a wash down of areas around the outside bars.  Didn‚Äôt manage to get many photos as was there to relax with my daughter and partner on a well needed break just shame we had the complaints really  Hotel is very deceiving in the photos shown by holiday providers not as large as it shows and is massively smaller in size,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The-newt77
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,pat e wrote a review Jul 2018,40,worth the money a nice little get away,I booked this holiday through teletext and therefore did not see any reviews on the hotel. That said when we arrived at the hotel we were a little worried as it appeared to be in the middle of no where. when we woke we found it to be clean and tidy.The room looked over the main pool which was the family pool so a little loud there were slides and an adult pool if you wanted quite time. The entertainment staff were all very good and worked hard to entertain everyone the cleaning staff work endlessly to keep the area clean and so did the gardeners.The food was ok but not varied enough but manageable as we were only there a week. The down fall was the reception stafff did not come across very friendly or in fact helpful due to not being able to speak English however they did refer us to the tour operate booking man who could speak English a little frustrating at times. The tours were expensive and a lot of holiday makers complained on their return about additional costs once there. The hotel was in an area that you could not go out and walk around as there was nothing to look at other than derelict buildings so therefore you were almost at the mercy of the tours there is a shuttle bus that goes into town however you are told CLEARLY not to walk around Marrakesh on your own the first time. the down side was the bees they were everywhere especially around drinks and the bar area but I never got stung and did not know of anyone that did. the air conditioning was not very good and the WI Fi was worse its free but only in reception and very difficult to get on to. the dinning staff were very keen to clear the table at times We had to fight to keep our plate so be warned dont put your knife and fork down as it will be gone and if you need to go and get something else ensure someone is at the table to make sure your food is still there when you come back overall this was a nice hotel and accommodated families well. I would go back for a short break but not a longer holiday as I felt restricted to the complex due to all the horror stories we were told by people who had been on the trips and the cost of them.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Margate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499pate
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,zenia1232018 wrote a review Jul 2018,20,Would not visit again!,The food at the hotel was nice. The swimming pools had dead bees in it and there was bees absolutely everywhere! Couldn‚Äôt even get drinks because there was bees everywhere which put me off I would leave my drink for a second and there would be about 5 bees inside the cup. Their was 6 of us women in two rooms which had one joint balcony however the balcony was not safe. There were a few trees in front and that was it men kept parking their vans and sitting right outside and smoking which meant throughout our time in the hotel we couldn‚Äôt go on the balcony and couldn‚Äôt even keep our curtains open as their was no nets so we were always in the dark with our balcony‚Äôs locked. We asked at reception for them to move us and they didn‚Äôt seem to be bothered about our concerns and without even checking just said their were no rooms available and to come back the next day. The next day my mum spoke to a lady called Fatima who was helpful and came to our room to have a look at the men sitting outside in their vans and moved them and assured my mum it wouldn‚Äôt happen again however the next day it was happening again. My mum then complained to one of the Meeting point men who said we should have come to her and he would have got us moved straight away however it was a bit late as we were leaving the next day and the receptionist surely should‚Äôve told them about it. The bar staff also made comments which made me and my sister feel unsafe such as ‚Äúwill you marry me‚Äù ‚Äúare you married do you have kids‚Äù you can imagine as a 18 and 20 year old girl that would make you feel very uncomfortable. Never take room 5009 or 5011 especially if you want any form of privacy! We were supposed to get a garden view but were basically given a car park view.    I have included some pictures of our balcony and how we had no privacy in our room what so ever which was very unsafe for 6 women to stay in!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zenia1232018
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Beth M wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Definitely worth the money,I got back from this hotel a week ago and my gosh do I miss it!!!!! Me and my partner stayed for 12 days and had a fabulous time. The weather was absolutely beautiful and we spent most days sitting around one of the 4 pools they had! Whether you want to sit around the busy pool where you can chat to the animation team and listen to the loud music or whether you want to sit near the pool that has the slides that‚Äôs not as busy or even if you want to sit at the adult only pool which is quiet and calm there is a variety of choice! The food had a large variety and breakfast was our favourite with fresh omelettes and fresh crepes and waffles with all sorts of sauces! Delicious! We were also lucky to experience the the end of Ramadan and Eid which was a lovely celebration!    Animation team were wonderful. They spoke fluent French and very good English. I will definitely miss Brad Hannah Ivo Sam Noha and Momo. They were such fun! Always getting you involved if you wanted to be and constantly entertaining everyone with their brilliant dancing!  I also want to shout out to the lovely bar staff! They were all excellent but I remember Asaraf and Ismail the most. I found the Moroccan spirit measures to be VERY strong so whenever I went to the bar I would have a laugh and joke with them and always ask for ‚Äúand English vodka please‚Äù and they knew what I meant! Brilliant guys!  The hotel is secluded so you need to book the free bus to get anywhere which is simple.. just ask at reception and they sort it for you. Also the hotel has its own cats and kittens which are gorgeous and SO friendly!!!! They wander around and come to you if you call them.    Now the reason I did not leave 5 stars is for a couple of minor reasons. These reasons would NOT stop me going back but o still feel I should mention them.  Firstly: the bees literally drove me crazy. They are EVERYWHERE.. you leave your drink unaccompanied for 2 minutes and you have 3 bees on your drink. When you go to the outdoor bar there is a huge swarm next to the bar which always freaked me out but didn‚Äôt stop me getting a drink and the bar staff make you feel very calm about them.  Secondly 3 days into the holiday I found a ton of ants next to my bed on the floor and so I reported it to reception and asked to move rooms... they kept making excuses about there being no spare rooms and asked me to come back the next day... so I did... and again apparently no spare rooms... this wasn‚Äôt true as I knew for a fact next door was unoccupied so there must have been tons more unoccupied rooms. Anyway a cleaner came and sorted the ants and they didn‚Äôt really return so wasn‚Äôt too bad.  All in all a FABULOUS holiday and I will definitely return.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,dansthe14u wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Excellent Hotel,We stayed for 4 nights at the start of June and thought what a fantastic hotel with beautiful gardens and spotless. A warning you do get loads of wasps around the place but none sting you and there is nothing the hotel can do about these. The animation team was absolutely the best I have every come across It was Ramadan when we went yet the team still had so much energy all through the day into the evening. They was all great movers on the dance floor and they will always teach you some dance moves.    Room was cleaned everyday and left spotless the sink was blocked but once I informed the reception this was dealt with within no time at all. Everyone was so polite but we did find the reception girls could do with smiling more but they was still helpful.    If heading out to the old town please be aware you will be grabbed as soon as you set foot off the minibus and made to walk around with an unofficial guide. If you don't want this please say to them no thank you and walk off to do your own thing but please be polite. First they just took you around friend and family they have stores but if you tell them what shops you want they will show you where they are. please also take note if you have small children and go to the market square you will find small monkeys locked in cages. Also do not get a Henna done as they rip you off and charge you ¬£50 when the hotels do them for under ¬£10.    All inclusive was good although food could be better but that's just my opinion Long lines at the Pool and main bar more staff needed for sure. A big down side for me is that the bar closed at 11pm sharp and that's it the night has ended they should go on till at least midnight.    overall It was a great holiday and i'm looking to go back next year if not before.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansthe14u

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jenniferohjenny1990 wrote a review Jun 2018,20,"Started off ok, ended bad",After reading some reviews on here I was not expecting much and to be honest normally take the reviews on here with a pinch of salt.    On our arrival at the hotel we were asked to sit down in the reception area and fill in some paperwork and then go to reception to sign in. We did the paperwork and then went over to the desk where we were left for about 5 minutes where no one spoke to us but just carried on what they were doing on the computer. I made a comment and eventually we were welcomed to the hotel. We were asked to come back in an hour as our room wasn't ready. so got changed and went and sat by the pool for a little while. when we went back to the reception desk we were asked to go back in 15 minutes so went away and came back. We were then upgraded to a suite room which was nice but did't really need. We weren't given any welcome meeting about what was going on or given a map of what was in the hotel but we figured it out as is pretty small.    Bad points :    We were given the wifi code which didn't work and I went back to the reception but they couldnt careless. I know it isnt about wifi but I needed it to get information for our trips out of the hotel. so we incured a rather large phone bill when we got back.    Food all very much the same each lunch time and dinner time which got boring.    Bees everywhere in the day time and felt quite bad for the workers as they were being stung.    Good points:    Entertainment team were good at keeping us entertained.    The rooms were clean but did see the odd cockroach and ants.    To finish the review off unfortunately towards the end of the holiday I started to feel poorly. The last day my stomach wasn't great and for a week on return to the UK I have suffered diarrhea and stomach cramps.    I have emailed the hotel and had no response with regards to the illness and the customer service.    Obviously everyone has a different experience on holiday but this is ours and I hope if you stay here you have a better time.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fairford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenniferohjenny1990
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Mummy j wrote a review Jun 2018,40,"Fun and friendly holiday, stress free!",We travelled as a family of three with a 9 year old to the Labranda Targa early June and I was pleasantly surprised having read some mixed reviews. The rooms were clean and spacious enough. Air conditioning worked a treat (not sure about the need for the thick duvets though in 30 degree heat!!). I would recommend ladies take a small mirror as our room had only one in the bathroom which was too warm after 3xshowers on an evening!    Pools are nice not too busy always able to get a bed though usual towelgate situation on a morning for the poolside spots!    Pool bar gets VERY busy for drinks with long/slow queues which can be a drag. I just got lots of bottles of water as I couldn't be done with the waiting! There are lots of bees as well which of course are attracted to soft/sweet drinks so it was easier not to have them hanging around!    Entertainment team worked tirelessly day and night though this is geared more towards the adults and getting them involved in pool games etc. For younger kids there is a fantastic kids club service offering up to 5 hours of service per day (I think it was 10-12 then 2-5). It was catered very much for younger children though my 9 year old did not want to go which was a shame.    I feel the hotel would benefit hugely from filling the gap for entertainment for the older kids and tweens as they were not really able to join in so much and this made the holiday a little less inclusive.    Food at the hotel was really quite good. Fresh omelettes pancakes cereals fruit etc for breakfast (Not English breakfast which disappointed some guests!). Good variety of meat and fish dishes vegetables rices etc and a fresh pizza/pasta counter and bbq area. Could be quicker on the refils as things emptied quickly. My daughter had no complaints however she is a good eater and was not fussed by a lack of chicken nuggets or processed food. The fresh fruit and puddings were amazing!    Evening entertainment was average we were in bed by 11pm most nights reading or chatting. This suited us as we wanted a nice relaxing holiday which is what we got. There were no round groups or drunken people making a nuisance which was refreshing for an all inclusive hotel.    We visited the local Medina Market taking the free bus from the hotel. We all went into the new town. Both are well worth doing. Just be prepared to say no a lot! And we also had some sellers being rude to us when we looked and said we would return later. It was not at all overwhelming I felt well prepared having read about the culture and as we visited during Ramadan we dressed respectfully with their values in mind.    All in all a lovely holiday. I would consider returning to Labranda Targa if the entertainment for older children was better catered for.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gateshead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twitterbuggle

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,trevor p wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Great hotel,Stayed here for a week. Great hotel great food . DO NOT listen to the negative reviews. For those who have complained then they seriously need their head looking at. The hotel is so clean. I have never been to a hotel with so many cleaners. They were even washing down the doors of every room. Gardeners out ever day attending to every part of the grounds. The food is fantastic. Enough choice for everyone. Breakfasts are cereal pastries hamcheese spicy sausage eggs ommlette station a huge range of salads and breads. Also a selection of fresh waffles and pancakes and donughts. . Lunch was huge amounts of salads fresh pasta and pizza. There was always a meat dish  fresh BBQ and plenty of veg and pasta including vegetarian food. Same goes for evening food massive amounts of choice. I have put 10 lb on in a week. . Really if any one moans about the food then stick to benidorm for plain English food . You are in Africa you need to experience good Moroccan food..  We needed to change our room and mouna in reception was fantastic. We changed and all done in 10 mins . Yes the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. We did our research and found this out so we were ok with it. There is a supermarket 25 mins walk away which we did everyday to work off the breakfast. We got there free bus in to the city which you have to do if u go to Marrakech. What's the point not seeing it. .  Hotel has a few pools. Main one is loud and busy . Small ones for kids and a quiet one if you want to relax and read so something for everyone  My down sides are  Only one bar open during the day. This gets really busy so another bar should be opened  Gym. Yes I use the gym and sadly only cardio machines. So please get a weight rack and at least a few weight machines and I'll definitely be back.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,HARTLEPOOL UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nipy70

Hotel is pleasant and the food is good a couple of times I needed to reheat it but it wasn‚Äôt a problem as there is a microwave you can use. You can only get water or wine in the restaurant no beer but the wine is lovely. Great choice of pools if you want some action stay by the main pool as there is plenty of loud music and activities- the entertainment team are really good and work very hard. If you want quiet you can go to the pool up the back (near the slides) or the adult only pool which is really peaceful. Not much outside of the hotel but a trip to the old town via the hotel shuttle is a eye opener! Spent a day here and really enjoyed shopping and watching the locals going about there business. And was amazed as they didn‚Äôt hassle us to buy anything if you said no thank you they left you alone. Check your travel plugs before you go I had three two pin plugs with me but one wouldn‚Äôt fit two of my plugs had a hole above the two pins and they worked but the third didn‚Äôt have the hole so wouldn‚Äôt fit. Adult bar was really good in the evening the lads who sang and entertained us we‚Äôre brilliant. Just three things I would say to the management which would improve things a little get a toaster that works properly get some more glasses in the bar near the pool so those hard working barmen don‚Äôt have to keep running around trying to collect them and please tell your sunbed lad not to wake people up and make people move so he can straighten the sun chairs at the end of the day.

Big walk in shower which was great maids did an amazing job at cleaning our rooms daily.    Staff at the hotel were very friendly and entertainment services were great. Bartenders are really lovely. Sometimes I did find it better to sit in the adult area only pool as it is more relaxing but each to their own. We went all inclusive despite the fact that the drinks selection isn‚Äôt greatttt at this hotel I did manage to get drunk everyday lol.    Location is far I won‚Äôt lie to you but there is a shuttle bus that runs every 2 hours .. we used to get the 8pm one everyday after dinner then get a cab back which I husstled down to 80 Dirhams.    Dinner was very nice on certain days certain days it was disappointing .. it can be slightly bland but guess they have to cater for everybody. Breakfast needs more selection I think personally. Only thing I will fault about this hotel is the snacks considering your paying all inclusive no crisps and etc are provided. Not a huge fault tho it‚Äôs minor.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,ashleyB_187 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,A proper hotel in a haven just outside of Marrakech,Myself and 2 friends wanted some sunshine so decided to have 4 days in Marrakech at this hotel and it did not disappoint.    The hotel is situated 5-10 minutes outside of Marrakech but do not let that put you off - I personally think its the best thing about it.    The hotel is about 45 minutes from the airport.    Upon arrival we were taken into a meeting room and given a welcome talk - we were provided with wifi codes & wrist bands for the all inclusive.    The food here is freshly made and often has a themed evening such as Italian or Mexican with fajitas etc. There is always a large bread / pastries table and a large selection of salad olives sauces & then of course sweet. The food is one of the best selection of all inclusive's I have had the pleasure of staying especially with regards to the cost of the holiday.    The hotel has 3 pools - 2 main ones and an adult only. The adult only pool is to the right of the resort and doesn't have any entertainment or music but is quiet and often busy. The main pool provides entertainment and is a child friendly pool.    There are several bars that serve throughout the day and the entertainment staff are fantastic in engaging and making friends.    The rooms are large - we had one with 3 single beds we struggled with towels (They kept replacing two instead of 3) and they only apparently had 1 iron (so time is limited to 1 hour) but other than that we were thoroughly impressed with house keeping during our stay. We had a room overlooking the pool and would advise that.    The wifi whilst strong in the main entrance is limited elsewhere and unreachable in the rooms but this also makes for a nice relaxing holiday at times.    You must book the shuttle buses into the old town and new as they do get fully booked.    The hotel also has its own concierge who can book trips etc for you but the costs are hugely inflated therefore my advice as we did would be to book online as we did through get your guide and they will collect you from the hotel anyway.    Overall we were impressed for price v money and would recommended this holiday and hotel to our friends.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Mickleton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleyB_187
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Heather D wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Missing it already :(,Firstly be warned my reviews are always long but i like to be thorough and true. The hotel is beautiful very clean and well set out. Food is amazing all though if you're like me and eat a certain diet i weight train so eat only a high protien low carb diet you will struggle as everything is smothered in oil for cooking and constantly added. I know this as i went to the Arabic cooking lessons which i suggest you go to they're great fun. You can at breakfast ask for just fried egg (done on a grill not fried in oil) but there is lots of cheese scrambled egg boiled egg grilled tomato with cheese and also a muesli kind of cereal. I also do not have caffiene so decaf coffee and tea you will need to take but they do have sweeteners. There are no weight's at the gym so either take resistance bands or do as i did and fill empty water bottles with sand from the kid's pit or volleyball court. Plenty of bottled water and for those who won't drink it like my son i took a Robinsons squirty juice and added that. Only alcohol available in the main food area are wines so if you want anything else you will have to get that from the Cosy bar on your way. The staff in all areas are fantastic we had such a laugh with everyone. If you approach with a smile and a hello you will get far nobody want's to be greeted with a grump! You can have free Arabic lessons which came in handy and easy to learn. The pool's are great and the sun heated them enough for nobody to complain when getting in them. There is a Honey bee problem but they do not hurt you you will get used to them by the second day. We found using empty water bottles to put our drink's in helped because they couldn't get to it they went elsewhere. We were upgraded free and im so grateful for that because we had constant aircon movies on the tv overlooked the pool and the patio doors kept noise out if you wanted peace. Our shower was HUGE that the kid's from the other room's we had booked all came for a shower in mine and called it slip and slide. The kids could actually slide on their stomachs from one side to the other such fun i know because i tried it but on my feet lol We left all kind's of expensive stuff out and cash and not once did anything go missing there is a free safe and it will fit a laptop in the cleaner's are thorough friendly and trustworthy. Each day an entertainment programme goes up with a dress code for dinner to. This is not compulsory but great fun. White night red night black tie (id packed dickybows for the lads which they loved) and fancy dress. If you're like us and love dressing up then take clothing to go with these themes.  Now for the only bit that put us off wanting to go back and made us want to book flight's home. The entertainment programme with Maxi Club consist's 99% of adult only. Yes it advertises kid's club but please note that unless they take note of the complaint's then this should be an adult only hotel. Kid's club is supposed to be 4-12yrs this is nothing more than face painting and colouring in and unless you realise you won't even know it's on. Mini disco is also aimed at 4-12yrs trust me it's for under 7's Everything else is adult based and they will not let kid's join in except for aqua exercises. My children and other's they met were aged between 8-14yrs and they were all bored and had to make their own fun mainly running around playing tig and hide and seek. Some were crying and begging to go home which had myself and other's having to talk to the Maxi club staff. I was advised to talk to Sammi the manager about this. After him seeing how upset the kid's were and me explaining that it was an adult only based hotel and that they needed to have some of his team get a club up for children within this age to do dart's basketball and all the other stuff the adult's only were allowed to do i noticed the day after that this changed and Noah was walking around gathering kid's to go to kid's club and the other's Sam Brad Momo Hannah Naz Smiley and Ivo were involving the kid's. This made a massive difference to everyone's holiday. If thing's change and a 'teens' club is put together then we will be back like a shot and would highly recommend it to other families. This is a fantastic hotel and i hope they take this on board. Thank you to absolutely everyone for whatever part you played in our holiday. Special shout out to the pool bar lad's who i had a scream with all the time. If you take on board my earlier comment about Arabic lesson's you will be fine going out and about and not feel so intimidated. I suggest you check that thing's for kid's have changed before you book if you're taking kid's because it's not a holiday when they're bored and upset. Enjoy this place it truly is amazing.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wigan, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3886YPheatherd
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,paul b wrote a review Jun 2018,40,It Is What you pay for,My honest opinion of this hotel is that it is a small location but it provides you with all the amenities you may require. I walked round the complex in 5 to 10 minutes visiting all pools and both restaurants  There are 5 pools  which are 1 adult only1 small child pool 1 main pool for aqua aerobics water polo and most other day time activities 1 water slide pool and medium sized pool.  There is an area for beach volleyball near to the water slides.  There are 3 bars 1 by the water slides open from 10am till 5pm the cosy bar open from 5pm till 11pm and the sports bar which is not part of the all inclusive package but it is were you can purchase branded spirits and various cocktails.  There are 2 restaurants 1 serves the main food during the day the other resturant is the Moroccan Restaurant which you have to book and pay 10 euro per person this is the al la carte restaurant.  There is one shop a shecha corner and a well being centre with spa there is also a small gym.  The rooms are spacious and cleaned daily.  The food is varied and edible with the added choice of Italian and a small selection of food cooked on a bbq  The animation team were very energetic .  Be aware if you go on the trip to the Ouzoud waterfalls it involves traveling for 2 1/2 to 3 hours to reach them and you need trainers or other suitable footwear for steep climbs also this is not for anybody with walking difficulties.  Finally there are a lot of honey wasps around the waste bin areas in the resort also on entering and leaving Morocco you have to fill in a embarquement card,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shoeburyness, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2222HHpaulb

Brilliant choice of foods all piping hot too breakfast consisted of crepes pancakes waffles cereals toast pastries and omelettes and hot food range lunch was amazing rice and pastas meats and soups dinner the same and snack time was just snacky bits all inclusive drinks were fine plenty of alcohol in them.  Only down side for me are the flaming birds at stupid o clock that woke us up and the wasps around pool area so drink your drinks fast!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kat Hoy wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Great stay,Just back from an excellent holiday in this resort.    Rooms - really spacious air con good cleaned everyday with fresh towels left fully functioning mini kitchen so could freeze water bottles for hot days by the pool.    Pools - 5 pools to choose from so something for everyone! So nice having a quiet adult pool for those times when you want to chill. Slides great for kids. Never any issues getting loungers & area very clean. There are lots of wasps but they are honey wasps and don‚Äôt seem to sting.    Staff - animation staff were INCREDIBLE!!!! Non stop entertainment day and night. I hope they are all getting paid very well as they make this hotel an amazing experience. Cleaning staff also excellent. Reception staff were helpful. Meeting point staff quite abrupt and not helpful unfortunately.    Food - I‚Äôm a vegetarian and was impressed by variety of food everyday. Breakfast was always incredible with freshly made omelettes pancakes & waffles amongst loads of other stuff - what more could you ask for! Lunch and dinner varied but I think there was always at least 2 dishes that would suit plus they make fresh pizza and pasta everyday! However as chefs didn‚Äôt have that good an understanding of English it was difficult to determine allergens in the food. This could be solved with labels for foods containing nuts perhaps.    Overall a great trip. As I am pregnant I didn‚Äôt get to enjoy the all inclusive cocktails but my partner loved them & found the bar staff great.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dunmurry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kat_Jim_Cillian

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kash H wrote a review Jun 2018,50,A perfect week!,"We arrived on Monday morning nice and grumpy from an early morning flight (and long tedious entry process into Morocco!).    We were greeted by the reception team and a porter who helpfully took our bags to our room. At reception we were given information about where things are and opening times for eating etc. Our room was spacious clean and the safe was very easy to work! We went and got our towels (they should really give out towel tickets at check in). There is Wi-Fi but only around the pool/reception areas.. getting on is relatively simple and the connection is good!    In terms of food - there was loads of it.. fresh salads decent range (can get repetitive after 7 days!) and lots of space to spread out and eat.    The only downside is that the cutlery is all adult sized and tricky for the little ones to use.. also there seems to be a shortage of small spoons... oh and no porridge in the mornings (it is Morocco afterall!)..but omlettes so all good. My personal favorites include the roasted onion tagine the salad bar and pizza corner. in terms of suggested improvements - they could do with having pasta/spaghetti more regularly available (as the chef takes way too long to cook it!    So what else?    The setting - there's lots of talk about how the hotel is miles away from the hustle bustle and action.. I think this works really well because you get silence.. there's lots of greenery and well kept space around which is very relaxing. The slides are great as are the pools and there's always enough space for sun loungers. People tend to wake up and reserve theirs early on.. we managed to still find a way around this as the pool side staff are always on hand. Pools and slides are watched throughout. There are honey bees but they are manageable!    The music during the day and at the mini disco is perfect.. after this the team decide to take a more ""latino"" direction which isn't to everyone's tastes. I would have preferred them to take this music into the evening!    The staff throughout were amazing (even though it was Ramadan).. the reception staff were probably the least helpful early on... the restaurant staff did their best and they could do with more english speaking staff but hey these are small things in the overall scheme of things!    For me the absolute highlight of the trip was the sensational animations team. They all deserve a massive shout out but I'm going to mention Brad and Nuha in particular.. the way they run the mini disco blew us away.. energetic and enthusiastic all the way and the kids looked forward to it all day! It was Ramadan and they were not only running the evening activities but keep people entertained throughout the day (without water!!). Nuha runs the mini club which kept my girls entertained every day! Brad's ""Gangnam style"" is worth watching if you happen to be around the mini disco after 9pm! We bought the CD which is now going to be the soundtrack to our summer school term.    Chances are we'll be coming back - thank you all for a great week!!",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wilmslow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kashharoon
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,monipatty19 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Best week ever!!!,We stayed here for a week with our two daughters aged 10 and 12 and our in laws and have had the best holiday ever! Our adjoining rooms were cleaned immaculately every day and we were given fresh towels. Our rooms went straight out to the pool area which was also immaculately kept with beautiful shrubbery and paths. There were always parasols and sunbeds available and free beach towels if needed. The food in the restaurant was local tasty and there was great choice of dishes available; both Morroccan and European and always something for vegetarians. The wine was local and great quality too. The pool bat could get busy but the staff were always really friendly and helpful...even when rushed off their feet. The drink choices were varied and my mother in law and I really enjoyed drinking the cocktails! The entertainment was typical hotel standard and the team worked really hard at this. The children loved the dancing parties in the Cozy Bar. There was always a mini disco which little ones enjoyed. The pool area was always buzzing with entertainment and games and the pool fitness classes were really good....I dropped nearly a dress size in a week! The slides were brilliant fun and safety was at the top of the agenda. There was a guy monitoring the slides at all times and in the bigger pool a life guard. All of the staff had a good laugh with us. The other guests were mostly British and French so it was a great opportunity to dust off the GCSE French but most of the staff spoke good English anyway and Arabic.  In conclusion the staff food atmosphere activities and hotel were great and we would certainly consider returning for another visit. Well recommended.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Deal_trio wrote a review Jun 2018,50,No complaints from us!,We arrived at the hotel in the morning and were immediately told to leave all our luggage in the main reception area and escorted into a room (later discovered this to be where the kids‚Äô evening entertainment is presented followed by some family entertainment...) where some rep told us about all the spa facilities and excursions seeming particularly excited about the ‚Äòmost beautiful waterfall‚Äô even getting a picture of it on his phone although he was too far away for anyone to really see it! There was no pressure to book anything so it seemed a little bit out of the ordinary; we were more interested in getting back to our luggage.    After checking in our bags were taken to our rooms which we were pleasantly surprised with. They were quite roomy with a kitchen separate kitchen and a large shower and toilet area. The beds are extremely hard which is my one criticism making my ribs ache at times. However my husband found the bed to be very comfy!    The entertainment/activities throughout the day was non-stop with Step classes Zumba both in the pool and out of it Aqua gym to name but a few of the exercise classes. There was Water Polo & Basketball Darts Tennis Table Tennis plus many more. Arabic Lessons Tagine demonstrations and so on. The entertainment guys worked very hard around the pool all day and always with a smile on their face even when the kids were badgering them!! They didn‚Äôt let up either as they were running the mini disco at 9pm and carrying on with the evening entertainment.    We had no problem with the food at all. It was plentiful with a good variety of options. There was not a day when I hadn‚Äôt eaten my fill. The kids were happy with pasta pizza chips veg fruit and puddings. My son being the most fussy of our two did end up with pizza most days but he ate a lot of fruit as well so I was happy enough with that. Every day I had a freshly cooked omelette followed by fresh fruit; at lunch I generally had a massive salad and in the evenings there was always a choice of different meats and fish with different vegetable dishes salads soup and bread. We sat at the same table every night and after tipping the wine waiter 50 dirham he made sure our table was vacant with wine and water ready for us every night. This isn‚Äôt essential but we were happy to do it and enjoyed the attentive service we got as a result.    Drinks were plentiful and all the bar staff were cheerful and polite. We never encountered any of the rudeness mentioned in other reviews. They were always happy to chat and were particularly lovely to the kids.    Lifeguards were always around and once they finished for the day no one was allowed in the pool. The slides were fun with the kids disappearing off to play on them at regular intervals. There was an adults‚Äô only pool at the back of the hotel. I never used it but walked past it to go back to our room. It was very quiet there (as opposed to the loud music around the main pool) and well used. We never had an issue getting sun beds; there seemed to be enough for everyone. Beach towels were free but had to be returned every evening but it was nice to have clean ones each day.    My son used the Kids‚Äô Club set inside a lovely purpose built building with a movie room activity area and boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô toilets. Outside was a small playground and beyond that a paddling pool with some little slides. He had his face painted so was very happy!    This hotel is also very popular with honey bees which seem to rather like all the drinks. They were a bit of a nuisance but are quite docile (in our experience) and I wasn‚Äôt aware of anyone getting stung. We just drank water round the pool and if we did have other drinks didn‚Äôt leave them hanging around.    I wouldn‚Äôt be adverse to returning to this hotel as we all had a really great time. I think I would prefer to be somewhere that had other things around it as it really is in the middle of nowhere; you just have to look around when you‚Äôre at the top of the slides but there was enough going on for us for a week.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Whitfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deal_trio
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jabzz M wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Hmmm... Not great,"We are currently staying here and are on our second day of a seven day holiday with our two kids. We arrived on Friday morning and were greeted by the welcome team who seemed nice and helpful to start with. Room is not bad but the mattress is rock solid so it's like sleeping on a plank. We've asked for a topper but they just piled some blankets under the sheet. My wife and son are allergic to cow's milk so we asked for soya milk at reception and they actually said ""you can walk 20 mins down the road to the nearest shop if you want it"". Couldn't believe it! Anyway we managed to talk to Fatima who was very helpful and when got back to our room there was some soya milk on the table.  The staff here are extremely grumpy mainly the bar staff. Its like they hate their jobs. I know it's hot and I know it's Ramadan but it really feels like you're not welcome here. Almost like we're disturbing them especially the inside bar guy. You also have to que for drinks as there is only ever one bar tender serving even when there's 3 of them behind the bar. Its ridiculous. I didn't pay my hard earned money to stand in a que for 15 mins for some cheap alcohol local alcohol.  Some of the food is ok but there isn't much choice and if you want pizza or pasta be prepared to wait a while.  Outside toilets are so bad and every now and again you can smell them from the pool area.  We expected better or at least what we paid for but so far it's not a great time. Kids have made friends so that's a plus.  Won't be coming again that's for sure. They really need to hire friendly bar staff or send them on customer service training courses because it's really bad!!",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jabzzm
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,BMorriss wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Enjoyable holiday but the hotel could do better.,Hotel location:  nothing near it  kids play football on road to it no shops  bars or restaurants. Taxi required to go out.  Hotel run buses to new & old town daily  you will need to book the day before.    Stayed here for a week as a family of three the room beside the pool which was loverly to chill by in the evening. This was cleaned daily.    Entertainment is mostly keep fit or a dancing act both at the pool and later in the evening.  Children‚Äôs Disco is on each evening with the animation team working hard. (Dancing).  The children all loved this.    Drinks during the day are from the pool side bar to which most of the time there are queues as this serves the full hotel  no other bars open ?  Even got asked to collect some empties as they had run out ?  The tumblers and wine glasses are all plastic which are badly worn these are used in the other bar in the evening also  Pool bar is closed at 17:00 hours and you have to go to the cozy bar ( Swim wear not allowed ) so why close the pool bar so early.    Cosy bar :  opens in the evening and has a duet on one on guitar and the other on a keyboard.  Asked for a Black Russian which they could not do as they are only allowed to do the four cocktail on offer! You still have to queue at this bar also. Bar staff requested I go and bring my glass‚Äôs back from out side before getting served the supervisor went mad at him for this.    Tv Sport bar:  Never seen anybody in here due to having to pay and being over price ( whiskey ¬£7 a glass)    Evening entertainment:  dancing or a bit of a show by the animation team. ( they do work hard and long hours).    Restaurant :  large selection of food available not to my liking but I‚Äôm very fussy where food is concerned but the other two enjoyed it.  Pizzas always had to wait  here they can‚Äôt time it right to cook even when the restaurant first opens  they are not ready even then.  You can get a glass of wine with your meal but no beer.    Pool & slides:  had a lot of fun here  sun lounges are plenty . The water is always cold at first but loverly once your in.    Reception:  Will help but most of the time. I smile    Moroccan restaurant:  you pay a little extra here but great to sample the local dishes requested a bottle of Prosecco which they did not have only the all Inclusive drink available.    Power cuts :  we had two of them and you can‚Äôt shower as the room is in total darkness    Water hot :  this failed one afternoon.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,karen m wrote a review May 2018,30,Would not stay again,I stayed at this hotel in April my self and 3 friends. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere the food is good there is something for everyone you won't go hungry but you might by the time you are served from a chef when the hotel decides to take pictures to boost the look of the dinning room and don't care you are stood waiting to be served. Drinks are reasonable. Entertainment in the night is to much like a poor Butlins but the entertainment staff work so hard from early in the morning till late at night.  the bar closes at 11:00 pm but there is a bar open where you have to pay basically your paying for what is free through the day?  The reception staff are very rude indeed they could do with a customer care course.    On arrival to our room there was no towels when a lady brought us towels she asked were we sure there were no towels?  The room smelt of stale smoke as we are non smoker we had to endure the smell.The rooms could do with a little sprucing up! The beds are so hard as are the pillows.    We attended the welcoming meeting with a rep called Nabi who was the most ignorant rep I have ever come across he is fine when taking your money for excursions then nasty when there is a problem with the excursions. he and his fellow workers in the office just leave you sitting there whilst playing on their phones they could not organise a chimps tea party between them.If you are to do any excursions do not do them through the hotel do them on line or before you go.    A free bus runs from the hotel to the souk then back again if you are to go to the souk use the free bus as the hotel charges to take you and bring you back?    It is a bedlum when you arrive at the airport to enter Marrakech you have to fill in a form which should be handed out on the plane so you can fill them in and have them ready then you have to do the same again when leaving Marrakech be prepared to stand in queues.  Then when you arrive at the hotel you have to fill in another form?    If you have transport picking you up when you are leaving the hotel be wary as they do not arrive at the time stated when you ring the number to the transport they will say they have been? There were quite a few people it happened to nd my self and we had to ring a taxi which cost us ¬£15.00 and we had already pre booked transport.    I myself will never return to this hotel but I would return to Marrakech and stay in the city where it is more lively and cheaper to eat and drink than what was payed for to stay here.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123karenm
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Anthony T wrote a review May 2018,40,Middle of Nowhere,Nice(ish) Hotel in desperate need of a paint job but all in all a nice place to be. Food is reasonable usually you will find something that you like to eat and it was all inclusive when we stayed so you grabbed your plate and shuffled along the line. Clean enough and Staff were helpful always although the Reception Staff could be a little rude if you allowed them to be. Pools are nice and BIG and there is a great Adult Only pool very peaceful. Bars are open most of the day. The location of the Hotel is a little dire being about 50 minutes from the Airport you seem to be travelling forever before arriving. The Immigration process into Menara Airport is a long process so beware.  I got this deal through 'Wowcher' never again but we paid a bit extra and it took away the 'Wowcher' sting.    Overall apart from the location the hotel is good food good staff good and they do some good excursions up into the Atlas Mountains which is well worth a go.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,mooboo1493 wrote a review May 2018,30,Budget holiday.,Overall the hotel was good. Although I'd probably give it a 3 star * instead of 4.    The majority of the reception staff were nice and friendly. When we arrived we were told to fill in a form then hand it back pay the local tax which was around 240 dirims (¬£20ish) then we would receive our keys. The concierge was lovely. He took us to our room and showed us around.    The rooms are good. It does need a lick of paint but for what we paid it was absolutely fine. Our air con did not work at all. We did ask for it to be fixed and we were told a technician would be sent out but this didn't happen. We could have complained a second time but to be honest the weather wasn't that hot so it was perfectly fine without.    The bathroom was lovely. Great shower and very spacious.    The room safe did not work. We didn't necessarily need it as the maids were very trustworthy. We did leave a tip out but this was never taken for the duration of our stay until we seen them on the last day and tipped them face to face. The rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels were always left.    WiFi was fine for the first few days (as it was very quiet in the hotel). It could be accessed in reception the restaurant main pool and adult pool. However from the 3rd day onwards there was an influx of guests and the WiFi became very intermittent sometimes not working at all so I can imagine what it's like in the summer months.    The alcoholic drinks are average but again fine for what we paid. There was an assortment of cocktails (I believe around 4) whiskey gin vodka larger and wine (red rose or white- but not the best tasting...). There was also a range of non-alcoholic drinks. Cold bottled water was located all around the hotel which was great. We did notice that they make up other cocktails such as mojitos but I believe the charge was around 7 euro?    The food was ok. However like other reviews have stated it does get a bit samey. Towards the end of our stay our bellys were not great... with the majority of our time left spent on the toilet. It has now been 5 days since leaving and we are still not well both with gastroenteritis. This has to be down to the hotel food as we did not eat elsewhere. Therefore I strongly suggest you watch what you're eating!    The swimming pools are good. We didn't really use the main pool with the entertainment so I can't comment on that however I do know that they were constantly getting people involved and playing good music. We used the adult pool which was great. Very peaceful! We also got WiFi connection there which was good. The pool is not heated so be prepared for the cold! Also the bar was not open at the adult pool so a short walk was needed to get drinks which was fine but a lot of people were commenting on this.    Fly's were sometimes a nuisance around the pool but we took insect/mosquito bands which seemed to do the job. The pools are not technically open until 10am and I believe they close around 6pm? We had no issue getting sunbeds however it is May. I'm guessing this might be different at the height of summer.    Towels are available free of charge. We didn't use this service as we had our own.    Irrespective of what the other reviews say I believe the majority of staff are hardworking and friendly.    Entertainment was ok... It wasn't really for us mainly aimed at kids however the one night we watched it it was a comedy take on a Michael Jackson stripper? Whereby in the end he was just in his underwear. A bit odd and at some moments a bit cringey! But that's holiday entertainment I guess...    In the evening there is live lounge music played in the bar. The pair of guys that play are very friendly and talented.    I should also mention that it was Ramadan when we visited. We had read reviews of other hotels saying that during Ramadan staff can be moody which would have been completely understandable. We did not encounter this so if this is a concern of yours I wouldn't worry about it. They are very used to serving food/drinks etc/ and dealing with guests during Ramadan.    We took two trips to the souks (markets) using the free shuttle bus service. This is a great asset. You have to book the night before your intended visit from 7pm. The bus takes you within a 10 min walk to the souks. We didn't encounter any issues whilst out even though it's known for pickpockets thieves etc. Be prepared to haggle prices and just say no if someone is bothering you.    Would we come back? No. As mentioned previously it was good for the price we paid however if we were wanting to go back to Marrakech we would probably opt for somewhere within walking distance to shops/the centre.  I certainly wouldn't worry if you are reading this review as we did have a good time and from speaking to others they did too. Just remember to watch what you're eating and stick to low-risk foods.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mooboo1493

I arrived to stay for 5 days on arrival asked about upgrading to a balcony room the man at reception said yes the women then instantly said no. Which I thought was odd but accepted. I then asked for a kettle to clean medical equipment which they said was a charge of 22¬£ for my stay which was ridiculous. I went to my room and when walking in saw a pair of women‚Äôs underwear on the floor which I wasn‚Äôt happy about. I went back down to reception to say I wasn‚Äôt happy which I noticed the lady of reception had changed I asked about upgrading to her which she immediately done. I wasn‚Äôt sure why I was declined ten mins before tho. When explaining about the underwear situation they said oh well you are Moving rooms now not to worry. Once getting to new room which was nice the safe wasn‚Äôt working I explained to reception which they advised would be fixed. 3 days later still nothing and asked a fair amount of times. While staying I noticed the room hasn‚Äôt been cleaned but noticed daily our towels have been taken and not returned which having to request new ones. The resort is a hell of a lot smaller than it looks in the photos and not as luxourius. I can‚Äôt fault the food isn‚Äôt a massive selection but was tasty what was there overall wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel and won‚Äôt be returning.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Stephanie A wrote a review May 2018,40,Fantastic.. You get what you pay for!,"After reading mixed reviews we decided to book.. It was my husbands birthday so I booked a surprise trip for him.  The Hotel gave us a free upgrade and we had a pool side view. Fantastic    Drinks are lovely and they have different selections.    Food: My husband is very fussy and even he found something to eat.    People complain about Wi-Fi.. Get over it you go on holiday to relax not to be on your phone.    Rooms are of a good size with plenty space.    The only thing that I didn't like were the ""Meeting Point"" guys very rude. They act like they check you into the hotel so they can charge you ridiculous prices for excurusions ""Avoid"". It's all a scam... My advice is just do what we did say No and walk to the check in desk.    The Hotel as I said is value for money. People should really stop moaning unless they paid Sheraton Hotel money...    Entertainment was good.. They did their best to entertain everyone.. Even though they were fasting they still made an effort. This is very hard we appreciated it.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Simon-Cathy wrote a review May 2018,50,Fab holiday with our granddaughter.,Well we read the reviews and went with mixed feelings. But we made our own minds up.    Absolutely fabulous so glad we went. Initially we had a room with no balcony we asked at reception and the next day after people had checked out we got our room with a balcony so thank you for great service.  The room was lovely rather big. Plenty of space to store bits.  The food was plenty lots of choice nice big restaurant lovely staff constantly clearing tables and cleaning.  The pool is amazing and the entertainment team are just fab. Definitely what makes the holiday along with pool parties on an eve  Going outside is a different situation. The main market area in the centre is full of local traders who are obviously relying on holiday makers to influence there business they can be demanding as can the snake charmer it‚Äôs just best not to have eye contact and be polite and say no thanks.  Other than that. It‚Äôs a lovely place and yes I‚Äôd go back.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simon-Cathy
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Greektanboy wrote a review May 2018,30,You get what you pay for.,"This is an ""All Inclusive"" economy hotel. That said the waiting cleaning and serving staff were all fantastic The restaurant provides a wide selection of food which is fresh and tasty. The rooms are a little tired but quite adequate. We were there to try and see as much as possible of Marrakech. The hotel provides a shuttle but you have to reserve 24 hours in advance. We did this the first day - great going into town but didn't turn up at all to bring us back so had to take a taxi. They tried to charge 150DMS but we refused and offered 100DMS which they accepted; (did this every time and always won). Had to book a taxi though Meeting Point - not good. Charged 130DMS and then made us wait until they had enough to fill a people carrier all of whom were charged 130DMS - RIP OFF! Hard sell from them on trips also -we resisted though did the Atlas Mountain and Waterfall trip. Excellent guide who was worth every penny. Spent a couple of days in the Medina and Souks - fabulous. Be careful of people who offer to show you places - they all charge at least 100DMS each time - a decent guide map and you can find your own way; also beware the leather pits - the manager there has a deal with a local shop - fabulous goods but very over priced - beware being taken to his ""negotiation"" room!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,kestralxx3 wrote a review May 2018,30,Dissapointing,The good bits first Powerful Shower Fairly clean Food OK Nice adult pool/area  Would we go again - No  It was not the Hotel more the attitude of the the staff the waiting and cleaning staff were fine but the reception staff were rude beyond belief they never listened to people but just kept saying NO to everything not just to us but many other visitors as well. At no time were they helpful or interested in people staying at the hotel. The air conditioning was not working when we inquired about it we were shrugged at and told it wasn't working anywhere in building and when we asked if it was going to fixed another shrug!!  When we checked out this morning along with others the staff were most unhelpful there was no interaction he took our key cards and turned away- nothing he was also ignoring another lady asking for help.  We did book a taxi through the Hotel to go into town but once we had passed our money over we were dismissed and had to wait a longtime when going back into building to  inquire where transport was we were just gestured away to wait even longer eventually the older gentleman came out and called a taxi that had been on the complex before we even booked so why the 25 minute wait????  Basically the Hotel is tired and in need of some TLC but that would not stop us going back it was the attitude and disrespect of the staff and the way ourselves and many others were treated,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kestralxx3

Hotel and location- hotel is lovely with 6 pools including the aqua park slides. The hotel grounds are so well kept staff ensure this very much so. Location of the hotel is not good if you are a explorer! You are in literally the middle of nowhere in a poor side of town so it is not safe to Just venture out walking you have to take a taxi everywhere!    Restaurant- food lovely always a good range! HOWEVER my main complaint being this a family hotel there is only 1 high chair for babies!!! Imagine how many people fighting for a high chair every breakfast lunch a and dinner it‚Äôs so terrible!    Kids club and mini disco- a disaster!!!!! The kids club is so boring there‚Äôs no toys only drawing or painting or playing in the playground which is very rundown.

No indoor swimming pool no free jacuzzi no dumbbells in gym.  Very cold water in outdoor swimming pools (may) lots of wasps and flies around the pool - bins should be emptied more often.  Dining area full of flies (also on food) very dirty and sticky tables and floor. All food should be left and available until dining room is opened- most of the food usually has disappeared after about one hour.  Paid fresh orange juice and paid bingo (‚Ç¨10)!  Terrible worn out hallway carpets and lots of ants in the hotel.  Hotel need better English and better customer service skills.  Evening entertainments is provided by hotel staff only.  Positives:  animation staff is working hard food is tasty although suits more for vegetarian and a bit too cold.  Free shuttle bus to town.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,priscipessina wrote a review May 2018,50,a great place for a nice family break,"we had a week holiday in this hotel from the 7th to the 14th of May as a family of 6 - grand-parentparents and 2 young children and everyone came back as happy as we could be.  we arrived around noon the check-in process was a bit messy between reception and the tour agency but they made sure we had our bands to go and eat right away.  overall the hotel is great - rooms amenities restaurants pools - you can always see somebody cleaning at one point or the other - it is not a luxury hotel but you have everything you need and in good condition.  i will try to make sum up by points as there are so many things to say:    -food : seriously the people that complain about the food need to stay in their country - you are in Morocco - if you dont want to try anything local then yes you will end up with fries and pizza - there is enough choice to satisfy everyone -different meats fishes vegetables every time - you can see everything is cooked fresh - for breakfast you can have fresh omelettes and crepes/waffles made in front of you. the waiters are all nice ( i cant remember the name of the waitress that was always around our table for breakfast/lunch but she was adorable with my 2 year old boy and really nice and friendly to all of us).    drinks: it is all inclusive with local alcohol so dont expect as well a 1000 choices with alcohol flowing but the cocktails were nice and refreshing wine was good and the bar staff at the pool and the bar were really nice and friendly - only inconvenience during the day it seems the sugar in the drinks attracts a lot of bees/wasps around the pool but not sure what could be done about it    -animation staff: You cant fault the team - these guys work more than 12 hours a day - always with a smile always friendly and with such a great energy. You always have something going on mini club for the kids - sports activities (in and out of the pool) - cooking classes - dance classes - mini-disco every night for the kids and after all this they still manage to do some shows in the evening. I am usually not a fan in participating in hotel activities but they are so nice all the family took part in some stuff (i did all the aquagym/aquazumba + steps sessions) we learn how to cook my father went to play petanque and waterpolo my daugter went to miniclub and minidisco...  they are friendly professional and i like the fact they are always present but not ""in your face"" - My family is French but my husband only speaks English and they will always make sure English people can understand everything as well.    - you have several pools one adult one on another side if you want some quiet time a small kids one next to the main pool one with 4 slides (quite fun to go to) another deeper one for swimming and a tiny one in the mini club with slides for the kids. Plenty of space and as usually you better arrive early to get a good spot but we never had a problem getting loungers    all the staff was generally friendly (the lady that was cleaning our rooms was always smiling and talking to us in the corridor)    i would say there are 2 things to bare in mind :  - if you want to use the free shuttle to go visits - you need to book the night before - it is normally from 7pm but if you want to actually get a spots you better be at reception from 6.30pm (and once again the driver was a really nice man)  -the agency organising tour seems to be a lot of hit and miss as we were not aware we needed to book the shuttle in advance the second day we asked for a taxi - couldnt get one without waiting 1h30 - we still booked it waited forever and we kept asking one guy if it would be long which he kept saying "" i dont know there is traffic he is on his way"" - turned out the taxi was there the whole time and we missed it cause that guy couldnt be bothered to check.

We had a lovely welcome and taken to our room it was very clean and had everything we needed.  Food was good with lots of choice  To set the scene day 2 my son became ill and spent the rest of the holiday in the room and he was taken to hospital for a day. Not great when I‚Äôm alone but I couldn‚Äôt have been supported better!  The animation team work their heart out constantly entertaining and putting everyone first my daughter spent a lot of time on her own around the pool area whilst I looked after her brother the team got her involved in all the activities and really made her holiday special when It could have been so different. Momo always asked about my son and how he was feeling and made the few occasions that I left My daughter alone much easier knowing him and the rest of the team really looked out for her.  There is always something going on but they‚Äôre not pushy if you don‚Äôt want to take part. Crazy game darts aqua Zumba pool volleyball the list is endless such fun to take part or spectate  Then there‚Äôs the evening shows so much practice must go into these river dance was my favourite but they were all fabulous and the team must work so hard to perfect them.  Then they move on to the cozy bar and had us up dancing most evenings to the live band again looking out for my daughter when I was checking my son was ok.  I appreciate everything Momo and the team did more than they‚Äôll ever know!  We came to see Marrakesh and didn‚Äôt get much chance to but what could have been a disaster was turned in to such a good time non of us wanted to come home!

Hotel staff very welcoming. You have to fill in forms on arrival then you are shown to your room. We were at the back of hotel above kids club. Huge room with fridge air con and balcony. Nice big bathroom. Not all rooms had balconies though.    Food is standard all Inclusive. I'm fussy but always found something. Breakfast we found the best. Afternoon snacks not great some rolls pastries and cold pizza. Drinks fab self service soft drinks in restaurant. Cocktails and cocktails included. Main gripe here is no ice cream at all unless you bought it in small onsite shop.    Entertainment team were fab and worked hard all day and night. Not too much going on for kids through day but to be honest they were kept so busy with pools and slides in the day.    We didn't do much of the evening entertainment mainly as our son was too tired and mini disco wasn't until 9pm.    If you need taxis etc I would recommend booking yourself the meeting point area in hotel (excursion booking) are very overpriced. Wanted 60dh for a return trip to palooza land which we arranged by calling Marrakesh taxis for 30dh. Also heard people complain about standard of trips etc. Visited the spa for massage same prices as here and found staff a bit miserable looking and they had the cheek to ask for a tip.    Wasps were a problem round pool you had to drink quick. No problems getting sunloungers. Wi-Fi was available at reception and around main pool.    We used the shuttle for old and new town.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,DanEccles93 wrote a review May 2018,50,Dont listen to negative reviews,I was worried about visiting here after seeing so many negative reviews. But honestly I had the best time. I have so much to say ill try and make it an easy read:    Food: Not the greatest of selection for fussy eaters or for specific diets such as vegetarians children or adults with special needs. Not typical of your usual all inclusive more home style food tagines rice chips fresh vegfresh pizzas and pastastewsbread bbq with one different thing on it every day we had tuna steaks chicken kebabs koftes ect.  Breakfast is yoghurts fruit fresh made omelettes cereals toast continental stuff. Expect queues as they seem to do smaller batches but its good because you know its fresher and hasnt sat there for ages. Never struggled to find anywhere to sit.    Drink: Again not typical of all inclusive these were proper drinks really nice alcohol not the harsh crap you usually get and the coffee and hot chocolate is amaze. Alsi you need to try the vodka sun cocktail because its lush. They also do kids mocktails. The queues for the drinks can get very big and only 1 bar open at a time. Fresh bottled water is also provided.    Entertainment: The entertainment team work such long hours and really try their best they are happy involve you and your children but dont push you if you dont want to join in. Their nighttime shows are fantastic though we didnt like karaoke as it was mainly in French which didnt bother us bit it didnt help that we didnt know what the song was hah. They kept my children entertained and happy so i was happy my girls felt special.    Room: Was lovely clean and fresh with lots of storage.    Wasps/Bees: Seen lots of reviews about this. Yes there are lots of bees but we were told by the locals that they cause no harm if we dont threaten them they are a nuisence but if you quickly discard of your empty drinks they dont bother you. Or put your drinks in an empty water bottle.not really a hotel issue as some have claimed as theres not too much they can do about it.    Free shuttle: Unfortunatley we didnt get the opportunity to do any excursions but there are plenty there at the hotel for cheap prices. We did get the free shuttle one day into the old town. It was about 15 mins drive away you do your shopping and the driver returns at a specified time. The souks were lovely and Quaint but it is very overwhelming and wouldnt recommend with small children as it is absolutley crazy.    Shop and money: Take plenty of money with you to change to dirhams because although the rate was good when we were there and it seems like youre getting a lot for your money it doesnt actually go that far. The rate was 1GBP to 12.1DH..We changed 150 and got something like 1800ish and thiught that would be plenty because we were all inclusive and not intending on going out. However it wasnt the crisps are 25dh ice lollys 30dh and they brought some markets in bingo cost us 200dh so its quite expensive as ice lollys ect arent included in all imclusive so if youve kids with you you have to buy them. There is no cash machine and if you need to get more cash you can get the free shuttle into the old town or you can use your card in the shop.    Hotel: The hotel and the pools are beautiful the gardens are just to die for they are really well kept and all in all its a gorgeous hitel to just do nothing to gather all your thoughts. It can be quite loud by the main pool but there is an adult only pool in which you hear absolutley nothing but the birds tweeting. There are life giards on the main pool and the slides and they are fantastic especially Youssef who really made my daughters holiday he taught her arabic and how to dive. I think she got a little crush. The housekeepers drivers waiters barstaff were all lovely all happy and really friendly. Couldnt do enough for you. We asked for a plug and they didnt have them but they sent a driver to the markets for 30dh to get us one. Nothing was too much trouble.    I dont usually go back to places i have visited but i would definetly come back here because honestly the staff made it and it was just so lovely and relaxing.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Connah's Quay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanEccles93

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tracey K wrote a review May 2018,30,Average Relaxing Holiday,We arrived at the hotel around 11ish little confusion on arriving instead of checking in at reception sent off to the room that does excursions to fill in form and trying to get you to book excursions before even being checked in. However after declining this was checked in and then asked to come back in around an hours time as room not ready yet (check in is 2pm you would thought if people were arriving before this rooms would be ready by hey was not so bad a wait). We were shown to our room around 12:30 which was clean basic beds very hard but did manage to sleep. Food was plentiful although as all inclusive very much of the same old stuff which was usually luke warm or cold by time you sat to eat it. Fresh made pizza was always hot and very nice though. The entertainment team are FANTASTIC always managing to keep everyone involved or happy they are great individuals who work long hard hours and still keep smiling and entertaining. There is a lot of damp around the hotel buildings and rooms that they are working on does not cause any real problems to your holiday. We had a lovely relaxing holiday we some fun times thrown in so enjoyed our time here. The hotel however could make things a lot easier for themselves staff and holiday makers being an all inclusive property - the evening entertainment takes place in the theatre room and is set up in a theatre style with chairs in lines and a stage. No tables no bar just a music booth and chairs not very inviting. A few tables and a small bar would make it more accommodating for people to sit with their drinks etc and enjoy the shows. Having self service beer wine and soft drinks at meal times and at all the bars would make life much easier the queues less long and the waiting staff having to deal with large drinks orders as people did not want to spend ages standing in queues again and again. Wasps can be a problem and the pool bar and the flies in general drive you nuts sometimes. No deposits required for pool towels or key cards though which was welcoming.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/93traceyk
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sarah C wrote a review May 2018,30,S Cottoy,When I arrived at the hotel there was no proper greeting wasn‚Äôt advised what excurisons would be good to book and then was told I would have to wait until 2pm for our room when we arrived at 11:30am. Room was very standard but clean a fridge was in the room with nothing in it and one bottle of water on the side. No WiFi in the rooms a code is given to you at the reception and you have to sit in the lobby for good reception. Cleaner came in everyday but the sheets wasnt changed as I notice a stain and also the toilet brush was disgusting. The second day of my trip I began to feel sick due to the food it looked amazing but really let me down as I am suffering now I have returned home. Entertainment in the evening was good for the kids but as my son doesn‚Äôt speak any other languages he felt left out now and again. Went to see the nurse who didn‚Äôt have a clue what I was asking her so therefore I think a nurse on site should be able to speak a number of languages as it‚Äôs a tourist attraction. Great for a quick cheap getaway but if you are looking for more of a standard then I wouldn‚Äôt advised to book. Also when leaving I would advise to arrive at there airport 3 hours before as I was queuing for such a long time when I looked at the time it was 10am and the gates closed at 10:25. Now I am home I am happy,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahcW646XX
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Gannet37 wrote a review May 2018,30,Good for children,A large hotel with an excellent outdoor area with swimming pools and slides table tennis and a few other sports areas around the back. ideal for families with children.    The only downfall was the pool where the slides were was being relined therefore this area was closed off.    The food was good plenty of choice it wasn‚Äôt steaming hot but acceptable. Microwaves were provided for people who wanted it hotter.    The room was average our safe didn‚Äôt close the AC wasn‚Äôt very efficient and some of the bulbs needed replacing.  We asked reception but nothing was fixed whilst we were staying at the hotel. Some people we met have a lovely room over the other side.    With a hotel that size maintenance could be slow.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Dave H wrote a review May 2018,40,Good Value for Money,Check-in: After the usual horrific Marrakesh Airport passport control taking almost 4hrs to get through we arrived very late to the hotel and the check in allowed us to take our all inclusive bands and go get food before the restaurant closed before completing check in which was very good. The check in was met with the 2 people on check in looking at the confirmation and mouthing travel republic and throwing eyes up to heaven after this communication during check in was limited to pointing and grunting.    Room: the room assigned was fine however the window opened to a tree which we needed to leave open for air but it invited all sorts of bugs into the room to be fair the following morning reception moved us to another room which was great it did get an extreme sewage smell every 2nd day but wasn't 2 much of an issue as it wouldn't last all day    Pools: 1 main pool 1 kids pool and 1 slide pool. The water in the pool was absolutely freezing but us being Irish meant we had the pool to ourselves. It was a bit 2 cold for my 7year year old to last as long as she normally would but still you could make the most of it. The slides and slide pool were good fun and the best way to quickly acclimatize to the water temp    Food/Drink: Food was good always a good choice for adults kids had pizza but if they weren't adventurous really struggled with dinner options. All inclusive alcohol was actually much better than European non branded spirits etc    Entertainment: this was where we were left disappointed daytime good lots of options and good staff but at night the entertainment was in a conference room with no bar or drinks (clearly accommodating for Muslim which is fine) but this meant to enjoy a drink in the evening or take the kids to entertainment you had to choose. In the bar area there was a very good solo musican on guitar who kept you entertained but it all got very old very quickly and the location of the hotel meant there wasn't any alternatives either,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveh468

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Christina T wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Absolutely amazing hotel üåü,Have no difficulties whatsoever reviewing this hotel we would give it six stars if we could. Came on holiday as two couples aged 23-25. We literally don't have a bad word to say about the hotel and everything that comes along with it.    The hotel is beautiful stunning infact. It is always kept clean and tidy with staff constantly fixing problems cleaning up and painting etc. All staff we spoke to were very very helpful and friendly and gave us a smile when passing or a funny comment. The boys by the pool work ever so hard- they have been renovating the pool slides for a couple days (dissapointing for our fun) and have been non stop in the heat helping guests inbetween with sunbeds and umbrellas etc. The bar staff are also lovely and always up for a good laugh and even during busy service times try to keep the mood upbeat.    The real gem of this hotel has to be the entertainment reps. Every single one of them made sure everyone was happy or doing activities dancing smiling or just generally having an amazing time so we couldn't thank them enough for it they have made our time in Marrakech outstanding and everyone else's judging by the mood we were always surrounded by. Special shout out to Brad for the funniest darts games and making our week extra special you went the extra mile!    The rooms were gorgeous and had the best powder shower going. We didn't have a balcony but weren't too bothered about this and they were always cleaned every day to high standard by the maids. The air con worked fine and seemed to do the job!    The fact people moaning about WiFi has baffled us- surely you don't go on holiday to cry over WiFi you cut yourself off from the world and have a good time. It works perfectly fine in the lobby just outside of the lobby and in the dining room depending on how many are trying to use it but we used it when necessary and it was accessible through a password from the reception so if needed sit in the lobby somewhere.    The food was fantastic and the all inclusive drinks were also brilliant. Bottled water was available all day which is a nice touch and the cocktails were lovely with beer coming from a bottle rather than tap. Nice big selection of food but don't expect English breakfasts and themed nights like in most European resorts- they catered to everyone's tastes and served a good selection during all three courses including fresh cooked pizza pasta Omlettes and other main meals. There was also a snack bar serving mostly sandwiches and waffles and a microwave If you like to heat your food up further. Two of our party were 'fussier' eaters and didn't complain once.    Although it rained bad for two days we used the opportunity to take the bus to the old town and visit the markets which was an unbelievable experience and used the booking company in the hotel to visit the desert on a camel and quad trip- highly recommend this it was outstanding.    As a whole we would recommend this hotel to anyone- families both big or small couples even friends groups. We had the best time and will 100% be returning at some point in the near future! Literally did not want to leave this hotel and wish we booked two weeks instead of one.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinaellent
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Katie L wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Great stay,My partner and I have just returned from a 7 night stay at labranda. Honestly we have no complaints. The hotel was ridiculously clean fresh towels daily and the cleaners were constantly doing their rounds. The pool and surrounding areas were clean and very well presented. Drinks were typical of an all inclusive however could still have some pretty decent cocktails and the locally produced beer was fresh out of the bottle and is really nice! The food was fresh and constantly being replenished the fresh pizza counter was a surprising gem and lunch time bbqs made my day! We did get tired of the food a little after a number of days but the reception staff are helpful in ordering KFC or Pizza Hut which was delivered to the hotel within 40 mins.The animation team are great keeping everyone entertained from morning til night. Taking time after midnight to rehearse shows for the next day. Amine was especially great  chatting and trying to get us all involved. All in a we had a great stay and would definately recommend and return in the future.

Clean bedding and cleaners came everyday which was good.    Pool area really lovely the way its built meant kids could wonder a bit and you can keep an eye. clean pool    Maxi Club- Kids entertainment was really good and my kids are still doing thw singing and dances they learnt. Kids disco every night for 30mins. Altho it was a repetition kids enjoyed and were looking foward to it. Overal Maxi team was very friendly and hard working.    Free transport to town.    Cons: Reception staff are rude and seemed clueless at times.    Food was ok BUT some dishes were served warm. Met a few pple who developed an upset tummy. I religiously used the microwave to ensure food was piping hot and limited myself from salads which was a shame as my diet became mainly carbs and meat.    Overally i wouldnt mind going back esoecially if they improve on food.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705abigailt

Rooms weren‚Äôt cleaned properly by house keeping hair on floor when arrived mirrors with marks. Bar staff outside were miserable and even said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to smile at you‚Äù towel staff were rude and refused to give us 4 towels as the towels are small so 2 minimum per person would fit. The alcohol they use is very weird made me and my friend have diahorrea our whole trip. Only one out of two restaurants were opened our whole trip and the food is bland. Not authentic Moroccan food. Was forced out of the adult pool at 6pm by rude staff just shouting ‚Äòfinished‚Äô. No WiFi in the rooms so had to have conference call in the lobby which was noisy.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Taraadams2016 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Enjoyable three day stay,We stayed at this hotel for three nights as part of a tour with RSD.    This hotel is very nice rooms are nice and hotel staff are helpful and polite and the food was acceptable. This was my favourite hotel of all the hotels I stayed in during my 2 week tour with RSD.    My only criticism is that the hotel should check the rooms prior to allocating them to guests. During our stay we had to change rooms twice due to ants everywhere in both rooms we can handle the odd one or two but there were so many any house keeping staff who had prepared and cleaned the room must have seen them. The staff were helpful though and gave us a new room without any problems and we were eventually given a very nice room overlooking the pool which was very clean and comfortable.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,jmaulnette wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Good break but...,Despite the not so good weather conditions the week of April 9th it was a good family break.  The kids (13 & 17) enjoyed the animation group by playing football volley table tennis and petanque. The team was nice and looking after us all the time. It is a shame that the infrastructure is not in good conditions. Tennis court net is nearly dead volley ball net will die shortly.  The hotel would be much better with a good painting refreshment. The pool was ok but having few issues on the liner and inside pool light.  During the week we had few days of excellent weather. Really a shame that everyone has to get out of the swimming pool at 6pm. Too early when you want enjoy the sun until 7pm.  The choice of food was ok but if you came late you don‚Äôt see much and even by asking nicely can not get any new re assortiment. Breakfast was good with a lot of choice. A shame that fresh orange juice is not available while plenty of oranges in Maroc.    We finished our stay on a very very bad experience which will not make me coming back to Labrandra and will really express my upset on social medias  While we checked out we were accused of stealing shower towels in our room. Two towels were reported as missing in our room and we were accused. Despite our arguments and demonstration that we did have the towels the security person did not want to hear our positioning. I brought the relationship manager to my car to check in and we opened our suitcase in the lobby in front of everyone.  The security man did not want to check our bagages and stayed on his position.

I want to express my dissatisfaction with the hotel Labranda Targa Aqua Park Marrakech !  You simply canceled my reservation yesterday without even telling me.  My reservation was made in advance because I wanted to give a gift to my sister and my niece who come to Morocco for a week from Paris.  All 3 of us were happy to stay from April 23rd to 27th in your hotel.  It's not nice of you to cancel the room within a week of their arrival.  You put us in a really uncomfortable situation and we now have to find an alternative.  Certainly my bank card is not passed. But just yesterday I wanted to give you another card.  I have contacted you on several occasions to ask you to keep our reservation.  I have never received a call or written answer from you which shows a certain lack of professionalism. !!!!  If you had answer me we could have found a solution I would have given you another card number or I would have made a transfer to your bank account for example.  I know that you are part of a group Labranda which abroad as in Egypt for example is a group recognized and esteemed then I expected the same thing in Morocco!  It's not very nice of you to have canceled our reservation my niece and my sister and I are very disappointed in your behavior and I would certainly mention it to the Labranda group of course and all social networks.  If you could fix this mistake it would be perfect try to make a family happy especially since we do not see each other very often.,Date of stay: April 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaalinette
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Rochelle H wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Beach resort a long way away from the beach,We stayed as a family of 4 (kids 9 & 7) for 4 nights. The resort is generally in good condition although they could do with fixing the paint on the main entrance wall as it doesn't leave a good first impression.  We had a 1 bedroom apartment with a large double in one room and 2 singles in the other room no door between them though. Room was a good size and had one of the best hotel showers I have ever had.  Staff on reception were all reasonably helpful. Plenty of sunbeds and pool was cleaned and well maintained.  The food was ok we never went hungry and ate more than we should have although the lunch and evening meals were only ok. They had such a mixture of food which was virtually exactly the same every lunch and dinner. No ice cream or cheese as dessert options which was disappointing.  Entertainment staff were amazing working from 10am till 10.30/11pm every day to liven up the place and help with entertaining the kids. The water slides were a nice addition. At times it didn't feel like we were in morocco more like we were in any beach resort in Europe not a complaint though as we enjoyed the entertainment.  Two negatives:  1) the wifi was the worst I have experienced in years it was only available in the lobby/restaurant and it was almost impossible to connect unless you were up at dawn before anyone else. In 2018 there is no excuse for poor wifi. I don't mind not having it in the room if you can actually use it in public areas  2) a couple of times we got a taxi back to the hotel and had nightmare rides as the taxi drivers had never heard of the hotel and got hopelessly loss most of them don't have phones for directions and we didn't have the overpriced Moroccan data roaming. Probably good to check the driver knows where they are going before getting in,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Pimpama, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rochelleh342

Friends and daughters 4th trip to Marrakech and by far the best! We all wished we could have stayed longer.    The main reason for this was down to the fabulous ENTERTAINMENT TEAM.... A massive thank you to all the team from all of us... Samy (hubby) Hannah (Whitney) Brad (Chicken & Chicks) Smiley Sam Nizar Ivo and Chaima. What a great bunch of people you are and we will all miss you.. ;-) Hope you are practicing your tap and leaps Hannah Smiley Brad & Samy! We would love to come and see you all again.    The hotel itself was lovely and clean and food and drinkgenerally good. Our room was big and kept clean with fresh towels every day. Out of all the other hotels we have stayed at in Marrakech we would definitely return to this one.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,loulousoph wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Enjoyable family holiday,We stayed as a family of three for two weeks over Easter holiday. Friendly team of staff that work very hard everyday to provide a service to tourists. The gardens are beautiful and immaculate the team that work on them must get exhausted as it's hot and days are long. Well done for making them look stunning. Special mention to 'smiley' and 'brad' they are the nicest most genuine guys and always made our son feel entertained. I hate to moan about food as it's all inclusive and very tricky to cater for all tastes etc however it was poor. Limited choice warm mostly unlabelled and made my husband poorly for two days. I also think the restaurant was very dirty floors filthy and just needed a deep clean. As I mentioned I hate to moan about food but that is my honest opinion. Thank you to guest services lady for listening to us and moving our room to a quieter location. We originally had 1218 and could here music from pool and entertainment plus chairs scraping the floor incessantly. Moved to 6009 no problem there. Would recommend this hotel to others as long as you aren't fussy about certain aspects.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loulousoph

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Jenuwine66 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,Some disappointments but nice surroundings,Having spent four nights at this hotel I find the hotel was very nice pool area a lovely reception area and dining area what‚Äôs nice. However I felt let down by the services of the hotel at times. They only have two bars a pool bar during the day And from 5 o‚Äôclock they have a bar inside the hotel. ( they also have a sports bar but unless you‚Äôre buying premium drinks you‚Äôre not welcome in there). On our fourth day there it rained the whole day which wasn‚Äôt very nice as we was just expecting sunshine that can‚Äôt be helped however the hotel never felt it was necessary to open inside and insisted that guests went outside in the rain to get their drinks I thought this was atrocious. There were quite a few mature guests who couldn‚Äôt walked out in the rain and despite requesting that the bar staff speak to the manager they were quite aggressive in saying that they were not going. I found that the drinks were served in a slapdash manner and basically all the taste of the same. I felt that the food seem to run out rather quickly seeing that hotel wasn‚Äôt particularly busy. How do you run out of a feature food like lamb an hour after you open? Over lovely holiday we me some pleasant people but I personally wouldn‚Äôt choose to stay here again.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Enfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenuwine66

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,barbaitch wrote a review Mar 2018,50,A most memorable holiday!,My husband and I have just returned from a most memorable six days holiday in Marrakech staying at the wonderful Labranda Targa Aqua Parc. We will always remember it most fondly for the happy friendly atmosphere and hard-working staff in all areas from reception to restaurant entertainment and house-keeping. It's a perfect choice for people of all ages from young families to teens baby-boomers both single and married and even oldies like us! There's something for everyone and we loved it. The only negative for us was that although our room was nice and roomy and very very clean with a comfortable bed I could have done with a softer pillow and brighter lighting in the bathroom and as it was located at the back of the hotel only to be expected as we paid a budget price for an otherwise incredible package deal through MailTravel the view from our window was what you'd expect but we found it quite interesting if we looked over and beyond the central heating/air conditioning pipeworks servicing the hotel at a lower level . But aside from that we loved the Labranda Targa and the amazing all-inclusive package price and would definitely stay there again. There is so much to like about Marrakech and we loved our half-day guided tour of the old city last Wednesday as well as our visit to the souk (market) with all the fabulous alleys and lanes filled with such wonderful colours and incredible shops sights sounds and unique magic of Morocco.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,alicia_taylor86 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Great Value Modern Hotel,Booked to stay in this hotel on a Travelzoo deal and I was so pleased with the result. The hotel is is modern clean and has all the things you could need. It was an all inclusive deal but the food was still fresh and healthy. You tend to expect quite a limited unhealthy menu but there were plenty of choices of dishes; rice pasta meats salads etc.    The rooms were modern clean and quiet however the biggest downside is the hotel does not provide Wi-Fi in rooms. You have to be in the lobby to be able to get internet access. I even enquired at reception to see if I could pay a surcharge for the Wi-Fi in rooms but they just don't do it. Something I think they should consider doing as a hotel of this size should do it. The lobby was constantly full of people on their phones trying to use the limited signal.    The pool area is lovely although I should imagine at peak season it would get very busy. The free mini bus into the Old and New towns is a great free service which the hotel provides. The hotel is situated about 5 miles from the Old Town so it could get quite costly in taxis without it. We used the buses every day and they run regularly.    Entertainment team were fun and jovial. The welcome show we watched on the first night was a fun way to pass the night after our journey.    Really enjoyable stay. I would definitely recommend and would certainly come back.

I have celebrated my 40th birthday there and had a lovely time. Hotel is clean well organised and food is excellent with lot of choice. Animation team do their best to get involved with the guest during the day with different activities and they do a different show every evening. Cosy bar has a live music most nights which was very entertaining. Pools were bit cold as is still early in year but I and my son had a good swim too as it was lovely and warm. Shuttle service to town is great but don‚Äôt get giude as they just take you where they want and u feel pressured to buy. You are quiet safe to walk around the market alone just watch your wallets and bags.

Heres my honest review / assessment of this hotel.  Friendly and polite staff.  Food was great a lot of traditional morrocan fayre with bits of continental.  Drinks are served in plastic glasses but thats par for the course in an all inclusive establishment. Especially given that a load of idiots tend to leave cups over floors etc.  The rooms were spacious and quite modern. Cleaned daily with fresh towels etc. Id have to be very picky to fault them.  The animarion team are without a doubt the best iv come across.  They are constantly trying to engage people and raise spirits. They always made a big deal of everyone in the hotel.  The evening entertainment they organised / provided was fantastic. We loved it.  Honeztly please please ignorre the negative comments. This hotel was a pleasure to stay in.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Paige C wrote a review Mar 2018,50,What a fantastic holiday!!!,I am a big fan of trip advisor but the lead up to my holiday I started to doubt whether we had booked the right place.. little was I expecting to have the BEST holiday!!!    Please please don‚Äôt listen to all you read people are too quick to moan and complain.    Check in was quick and easy our booking confirmation was checked and our all inclusive bands applied and we were advised that the restaurant closed in 20 mins so to go and get something to eat and then continue checking in.. very kind gesture as never had this at any other hotel! All the staff on the reception were extremely polite and always smiling.. I honestly don‚Äôt know where these ‚Äúrude staff‚Äù were that I‚Äôve read about in reviews...    Rooms are amazing!!! So so big and the shower is out of this world - it‚Äôs actually quite sad now to be back to my normal shower at home! Only downside is the pillows are a little big but that‚Äôs just personal preference as I only normally sleep with one pillow at home and one pillow here is equal to two normal ones but everyone is different.    The restaurant is nice and spacious food is okay breakfast is best meal of the day with yoghurt waffles fresh pancakes and honey being a personal favourite!! Chips and gravy at lunch are also to die for!! Food is okay I only struggled due to being a fussy eater.    Pool is big and cleaned every single day. In fact this is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever been too. Even the toilets were always immaculate and smelling lovely!    Yes the drinks are served in plastic glasses reusable/washable ones. I don‚Äôt see the problem with this at least they aren‚Äôt the disposable plastic cups you get at most other hotels. You have to remember it‚Äôs a cost effective way and you can imagine if they had glass exactly how many would get accidentally broken and how much this would end up costing to replace.    Now for the animation team. They are a fantastic team and a really good laugh... we especially got along with Hannah Smiley and Sam. It was Sams first week during our holiday and he did absoloutely amazing you would think he‚Äôs always been there!! But I really do have to make a special mention for Hannah (Hanan in Arabic) in the summer months I am an holiday entertainer myself but Hannah extremely impressed me. She made a large effort each morning to walk around saying morning to everyone stopping at each sun lounger engaging in conversation this made us very comfortable and friends with her. Morocco is a Muslim country but I personally wasn‚Äôt very educated on the religion hannah told us all about her life her religion and exactly what ‚Äúbeing a Muslim‚Äù really was and I have never been so fascinated in all my life it was amazing to hear and learn!!! She is a naturally funny person and when she had her day off on Wednesday we genuinely had a rubbish day. By the time I left to come home I felt sad to be leaving and gutted at the fact that Hannah was not part of my animation team. This girl really does deserve to be commended.    We adored our holiday to Labranda Targa Aqua Park and gutted to be home is an understatement.    Thanks again everyone and to anyone thinking of booking please GO!!!!!,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paigec430

Me and my boyfriend spent 4 nights here in the last week of Feb and had the most perfect time. The food is lovely so much choice morrocon dishes freshly made pizzas to order lovellly breakfast (pastries fruit cereal eggs) lunch was beautiful and then snacks at 3pm-5pm were great too! Alcohol i would give a 7/10 not amazing but still pretty good nice wine and cocktails were nice.    Rooms are nice the beds are so comfy!! one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept on. Hairdryer in bathroom and the shower was great very powerful. The pool was cold but i think in summer a cold pool would be appreciated. However we did still go on the slides and it was great fun.    The staff are so lovely the entertainment team are great! Such lovely people we even went to a night club with the. The evening entertainment was cheesy but still such a laugh. They play music by the pool most of the day a good volume. Theres a free shuttle bus which goes to/from new/old town. Great service for free which we used to go to old town and see the markets/souks.    The shop in the hotel is very over priced! Was ¬£14 for suncream lol so pack all the stuff you need.    Overall This hotel is perfect for everyone Families couples girls/lads holiday. I would 100% recommenced to everyone i know. It was so good I'm booking to go back in June and i cannot wait.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Bersarah wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Amazing 6 days 5 nights!,My partner and I have just got back home from a wonderful 5 days in Marrakech. We booked through teletext and got a fab deal for my other half‚Äôs 30th - we didn‚Äôt expect much considering the money we paid and some of the reviews but we were pleasantly surprised all throughout the holiday. The place is gorgeous starting in the reception it is beautiful clean and welcoming from the get go.  The reception staff we had to start with were friendly but spoke little English they spoke more Arabic french and German. They greeted us gave us our room cards WIFI passcodes etc and pointed us to ‚ÄòThe meeting point‚Äô man who arranges excursions etc for guests who speaks fluent English amongst other languages. He gave us all the information we needed on the all inclusive package (food times areas etc) as well as a run down of the evenings entertainment and day schedule. We then had a lovely man take us to our room and take our bags for us.  We had selected a pool view room and were not disappointed at all. It was clearly marked so you would never get lost which is great for Miss no sense of direction over here.  The room it‚Äôs self was spacious modern practical and most of all CLEAN! The bathroom was lovely again spacious and had a hair dryer in there so no need to bring one! The shower was powerful neither my other half of I wanted our showers to end as they were more like water massages!!  On the first day it was raining a little but still warm we ended up in the cosy bar (the all inclusive bar) which gives very generous drinks and a good variety of different drinks. Then a lovely lady and gent came to sing in the bar they were incredible.  We met all of the entertainment team who are absolutely fantastic - they work from 9-11 6 days a week and ALWAYS have a smile on their faces. Smiley was particularly welcoming on our first day and it was Sams first day on the job but he did very well. Hannah is also great very funny and approachable. Momo has the most energy I have ever seen and it is truly impossible to be miserable in his presence. DJ red man is fantastic and extremely polite. Shama is in charge of the kids club but also is involved with the evening entertainment again wonderful.  Our personal entertainment staff was Brad - he made a real effort with us daily to check in and connect with us. None of them pressured us to get involved with activities at all which we liked but they did make sure we knew what was happening which we also liked. All in all a great bunch!  The spa - I had a lovely spa day in the beautifully set oriental spas. I booked two treatments and I couldn‚Äôt have been happier with them. The staff were friendly kind and welcoming and I would recommend checking it out.  Food - I really thought I‚Äôd struggle with the food but boy was I wrong. The breakfast was the same everyday but had such a huge variety you could easily have something new every day. Pancakes freshly made to order omelettes cereal yoghurt pastries sausages and the list goes on. Lunch was different every day but again very vast in choice same with dinner. Lots of Moroccan food which was delicious as well as a Italian corner with pizza and pastas. Genuinely something to suit everyone.  You do have to time your eating well for hot food but thy is simply because the other guests don‚Äôt seem to shut the lids of the warmers no food was cold as all though and it was VERY tasty.  They have 6 pools and wonderful water slides. We didn‚Äôt race them as dipping our toes felt far to cold but once we went on the water slides we soon got used to it and made the most of the water slides etc. The sun beds are very comfy. Again the areas are clean and there is always staff cleaning gardening entertaining etc.    This holiday would genuinely suit everyone family‚Äôs couples solos ANYONE could have the best time here and I 100% recommend!,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bersarah

The food was good not much choice but good quality and enough to find something you like .  The water slides I thought were just for kids but there not so fast and so much fun !!!!

So on a daily basis straight away you had Red-1 Smiley  Hannah Brad and Momo and Sam when the music started around the pool  they would all come and chat to you answer any questions and were all so friendly ! Even on the days it rained they would take the games inside and made it so fun we forgot it was raining ‚òîÔ∏è    All of us all played darts everyday which was made more fun by the team  always funny games played and then Zumba and my god can they dance !!!!

We are a family of 7 2 adults and 5 children we booked two rooms. When we arrived we were pleased to find the rooms were side by side however one was double bed with two singles and other was just double bed. My daughter is 14 so have paid an adult price and she has to share the double bed with her sibling! Have tried to resolve this and were offered new rooms Futher away from each other and the same set up!!    Food leaves a lot to be desired very limited choice and cold. Children have struggled to eat very much at all we have had to get taxis out to get food.    The animation staff work so hard really can't fault their efforts however the entertainment is not great the room is like a conference area and not a relaxing place to enjoy the evening.

In one week we there had been a few fights in there although the hotel was good at dealing with this and would remove people. Also had cockroaches in there and they ran out of alcohol one night. Rooms. we stayed in the pavilions away from main hotel and had no priblem with our room thank God they had heating. Room clean and suited us. Only thing I would say is tea and coffee facilities in room would of been nice oh and a mirror only had bathroom one with is impossible to us after showers. Food : cold not enough choice the fact they have a microwave to warm your food though says it all was very disappointed with this.  Staff cleaning staff where lovely plus the guy from meeting point that does your day trips he was brilliant he helped us out with a lot. I wish I could say same for reception staff found them highly rude and not very helpful at all.  We paid for a lovely night out through meeting point called lotus privilege would highly recommend it great food and entertainment.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Donna J wrote a review Feb 2018,30,Need to improve customer care,Six of us stayed on a 3 night all inclusive break. A nice looking hotel with three to a room. The rooms on appearance were clean comfortable but...only one set of towels for 3 people! One room had to be changed as within one hour it smelt like there was a sewerage leak. It took over two hours for the change of room to happen and just short of 5 hours (after several complaints)for us to get the correct set of towels required for the room. The telephone in the rooms did not work so we had to go to the reception four times and on the fifth visit I waited for the towels and took them back to our room myself. The complimentary bus service into the old and the new town was very good although we would probably have benefited from maps to help us get around and also a bit of guidance from the driver to his passengers on which direction to go when we were dropped off. On the second day the rooms were not cleaned because we didn't know that we had to put the sign on the door requesting a clean up so we had to ask for this to be done. My friends in the other room had an afternoon nap and woke to find that the room had been entered and cleaned while they slept; they hadn't locked the door but surely when the cleaner arrived and found them asleep they should have knocked loudly to alert them of their presence! The food was nice. When we arrive they were not busy however it was very busy by day 3 and the hot food ran out at 8:30pm.  On the whole although unlucky with the weather we had a nice break as we made the most of the time we had.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnaj67

We had the worse week of weather which was really disappointing as there was nothing to do in the hotel. The swimming pool water is so cold knowone goes in. my little one could not use the kids pools as they are freezing and he put his feet in one day and never did it again so me and my husband chose to use the spa to let him have a swim we was charged 150 DH each for a tiny pool any that was just warm so never did that again.    The entertainment team are lovely and work hard the reception team and not welcoming at all they give you NO information where things are or when meal times are you just have to find that all out for yourself There is a lovely man called Amine that works in the trip office he is always on hand to help and went above and beyond for us. The restaurant team and bar staff are all amazing and went out there way to make my little boy happy.    The food was ok and very much the same everyday there was always something to eat so no issues there.    The hotel itself is lovely clean and the rooms are nice I think in the summer months the hotel would be amazing.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemmaO726
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Caroline O wrote a review Feb 2018,30,4 nights - all the gear no idea!!!,A cheap get away with my friend.  Absolutely no customer service from the outset. A catalog of hic ups..  From the start no information sheets for advice etc.  Asked 3 times for help in our room due to tv not working and not enough towels. No help ever. We gave up.  Ran out of alcoholic drinks on our 2nd night.  Ran out of money to exchange ALL DAY 1 of the days.  Miserable staff in reception and in the so called spa.  Spa staff unhelpful really miserable and not worth a visit as not really warm spa at all. Indoor pool tiny and not worth a dip as far too cool.  Can‚Äôt believe extra charge to use steam room.  Miserable bar staff almost like they didn‚Äôt want us there. Plastic classes at all times - not nice at all. Very very limited choice of drinks. One day the main bar was closed all day but the pool bar was open...during rainy weather therefore pool not in use.  Nothing to do during day when cold and rainy although the hotel can‚Äôt control the weather I‚Äôm really shocked that they didn‚Äôt put any fun activities for adults. Instead the kids club staff hung around the foyer and literally played practical jokes on people I witness this to a guest and then following day to my friend who wasn‚Äôt at all impressed (invasion of personal space)  Amazing food but miserable staff..crazy that one drinks machine for hot drinks only available for all guests Paper cups for juice!  One iron for whole of hotel!  In my opinion only smiley friendly staff were the bell boys and lovely security man.  When room cleaned empty plastic glasses not removed once no toilet paper or tissues replaced.  During winter season not recommended for kids would get very bored as did us adults.  20mins from main new town and old town not always room on bus so we ended having to get a taxi.  Please make sure when booking a place on the bus you say exactly where you want to go.. new or old town! When we booked to go to the souks in the old town they booked us on the bus to new town so ended up a little lost so got the bus back.. 2 hrs later (as return only every 2hrs also) then had to get a taxi to the correct place the souks as no room available for next bus into the old town (souks).  Why only a small bus every 2 hours?  Would I return? No  Was the overall holiday price worth it? Absolutely you get what you pay for I‚Äôd rather of paid much more for much better service!,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolineo226
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Linda T wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Birthday stay 4 nights,Excellent 4 night stay here despite very cold weather. We was expected it to be allot warmer!!! The hotel on average was very modern nice and clean! Great for families couples groups of friends or solo travellers. Hossne & Abdelbari our waitors were very attentive polite and very helpful during our short stay. Delivered excellent customer service. The negatives during our stay was the WiFi signal. Only available in lobby and it kept cutting out a few times not very strong! Would have liked Wi-Fi in the bedrooms too! Choice in cocktails very limited and so was the wine and beer. Food was abit repetitive even only on a 4 night stay. They served chicken every day and too many fish dishes. Would have liked to have seen more variety for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was lovely. I enjoyed the breakfast. Fresh crepes Moroccan style pancakes beef sausages grilled tomatoes aubergines eggs the way you like it egg station for ready made omelettes wide choice in bread and pastries plus of course cereals; fruits and yogurts for the kids. Loved the free shuttle to both the new town and old town. This saved us allot of money. You need to prebook this after 7pm the day before to make sure you get the slot time you want. They have around 8-9 different time slots for both shuttles. No free airport shuttle service. You would need to arrange your own. We used holiday taxis ¬£20 return pee person for shared shuttle. Not too bad at all. Overall good hotel and travel experience.

All inclusive the only food worth eating was the bread everything else was tasteless and luke warm.  Slow unhelpful staff who purposely ignore you or take their time in even acknowledging you.  4 star thats laughable it wasn't worth one star the entertainment was non exsistent and tbe cosy bar wasn't at all cosy it was dirty with cheap furnishings alo g with the cheap drinks in plastic or paper cups coffee was only available through a machine and was usually a mixture of both coffee and chocolate.  Cleaning was basic sheets only changed once during our stay and the room itself was grimy.  Hated the area and the shopping experience we spoke to so many people who wanted to come home early just to have a decent meal.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,steph1989 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,"Nice hotel, great value",I traveled in March with my husband and some friends for 5 nights all inclusive we booked on a Travelzoo deal which was such good value. The hotel and grounds are nice and well kept people are friendly enough barring a few questionable reception staff who were rude.    The food was ok and managed to find something to eat most nights but a bit more choice would be good. The rooms were nice however we kept finding ants so maybe they needed to be sprayed or something the air con and heating was also not great especially as of an evening it was quite cold.    Evening entertainment was good fun and the staff were really friendly the bar shut quite early which was a shame as the singer that played most evenings was really good however once he finished you had no choice but to go and watch the show or start paying for drinks.    The pool was freezing which wasn't ideal so didn't use the slides much however some of our party said they were good fun. Overall we had a good time and for the money it was well worthit.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Essex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephthatch1989

Bottled water in fridges around the hotel the usual choice of all inclusive drinks although the Cocktails where good the Pina Colada was shocking.  A great choice of 3 swimming pools one with flumes the water was cold but hey it‚Äôs January.  Rooms cleaned daily with all toiletries and a fresh bottle of water added.  Tv channels are ok. The bed was very hard but then again that is down to personal preference.  Hire and excursions trips where available at the reception a good price to we hired a car for ¬£23 for 24 hrs mind you driving in Marrakech is not for the faint hearted.

The staff didn't understand us sometimes and we had to keep going to reception as they never answered the phone. After eating the food my family and a few other family's we spoke to all had diahorria. Nabil the man in the reception was amazing he helped us get our room changed to a balcony and was very lovely. The rooms were lovely and big and got cleaned every day . The slides were great however a little bit dangerous. Close the the airport.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The room was cleaned every day with fresh bedding. The room was basic but it had what we needed and it was clean. The food was fantastic and the staff were attentive. The only criticism would be that the outside pool was too cold and if heated we could of used it. We thought the indoor pool was available to use but was told it could only be used if you purchase a spa treatment.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,carltoronto wrote a review Jan 2018,40,One week visit in January.,Very nice hotel. It's not a huge hotel in terms of layout which is not a complaint but an observation. I went with my wife and two kids in January when it wasn't too busy and when it wasn't warm enough to swim in the pools although our kids did manage to spend a few hours on the second last day using the waterslides. Here are some key points regarding the hotel from our perspective:    Location:    The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport. It was quite busy on the road when we arrived so it took a bit longer but it was a relatively short trip. The hotel itself is somewhat isolated. If you walk out of the hotel grounds there are no retail stores within walking distance and you'd have to walk/drive to the closest town which is about 10 minutes away.    Room:    We had a studio in the 5000 section which is just off the main lobby to the right. There wasn't really a well-marked path to this room section and we kind of found it on our own on the first night as you have to walk out two glass doors to a garden area to get to the room. The room was very large larger than a standard hotel room and we had lots of space for 4 people. It had a fridge/freezer sink and small stove none of which we used.    Cleanliness:    The hotel is very well kept and clean. The room was made up daily and was always fresh. The restaurant was clean and there were always staff cleaning and tidying up.    Food:    Only the main restaurant was open while we were there and we ate there each time. There is an Oriental Restaurant but it was closed. The food was varied each day and was always very well cooked and tasty. No complaints. They had a variation of local Moroccan dishes and western style food (fries chicken wings etc) that should appeal to most. Many salads and other dishes for vegetarians too.    Staff:    Staff were excellent. Many easily spoke Arabic English French and/or German and on the tours we did we had guides that could additionally speak Berber and Spanish. Pretty amazing.    Shuttle:    The hotel has two free shuttles that run every 2 hours to and from the town and from the main square. So you can get two free trips in and out of the town from different areas - new town and old town - and wander around on your own to the souk (markets) and gardens. Tip: The sign up sheets appear in the evening for the next day so be sure to sign up your preferred departure time early as they did fill up. When you get on the bus the driver should ask you for your pick up time so you get a spot on the bus coming back too. Each trip took about 20 minutes to get to the town.    All in all it was a very nice trip. The hotel was very good in our opinion and we have no complaints.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Frankfurt, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mexicotriptoronto
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Anthea26 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,A very pleasant stay!,This is my fifth visit to Morocco and I am very well accustomed to travelling here. Although my first stay at Labranda Targa Aqua Parc (previously the Atlas Targa and not to be confused with the vast sized sister site Labranda Aqua Fun also in Marrakech).    I was initially apprehensive having read some of the reviews but very much to the contrary this hotel turned out to be a little gem! It is a nice sized resort large but not so over sized as to overwhelm. Easy and accessible to get around and to map out and remember in one go. I felt very comfortable and at ease in this space.    The grounds are tidy and neat with distant picturesque views of the Atlas mountains preceded by the small town of Targa. It is a beautiful sight to see sunrise and sunset at dawn and dusk over the Atlas Mountains - especially in the quietness of the hotel in the early hours or just before dinner. Situate yourself at top floor of the hotel - there are external stairways or from inside hallways or rooms open a window - a recommended must. The hotel grounds are safe to walk around as there is outside security at night time and always on the gated entrance to the grounds and inside the hotel.    As mentioned the grounds are not overwhelming so you won't get lost. The hotel has three large pools - two at the front one with the aqua slides and the other for everyone with a small pool for children. However the gem of this hotel for me is the third generous sized pool at the back of the hotel for adults only - it is quiet and serene and has amenities. Accessible gym available. The restaurant caters for a wide variety of European tastes; including chips and pizza plenty of healthy salads fish meat and traditional Moroccan cuisine and a variety of cake deserts/fruit. Breakfast is plentiful and a wide variety including the delicious Moroccan pancakes. Everything is cooked freshly. Lunch a good variety of hot and cold food. All inclusive is probably the best option but full board I would imagine is okay too. Water bottles provided at every meal as well as local alcoholic drinks and beverages. The hotel is clean and as always staff working to keep it so as is the restaurants. Food is self service with over seeing staff and with waiters to clear tables.    Tours can be arranged from the hotel and advisable as these trips generally include insurance and are door to door. Although shuttle buses are available to the new and old town daily but must be booked at reception and with the driver for return. The hotel is situated a 20 minute drive from the towns. If it is your first visit to Morocco then the drive from the airport will take you through some underdeveloped areas but don't let that put you off as there is more to see if you travel into the towns during your stay.  Currency exchange is available at the hotel and is slightly higher here than at the airport. The Animation Team provide activities mostly during the summer months but otherwise entertainment is provided all year round including in the evening. Rooms are a nice size and with modern decor and blackout curtains. I had a twin room without terrace on the second floor. My original room with terrace on the ground floor was unsuitable as for its situation and I requested a change which was made with no issues. Although note there are sometimes continuous heating or air con generator noises in some rooms. These are not really noticeable during the day but if you are sensitive to sound it would be best to remember to bring ear plugs for sleep. I used my ear plugs and these were fine although next time I will request a room without generator humming.    The hotel is situated near the Atlas mountains so the temperature will drop at night and in the early morning. Ensure you bring some warm layers. I traveled between 31 Dec and 6 Jan and during the day there was hot enough weather for sunbathing and I felt good for the heat and have a nice tan - in town it was hotter. The hotel pulled out all the stops for NYE celebrations in terms of meals and entertainment.    There is a Spa available on site which is modern retaining a level of Moroccan authentication. I would also suggest considering a trip into one of the towns to use an original hammam. You can do this via the tour operator door to door at the hotel (or independently) but weigh up the options of being already based at the hotel post treatments. I personally found the Spa a little over priced and is not for the feint hearted or prudish! Fortunately I have used hammam's and spas before so used to it all. Consider your own choice treatments rather than the package as these can sometimes be more fulfilling and cheaper. I did the oriental spa ritual and felt that the process was back to front with hammam given first then jacuzzi and then massage. The flyer advised jacuzzi first hammam then massage. The way I was given the treatments meant all the goodness of the hammam (body scrub soap and wrap etc) was washed away afterwards by using the jacuzzi followed by massage. I did challenge this but was told it was the right way and i conceded at the time as I didn't want the hassle. I am accustomed to using spas over the years and maintain the treatment was provided the wrong way around. Nevertheless I enjoyed the use of this spa on a couple of occasions but felt it a little expensive in relation to what you actually get.    I traveled on two tours and enjoyed them both one to Ouazazate and a Desert Safari - although the Desert Safari was the my most enjoyable. Salem the tour operator at the hotel's Meeting Point is very helpful and patient in booking and in organising tours - he will tell you what you need to know and is courteous to deal with.    The Animation team are great bunch of youngsters who do their utmost to ensure that guests are enjoying themselves. They are not pushy or in your face and a very pleasant team to talk with. The general staff on reception management security catering waiters cleaners were all very pleasant and overall made my stay.    My trip was about rest and relaxation with a little bit of adventure on tours. I achieved this and more and will most definitely return. If there are any issues with any part of your stay just let the management know and they will sort something out for you - don't be afraid to ask. If you are new to Morocco - learn a little about the culture etiquette speak a few simple words of Arabic or French as this always works well with locals and staff. Just a simple hello please thank you etc - gestures and mannerisms. Remember the staff work incredibly hard and for long hours sometimes 9-14 hour shifts - I found everyone was courteous and smiled.    Last but not least my very special thanks to Fatima Hotel Manager who was so lovely to speak to modern in thinking efficient courteous and very gracious - Fatima made my trip so warm and welcoming. Thanks to Salem for booking my trips tailored to my needs; thanks to Rizwan from the animation team who was so great to talk to energetic helpful and a great team player. Also to his colleagues in the animation team for such a warm and lasting welcome. Thanks to the great reception staff who helped me out with any queries and for their warm welcome too.    Thanks everyone it was great to meet you and I had a lovely stay!,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anthea26
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,j.schr wrote a review Jan 2018,30,an experience not to repeat again,The only real positive element of this hotel is the pool area.    For the rest:  - no wifi in the rooms. slow Wifi at the reception desk.  - Inhouse phones not allowing to contact the reception desk (imagin an emergency in the room)  - daily repetion of the food buffets  - most drinks are free but chemical fruit juice substitutes instead of real juices low quality beer in plastic recipients  - poor service at the food corner (understaffed???)  - rooms to be refurbished and technical installations to be updated  - carpets in public areas to be replaced    My message to the management is to close the hotel for a couple of months and to refurbish it completely before reopening. And change the concept of the hotel. The 20th century 'All-inclusive' concept is dead. We live in the 21st century with 'Wellness'-H√¥tels 'Activity'-H√¥tels 'Organic Food'-H√¥tels a.s.o.

The staff were amazing and made arrangements for us to be moved to a suite and they also extended our checkout time as our flight was in the evening.    There was much options when it comes to the food and if your vegan you will find you have only chips that you can eat. Best meal of the day for us was breakfast. Drinks could have also been better but we were provided with bottles of water.    We arranged all our excursions through the holiday rep at the hotel. His name is Salem. Omg he was amazing.

Surprising 100 Dirhams tax at the hotel desk after paying a tax to the travel operator over the phone.    Weather isn‚Äôt the best at this time of year quite cold and dim.    Travelling early December weather wasn‚Äôt that great. Rooms were freezing and the heating was not working in our room and other guests room we spoke to. Despite requesting for maintenance numerous times no one showed.    All inclusive is best option the food is ok plenty of options of food and drink which include plenty options for vegetarians.    Things like excursions to attractions and sights work out to average cost of between ¬£35-50.    Very far from anything quite deserted area.    WiFi is only available in the lobby and dining hall. No WiFi in bedrooms not what I expected at all.    Got to the room looked clean from afar but noticed hairs in odd places. Plus the room was very very cold had to wear my winter coat and call the staff. Staff took about half hr to come and decided to move us to another room as the heating option was faulty. The new room was no better. They said heating started working from 2100. After this time we called reception as the room was still feeling cold. They said maintenance would come to the room and investigate. After 2 calls to reception and waiting for over an hour (NO ONE TURNED UP). Very disappointed with the room temperature.

The heating did not work at night and my son got ill when I raised this to the reception they advised nothing can be done. I then had to speak to the manager who upgraded and changed my room to suit my family. He was very nice I don‚Äôt remember his name but he was the one who sits in the lobby with his laptop sometimes.    Also when you call the reception from your room they never answer and it gets very frustrating when you have to keep coming back to reception to ask anything.    I requested a kettle to boil water for my sons milk and it was in very bad condition all bits were pealing of from inside and they only changed it when my wife got angry again reception staff need more training.    Many times the cleaners walked into my room without knocking and when I told the reception staff they said ‚Äúoh we will tell them to knock next time‚Äù it‚Äôs common sense they should be doing that anyway.    I requested a 2 pin socket i was shocked when the reception man said give money to one of the bell boys. Just because he went to fetch me from the office.    The outdoor pools are NOT heated lol freezing water. However there is an indoor heated pool which cost 150 dirrams per person which included the Jacuzzi.    Now with the GOOD points.    like everybody says in the reviews the entertainment team are just the best.  @ Smiley Rid1 Tony Cheima Hannah and Momo. Without these guys this hotel would be boring!  These guys rock the place late night shows every night and daytime they chill with all the guests. My son really loved these guys and very much enjoyed their company. BIG THANK YOU TO THE ENTERTAINMENT TEAM!!    The food was ok not bad loads of variety. Non alcoholic drinks were good.  The deserts need improving. Mohammed (manager) for the food area was great he Is welcoming and always came over to have a convo Big thank you to him also.    The hotel had a free shuttle service to the New and Old town which is great.    WiFi is only at the pool areas and the lobby.    A kettle and iron can be requested and the rooms also have a mini fridge.    The Hotel shop robs you I was charged one price and on the last day there was a new worker who was charging me extra. When I confronted her she spoke VERY rudely and said I was lying she‚Äôs lucky she is a women. So don‚Äôt waist your money at the hotel shop. Much cheaper elsewhere.    Overall we had a great time we enjoyed the company of all the other guests. it‚Äôs always more fun when you make friends and hopefully will return.

Entertainment is excellent Smiley Chamar Moomo absolutely brilliant.  Food choice was very good for all people from around the world cooked to perfection however could be a little hotter.  Rooms are very comfortable with a modern style and very clean.  The spa is a must I had the full package that lasted 3 hours yes 3 hours. My skin feels perfect one of the most relaxing.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,abdul786123 wrote a review Dec 2017,10,"Never again, poor standards worse experience and the owner is the king lol expectations is zeroooooooooo",I recently stayed at this hotel for a week and was not happy with the stay. The rooms were ok but no kettle etc heating did not work as well. The pools lol well couldnt use them water was soo cold even though weather was soo nice. thry need heated pools and there is extra charge to use thr indoor pool. Need an iron? well u have to wait hours n hours to get it. It was like they only had 1 to accomodate all the guest lol actually i asked several guest who where staying about the iron and they all said the same and it was the same colour red iron they got lol they need to invest in more irons lol. Food was ok but it was the same type of food everyday not many options to choose.  Going for the hammam and massage? DONT GO they charged me 700 dirhams for 30 mins hammam n 30 mins massage. I asked another guest and they said they only paid 375 each and they also had jacuzzi.  The wifi was only in the lounge area not in any rooms and as i have experienced other hotels with less stars they all had other facilities available and better service.  The staff were not helpful at all and couldnt speak english which was really a big downfall. The only staff that could speak and understand was amena and zenab both were helpful. The manager was not helpful at all as 2 guests where in a situation but could not help all he wanted was money money n more money.  I also heard that a quest where complaining for several days with no outcome. 1st day they had issue with the door and took the staff 2 days to fix and they had more issues within the room i felt so bad but was digusted how the situation was dealt with.  The only best outcome of this stay was meeting several guest and together we made our holiday worth while so thanks to Reana Samina aka Mini me lol Yahya and Iman and their cute children Ash and Sonia.  Truth is i would not return back to this hotel as i also found out that the king and a German are the owners of this aqua park and would have expected the standards to be at a higher quality standards to what i have experienced NEVER AGAIN and DO NOT BOOK to all.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Yorkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abdul786123
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Marta N wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Nice sun break,We came here as last minute deal hotel was nice and clean. No much food choices probably due to off season time. Swimming pool was extremely cold and when I asked then if they have heated one they sat they looking in to it. Spa was really nice and not expensive at all for 15h treatment was only ¬£20 each. Only disappointment was when we went to Sports Bar (which you have to buy your own drinks)whit the friends who was drinking drinks purchased there we was asked to leave as we bring a glass off wine from the bar next door. I truly do understand the drinks served there is nothing to compare to all inclusive drinks but we shouldn't been kick out.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,LucieWinnard wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Absolutely flipping fantastic!,We stayed at Labranda from November 1st - 15th and honestly had the most fabulous holiday. After reading the reviews previous to this I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect but holy guacamole who‚Äôs writing the bad ones?! The hotel is spotless. Room is cleaned every single day fresh towels the maid is absolutely lovely too. I have to say the entertainment team totally made it for me they are brill!! Momo in particular was the most entertaining funny and friendly guy I think I‚Äôve ever met. Racha was fab too as were Tony and Sammy. Their evening shows were so funny Zumba every day aqua fitness darts even an Arabic lesson. They work literally around the clock and in the 14 days we spent there didn‚Äôt have a day off. Absolutely amazing energy.  The bar staff at the pool and in the evening bar were fabulous too lots of fun and always happy to help. Never felt like any of the team didn‚Äôt want to be there even though they all work such long hours!  Reception staff were the only people who don‚Äôt particularly make you feel like you‚Äôre welcome - one young girl out of them was very friendly though so I generally waited until she was on the counter before I went over for anything. Gutted I didn‚Äôt get her name!  The food is decent. It‚Äôs your standard all inclusive food something for every one meat chips salad veg and don‚Äôt miss italian corner hiding in the restaurant with pasta and pizza! I didn‚Äôt have a bad belly once and tried absolutely everything.  There is a free bus to old town and to  New town which was a fantastic touch to our stay. If you go to new town and like steak check out MummaMia it was so good that my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  Currency: Take cash and change it when you get to the hotel - don‚Äôt bother at the airport the rates there are shocking!  Drinks are good definitely not watered down or cheap weak booze.    My advice - book it. You won‚Äôt regret it as long as you‚Äôre not expecting 5** for 3* prices. We don‚Äôt usually go back to the same place twice however we will most definitely be returning.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,donnalV6393FR wrote a review Nov 2017,10,Awful hotel awful staff,When we arrived at the hotel we asked for quiet rooms. The rooms we got were very near the bar and had no balcony. Still awake at 2.00 in the morning with all the noise. My friend had already previously emailed asking for quiet rooms. When we asked to change they were very unhelpful and we gave up. Food was okay not very hot and I was ill on two occasions after lunch. Staff were so unfriendly. The nicest person there was the omelette man! The best food we had was on a trip out in the mountains it was delicious and hot. I think the staff need a lesson in how to treat their guests then they might get some tips. Even the animation team were not friendly. I have never been to a hotel where they do not acknowledge you. I would never go there again.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnalV6393FR
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,tarice wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Honest review of the 5 days we spent here,We have never done all inclusive and were a bit put off by the reviews. Normally were eat out and we just wanted a cheap holiday in the sun. The matteress is a little hard but for my husband with back issues this was great. It is clean staff are always cleaning the place.    Staff are friendly and helpful. Entertainment staff were friendly and not pushy so this was good. We alternated between the large pool with music and the smaller adults only pool which was so quite you really could chill out. We had a quiet room in this area and slept long as the rooms are dark when you draw the curtains. The shower is amazing very powerful and i love a hot shower whatever the weather so this was great as it could go quite hot.    Pools themselves are freezing with not many people swimming for this reason. This meant that I would splash myself but not swim. They have a ping pong table and French balls.    Food _ breakfast was good with fresh omelettes and Moroccan pancakes. Lunch was average but dinners were good. You don't get Moroccan flat beads etc but it is a cheap place to stay so we were not expecting high quality buyout there is something for everyone. Wine is awful. The one you pay for ok if not the Moroccan cheaper bottle Local beer good. Cocktails good. Cakes and snacks inbetween good.    The shuttle we used to go into town and it was good. Just be prepared to be offered guides when you get off the bus. We have travelled and just Said no and it was five but I can see how that can be a daunting prices. Just say no and no more to the locals when they offer you help. That way they don't engage and you don't feel hounded. Go to the medina for the day to see the snake charmers but but at night from the souls when it is less busy and try the noughart sweets .    We ate out one day and it was a far better standard but there was a price tag that came with it so it depends on what you are after. Would recommend nomad with a great view over the medina. I read most Moroccans don't eat out so restaurants are more for the tourists.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarice
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Harem L wrote a review Nov 2017,50,BEST HOTEL,Honestly guys. I read a lot of reviews on here and really for put off. But this hotel is one of the best hotels out there. So many friendly staff from reception to security to activity group. Really nice people. There‚Äôs something for all ages. Really nice food. Different food everyday. Tasty food. Friendly people. Nice view and open space of hotel so you can walk around drinks are there and staff serve them are friendly. Couldn‚Äôt ask for better hotel. Might be around 20 mint drive away from city. But there‚Äôs a free shuttles bus. Or taxi charge around 150 to 200 durh. Approx 15¬£ to get to the markets. But there‚Äôs enough to do in the hotel to spend few days without going out.

The only real negative I would say is the welcome pack isn‚Äôt very forthcoming so you have to ask for meal times and bus times and the 3pm snacks are a bit basic sandwiches and donuts/waffles.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,jasmin e wrote a review Nov 2017,10,Wish I had listened to reviews and changed hotel:(,Currently staying here with my mum.  Read reviews before coming and was a little worried but felt we would come anyway. What a big mistake.  I agree with comments on cleanliness the hotel is clean and looked after.  From the day we arrived staff have been really unhelpful no information given and the travel reps extremely rude to us when asking about trips.  We have been on the free bus to the old town where we were actually physically pulled by women begging men urinating in the streets and horse legs scattered along the roads having just been cut off awful experience.  Food is Ok managed to eat pizza and that's it most nights although I'm currently unwell seems to be a pattern at this hotel people falling ill.  We are now on our 4th night and have just been refused alcohol apparently we didn't get it with our 'all inclusive' package although we have had alcohol every day at every bar... once again rude unhelpful reception tell me 'well that's what you get now'  Spa... It's not included it's ¬£18 just to get in booked scrub and 20 minute massage with Jacuzzi for ¬£35 was dingy dark and dirty water. Apparently they use special oils I was told however all I see them use were the tiny supplements inside the rooms..

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ruth C wrote a review Nov 2017,30,An honest opinion.,The hotel : a 20 minute drive from Marrakesh you cant leave except by taxi or bus there are wild dogs just outside the gates and it isn't safe to walkabout outside the complex so you cant explore unless going out with a tour group by vehicle or on the hotel bus to the souks .It has good security so the complex itself is very safe. You are given coloured wristbands to wear. The rooms are a good size and reasonably clean. Beds : mattresses very hard and uncomfortable. Food: if you are expecting delicious tagines dips flatbread etc forget it. There was plenty of food but simple and plain  not spiced to an authentic flavour or taste. They did BBQ lamb kebabs but they were raw in the middle. We also had chicken but it was a little undercooked and pink in the middle. There are salads and fresh bread rolls which were nice. Pudding is cake every lunchtime and dinner no fruit salad ice cream or variety just cake or plums and oranges and grapes. The morrocan pancakes at breakfast were lovely. Local drinks rum cocktails beer water and soft drinks  tea and coffee are available. The plates were not very clean  they were often a bit dirty with a dusty film or a bit greasy and could not have been well washed and rinsed.  The pools : there is a good slide for kids and a large pool but lots of games so can't use it much as only the deep or shallow ends are free when the many games are taking place the music is very loud. There was an adults only pool (but it wasn't child free there were often children in it )and is not close to the bar. We wanted to keep our room til evening on the last day but couldn't as not available but thankfully we were able to have lunch drinks and use the pools and toilet facilities etc. Went to the souks to do shopping but got so hassled we gave up after an hour it just wasn't enjoyable. The hotel staff work very hard to keep the place clean and are friendly and helpful. Tax was approx 260 dirhs for the week about ¬£26 for 2 people. WiFi only available in reception. It was a nice hotel but a bit like being in a 'luxury' compound and best for families with kids who want to just spend all the holiday beside the pool although be aware smoking is not banned by the pools.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7925WRruthc
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Clare S wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Relaxing holiday in great facilities,Arrived on 24th October for a family holiday. We were greeted by friendly staff & shown to our room at 11am so well before official check-in. Everything in the room was explained to us. After we settled in we soon realised the room needs some TLC as a few things weren‚Äôt working but this didn‚Äôt spoil our stay.    Food is great and plenty to pick from. We had a great time everyday the swimming pool slides kept our son well entertained. We ventured out on a site seeing tour which was hosted by brilliant tour guides; a great day out seeing the artichure of Marrakech. Lunch was included in a Marrakech restaurant full with colour & culture. We walked miles around the market which was a fab culture experience; watching many traders & children hard at work. During our last day we used the spa facilities at the hotel and enjoyed a relaxing massage; well worth doing.    Good points  - Swimming pools clean and option of four  - Well maintained outside area  - Lots of sun beds but still need to be down early  - Food we could not fault. A great Italian bar for children  - Entertainment team worked hard to keep children happy  - Bar staff worked hard  - Hotel staff very helpful  - Access to bottled water  - Spa facilities    Bad points  - Shower. Harsh on your skin and inconsistently working  - Bathroom sink. Take hours to run water down so we left the plug out  - Air-con poor  - Furniture tired & worn door to fridge broken  - Lightening in hotel room very poor  - Impossible to get a glass of wine at dinner time. Waiters don‚Äôt offer so you had to ask    Overall the hotel provided a great family holiday for us despite the faults I do feel as if I got the right value for money.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gunnislake, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908clares

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Shan wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Beautiful hotel üá≤üá¶‚ú®,I stayed at this amazing hotel for our family holiday. There were 8 of us split into two rooms. Initially we were given rooms which were too small and had to ask to be moved to rooms which appropriately accommodated us. The baggage handler seemed to be unhappy to help us move our baggage to the second room by his expressions and body language. This made us feel somewhat uncomfortable. üëúüíº    We were not informed about what time breakfast would be or any other important information so we had to ask at the reception desk. The staff at the reception desk were not friendly at all however the the bar staff and waiting staff for breakfast lunch and dinner were lovely and we ending up leaving tips. The food at the hotel was very delicious with many options to choose from.    The hotel provides a shuttle service which you need to sign up for every morning to secure a spot on the bus. We were not told about this service on arrival so if you stay here be aware and ask some question about this service.  The shuttle will drop you off at some of the popular tourist attractions and pick you back up at an allocated time if you do not wish to leave at the allocated time you can catch a taxi back to the hotel. üöåüöïüí®    The hotel also has SPA. The SPA is very clean and modern I would definitely recommend booking yourself in for a treatment to unwind and I‚Äôd say that this hotel was amazing overall but some of the staff and the lack of information really do let you let you down. In our time here we also witnessed an argument between reception staff and another hotel guest because of their behaviour.  There were activities that we were unaware we could partake which did disappoint us but we made the most of our time by taking trips out of the hotel on the free shuttle service I would stay here again but I would be more reserved  üëôüíÜüèæüíÉüèæüèäüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèìüê™üõµ,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shani1994

A big bonus with this hotel is that they have a nurse on site between 10 and 6 who was very helpful and the fact that there is no charge to see her is amazing.  We ended up seeing her twice and she was always very welcoming and helpful.  The waiters were brilliant and also the man making the omelettes.

Both pool bar and evening bar is good and service always prompt sometimes a few queues but nothing more than a couple of minutes. Food is varied and always something to eat lots of Moroccan food but this is Marrakesh not Margate.  The best part that really made the holiday is the animation team led brilliantly by Samy and the rest Tony Smiley Rad1 Chaima Momo and the best one Racha! They work so hard to make sure your holiday is entertaining from early in the morning right through til 10:30 at night after the amazing and funny shows they put together.

As other reviews said nothing is explained once checked in just bands put on wrists and keys to room the porter who took our bags was better he showed us the dining room bars n the pools also then took us back to reception and told them to give us a printout in English with meal timings what was inclusive and what wasn't. Rooms were nice bathrooms too yes there were a few ants but we were in morocco so ants flies lizards and mosquitoes etc to be expected! The food was ok bit bland but that's morrocon food can't expect fish n chip or bangers n mash as they would expect us to have tagines on hours...same as how the language French is spoken by all as that is native to them...the animation team was the best they are working all day and night and they were very good on the shows in the evening a tight budget for costumes n props but even then they were excellent on our last night they did river dance and they were amazing the same four run the kids clubs the pool side entertainment all day and then the shows in the evening.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,FrequentFlier737657 wrote a review Oct 2017,30,It's a real shame,Firstly we checked in around 9pm in the evening and we were really confused because we were not giving any set of direction or nothing... We were approached by a man who deals with the excursions who asked us to put on our bands and have dinner then the man will take us to our rooms ( OK then.. ) food wasn't pleasant to start off with and we thought maybe it's because we were rushed to eat so we gave it another chance the following days to come.. and on the way to dinner we saw a kind and only person smiling and that was the man himself RID 1 and we asked him when breakfast lunch and dinner is and he kindly told us and other things too and he introduced himself he was ever so kind..    the excursion people are really a waste of space just noising around and grumpy. anyway moving forward we were just giving our room keys and we got into our room.. so we had to guess our way around and what services they provide.    Food again was disappointing and very slow keeping a line of people waiting they didn't have a strategy and were giving out undercooked food which had left a few people I know with food poisoning the food only got better when the school holidays came around the corner which I think is really un professional of them to do because we all paid the same amount of money for this accommodation but you only care when there's more people that come into the hotel to give better food which was still undercooked. We all asked for the manager but don't even think there was one because he was never there or never even got any compensation or any apologies.    Cleaners are sneaky.. make sure your money is with you at all times we were around 300 dhirims short and made sense after we heard stories going around and found out many cleaners got the sack because they were stealing money and other valuables even the safe is not even safe at all so watch out for that please.    Shuttle buses to the markets were a big help so thank you for that but my advise to you guys is to sort out your receptionists and catering as they really let the hotel down and really hope you give much love to the animation team ;    MOMO ( really funny guy really friendly and wish him the best in the future as he has really amazing talent )    The same goes out to RID1 TONY ( another funny character)  SMILY  RACHA  SAMY and JOHNNY plus their music choices at the pool and dances are epic and will never forget these guys üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº hope you all the best as you have made us feel really welcomed and whoever the manager is should give these guys a lot of appraisal because without them and their hard work this hotel would drop to a 1. I blame the management to be fair. I would return only to see the animation team because they made this holiday for me the best and it's was that good I we would always wake up early to enjoy the activities they would provide.    So if your reading this please improve the food for kids as well as adults and the staff too because they let the place down    Best regards  ALI,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentFlier737657

I certainly had no complaints an amazing amount of choice it was different every meal and every day. didn't seem particularly hot (temp wise) but when catering buffet style you don't expect food to be piping hot so not a big deal. it was really good.    hotel communal areas was kept spotlessly clean and rooms clean enough did have foot marks on the wall in our room though and shower pressure / hot water didn't seem completely reliable    staff were mostly friendly and helpful they even helped us print boarding passes for the flight home as it wasn't available on my mobile app there was an older guy running the pool bar who never seemed to smile seemed standoffish and rude but not the end of the world.    Entertainment team were lovely and tried to mix with everyone - god do they work hard though constantly games and activities being arranged at the pool in the day and then was the same crew doing shows and entertainment in the evenings through to 11pm. it is basically hilarious cheesy holiday fun pulling in audience participation etc.    shuttle service into the city both old and new town is free and a nice touch as the resort is in the middle of nowhere it runs every two hours and last shuttle back to the hotel is around 8pm. We would have liked to have taken advantage of shuttles after this time though but a taxi at 80dhirum isn't the end of the world.    twice during our 5 day trip we had to plan a different shuttle to the time we wanted due to a lack of space little bit of a pain as it led to wasted time - we were here mid October i suspect earlier in the summer when the resort is busier this could be a bigger problem    word of advice a printout in the rooms telling you of meal times and general hotel information would be great no one explains this when you arrive your just left to figure it out we missed lunch due to not knowing it was going to finish but snacks were out half hour later so not the end of the world. Could offer spa prices and services on the same print out - it would be a way to tempt use of these facilities,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4205SWsama
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ben T wrote a review Oct 2017,20,Ambitious 4 star hotel,The hotel itself is a very nice building nice rooms etc. But as for the food very poor the food was nice but very little choice and very very under staffed. Starting at breakfast if you want pancake good luck 20-25 minute wait for 1 pancake however it is full of French people who have no concept of queuing so if you‚Äôre French your wait will only be 3 minutes! Other options were okay but 3 people serving over 250+ guests isn‚Äôt nearly enough. Lunch is okay however if you are a slightly fussy eater you are limited to pizza pasta and chips everyday same story for dinner. The drinks are basic soft drinks are flat no matter what you order as a cocktail you get the same thing the beer is local but it is okay. If you are a cider drinker looks like you‚Äôre in for a very sober holiday. If you do not have kids do not visit! The evening entertainment is non existent. The pool is okay however only use the adult/quiet pool as it is just about free of the screaming kids. As for outside the hotel do not leave! We went on 1 excursion to the soukes and it is the worst place in the world people constantly cornering you and full of men just staring at women‚Äôs bags. No matter how much the tour guide tells you it is safe it is not the slightest! Do not let anyone go by themselves and do not take your children in particular if they are girls.    There are lots of good bits to the hotel and as a whole I enjoyed my stay these are the bad bits and this is a very ambitious 4 star hotel. If your coming on a holiday with adults look elsewhere.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bentE6684JE

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Luke S wrote a review Oct 2017,20,Fair for the price.,Hotel was nice marble and high ceilings. Room was great air con not so much. Pools were a bit dirty but OK. Food was a bit hit and miss mostly hit for me but not for my partner although never went hungry and the drinks were sub par (stork lager is not nice no other choice and the spirits were standard all inclusive crap). Service/staff were grumpy. Animation team was good though. We asked ourselves what we'd rate the place but had to come back to what we paid. For what we paid the hotel did an excellent job I wouldn't say it was 4 stars which is where the disappointment comes but we didn't pay 4 star prices. The hotel shuttle bus to the city centre was good. But the city centre is no place for children. No one warned us. It's a developing nation with aggressive beggars and scamsters. An experience for sure but not to be repeated and not for the children.    Dropped from a 3/5 to a 2/5 as the hotel decided to paint the tables in the bar and leave them drying without any warnings. We all got covered in black paint. Highly unprofessional.    But remember you get what you pay for. We booked a package which was 75% flights. Hotel did a fair job. We had a good time.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Flitwick, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/964lukes

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kirran wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Average Stay...NOT a 4*.,We stayed as a family of 4 adults from Monday 16th October-Monday 23rd October.  Lets start with the good points...    THE ENTERTAINMENT TEAM!!! We are a very well travelled family and have stayed at hotels all around the world but the entertainment team here has to be THE BEST we have ever seen! Soon as they saw new faces by the pool they made an effort to get you involved in the games by the pool. They worked from 10am-6pm then again from 9pm-11pm keeping you entertained!  We didnt have any kids with us but could see how amazing they were with other peoples kids. No one had a bad thing to say about these guys VERY hard working!  Tony is the best! (private joke haha) Smiley MoMo Racha Rid1...missing you guys so much you're team is an asset to the hotel.    The rooms- we had 2 pool view first floor rooms. They were MASSIVE. Very clean and up keep was very good from house keeping. The balconies were swept everyday and fresh towels and shower gels everyday.  Although we had no problems with our room we did hear from others that housekeepers had been going through baggage and been caught?    Now the negatives...    The food- Three days into our holiday we realised that around half the hotel had stomach aches diarrhoea and sickness. This included my mum dad and brother. This was because at dinner one night we got served RAW chicken. It was uncooked in the middle. Whilst by the pool my mum started feeling sick and Tony from the entertainment team took her to see the nurse who logged the sickness. For us this ruined our holiday as 3 out of 4 members of the family spend 4/7 days in bed in the room they didn't eat anything other than bread and water for the rest of the holiday. We all had upset stomachs and my mum and dad were physically sick for 3 days.  Also the salads were not kept in chillers and not enough selection of food at breakfast if you don' t like eggs or moroccan pancakes your screwed.    The bar- The barmen are grumpy and moody who never smile. They make drinks without measuring the amount of alcohol so your drink either tastes of nothing but alcohol or you cant even taste the alcohol...for a 4* we expected better drinks. We watched the bar guy 'clean' the glasses by rinsing them with no washing up liquid used.    The all inclusive- Well it isnt. The all inclusive starts at breakfast and finishes at dinner. After 10pm if you want food you have to order it from outside and the bar stops at midnight. We have stayed at 4* hotels where the all inclusive is 24 hours. If we're paying ¬£500pp we expect to be able to eat whenever we want to NOT when we are told to.  Also if you want ice cream at anytime of the day you have to buy it. We have never been to a hotel on all inclusive and they don't serve ice cream.  The cheapest ice cream from the hotel shop is ¬£1.50.    The staff- Can't understand/speak english. The reception girls are RUDE. We had asked if we could change money and they said come back at 5pm. So we went back at 5pm to be told they cant do it because they guy who changes money isn't there. As we were going out that evening i demanded to see the manager about this. 2 min later i was told this could be done. When i asked the woman why she lied she got rude and started speaking to her colleague in french whilst looking at me...very professional.    Wifi- you can only get wifi by the pool and in reception. We were willing to pay extra to have it in our room but they don't have an option to do that.    We checked the reviews of this hotel upto the day we flew out and saw nothing bad but did not expect to get food poisoning. We have stayed in 4* hotels 10X better than this and would not recommend anyone to book here.  They only enjoyable thing about this hotel was the entertainment team and other holiday makers we met there.  We have written to our travel company whilst out there and will not be returning. We are also aware of many other people who stayed the same time as us who feel the same way.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirran_22
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kelleta J wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Good but room for improvement.,So we are at the end of a ten day stay at this hotel. Overall it is good as in nice clean no issues with the cleanliness of the rooms. And most of the staff we encountered were nice and polite not any issues with the language barrier they tried and that's all you can ask for if you don't know French or Arabic...  So I'll do it section by section and explain why I think it's a three star (that's me being generous)  Hotel itself very nice but extremely far from everything. Reception staff not very accommodating as we had booked two rooms pool view next to each other the rooms we got had the numbers that were next to each other 1245-1246 but in actual fact they were about 8 rooms and two hallways apart so not ideal when we went to ask for rooms nearer they said it was too late and come back in morning we did and they said as one room was pool view they won't be moving that one and took the other party to view rooms that were smaller not cleaned yet and not near the other room and not really pool view more like tree View. So they had decided after viewing three much smaller rooms they would have to make due with what they had as 3 people in one room was a squeeze as it is without going into a smaller room.  So the One which was pool view 1246 was nice lovely room but two single size beds I moved the beds next to each other and against the wall and this solved my issue as I had a toddler and she would have fell of the bed so that worked for us and the other one was roof view of the front of hotel 1245 had two single beds and a fold out bed we just made it work as reception staff didn't seem like they had the time of day to help. But as I say rooms clean and tidy.  On coming bk to one of our rooms after a day out a picture had been knocked off the wall and the plug socket was left hanging off the wall as a result of that happening but. We phones down and they were quick to fix that issues.    Now changing money changing money here is abit of a joke. We on numerous occasions would come to change money but be told there was no money till later on in the afternoon after 1pm sometimes later they always send the people to the bank in the morning. So if you can change a lump sum in the airport before your due to arrive it will help.    One little shop on site which is OK sucker ice creams and crisp chocolate pop pool toys and souvenirs and the staff in there were very nice and helpful but a very basic shop as in if they run out that maybe it till the next day so if your going at a busy time be mindful of that.    Please note there are no sucker or ice-cream as apart of ur all inclusive stay here. Just the food and drink.    The bar staff at the inside bars and pool bar where friendly enough but at snack 3-5pm you can not get alcohol in the inside bar part during that time u have to use the pool bar for ur alcohol but they will serve soft drinks.    The cleaning staff maintenance people and security people and porters I didn't have any issues with they were very helpful and polite and did a very good job at maintaining the hotel.    The pools were great we didn't use the slides but they were working and being used by familys during our stay. The mini kid club was good for the little ones but if they are under 4yrs old you have to watch and stay with them at all times. The entertainment staff were lovely too. They do do an amazing job and deserve the credit to. The shows are abit cheesy but what do you expect they do the shows and try keep it bilingual to accommodate all.    The kids club was good there's was one lady who was the second mummy to all the kids I wasn't sure at first but she did the hotel proud as she ensured the kids were safe during there time in the kids club and during the kids entertainment nights 9pm - 9.30pm which yes is abit late but it's because dinner isnt till late 7pm.    The snack time other people have complained about there being no food and the snack closing earlie but I didn't have an issues a snack is as it says a snack not a meal it's little pastries and sandwiches to tie you over till dinner.  Now the food breakfast u caunt go wrong well depending on how u like your eggs we had to keep saying to flip them or abit longer as sometimes the eggs were not properly cooked but the chefs were happy to do this that is all we had for breakfast or making toaties out of the cheese nd meats they had. Ask for a teaspoon for the yoghurt a toddler and a table spoon were not good but there spoons must go missing.    Lunch was probebly some of the best food. They had chips and the kids enjoyed they have a Italian corner where they do pizza and pasta and bolognese a vegggy and meat option which was good. Thats opened at lunch and dinner.  The food at dinner felt abit repetitive and not very nice it felt like what was left at lunch was mixed with something else and served for dinner. But the last two days I think after the many complaints it had picked up and they were serving chips at dinner which they hadn't done previously so our kids were left hungry at night till breakfast next day.  There is always a rice dish pasta dish and vegetable and. Meat dish fish and chicken they do try and accommodate for everyone.  Although sometimes food can taste abit salty or bland or the vegetables taste like they could have had another 5minutes boiling.  The lasagne yesterday was probebly the best thing I had this whole ten days I had seconds.    There is a mix of salads and sauces and fruit and cold rice and cous cous so there's something for everyone. Now here's the bad bit although the food was nice some times they were in too much of a rush and the food wasn't cooked properly I and a few other people had to take chicken bk to be cooked fully as pink chicken isn't appatising for anyone. And although they have the fruit and salad be mindful it's washed in there water so an upset tummy maybe imminent bring ur immodium and dyrilite as you may need it better safe then sorry.    Although they have the two buses to take you to old town and new town you have to come down at 7 pm the night before to book on to a bus and that's just to get to the town you then have to book with the driver to come back and if other people have booked that time you want and the bus gets full you won't be Able to come bk at that time. Also the drivers won't wait for on the way bk we have got there at four to get the bus bk and it had left earlie so we had to get a taxi back to the hotel. Taxis from old town and new town work out to be about 150 dirham. As the hotel is quiet far away from the towns. So if you don't want to end up paying out get there ten minutes before just to be on he safe side.    My little girl has got an eye infection from the pool water here the last two days and we are leaving today and checkout is at 12pm the nurse told us she has to rest her eyes and not be in the sun or anything so we had to speak to manager to get one of our rooms till 3.30 so she can have a sleep and rest before our flight and long journey home. Because when I asked reception staff they were not very helpful at all. The man at meeting point was fab he rang for the manager she came down and told them to let us keep the room for longer as the little one needed it. So after lunch we went bk upto the room and the beds had been stripped and towns taken so I guess that's no sleep for a poorly little one after all. Think the message just didn't go all the way down to the maids cleaning that we had the room for longer as they had stripped the beds whilst we went for lunch.    This is not a great hotel deffinetly not a four star and I don't know if I would be bk the people I have met most of them are nice and I feel I could like to come bk for a break but only to Morocco not to this hotel having a upset tummy because of the food when you are all inclusive and not having any other means of food without having to pay 300 dirum for taxis to get food which then should be even more expensive it's not good and with the food here being abit repetitive and not having an option for kids other then pasta and pizza I can see why kids were free!! they don't want to come back here and the fact they haven't got a room for people to freshen up in if they are not leaving the hotel till the evening is abit of a no no. It's a hard one I'm torn it's a beautiful place but needs some major improvements and because of the troubles I had here I won't be coming bk.  As holidays go this one has left me wanting another one to get over this one. The kids didn't enjoy the food and with us all getting upset tummy I'm not surprised as to why. It's all right the hotel looking a four star but it actually has to be a four star in return for people to be getting what they pay for.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelletaj
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Charlotte D wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Amazing...,We have recently just spent the past week at Labranda Targa Aquapark hotel and we highly rate the hotel and staff there.    From the moment we arrived late in the evening we were taken to the buffet area to have dinner before checking in which was greatly appreciated. We went fully inclusive and enjoyed the varied selection of food for breakfast lunch and dinner there was something for everyone in my opinion. Cold water bottles were readily available in the fridges and the air con was great in our bedroom. The bedroom was very spacious with a nice built in shower. High praise goes to the staff who entertained guests such as Tony and Smiley they were very entertaining and added to making the hotel warming to guests.    I booked a Hammann and facial at the Oriental hotel spa the staff were very accommodating and I came away feel very relaxed and my skin felt amazing.    You can reserve a place on the free shuttle bus at reception that travels to two different locations Nouvelle Ville and Jemaa el fna which was great.    Overal throughly enjoyed our stay at our hotel and will highly recommend this hotel to our friends.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlotted703
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,alibella28 wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Return visit,This was our 2nd visit in 4 months. After a fantastic stay in June we decided to return in the 1st week October . One of the reasons for returning to this hotel was because of the fantastic food we had on our previous visit. Not sure what's happened but this time the food & choice was very poor. Occasionally you had an odd lovely meal but seriously stews with lumps of bones are not on. Most of the meat dishes were just bones or lumps of fat. I realise the hotel wasnt full capacity but there was very limited choice of hot dishes. Salads were good though.  Also on the 3rd day in we started with painfull tummy cramps with diarrhoea. We met up with friends on this holiday & all 4 of us were the same . We have all continued to be poorly for almost 2wks on our return home. Just to be clear non of us ate outside of the hotel. However i realise it might not necessarily be down to the food as it could have been the ice or drinks.  But one thing we did notice was that the drinks glasses at the pool bar are only given a quick rinse . I hate making negative comments as i have truly enjoyed this hotel and wonderful staff in the past but being ill like this on holiday is no fun. Maybe the hotel can take note of how the glasses are cleaned.  POSSITIVES  Staff were friendly especially the entertainment team  Gardens & grounds kept clean  Rooms were great again & kept clean  Weather in October is beautiful and a great time to visit  hot (mid 30s) but without the intensity of the summer months.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Penrith, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alibella28
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Siane1984 wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Cheeky October Getaway!,Have just returned from a lovely 4 days at labranda Targa. After a flight delay we finally arrived at the hotel and were straight away told to go to the resturant and get a cold drink and some food before check in (this was very welcomed after being up since 3am and travelling all day)Check in was quick and very efficient and reception staff were friendly and helpful.    Our room was perfect! Very clean and spacious and had everything we needed.... the aircon was not very good in our room but as it was not the hight of summer it was bearable. I can imagine that in August this may have been an issue. The bathroom was super clean and the large powerful shower was amazing!!    The food was one of the highlights for us!! There always plenty of yummy traditional dishes to choose from and we didn't really ever have a problem with queues. Occasionally the soft drink machine would stop working but this was always promptly fixed. The free bottles of water were also a welcome addition!    The staff on a whole were friendly and helpful. There were a few grumpy bartenders but I can honestly say that this had no effect on our holiday. The entertainment staff were fantastic and more than made up for the odd grump behind the bar - they really are a credit to this hotel they are obviously very good friends and this shows. There was always something going on around the pool from dance classes to water aerobics. We are very boring and are not 'joiners' but we very much enjoyed watching all the games and entertainment going on around us we were never pressured or pestered to join in (unlike some hotels) and had a such a laugh watching everyone playing the games and enjoying themselves.    The only downside of this hotel are the occasional swarms or wasps. There are quite a few but this isn't really the hotels faultthere are wasp traps around so they are trying but there are still quite a few that bothered us.    We did have an one incident where the maid left our room door open after cleaning but thankfully all our valuables were either with us or in the safe and everything else seemed untouched - this could have turned out very differently but we were lucky. I did raise this with the hotel manger who was very apologetic as was the cleaning manager. Mistakes happen and there was no harm done on this occasion but I was a little on edge coming back to our room every day after this ( maybe that's just my OCD though!!)    Over all we were very satisfied with our trip and would not hesitate to come back again for a cheeky few days away in the sun!! üòÅ,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Siane1984
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sbounty wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Unforgotten Experience,Our booking went smoothly and we arrived to the hotel safely. Check-in took so much time one receptionist was handling many guests which was not enough. The room was a massive calm and very well cleaned. Tissue box was missing and reception informed but the housekepping did not make the follow up to provide it till we have asked the receptionist once again. Atmosphere at the hotel is so so so amazing kids loved it indeed as we are the parents. Food was perfect but the only one problem in this hotel which I can blame the management is not and not enough staff means for us as a family wasted a lot of time to get served the food a massive queues everywhere even was the buffets but the matter some of the food can serve by cooker direct only..for example to get pancakes we were waiting between 10 to 20 minutes. Another matter we have noticed when we were queued the swimming pool's staffs came to collect their food without queue when customers must served first (I think you are agreed with me) how come once we were waiting for vacant table to have our food and staff occupied it...!!!!!!?    The one staff I appreciate indeed the high superior customer services provided to us is the receptionist MISS AMINA she was perfect very helpful eye contact and when she took a notice from us as customer she did the follow up immediately. Thank you so much MISS AMINA and because of you we decide to come back to this hotel again.    This is a message for the hotel's management especially rooms division department and food & beverage. Please when you have high occupancy at your hotel make sure you have enough staff at these two departments otherwise I can say it was not organised properly and professionally. You have amazing hotel where customers arrived to be served and feel a warm welcomed with full enjoy do not lose them because of your cut off budget from hiring the more staff that will allow you to lose more customers.    The last small problem were in our room is too much ants founded and the management must to take in considerations.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sbounty

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,mummyjo2017 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,10 days of fun in the sun!,We booked this hotel very last minute taking a bit of a chance but we couldn't have chosen better. The room was huge and cleaned everyday free bathroom soaps etc which was a bonus. Shower was massive and powerful free safe and cold fridge as well as very good air con. Couldn't fault the room at all.  Breakfast was amazing with a vast selection of just about everything the Moroccan pancakes were my favourite.  Entertainment starts gently about 9.30am and hits up throughout the day with games in and out of the pool. Lunch is great and again a wide variety. Games start again at 2.30pm and the entertainment crew are amazing really getting people involved.  The free shuttle was perfectly organised and it's only a short trip into town. If we wanted to come back late we just jumped in a taxi which is cheap and easy to do.  I would recommend not hiring a car they drive like maniacs!! With no apparent road rules.  Always felt safe and never scared you just have to be strong but polite and a smile goes a long way.  Now for the best bit!! The animation team........... these people really make the hotel and made a great holiday amazing. Rad1 SmileyJohnny MoMo and Sammy are an absolute credit to the hotel. They work very hard and go over and above to make sure you have a fantastic stay. They will sit and chat join in all the fun and are very very funny. The hotel should give them huge credit for doing such a fantastic job.  I have never returned to a hotel but this one I will be booking again very soon and have already recommended to my friends.

We arrived at midday and we were given 7 rooms next to each other on the ground floor our room was clean with an amazing shower. We had twin beds which wasn't a problem and we soon pushed them together.  Grounds all kept looking beautiful by the gardeners working non stop.  Entertainment team were fabulous Smiley Sami and Racha just to name a few always trying to get us involved but respectful if you said no. I personally loved the aqua Zumba and the sun dance.  Food was good I loved the salads and breakfast was good too especially the eggs for dinner there was always a mixture of beef chicken and fish I did get into a habit of putting my dinner in the microwave as I like piping hot food sometimes you have a little wait while they restock the dishes but really not a problem. The waiters were fabulous and work non stop I just wish we had taken their names as there was 13 of us they would already have a table set up and worked tirelessly filling our wine.  Drinks were great again the bar staff work so hard there would sometimes be a bit of a que especially when we would get a round in apologies for that! The Rum Beer Wine and Gin all tasted really good.  We did tip barman waiters waitresses and taxis as I think they thoroughly deserved it.  I would definitely think of returning for a bit of winter sun and fun.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/234janice

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sarah V wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Entertainment team Maxi club,We arrived 2 October and right from when I got there I got into the holiday.    The pool is really busy and there was always ao.ethi g you g on with the entertainment staff.    They are all really friendly and so comical their shows are just amazing. I live to get involved but I've never got involved I somethi g everyday lime I did on this holiday.    They all make you feel so welcome and are always to take time out and have a chat with you.    They have everything from darts French bowls beach volley ball football and even a mixture of dance lessons. They also have morning stretching classes and step aerobics.    It's very lively and great for kids. We were in a group of girls for a girls holiday we spoke with people that had kids and there was no bad word said they really get the kids involved I everything. There is a kids club and no I disco in the evenings and all are so good with the little ones. Their signature dance is wicked .    There was also always something going on in the pool from Aqua aerobics Aqua gym Aqua Sumba there is also water polo water volley ball and much more.    I found them enjoyable to speak to each day and although I was tired due to the fun they make the exercise I couldn't stop myself from joiing back in I was so pumped and have never enjoyed exercise so much before.    So I'd just like to thank the hotel for having such a great bunch to keep your guests entertained they are such a big credit to the hotel.    So I guess there isn't much more for me to say rather than a huge huge thanks to my favourite member of the Maxi team Momo the little baby of the group and of corse all the rest so thanks to Rid1 Smiley Samy Zak Yoyo and all the others we loved your entertainment and especially the riverdance that you did absolutely amazing so much hard work went into your dance.

Our welcome was first class we were welcomed by there own tea and biscuits which was such a nice inviting touch. The hotel is the cleanest hotel we've ever stayed in. Every staff member was absolutely amazing and catered for our every need  we didn't have to lift a finger. We had a massage there with the loveliest ladies which was amazing and felt so relaxed and spoilt. If you miss lunch there's a excellent snack bar with staff that makes u feel so welcome. Haven't even got to the water park in my opinion has to be one of the best in the world the slides are bang on with staff everywhere to help with anything  one guy in general can't remember his name but he had the best green eyes ( he will know who he is ) went out his way with my children. The whole day was full on always something going on staff were very involved talking to everyone we played killer dart's which was hilarious if you lost u had to jump in pool  we played water volleyball too boy's v girl's was just hilarious girls won of course  evening entertainment was always good it's the pool staff for us that made our holiday with two in particular Maurice and di di who we're just the kind of staff u want  Maurice always made sure he was heard going around causing harmless chaos which was great and di di always made time to come and speak with everyone of us and eventually bought my nearly two year old round to being he's best friend ( not a easy task ) just little touches like this was lovely. Would 100% go back and would recommend it to anyone. Missing it already x,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samkerry
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,alisonbontiff wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Best holiday for a long time,Wasn't too keen on going to Marrakech but thought I would give it a go. The BEST decision I could have made. The hotel was stunning and the rooms were spacious and clean the linen was changed every day and fresh towels were provided. The manager did his upmost to ensure each visitor was catered too and you would often see him walking around outside ensuring we were enjoying our stay. The food was fantastic which for me is a first as I am so fussy. Anything and everything was provided and if they didn't have it it would be there the next day. The lunch time BBQ's were delicious and the whole leg of beef was my fav. Now for my favourite part of the holiday THE ENTERTAINMENT TEAM. Mehdi Smiley are amongst the entertainers who provided us with games dancing Arabic lessons Moroccan dancing lessons Samba classes aqua aerobics zumbarobics football water polo  these were the few things that kept us entertained and this is without the evening entertainment as well. Please continue to bring joy to peoples holidays and in my opinion you all deserve a pay rise for the hard work. Thank you for allowing us to experience this fantastic time and I am sure to come back next year.

When we went in September there were not alot of children so was nice and quiet.  The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to Marrakech old town and Gueliz too.  The souks in the old town are amazing by day with all kinds or authentic Moroccan treasures and transformed by night into open air restaurants.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,LittleGem wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Excellent value for money,For the price this was excellent. Rooms were clean and cleaned every day with new towels etc. Staff were really friendly and helpful the safe didn't work when we arrived and reception sent someone up straight away to fix it. Air conditioning in our room wasn't powerful enough for us but then in 39 degree heat it's no wonder it struggled!    Lunch was a really good quality different tagines plus food cooked fresh a BBQ and a pizza oven and lots of different salads. We didn't think the dinners were as good but still there was a good selection. Breakfast had lots of choice and had omelettes and fried eggs to order I would've liked more fresh fruit and better coffee but again for the price I thought the selection for food overall was really good.    Pool areas were excellent always found a sunbed at any time and the 4 slides were fun. The all inclusive bar had a good choice including cocktails.    The free shuttle bus was good we used it to the old and new town shame the return buses finish around 8 would've been good for there to be a later option as we had to get taxis back.    We loved Marrakech and would definitely recommend the hotel!,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Darlington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemLambie

The hotel was very clean in the general areas and our room we got fresh towels everyday and could easily swap the pool towels.  There was plenty of choice for food and it was all well cooked and tasty I was very worried I wouldn't like anything but always found something to eat.  The entertainment team did a great job all day at getting people to join in - I won't be forgetting the sun dance anytime soon! The evenings were relaxed but we enjoyed all of the shows put on by them so well done! Great work Rad Smiley Johnny and all of the team!  We booked an evening in the desert through the hotel which included a camel ride 4x4 and a traditional Moroccan meal. We figured out it was about ¬£65 but well worth it!!

Went here with family. We had an amazing time On the day we arrived we was greeted via a manager who made us feel at ease straight away. He said we are now to treat the hotel as home. There is absolutely nothing bad that i can write down about this hotel. The staff there work extremely hard day in day out. Hotel is kept to an amazing high level of cleanliness. The entertainment staff are totally the best i have ever seen working in an hotel. seriously hard working. they entertain all variety of ages. Starting early in morning threw till very late at night. The resturant is a buffett style breakfast lunch and evening meal. The food is freshly cooked especially omelette station. omg its to die for. Lovely food everyday. There are five pools to choose from with plenty of sunbeds and parasols. Rooms are cleaned everyday to your demand. Fresh towels everyday. Pool towels provided each day with a token given to you via reception. There are no stupid rules like taking food or drinks from resturant. bottled Water is kept in a fridge for everyone to take again no limits. All inclusive starts from 10.00am untill 23.00pm. no limits. safes in rooms are free of charge. internet is free of charge. Pool gardens are kept tidy and attended to everyday. Childrens play areas and all pools including water slides are maintained by life quards. I could go on and on about this hotel and its all good nothing bad. If you get the chance to go you really wont be disappointed. GOOOO!!! Thank you labranda targa and all the staff at this hotel for making our weeks stay with you so special.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Marisa84 wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Relaxing and welcoming!,Beautiful hotel with really friendly and welcoming staff. My sister and I stayed here for 3 days as part of a third party spa break deal - the staff facilities and atmosphere were excellent and certainly a very relaxing place to stay during the last weeks of september. I imagine it could be a lot more hectic in the peak seasons. We loved the fun slides too and enjoyed messing around on the different choices as a break from lounging around by the pool all day. The hotel offer a free bus service which shuttles you to the old and new towns and back again which is useful for checking out the infamous souks. Excursions are all available via the hotel at reasonable prices and the spa facilities were of a good-high standard and comparatively very cheap than what you would expect to find in the UK. I would say that if you were looking to find even cheaper deals however you may be better to head into the city and haggle for some deals there - haggling is tough going in Morocco though so depends on what kind of trip you're looking for. I found the food selection to be good though agree the flies around the food area are frustrating a little offputting to some perhaps. I'm fairly easy going and well (ish) travelled so I wasn't expecting to be waited on hand and foot nor was I expecting there to be zero flies - it's all part and parcel of being in a hot country in the African continent. the treatment and service is certainly higher than what you might expect in a four star hotel in the EU but perhaps not comparable to those in the Caribbean or Red sea area.    Lots of activities at the hotel and there is a market that is brought in should you wish to remain hotel bound - if you are only on a 3 night stay for example.    Evenings tend to be quiet on the whole though there is some entertainment and the music is fun and not too terrifyingly cheesey - we certainly had a good dance!    - and as someone who has visited Marrakesh previously I know there is a good nightlife scene in the old and new town should you wish to adventure out one evening - weekends are better of course. Marrakesh in the evening isnt cheap so expect to pay out for your drinks but a taxi from the hotel to the city centre should only be around 200dhr which is roughly (¬£20) and about 8-10km.    Would definitely recommend this place and will be visiting again!,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marisa84
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Hamid B wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Great resort which is let down by food,5 of us stayed here for a week. The positives; animation crew are absolutely brilliant and they made the holiday for us - lots of activities by the pool and entertainment in the evening rooms are good and cleaned daily facilities are very good especially the pools and slides we found all of the staff friendly free bus to the old and new town regularly throughout the day and plenty of water and drinks available.    The not so goods the food was a bit bland for me - i think they try to cater too much to European families - i would have liked to have seen more Moroccan dishes (tagines etc). i found some of the other guests behavior very selfish - especially the amount of food they wasted (especially deserts) also behavior when putting towels on sun loungers and hogging parasols. This was not the fault of the hotel who were happy to help getting you sun lounger or parasol. This hotel is not at the luxurious end but then you are not paying those prices.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hb144
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ellen H wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Lovely week away!,Please don't listen to the bad reviews- I'm glad we didn't!  My partner and I have just returned after a lovely week away at Labranda Targa.    On arrival (late) we were greeted by friendly and welcoming reception staff who quickly showed us to our room. There is a landing tax you have to pay on arrival I think it was around ¬£20 for both of us. The room was spacious and clean bathroom comes with toiletries and hairdryer. Rooms are cleaned everyday and fresh towels and bedding daily. A free saw is also in each room. We enjoyed the different designs of pillows/throws on our bed from the housekeepers each day. There are also interlocking family rooms if requested. The hotel staff work extremely hard on keeping the hotel rooms grounds and pools immaculate.    Each of the 5 pools are kept to a very good standard and cleaned regularly. There are lifeguards by the main pools who cannot do enough to help you especially the chap by the main pool in the Gucci hat he was very good with the children. Pool towels are available from the hut next to slides- you'll need a card from reception. These can be swapped for clean ones daily (sometimes twice a day if needed).    Samy and his animation team were absolutely fantastic from the start to the end of the holiday. Always getting people involved with the day and evening activities I can recommend the aqua gym in the main pool at 11.30am lots of fun and good for working off the delicious all inclusive food! The evening entertainment is mostly held in the theatre room and you can tell they work really hard on new shows every night if you don't fancy the entertainment there is a live singer every night outside of the Cosy bar. Every member of the animation team were so lovely could not do more for you always there to help and offer advice.    We found the food to be very good always enough of it and a good variety. It can get quite busy and some guests do not know how to queue but nevertheless there was always something available for everyone. Some food is prepared in front of you which was nice. The man who makes omelettes for breakfast is a star- from day one he remembered our requests and cooked our omelettes to perfection enough so we had one everyday! He also is on the BBQ at lunchtime which I can recommend the chicken skewers if available!    We did a couple of excursions through the hotel- Camel Ride and Jeep Safari in the D'Agafay desert this includes a 3 course dinner with entertainment. We paid around ¬£60 each for this if I remember correctly and were happy with this price.  We also opted for a guided tour of Marrakech old town and I'm so glad we did! So many people we met had awful experiences in the towns/markets be warned that as soon as you get to the main square people will put snakes/monkeys on you and take a photo- after this they will make you pay a ridiculous amount of money. Not to mention the monkeys being dressed up and chained by the neck it is the cruelest thing I have ever witnessed. If they come over to you say NO and steer clear. Also the ladies with Henna they will grab your hand and start to draw on you and once again try to charge you even against your will. The locals at the markets are out to make money so if you opt to head into town on your own don't let them tell you where to go they could say that 'the mosque is forbidden' so follow me I'll take you to the square- shock horror another local is there waiting and they both will take your money and you will not be at the square. Even if you don't know where you are going just pretend you do.  If you go with a guide they will tell you this on approach to square you also don't get pounced on so well worth the ¬£17 each for guided tour.  Free return shuttle bus into New and Old towns available from reception but need to book 1 day in advance.    The onsite shop is limited and quite expensive so try to take everything with you as I am not sure how close the next shop is to hotel.    The only negative we had during our trip was the Marrakech Market which has nothing to do with hotel.

If you are expecting an English hotel then you'll be disappointed for we are not their primary holidaymakers. English is not their best language. Food is very tasty and plentiful but again if you're expecting bland English food then you'll be unhappy. I thought there was loads of choice.

The food was delicious and varied plenty of Moroccan dishes were served meat and fish dishes along side vegetables and potatoes. The salad bar was wonderful always offering a different selection.  The entertainment team were full of energy and a different selection of entertainment was offered each day. On a Wednesday they have a small traditional market at the hotel and the entertainment for the day is all based on Moroccan culture Dr Aziz gave a demonstration on Moroccan herbal medicine which was fascinating.  The hotel staff could not do enough to ensure everyone had a fantastic time.

Having extensively throughout the world I can honestly say this hotel must rate as the most miserable place ever. My room was shabby with beds so hard and uncomfortable. Towels changed twice in one week. Floor half washed table top never wiped down balcony never cleaned etc. The entire hotel was shabby. Animation team par excellent. Reception staff not in the least bit interested in you. The pool areas ok plenty of sun loungers all the time. Now I come to the food how-to begin. Breakfast was abysmal lunch and dinner ever worse all disgusting food was cold..fruit was either rotten or rock hard. I cannot stress enough the food. If you must book this hotel then do so at your peril. Many other hotels in Marrakech which must be better. The entire week was horrible glad to be home. Oh I forgot to mention the drinks beer watered down spirits tasteless cocktails had a question mark about them could not decide what they contained.

You do have to pay tax but was only ¬£10 each person so not too bad. Like some of these reviews say about the food hall is an absolute lie! There is plenty of places to sit from 2 seaters to 8 seater tables so you wont have an issue there and they keep on top of keeping the food stocked up and enough variety for everyone!    The entertainment team is what makes this hotel a good visit! Smiley rid1 mehdi and all the rest make sure everyones involved in the activities and always make sure you are alright around the pool! Keep up the good work lads    Now to a couple of negatives there was one female staff at the reception that needs to learn to smile and get some manners coz i was going to say something to her on a few occasions but thought not to make a scene    The 'gym' is not a gym and i dont think they should advertise this because i am a gym freak that trains 5/6 times a week i was appalled by this and could of potentially ruined my holiday. It is a 'cardio gym' with 2 running machines 2 bikes and a cross-trainer that doesn't even work! PATHETIC WHERE ARE THE WEIGHTS    For an all inclusive 4 star hotel no icecream? Not good at all coz this is something every hotel i have visited has    The hotel shop has little variety and is over priced.

The only thing that wasn't great was the pool bar the drinks machine kept breaking and the choice was poor. I did feel sorry for the staff working at this bar as it was covered in wasps all the time. We just used the inside bar. Such a great family holiday we would definitely return to this hotel it's value for money. The staff were really helpful when we needed anything. There is a free bus into town but your not guaranteed to get on the return journey I think an increase in buses would help. Over all thank you for such a good family holiday enjoyed by all.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Haworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8493EKwendy
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,evns696 wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Take care,We stayed in hotel Labranda targa for one week on 20th August. On arrival we were too early to check in to our room the lady on reception was rude and hardly spoke we filled in forms and given bands told to leave our bags in lobby and come back in few hours. Not given any information regarding meal times pool times slide times or where to locate any of the amenities in the hotel.    We took the free shuttle into Marrakech you need to book the bus in advance. Take care while in the square as it's very busy and hot. The bus runs all day.    We stayed on the ground floor opposite the outdoor bowls. DO NOT leave any items out in the day to dry as they will get stolen!! Even though the hotel has cctv overlooking the rooms the management staff say that they don't cover the outside of the balcony. which they clearly point at. The rooms are clean and adequate. But even though we asked several times for towels as only 2 were given for 3 guests we were never issued any.    Day 3 of our holiday my 13 year old son became very poorly with sickness temperature and diarrhea. He was unable to eat for the remainder of our 1 week holiday. We informed the manager who sent us to the onsite nurse who informed us that there was nothing she could do or give him as he was under 15. Since returning his symptom continued and we have just had information to say that he contracted campylobacter infection.    On the last day of our holiday my son done his best to sit in the shade around the pool with us as his dad works away from home this was the only time he would spend with him this summer. When we went to pack away that day we realised that his go pro action camera had been stolen from the pool side right under our nose.    Meals times: Get there are soon as the doors open and you will get to eat a decent meal arrive half way through and it is like a zoo all inclusive turns people into animals children are left to fend for themselves fingers and hands in everything and people have no concept of queuing.  The outdoor bar has lots of fly's around the drinks dispenser and the plastic cups are not washed just swilled through.    The best thing about the hotel is the friendly entertainment staff who were happy to help and eager to please without being too pushy. They work hard from morning til night.    The stolen items has made us cautious and is not the hotels fault.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Swansea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evns696
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,fmxo wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Good and bad,Currently here now. Good value for money entertainment is great (so are the entertainment staff so friendly) rooms are nice (very spacious) however paid for a pool view; haven't got that. All inclusive ok - 4 choice of alcoholic cocktails come out of a machine breakfast not great at all. NO ice cream available for the children on all inclusive you need to buy them out the shop. Moroccan locals stay here and are very rude spitting at the children and popping rubber rings and nothing is done. Wifi only works in the lobby. Some bar staff are extremely rude. Other than that can't fault it at all.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmxo

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Paulo Mota wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Perfect family holiday,"Thank you to all the hotel staff for making us feel welcome at all times during our 2 week stay.    Maid servide:  Perfect. Rooms kept cleaned every day and the ladies always wearing a smille.    Bar service:  Wonderful people in both bars who knew by memory what we wanted for drink. Always friendly and polite to us.    Lifeguards:  This guys are the ones setting up the parasols and sorting sunbeds for all guests. They will make sure you feel comfortable at all times.    Restaurant service:  Always something appealing and lots of variety. Lunch time with a bonus of a BBQ going on outside.  Very good variety of choice and the staff works really hard to keep up with the demand. We noted at some points a shortage of staff for the demand.  But the ones on duty were fantastic.    Reception staff:  These are the ones letting the others down. They don't smile they don't make an effort to be professional and kind. Guests are treated with a cold attitude and they struggle to make eye contact.  Because reception is the first point of contact for customers I would suggest the management the review their customer service skills to reassure improvements in the near future.    Maxi Club - Entertainment team  What a team.  This is the best ever entertainment team I have seen for over 15 years visiting hotels in the summer season.  They work really for the customers they are there to keep us entertained and happy. Lots of games throughout the day and night shows are managed and carried out from this wonderful team.  Medhi I hope you are sucessful in your life and achieve your goals.  To the entire team my sincere thanks and wishing you all the very best.    Hotel facilities:  Just perfect with 5 pools free gym 4 slides and wonderful green areas all around the facilities.  Shop is very basic and I think the hotel would benefit of having more variety available for sell including newspapers magazines and many more items related to suit holiday makers.  Very ""empty"" shop but the girls work there were always friendly.    Wednesdays there was a ""market"" just outside the pool area by the bar area. Products sold on the market are traditional from Morocco which was a bonus and good surprise to us.  Free safe in the room big enough to fit a 17' laptop and all valuables.  Quiet overnight giving us a good night sleep.  Security staff around the hotel including the entry/exit gates to ensure safety for all guests.    We will return as we loved every single minute.",Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulomV8767AL

The hotel is terrific with great facilities food and general staff who cannot do enough for you and always with a smile.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Simon-Cathy wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Lovely week in the sun .. don't believe all you read !!!!,We have just returned from a lovely week in Marrekesch. Had we took on board all the negative and brutal reviews we wouldn't have gone !!    The Reception & Room  We arrived around 12 lunchtime and had assumed we wouldn't be allocated our room until 2pm so we had packed swimwear & suncreams so we could enjoy the pool whilst waiting. Pleasant surprise we where given our room there & then sadly it wasn't on the floor we had asked but it wasn't a problem . The lady at reception said if we take the room for now and wait until. Lunchtime the next day we will be able to swop . So we did and the next day as promised we was given a lovely room . The room was spacious & clean 1 double bed and a sofa style bed for our granddaughter. Large wardrobe and a fridge . The air con worked perfectly . The maid came every day changed the towels & bedding. She and her colleagues where always polite and spoke to us . As for the ants we saw a couple but nothing like the reviews had stated !'    The pool    Well there is 5 pools one for adults only  a kiddie pool in the kiddie play area . Then in the main area you have 2 pools and a little paddling pool for children and the water slide area .  The water slides are popular but in all fairness there was never big queues. The lifeguards are very good very alert & assertive I actually witnessed the lifeguard who always had a yellow hat & yellow whistle dive in to assist a child that was in difficulty he was amazing I must say .  The entertainment team totally take ownership of the main pool area most of the day with water aerobics . Zumba . Volley ball and much more . They try there best to get everyone involved with darts cooking lessons  dance and a couple of evenings they do a pool party so lots going on . The main men are Johny  Smiley Yoyo . In fact they are all lovely . There's a couple of the team who run the kids club our granddaughter wasn't fussed about going as she just loved the pools & the water slides. But from what I saw they did a grand job and looking after the children .  The pools are cleaned everyday we never witnessed broken glass or dirt . Plus you are only allowed plastic glasses around the pool . As for the Bees yes they are a nuisance or can be we didn't have a problem if you drink your drink and don't leave it lying around then they won't bother you . In all fairness the guys put bottles with syrup drink around the pool area in order to distract the bees . But then you get idiots who put a glass of cola on the sun bed covered with a towel hence a massive swarm of bees appear . Bottom line use your common sense !!    The restaurant  Yes it can be hectic with tables not been set and food trays empty . yet again a lot of the upset is caused by holiday makers piling there plates up high and not eating half of what they've chose . In all fairness whenever we entered the dining area we always got a table . The food is what it is . You can't expect pie & chips etc . There is something for everyone chips pasta salad bread lots of cakes .    The drink    The drinks are decent a good measure of vodka which tasted fine . Lager was bottled and served in a decent size glass the wine was ok served in a plastic wine glass but yet again a decent size and measure !! They also made great cocktails both alcoholic and non so the children could enjoy them.    The shop  It doesn't sell a lot. Crisps chocolate & ice cream it does close early on a Sunday    They shuttle bus  We used it a few times it stops are carefoure supermarket and also takes you to either the old town or the new medina we did both .. the old town is ok but can be horrendous as the locals won't accept no for an answer plus there are guys with monkeys who try to con you out of money . They plant the monkey on your shoulders or child's shoulders then ask for money for a pic the snake charmer does the same just be mindful . Also use the smallest note possible when buying as they try to con you out of change ..  The new medina is ok it doesn't open till late on a Sunday tho ! There is also a mac Donald's thereüòè. No hassle here you an wander round at your own leisure there are shops like H&M and Zara there nothing wow prices much the same as uk .  There is also a horse and carriage ride not sure how much the guys in the town charge but there is an excursion operator at the hotel they aren't part of the hotel I know they charge 250 durhams per adult & half price for kids .    So basically would I recommend the hotel .. yes absolutely we had a fabulous time the only comment I would make is the food choice for younger children could be better . And stop allowing people to put towels on the sun beds so early in the morning like from 6am !! And half the time a lot of people didn't actually use the beds !!    The staff are all friendly and make you feel very welcome,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simon-Cathy
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Flexistraw wrote a review Aug 2017,30,"Good holiday, don't read the bad reviews",We stayed her for 2 weeks with our 2 year old daughter and friends. We had a lovely holiday.    I was in panic after reading reviews about coming here and the bad reviews were totally unnecessary. I was pleased to see that the management were always trying to improve on any comments made on trip advisor.    Hotel was clean and efficient our room was more than adequate  food was good pool was lovely and the animation team were amazing! Bottled water was everywhere too which was my main concern!    I would say that the animation team especially Ilyass and Ridwane (Red1) went above and beyond their jobs to make guests enjoy their holiday. There was always something going on though you never felt pressured to join in.    It was a reasonably priced holiday which we got good service. We didn't pay 5* prices. It did confuse me to why people expected more when didn't pay top end. Some people are never happy.    The only areas for improvement for me would be to sort the lunch time sitting out as it's too busy.  After the first week we skipped lunch and waited for the pool snacks a bit later. They needed more staff and needed to clean and set new tables quicker. The only member of staff who was grumpy was the older man at the pool bar. üò±  The younger men serving in the inside bar especially Ash was wonderful.  It would have also been nice on arrival to have had received a map of the hotel and the meal times.    We found some of the Nationality's rude. They were unable to queue and could be aggressive but this was not the fault of the hotel!    If you've booked this holiday please do not panic. Our 2 year old had a great time as did we! At the right price we would go back!,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flexistraw
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Rachel L wrote a review Aug 2017,50,I didn't want to leave!,Just got back from a week away at this hotel! It was amazing! arrived at the hotel before check-in time so we got our wrist bands & could use all the facilities before check in & the hotel staff looked after our suitcases! So we decided to go for lunch & I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of different options! & plenty to choose from esp when I am Gluten free..  everything from salad fruit & even an Italian corner plus the traditional foods & it was all lovely! They even had a BBQ going outside!  We booked on two of the tours the hotel run the 'night in marrakech' & the day trip to see the Ouzoud waterfalls & both were fab! & recommend them both!  The hotel was cleaned daily! Toilets rooms & reception areas all the staff were friendly and many spoke in English as well as French German Spanish & of course Arabic  The pool was cleaned everyday & the chlorine levels checked throughout the day also lots of life guards around & slides manned.  Now the entertainment.. I was expecting just children's entertainment as you so when you go to many hotels etc however they not only done a children club (mini club) but they had activities for the adults too.. EVERYDAY!  From morning fitness to aqua fitness/Zumba cooking lessons different language lessons dance lessons as well as football and pool games the children had a mini disco in the evenings & then entertainment too & even had pool parties! It was all round an amazing experience! I would definitely be back & loved it... üíï,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachAnneL
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,OLLY856 wrote a review Aug 2017,40,GET AHEMAD BACK IN THE COSY BAR,Myself and my family a friend and her 17 year old stayed here for 2 weeks from July 25th to 6th of August. There are bad points but more good points with this hotel .    We arrived at 1200 after a small mix up with the room allocation(we asked for 2 connecting rooms and another for our friend and her grandson close by) we were shown to our rooms (our friend had too swap the next day to move closer). The rooms are cleaned exceptionally well each day with clean bedding each day and fresh toiletries .  There is a big main swimming pool were the entertainment is held during the day (also at night twice a week for the pool parties)  A quieter pool a pool with 4 good slides another pool in the children's club play area with 2 slides and a small paddling type pool beside the main pool. All these pools are cleaned everyday . Around the pool and bars there can be a lot of honey bees they hardly ever sting we only saw 3 stings in 2 weeks if you take your drinks back to the bar after you have finished with them they don't stay near you.  The first week the restaurant was very pleasent and no waiting for food but the second week all he'll broke loose and the staff could not cope we witnessed 3 very loud confrontations over food at times it looked like a refugee centre . However we complained to the management and the next day there was a marked improvement. The food was very repetitive but there is always something to eat .  The entertainment staff were very good always engaging people who wanted to be involved .  There are 2 free bars the first week again was great no waiting to be served but the second week was worse especially the pool bar poor Bushka and Zack were always flat out some people said Bushka was never happy but if you actually bothered to speak to him and not just order your drinks you would find he is a lovely bloke. The cosy bar is the other Bar this had the first week the best combination of bar staff with achraf (ash) and ahemad the main men my 2 year old son loved these 2 and they would always smile and play with him when they had the chance . The second week ash was still there but ahemad was moved to the restaurant and replaced the bar was missing a star from then on. PLEASE PLEASE PUT AHEMAD BACK IN THE BAR .

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,LolGrant wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Great Value Break,My break at this hotel was with four friends was fantastic value for money. We stayed 5 nights and had a lovely break. The hotel staff were very helpful and worked extremely hard to make everyone's stay enjoyable. The hotel has something for everyone with pools and entertainment for families plus a 'calm' pool which is adults only and is away from the music and entertainment so you can sunbathe and swim in a quiet area.  The rooms were a good size very clean and had great air-con.  The food was as you would expect from an all inclusive restaurant so a bit repetitive but to be fair the staff were always replenishing the buffet areas. The breakfast outside barbecue and salad bar food were particularly good. There were large fridges full of bottled water available throughout the day included in the price.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,markandcaren wrote a review Aug 2017,30,Good for a cheap holiday but not 4* by far!,We've just returned from 2 weeks at this hotel and overall it was a good holiday for the money we paid.  Lets start with the positives:    The kids enjoyed the pools and slides.  The food was mostly good.  The housekeeping staff did a great job and were very polite.  The entertainment staff were very entertaining.  The grounds were well maintained.  The rooms were well equipped with complimentary shower gel and shampoo.  There was a nurse available.  Free shuttle bus to the old town.    The not so positives:    Hotel decor is tired.  There is only 1 restaurant.  The reception is very unorganised 2 members of staff are rude and instead of dealing with 1 person at a time they will start helping someone else whilst they are dealing with you. They favour French and Moroccan guests over British.  The plastic glasses they provide at the bar for drinks are random sometimes you'll get a nice big one but mostly they're small tumblers or a wine glass.  The restaurant don't have enough cups for hot drinks or glasses for juice so they provide paper cups......not very 4*!  There is never any cold milk for tea during the day only at breakfast.    Just to add the hotel was making improvements when we were there so if they continue with this I'm sure it will be so much better in a few months.    We had an issue when we were out there and despite being promised a fruit basket and a complimentary massage this didn't happen. Such a shame that they didn't carry out their promise.    Overall the hotel is ok and is making improvements but we won't return.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,laff46 wrote a review Aug 2017,30,Let down,We have just returned home from our 2 week family holiday. I never write reviews but feel I need to share our experience of the Labranda. We called two days before arriving and asked if it was possible to have 2 rooms next to each other to our surprise we were given adjoining rooms. when we eventually got in them (as you can't check in until 2:30) we found them very clean and spacious the shower was brilliant. We had ground floor rooms and quickly discovered one of the patio doors didn't lock this was reported to reception on the first day we were told it would be fixed. This was again reported on day 7 as someone had been in our room we were told again it would be fixed....it wasn't. We gave up and learnt not to leave anything out. Housekeeping were always polite however sometime didn't get to us until around 5 which was disappointing. The kids loved the pools and slides however the pool next to the slides was quite often dirty and one of the steps to get out was broken. If you needed a parasol the pool staff were great and quickly got one. If you want to play table tennis I would advise take your own bat and balls as they were all broken. Alcoholic drinks were only beer vodka gin rum and wine which was warm. The first 3 evenings the beer run out as it was bottles not draught. There is no al a carte restaurant as stated and afternoon snacks consist of pre made rolls and cake which the children didn't like. The sports bar isn't included you can go in to watch the big screen but you cannot take your drinks in there! There are plenty of fridges around filled with bottled water. Now to the food hall. It just could not cope with the amount of people there were. Poorly designed and very disappointing. Food was repetitive and nothing for children except chips and pizza which is ok but not for 2 weeks. Pasta always had a sauce on so they couldn't even have it plain. Unfortunately I was very ill the nurse was great and free if you need to see the doctor as I did it costs 400dirham then 20dirham for the prescription. The staff were very hard working and polite. The shuttle bus to the old and new town was reliable.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Watford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laff46
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Clarendon10 wrote a review Aug 2017,10,Marrakech Mistake!!,You can imagine my surprise when we arrived to find a run down hotel with staff who are indifferent towards British tourists ‚Äì ignoring us at reception in favor of others who spoke their language or French. When we got to our rooms we were disappointed to find the luxury rooms shown in your pictures were just that Pictures! They were certainly not a reflection on the shabby rooms we had been given with electrics that did not work air conditioning units that did not work correctly and lights not working in bathrooms ‚Äì we had to use torches to use the bathroom facilities for two days before we managed to make them understand that there was a problem in the room. We had constant issues with door passes not working at least twice a day sometimes more each time meaning we would have to go to reception to get them re loaded to operate the rooms much to the annoyance of the reception staff who seemed to think we were doing this on purpose! They are electronic key passes we have no control over them working or not ‚Äì and not seemed to be the norm! As for getting towels in your room that was a game of roulette very hit and miss ‚Äì they would take your old towels and not replace them and you would then speak to reception to get towels and it would take 4 hours for 1 to appear if you were lucky.    The restaurant was buffet style and on the surface seemed fine when first entering but as we soon found out the hot food was kept in unheated containers that soon allowed the food to go cold a perfect breeding environment for bacteria as we found out to our detriment as my daughter and I both suffered vomiting and diarrhea only two days into the holiday ‚Äì along with several other guests at the hotel. This was an all-inclusive hotel eat as much as you like ‚Äì the food was inedible and what little we ate made us ill so our whole group ended up surviving on bread rolls and melon we couldn‚Äôt eat the salad as it was after eating this that I became very ill it would seem it is washed in their local water. I have been that ill that even now I am still suffering severe stomach cramps and diarrhea and still not being able to eat and have found my weight has dropped by 8lbs in the week we spent at this atrocious hotel. (On an all-inclusive holiday I would expect to gain weight not loose it)    The swimming pools at this hotel leave a lot to be desired they are old with the rubber linings creased and in particular the one pool that had steps built in they seemed to have been painted blue but it kept coming of and sticking to our skin and clothes actually ruining 4 swimsuits as they now have blue paint embedded in the material. These pools often had debris floating in them that was not pleasant. The metal steps in the other pools are lethal with loose rails - only one step on one set and because they are metal you burn your hands when trying to get out of the pools. The pool safety was horrendous there were no life guards or spotters in attendance so there was no management of children using the slides into the pool I witnessed on several occasions people struck by others who came down the slides before they were clear from the bottom in fact at one point I nearly had to rescue a child who had been struck and ducked and was struggling (luckily her sister jumped in and rescued her before me).  The signs at the pool side state inflatables strictly forbidden and yet every child and adolescent and indeed some adults had inflatables of one sort or another in fact they were sold in the shop on the site. The signs also state no diving ‚Äì even the animation team ignored this as they encouraged young people to dive over a high jump bar straight into the pool getting the bar higher at each turn. On our first night there was a pool party with no lifeguards or supervision taking place the animation team were having a great time with the guests ‚Äì unfortunately a little boy got pushed into the pool and could not swim and was drowning he was very lucky to be saved by a fully clothed onlooker who spotted him floating and dived in and got him out and managed to revive him quickly.    There is also supposed to be an alternative Moroccan themed restaurant at this hotel ‚Äì it was locked up and closed for the duration of our stay. The bars ‚Äì All-inclusive they may have been but they only served White rum Gin Vodka local wine and local beer ‚Äì if you attempted to have a simple vodka and coke ‚Äì despite asking for small amount of alcohol it would be undrinkable and taste like nail varnish remover.    The outside bar hygiene was nonexistent I witnessed on several occasions the bar man picking up a dirty glass give it a quick rinse under the tap water and then serve a new drink to unsuspecting holiday makers ‚Äì it is no wonder so many of guest succumbed to illness.  The tables around the pool and the bar were dirty ‚Äì wiped over with a splash of water and a dirty cloth.    The Spa ‚Äì what can I say ‚Äì never in my life have I been ripped of so much for spa treatments. My daughter booked a body wrap and I booked a pedicure. Her wrap consisted of being smothered in a cream ‚Äì no wrapping? Left in it for 15 minutes then showered of.  My pedicure ‚Äì I was led down a very dark corridor to a dark gloomy room and sat on a chair ‚Äì the therapist then produced a foot bath (the same sort you buy from boots and use at home!) she put hot water in this and then stuck my feet in it with no regard for the temperature of the water ‚Äì it was a tad too hot! She then proceeded to file my toenails and clean them ‚Äì she was very rough and actually made my toe bleed at one point and obviously did not understand the word Ouch! She then used some sort of rasp on the soles of my feet to remove rough/dead skin and then painted my nails. When I had left I looked at my feet and was gob smacked to find that I still had blue paint all over the bottom of them (from the pool as mentioned earlier) so I had just wasted 450 dirham on a very poor pedicure and a not wrap for my daughter.    As for the entertainment ‚Äì we could not understand any of it as they did not cater for English ‚Äì you might get 2 words of English and 30minutes of French / Morrocan dialogue at a show that was the most amateur debacle I have ever seen. Thank god we had a pack of cards for when we wasn‚Äôt in the toilette.    As for the lush gardens the lawns were boggy swamps from continuous over watering using sprinklers that also stopped you from sunbathing anywhere within a 50ft radius as you would get watered as well.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clarendon10

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Osob B wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Great Holiday,My cousin and I with our two kids aged 4yrs and 7yrs visited the Labranda Hotel on the 3rd of August for 10 days. The start of our holiday started off pretty bad as we were not told we could not check in until 2pm and we arrived at 11.30am. The English rep welcomed us told us we could have lunch and the room would be ready by the time we finish. Much to our surprise with two kids who have been up since 3am had to wait until 3.30pm in the lobby of the Hotel with no room. When I finally demanded a room the Receptions who if I may add did not speak good English gave me a room after paying the taxes and I had to get the bell boy myself to help with the luggage since the Reception was no longer interested in helping us. When we arrived to our room there were 4 cleaners rushing around to clean the room. So we sat at the terrace until it was done. It took them 30 mins but the ladies were very apologetic for something that was most properly not there fault. After that the rest of our stay was very enjoyable. The domestic staff where very friendly always cleaned the room to a great standards and very warm with their greetings and smiles. Rooms are space and we had a great room next to the pool with a terrace. But there is no internet service in the rooms at all which made it difficult to keep the kids in the room to rest up before the evening entertainment.  Food......now what can I say. The food hall was like a jungle mostly to the fault of the ill mannered guest and their children. There is plenty of choices of food but people would take so much and there was a lot of waste. The restaurant offered a wide range of food however it didn‚Äôt taste great and made my stomach pretty bad so for the last 5 days of my Holiday I ate breakfast and fruit with bread. I am not sure if it due poor storage or preparation of the food but many guest and staff were ill due to the food. I would suggest anyone traveling to there take plenty of Imodium. Also the Hotel could do with more of an Italian choice rather then pizza and pasta seems that is the popular corner of the food hall.  Pool.....plenty of pools and space and a lot of water activities for all ages. My daughter and niece spent the whole day in the pool until the Entertainment Team took a break at 5.30pm. Great fun for young children to adults however there could incorporate more group games with the Entertainment Team. The pools however were not cleaned the time we were their and the chlorine was very high. Some guest and myself had a skin reaction to the chlorine and sun bring my skin up in a rash which was very itchy and uncomfortable.  Kids Disco and Evening entertainment....Great fun for the kids. My daughter and niece would come very night for the Disco and watch the show afterwards. The Entertaiment Team for the kids MoMo Sumaya Yoyo and Racha are amazing. They are always full of smiles and the kids loved them. They could also supervise the kids around the theatre area and pool even though it not their responsibility. Sumaya and MoMo run a great kids club which the kids seem to enjoy. They have such a warm kind and generous nature which make you as a parent at ease to leave your kids with them. One very small suggestion would be to incorporate English songs into their number as our kids were lost most of the time since the songs are in French and the moves were what they copied however didn‚Äôt understand what they were doing.  The Entertaiment team.....I saved the best for last this group people are amazing! They are full of energy and enthusiasm which makes the holiday worth while. From the morning until evening they always their to help you entertain you and make your smile. From Yonus their Dj and manager who is also the commentators for most activities giving his 50 pennies in how Well or BAD your doing to getting everyone involved in his Sun Dance. Racha and her warm welcoming smile great skill in Arabic dancing to Latin moves. Faycel and Smily doing water gym are always up for a laugh. Faycel the biggest prankster and Smily and is exceptionally BIG smile. I save my favourite two for last Radwan and Johnny who have awesome dance moves and can dance to any kind of music never tired always on hand to help with whatever you need from a tablet to help with your tummy to giving you an adaptor to charge your phone. These two exceptional men would be there at the pool food hall and even the seated area to see if all the guest were happy and always inform you of all the activities of the day. Johnny and Radwan were loved by our kids and many other kids in the resort and with out them and the whole team the Hotel would not be the same. The Entertaiment Team is the highlight of the Hotel and a great asset to the resort. I can not wait to come back with my daughter and would recommend this Hotel to my friends and family. I am looking forward to my next holiday to Marrakech and hope we will see the same AMAZING MAXI CLUB GROUP when we return.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/osobb
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,AGIrie wrote a review Aug 2017,30,Worthwhile trip,We have just returned home and whilst i do not usually write a review based on previous reviews i felt i should.  Positives- beautiful hot weather lovely hotel grounds we had a ground floor terrace with olive trees which was nice. Hotel room was clean and to a decent standard. The water slides were what made the holiday for my 2 children aged 11 and 5 us adults also enjoyed them! The breakfast was the best meal of the day- the omlette man very polite and smiley he also worked the lunch bbq where the grilled meat was tasty . There is a good selection of salad and meat/fish dishes although my children are fussy so stuck with chips but liked the bbq.  Drinks were all fine there is nomore water dispenser as mentioned in previous reviews so the hotel clearly have taken on board feedback and now provide bottles of water. Daily aqua aerobics was fun!  Negatives- As with other reviews we found some of the staff very rude i.e the lady serving pancakes in the morning with a straight face she recieved many complaints and glad that by our 5th day was no longer serving front line! I am well well travelled and found the people in neighbouring Tunisia for instance to have a far better level of customer care. Having said that the bar guy: Hitcham customer service was brilliant. He should certainly be staff member of the month :).  Our safe and room key card needed reprogramming on a few too many occasions although this was resolved quickly it became annoying. It would be great if Wifi was extended throughout the hotel. The waterslide pool has no grill where the sunction is (between slides) My husband had to rescue a little girl from almost becoming seriously injured! Please place a grill over the suction to avoid potential serious harm.  Overall- worthwhile if you are looking for a relaxing holiday in a secluded location. We did the trip: Marrakech by night horse and cart which was a nice evening out.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AGIrie

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,alisonbarraclough2 wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Alison,Was a little worried by some of the reviews however I need not have worried. We all had a great time. Great entertainment staff friendly and always had a smile for everyone. Room was big modern and cleaned well everyday. The food was good with plenty of choice for everyone. Only one thing spoiled our holiday and that was 'some' children and teenagers left to their own devices by their parents in the restaurant and by the pool. The entertainment staff and hotel staff did their best to keep an eye on the wild mob; not their job but they kept smiling. Maybe some parents should leave their kids at home if they're not prepared to look after them themselves; or stay at home themselves.  Good holiday good hotel wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to anyone. üëçüëç,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonbarraclough2

We exchanged rooms ourselves but a double bed for three was not comftable I complained twice about this and it wasn't until the third complaint and third day a fold up bed was put in  The entertainment staff were amazing but there was not enough staff to cater for all guests in restaurant as we had to make tables up ourself  My daughter also got Stuck in a lift for 40 minutes and was not shown any remorse over it she was scared and crying and was only told it was a electrical problem.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emmabah

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,xzoecx wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Great family vacation,A totally family only type resort.    If you and or your family love a bit of group activity and to be entertained with daytime pool activities like water Zumba aerobics volleyball etc with the added time filler of a range of slides then by night a varied yet seemingly odd however very enthusiastic evening entertainment together with the typical buffet style regimented mealtimes then this is the place for you!    The animation team were a bundle of enthusiasm and positivity from morning activities right through to their night time shows!    The slides were great for all ages having seen toddlers on laps with water aids to those normally grumpy teenagers right up to us young at heart parents all loving the thrill of the variety of slides what's also a bonus is that they are not too far from any sun beds you'd managed to station yourself at so can keep an eye on the kids which is handy given there is rarely a lifeguard to oversee the running or safety so you have rely on kids being sensible about leaving gaps before going and getting out of the way etc as I witnessed a few incidents.    The food was what would be expected from any 3/4 star resort. Same pastries etc that tasted very similar and many desserts just changed colour each day.  Lots of variety of food though and of course the 'chips with everything' was adhered to.    My friend absolutely loved it and piled her plate full each mealtime. I'm a really fussy eater but I used the secretly placed Italian corner to get bowls of pasta or pizza with my son which were cooked in front of you (hygiene not priority and could do with more chefs as they were in demand) If you're strict Veggie or Vegan is best to go early or avoid as there was contamination from meat in all dishes as hands are used for everything and not washed.    The family room was great and cleaned daily. Enough space for 4 of us. The bathroom and shower were of high standard and room in general was better than expected.  The kitchenette was pretty useless though as there was no cups/plates etc in the cupboards and the fridge freezer just kept water cold not ice creams etc.    The kids club looked good nice little pool area and trampoline with swings and indoor area. No permanent staff by the pool that I saw so would maybe worry about that but great facility nevertheless.    All in all it was a stress free holiday for a family where the weather is predictable.    Biggest let down of the hotel was the wifi which was only really available in the lobby and was temperamental during our stay.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xzoecx
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Awesta R wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Great atmosphere and service,We have visited Labranda Targa Club in the first week of August 2017. We were with a group of 12 (7 adults and 5 kids). On the evening of arrival we called ahead to let them know that we would arrive later than expected because of delays with our flight. The restaurant would have been closed by the time of our arrival (22:30). What a great surprise it was when we saw that they had opened the kitchen especially for us with freshly baked pizza's and fresh salads and drinks awaiting us. This is the high standard of service we enjoyed the entire week. We were advised an amazing restaurant at Place Jemaa el Fna the kids were entertained perfectly when one of the kids fell ill a doctor was called the same day to diagnose her etc. etc. Also the entertainment team was amazing at doing their job for people of all ages. We are certainly thinking of visiting a Labranda club again next year.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nijmegen, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westjeg
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,richardamarsh wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Fantastic family hotel,After reading previous reviews I was concerned about this hotel. Once I arrived it was a totally different story. What a lovely place to stay clean as a whistle and everything as it should be. The staff were extremely attentive great service from the barmen who remembered what I drank straight from the off which is a feat with the amount of guests.  The ladies that looked after the room did a perfect job coming back later on if you slept in. The restaurant staff were again great the breakfast omelette man knew my order too!! There was a massive choice of Moroccan and European dishes however this is not a Butlins so no Mcdonalds type stuff (thanks heavens)  As there were not too many English people staying(or Germans) the poolside beds were not all reserved by 6 am which was a welcome change.  There was mention of wasps but they are actually a few honeybees and no-one was stung at all.  To finish on a high the entertainment team were second to none and need to be named..Faysaal full of energy Racha always smiling Simon can dance a bit!  Ilysh full of get up and go Rid1 ball of energy they are all a credit to Younis and the management.They work really hard over massive hours and are always smiling thank you to them all!!!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,familyof3353 wrote a review Aug 2017,30,OK !,When we arrived we were all really excited. We were made to feel very welcome. When waking up the next morning we were really happy with the surroundings and said we had made a good choice. The good bits: Great pools and slides rooms lovely and kept very clean each day with fresh towels when ever they were needed.The food was full of flavour and always a decent choice Entertainment outside in the evening with the resident musicians was a lot of fun and we met lots of new people. The animation team made you feel very welcome ( especially Mr Magic).  After a few days in we felt that the bar staff were not very sociable. We tried tipping smiling and always said thank you in Arabic and French but I think they made it quite clear that we were a hindrance to their day We were tempted to video the bar staff to show others how rude they could be ( the younger bar staff were more pleasant but the older ones were terrible - they should know better regarding customer service) but felt that may be a step too far. We appreciated that it was Ramadan but a smile now and then would go a long way one of them in particular did not even make eye contacts and slammed the drinks down on the bar in disgust that you may even want a drink while you were on holiday enjoying yourself!!!! The beer was warm most of the time and severed into glasses out of bottles (no draft) this was very disappointing. It is a shame but I would have to say that if it were not for the bar staff and warm beer I would return. Just to note nothing in the surrounding areas to do although a free bus to Marrakech is work taking.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Staffordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familyof3353
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Ceri D wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Truthful review,Was very anxious after reading all the reviews but we have just returned and loved most of it.  Marrakech is beautiful the people are so nice to Kids especially.  Please remember before you go this isn't Ibiza it's Morocco with a totally different way of life from us. You need to go there appreciating this understanding that a little effort to speak some French and realising this is NOT a big alcoholic country will get you a long way. Staff can be stand-offish at first but try to make an effort with them and they are all very helpful. Hammering the alcohol all day is not top priority!!  Staff didn't stop working all the time we were there cutting the grass shaping the trees mending around the pool tiles the room maids were so pleasant I don't speak much French but managed to make small talk. The pool boys couldn't do enough to help finding loungers and parasols for you.  Yes wasps still a bit of a problem but guess what if you drink your drink and get up to take your cups back to the bar instead of waiting for the staff to do it for you then it's not an issue. I know it's a holiday but some people are so lazy. The staff were literally running round all the time.  As for meal times yes it can be chaotic but again the staff were always fetching more food clearing away and relaying tables if people didn't pile their plates full like they had never seen food before maybe it wouldn't go so quickly. I couldn't believe table after table of abandoned food through pure greed and such a mess I'm damn sure people don't eat like that in their own homes. What the staff must think I don't know I was embarrassed! Food was beautiful my kids got fed up of Pizza and chips but that's just because they are so fussy. Everything labelled or you can use your eyes to see what it is!! Queue for Pizza so maybe two members of staff would help here.  Girl in the shop needs to get down off her golden perch but the animation team are fab really wake everyone up and are on the go all day.  Some downsides we had ants in our room on first night but we made sure nothing in the bin to attract them and they went a bikini got stolen from our patio and an inflatable was stolen from the pool.  In my opinion it's the people staying here that are the problem if there are any not the hotel or the staff.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wales, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/728cerid

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,ENGLISH70 wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Expectations met.,I Stayed here with my Children w/c 15th July and there was much to enjoy with the hotel as well as some big opportunities. We arrived relatively early on a Saturday and were checked in within an hour. There were no towels in the room and no sheets for one of the beds. This was soon rectified.  The hotel itself is a little dated but the slides and pools are nice although you have to get up around 8am to get a poolside sunbed.  The food is ok and we found it to be a wide selection from burgers whole roasts steamed fish stews mountains of salads and sides. There were some items that run out but that is more to the fact that some people in line would take whole plates of the food and left others without.    The evenings were a bit boring and i was very surprised that everything is closed at 11pm. Not much of an animation team only one evening show and it was inside.    The hotel is quite far from Marrakesh so dont expect to be able to walk to town. That said there are taxi's and a shuttle that goes there.    The staff on reception have very little personality.  Overall the hotel feels safe and does what is says it does for a very good price.

Firstly we had to wait over 1 hour to be checked in even then our room was not ready. The staff and management's service suck like a dyson!!! No towels in bathroom our room was crawling with ants which they did nothing about. The safety box was not working and the phone line wire was cut so we had to go down to reception to complain. Housekeeping look at you funny and all you get is a blank stare when we asked for towels. When we asked to speak to the manager we kept getting sent to the meeting point room and got told to wait there. Guess what no manager arrived as he/she was busy. On the day of check out we kept getting pushed to the back of the queue basically we were being ignored. Maybe it's because I am British. If I were you I would go and stay somewhere else and enjoy morocco as this hotel and staff will definitely ruin your holiday!!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/636sabiham

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sajni S wrote a review Jul 2017,30,Not amazing but not terrible!,im giving this a 3 out of 5 rating is because of a few things that annoyed me personally. For some people it may not be as big of a deal but the housekeeping service was TERRIBLE. It started off on day 1 when we were told our room was ready and taken upstairs and then turned out it wasn't actually ready. They told us to go and have lunch and come back in an hour and it will be ready. So we did and the room looked clean when we arrived back but then soon discovered they'd left the previous people under clothes and socks (which were in a bag) underneath the sofa. Which made us think they don't clean the room properly. I then asked for a spare towel which they said they would bring up but didn't until the next day where I had to ask again twice. We also noticed they didn't change the pillow cases but just turned them over. Housekeeping in general was terrible timing usually. We came back from a swim around 4.30pm to shower and expected our room to have been cleaned in the mean time but it still hadn't been! So we were told to wait downstairs again while they cleaned as we needed fresh towels to shower with.    Another thing was the food. While the food was presented and tasted lovely there was no signs as to what was what and a lot of the waiters did not speak English. So for someone with certain allergies etc it was really difficult like my boyfriend who has a shellfish allergy and realised there were tiny prawns which couldn't be seen in salads and also on what seemed like a vegetarian pizza.    Also by the pool bar the wasps were out of control. I had read about these in previous reviews but had no idea the extent of them. It was awful! They covered the drink machines completely and as soon as you got a drink in your hand they started coming into the glasses. It wasn't much of a problem for us to be honest as we preferred being in the adult pool which was a bit quieter but annoying for others. They didnt actually attack you or anything but just flying around you is pretty annoying    At the start when we arrived we weren't really informed about timings about anything such as breakfast dinner etc but that isn't a massive deal as you can just ask about.    We did two of the excursions the Atlas mountain waterfall one and Marrakech by night on the horse carriage. The mountain trip was good. Be warned though it is a long way away and you are not told that from the start. We didn't ask but we assumed it would only be about an hour or two travelling but it was actually about 3 hours there and 3 hours back! It worked out well in the end as we felt like we had enough time in the mountains during the heat but if you're not a fan of long coach journeys it may not be for you. We also did Marrakech by night on a horse carriage which was nice. The old town is pretty dusty though so if you suffer from allergies take an antihistamine beforehand!    All in all I can't really complain otherwise because it isnt a 5 star hotel and I cant expect 5 star service especially for the price that we paid because we got a good deal. I read some bits where reception staff were rude but we didnt experience that. They were extremely helpful especially as our travel adaptors werent working and they offered to go out and get us some from the town which wasnt near by! It helps to know French if you can as they cant speak too much English but you can get by.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SajniS1
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,gregg y wrote a review Jul 2017,30,Decent but let down by the basics,I have scored this as a 3 . Average . This is exactly what this hotel is . We were a family of 5 on a AI deal for 2 weeks .  Rooms and facilities are as you would expect . Pools are good and plenty of sun beds to go round .    What does let the hotel down is the basics .  1. Restaurant totally understaffed . Staff never had enough bowls or cutlery ready for meal times . We had to wait and ask for spoons at breakfast several times . They also do not monitor what is running out . Milk at breakfast was also empty . As we had kids we went for dinner at 7pm when opening to avoid big ques . At 7pm no staff at pizza and pasta section. Then staff did come it was one person who was overran by the demand for this area . Also at the opening of dinner service the soft drinks machines were not turned on . Basics like this should be checked for opening! Often the soft drinks would run out in the middle of a meal time and not be replaced . Limited salt and pepper shakers at various table . Did not appear to be any rhyme or reason to this .  Lunch was also overrun as it was a 2 hour window for the whole hotel . We would try to go later to avoid the rush . This meant u were unable to get a clean table as staff would not clear them or re set with cutlery . On one day the members of animation team tried to take our forks from table . General lack of customer service awareness is lacking in the restaurant .    When I discussed this with manger we informed me dinner didn't start till 1930 . He didn't even know when dinner starts in his own hotel ! Also discussed the other issues I had with him and short term fixes were put in . The pizza and pasta station got 2 cooks for 1 night then it reverted back .    2. Entertainment    Animation team do a good job around pool and are friendly most of the time . The night time entertainment is what it is but why they have it out next to pool with music blaring till 11pm is beyond me . They have a function room where they can host this but choose to blast this forestry into the rooms around pool . Not ideal if you have kids .    3. Towels  We were a family of 5 and they gave us 2 large towels for the room ???  I had to ask 3 times to have this sorted at reception .    In general the hotel could be so much better if it paid attention to the basics .,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/924greggy
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,powyswales wrote a review Jul 2017,20,Do not go,"Check In    We booked this as a family holiday at a ""special offer"" advertised as 4 star. Hence this review is based on expectations for 4 star and price paid.    First off the Hotel Staff and most visitors speak French with the majority making little effort to speak English however you can engage them more by attempting some French.    At time of booking agent did not make us aware that family rooms were an option hence we booked 2 twins for 3 adults and 2 children we were advised that an extra bed would be put in one of the rooms. After reading about family rooms following booking we sent several emails to Hotel asking if we could pay to change one room not one email received a response!    Check In was poor it took 10 minutes to find out booking. I asked if there was an opportunity to pay to change one of our rooms from a triple to a family and was told they were all booked.    No information was given re: restaurants facilities entertainment etc..    Upon being shown to rooms we were confronted with 1 double 1 twin and no extra bed. Upon asking we were told that the rock hard bench with cushions would be made into a bed by housekeeping.    Despite requesting several times they never made the bed up or provided linen hence my 12 year old had to sleep on a cushion with only the throws off single beds to cover him see attached photo's. We later discovered that another family had the same experience.    The rooms were basic with a decent size bathroom however there were only 2 sets of towels in each room the rooms had clearly not been made up for 5 people.    There are no kettles in rooms or irons there are hairdryer fitted in bathrooms. Rooms had safes and A/C.    We had booked AI however I was expecting them to request my credit card for any extras when they didn't I was told they didn't have a card machine. I must admit that by this stage I was regretting booking this resort.  The rooms are not 4 star standard I would rate them 3 star    On a positive the rooms were ready even though it was only midday.    Restaurants and Bars    There is only 1 buffet restaurant there is a pool bar however this is for drinks only.    All meals have to be taken in restaurant and afternoon cakes were available daily in the bar.    Biggest issue with restaurant is that no food is labelled making it impossible to know what you are selecting / eating.    There is the usual hot food salads and pasta / pizza corner. At lunch time there was an additional BBQ with one choice of meat.    The pizza and pasta area was always extremely busy and the queues were very long. There were 4 pizza ovens but only 2 were ever switched on.    Drinks were mainly self service and it took several requests to locate any alcoholic drinks. Only wine is available in the restaurant. Only on two nights were we served any wine every other time we had to help ourselves. The restaurant is extremely understaffed.    The quality of food was just OK quality of wine was terrible and I was told nothing else was available. On last night I discovered that I could have paid for better quality in a different bar. In summary I had an almost wine free holiday and the resort lost the extra revenue by not giving any information upon check In or in rooms.    Child soft drinks were supplied in the smallest plastic cup I have ever seen barely bigger than a tot glass. Coffee was also served in the same tiny plastic cup. I totally understand the need not to have glass in pool areas however I do expect plastic glasses of a decent size and quality ditto with coffee cup.    Cocktails all came out of a machine with a choice I believe of 4.    I don't think the staff at the pool bar knew how to smile however staff in Cosy Bar always greeted you with a smile and were happy to enter into conversation    Entertainment    The resort does have an entertainment team who appeared to be busy all day by the main pool. No itinerary is provided for activities throughout the day and the announcements are predominantly done in French.    There was a show every evening however we never went so can't comment on it    There is a singer in Cosy Bar every evening however it was always the same singer with the same playlist. We only stayed 4 nights and was already fed up with it by day 2    Pools and Slides    There is a main pool with baby pool next to it.    There are 4 slides going into a pool a second pool next to it and a toddler pool with slide    On 3rd day I discovered a large adult only pool with plenty of sun beds. There were only 2 people there probably more to do with no one knowing about its as opposed to it being adult only!    General    The resort does have a wasp problem they are everywhere however I didn't see anyone get stung.    Wifi is available in lobby only    Small beach towels are available however we had to give a ¬£10 per towel deposit    Shop is horrendously overpriced Magnum ice cream ¬£5!    No ice cream or crisps for children included in AI    You have to wear bands on your wrists even though everyone was AI    Cleanliness is average room cleaning was poor shower area was not cleaned during our stay    Summary    This is a 3 not 4 star resort however not making up beds not labelling food not providing information etc. is unacceptable for any resort regardless of star rating    We would not return and would not recommend",Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Montgomery, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powyswales
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Stuart074 wrote a review Jul 2017,20,Spoilt by the reception sraff,We had been on a family holiday travelling round so we did not come straight here. Our experience of Moroccans was that they were extremely helpful and pleasant    Unfortunately the check in and reception staff were not. The lady checking us in ignored us for a long time and then when she did get off her mobile phone she managed to make the check in process both unhelpful and rude. This response continued from them during our stay. At times they were Rude and at others deliberately misleading.    It is a shame as the rest of the staff and the entertainment team in particular were great.    The pools are good. Kids enjoyed the slides. The food was good but having travelled round witnessing some poverty and people careful and respectful it was incongruous to see people piling their plates full at each meal only to leave most of it.    That is however the model.    Overall an enjoyable stay but so much more to see and discover in morocco.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bodiam, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stuart074
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Sheila K wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Something for everyone,After reading a few negative reviews we were a little sceptical but can honestly say we cannot understand what people were complaining about. The hotel was spotless and staff were cleaning constantly. The food was fabulous there were 5 of us including a couple of fussy eaters but can honestly say there was always plenty to choose from for everyone's taste. Bottles of water were available constantly which was very welcome considering the immense heat! There are 2 pool areas - the main area which is fabulous for youngsters or those really wanting to get involved with music and entertainment all day. There was also another pool at the side of the hotel the Calm Pool which really was just a pool with sunbeds and toilets - perfect if you want to relax in peace and quiet and it's adults only. The hotel is a bit off the beaten track and there is nothing to do or see in the immediate vicinity but a 20 minute taxi ride takes you into Marrakech town where there is plenty to see and do. Recommend going to the souk in the morning when it is considerably less busy; take a horse and carriage ride around Marrakech - we did this at night and it was a fabulous experience and lasted about 45 minutes. We also went on a quad bike experience booked via GetYourGuide which was brilliant. You must also experience a traditional Hammam whilst there - one of the best massages etc. I have ever had (although not for the faint hearted!).    We booked our airport transfers via GetYourGuide too before we left home they were absolutely brilliant. Our driver was waiting for us when we arrived at the airport and again at the hotel when we were ready to go back to the airport. Very friendly drivers and very cheap - only cost us ¬£18 for a 6 seater each way.    Will definitely be back to Marrakech and would not hesitate to stay at Labranda Targa Club again.    Our only slight negative would be that it would be nice for there to be an adult only area in the restaurant.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sunbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188sheilak

Before arriving i was dreading the reviews and wasps and food! However we arrived and were so pleasently surprised! My children aged 7 8 and 4 months were greeted with smiles. The staff were fantastic with us all including my little one. We were given a cot straight away and put into a room on the ground floor next to the adult pool which was perfect and quiet for our smallest and having a pram! The hotel was kept lovely and clean and the rooms were of a nice size. The entertainment staff were amazing with the kids and ourselfs! The reception staff were also fab and so were the cleaning staff! Its much cheaper to book a cab at the reception to go anywhere so dont go through the rep who is crap to be honest! Once u find a good cab driver stick with him we used ours the whole holiday! He was great! We experienced the market in the day and took a taxi with our 3 children we didnt need a guide and felt completely safe so do not panic! I also walked around the market with a pram!!! We did book a camel ride and quad experience at the hotel and to be fair they were really good and my two eldest children loved it! Pools were clean they had a pool party our last night kids loved it! Again staff were brilliant! Food was lovely too however u do have no idea what your eating but hey enjoy it! My kids loved the italian corner of pastas and pizzas! The bar staff were also friendly! All the staff work so hard here i think some of these reviews are so unfair! I would definantly come back to this hotel not this time of year with a baby though as it hit highs of 45 degrees and his pale skin couldnt take it again though i loved it:) the bees are annoying but they do leave u alone they just want your fizzy drinks no different from being in a park in british summer! We ate out also and the food was fab and cheap. I am an experienced traveler ranging from spain to the carribean its a lovely place and my family and i loved our stay was sad to leave!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Richard S wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Bad reviews are nonsense!,What more do you want people  Hot weatherall inclusive bar and water slides for the kids.  After being on a mission through the airports 347 passport and luggage checks we finally got shown to our hotel by friendly transfer.  We arrived at the hotel and greeted by a member of staff with a gold Trolly to take our luggage to the room we had to fill out some more details on a slip about why we where annoying British people but everything seemed ok.  We where then shown to the room and shown how the air con/tv and finally how the wife worked.... didn't take long... however my son was greeted by a member of the entertainment team (simo) who worked hard all of our holiday and made us welcome before we made it to our room!  We also want to mention rid1 that also works for the entertainment team full of energy and always want to look after you.  5 stars are a must on trip adviser but a TripAdvisor bingo game must begin!!!    Please find:    Bar man on pool bar that won't smile as he claims to have no teeth...    Bees that are flying around in large numbers but never ever sting you (and yes they are bees and not wasps like some people claim to be a profession with) wasps sting you for owning a caravan! We never got stung  So leave them alone    And finally    Find the people that take a large amount of all inclusive food but will never find a country the size of Canada to eat the colossal amount that as been clearly taken because they didn't wake up for breakfast.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Faaz P wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Excellent for families,Booked up for a short family getaway!    Should have spent longer.. great place for the family and kids..    Abundance selection of food at all times of the day 3 pools plus 2 mini ones for babies. Plenty of Sun Lounges.. the poolside entertainment 5 Star.. great personalities music in the background to keep the tempo in the holiday mood.. weather was perfect.    One thing I have to add is that the reception lack motivation it was hard work trying to get anything done or if you needed something .. communication was hard if you are English speaking as they mostly communicate in French!    Housekeeping was dismal.. it was the most negative that spoilt our time there.. to get towels or an extra one as we had a child in our room was A MISSION!! Horrendous.. it seemed a common problem as I saw other families having confrontations with the reception desk on the same issue.    Air con wasn't as powerful as expected for a country that encounters 40 degrees plus. It may have been our room or just unluckily with the housekeeping service.    One thing I have to add is that the restaurant could have been better displayed in the fact labelling the particular dishes.. there was nothing.. we had to guess by the look or the smell what was on the menu.. it's vital that this is corrected so that guests know what dishes are on display.    Overall we throughly enjoyed our stay there and not let the negatives Marr the lovely time we had there.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Leanne J wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Just returned,Just returned from a week in this hotel.    When I booked in January the reviews were great and I was looking forward to it but as we got closer the worse the reviews got... however I cannot understand the negative comments!    The hotel and grounds are beautiful well maintained and very clean. The pool and slides are lovely and the staff work exceptionally hard.    The room we had was 1112 it was large with 2 single beds and a large bathroom. Every day it was cleaned and a bottle of water left in the fridge even if we hadn't drunk the one from the day before.    With regards to the food... I think people need to remember it's Morocco not the UK or Spain. The food was lovely providing you're willing to try different things. The chicken and beef were always lovely and the gravy was the best I've ever tasted.    The animation team were brilliant and tried to do something to suit as many people as possible; which is difficult when you have so many different ages and nationalities.    Just as a heads up to anyone who is going - there are a lot of wasps BUT don't leave drinks lying around and they won't come near... didn't hear of anyone being stung while we were there!

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,alibella28 wrote a review Jul 2017,40,brilliant bargain sunshine holiday,If you have booked to stay here and are now reading some of the negative review's & panicking please dont.  After reading some of the reviews we decided to go with an open mind. .. heres what we got..  Lovely welcome & fuss free check in and taken straight to our room early in the morning.  ROOM ours was on the ground floor in the garden area near the adults only pool. Lovely & private & quiet. We had a patio area with table & chairs. Huge walk in shower which was fantastic modern furnishing with flst screen tv. The patio doors had blackout blinds to keep the room cool. Air con worked a treat & cleaners kept our room clean everyday. Hairdryer in bathroom was good enough to even blow dry my frizzy mop !  POOL AREA again it was spotless the loungers were clean and hosed down every night. Just pit your mind at rest about glasses be broken.... halfway through they stopped using glass and changed to large quality plastic ones which were better bigger & safer.  There is also a quiet adult pool but you had to walk to main pool for drinks.. i think this is a slight down fall.  FOOD. wow just cant believe all the bloody moaning. We found the good fantastic.  Beautiful fresh salad bar  fruit & the veg was exquisite & in season. Lots of breads to chose from meats  fish. Yes the que for the pizza was at times long bit here's a tip.... dont be a greedy barstool by taking it all leave some for others !! You can always go back for more! Honestly the amount of waste from some holiday makers was disgusting.  We saw some empty whole trays of chips taking whole pizzas & piling their plates so high they would spill half on the floor!  DRINKS yes you did have to que at the pool bar but honestly it didnt take to long. Cocktails were nice  beer great & their fruit rum was fab. Fruit soft drinks were a bit sickly but fizzy ones ok which even included Pepsi max. Bottles of water available at both bars  dining halls and left in room refrigerator. If you make the effort to smile  be friendly to bar staff & a little conversation goes a long way.    So all on all we had a fantastic 2 wk stay in hot hot sunshine. The biggest negative for us were some miserable moaning rude holiday makers who at times spoke to staff in a awfull manner. If you want to go on holiday and eat nothing but junk food then stay in Britain & perhaps go to Butlins. If on the other half you want gorgeous sunshine  clean hotel and lovely fresh healthy food & an opportunity to experience another culture then this please will do you fine üòÄWe also met some lovely people to holiday with and already looking to return üëå  The only reason i didnt give full stars is that i agree the restaurant could be run smoother . Also the shuttle bus only takes you to the new part of the city. It is then another (im guessing) 20 min walk or short taxi ride to the old town & medina. I hope the hotel changes this option.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Penrith, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alibella28

The staff all work hard especially the cleaners and ground staff. Everywhere was very clean. Our room was a good size and the bed very comfy. There was a large walk in shower and we had an outside table and chairs. The food was very good with a wide variety of hot and cold food. At breakfast the chef cooks eggs and omelets to order. In the evening they carve different meat and have lots of vegetables and salads. The entertainment in the evening was nothing special so we didn't sit outside and the bar was cooler anyway... The drinks were fine and the beer is all bottled. It's a local Moroccan beer and it's 4.7 % in strength. We didn't have any problems with queues as it wasn't very busy when we were there.

Food awful  that's if you got any as only a little was brought out at a time and you where kept waiting for more to be dished up. One Pannai roll cut into 4 and served so you only got a quarter of a roll and god forbid if you asked for more. Only one person behind Pizza/omellette bar and guess what another queue. The BBQ completely unhygienic with raw meat stored in blazing sunshine and hardly enough to serve everyone and only cooked 6/7 small pieces at a time so guess what another queue and long wait. very small portions they only catered for the first 100 people but several hundred staying there so if you didnt go with the first rush of people when the dining opened you got only the crap others didnt't want. That's if you could find a clean table as no staff and when they where there they where surly miserable and rude.The all inclusive is done on a budget snacks only available one hour a day the out door bar on average 20 mins to get served as the queue with a miserable barman with warm beer pored into small glass as you weren't allowed the whole bottle so one bottle beer serves 2. Surrounded by hundreds of wasps at the bar converging on all the spilt drinks sops on the bar which was filthy in fact the hotel could do with a good clean even in my backpacking days around the world have I ever came across a worse hotel. The swimming pools instead of tiles around had Plastic floor covering which was coming away and a lady tripped on and fell and broke her leg and there where no first aiders to help her in fact a nurse on holiday there was more helpful than the hotel. The reception guess what another long queue. We changed our room in the morning as ours had no working air con which we reported 4 times in the day to get fixed the final straw to move was the cockroaches running about in the bathroom and the army of ants marching through the room at 3am took another 8 hours from 7am until 3pm to change rooms staff most unhelpful as where all of them. If you wanted a drink at night there where 2 bars one which one had a queue and the other didnt which was in in a lovely air conditioned room with branded drinks as all the other drinks where local brands but in this bar all branded drinks Eg smirnoff vodka named brand beers but you had to pay so not all inclusive is it. So if want a holiday with rude staff hundreds of wasps queues for everything inadequate dining this holiday will be just right for you but if you just want a clean hotel helpful staff and just average foodDO NOT GO HERE...The only thing going for it was out of there hands and that was the weather.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracykit11

Not safe at all broken glass everywhere even in the kids club sand pit just chips and horrible pizza to eat for the kids. Seen them handling raw chicken on the bbq then handed out the cooked chicken with the same glove on. Air con non existent. Very rude people who work there the place is covered in wasps. We book through love holidays who basically ripped us off we paid for a family room but one of my kids had too sleep on the floor while the others had to share single beds. By the way we were a family of 7. We had two single beds and one double bed. When you complain they just shrug their shoulders at you. We also had a massive wasp nest on our window ledge as well. From the 2nd day there we were all fighting for the toilet because of the food. The place is a death trap. Anyway if your going to be stupid enough to go there take a lot of food with you as the hotel food is so so bad. I would rate this he'll hole a2 star just.

The room was spacious and clean but all hotel corridors are so dark you struugle to see where you are going after coming out of the bright sunshine.    The hotel has plenty of facilities  but it isa good 20 min taxi ride to the new town and 25 to the old town.It is a bit isolated with nothing around it so you cannot just have a little walk to restaurant/shops you have to get a taxi ride  which costs ¬£15.    I found the food to be a little boring and repetitive often luke warm and a struggle to find somewhere to sit half the time.. You can survive a few days but no longer than that on this diet.    Pool bar staff were pretty surly and as you have the very small bottles of beer on all inclusive they used to pour it and give you a half bottle of froth.Plus there were a lot of massive flies and other Insects all round the bar so not great.    The little hotel shop is also very expensive.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Kirstysins wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Great Holiday - apart from miserable 'holidaymakers',My boyfriend and I bought this as a cheap getaway I'd have been happy with nothing but a cheap pokey room. But what we got instead was far better than that. They put us in a Luxury suite. We were very impressed by both the size and the cleanliness of our suite. The Reception staff could've been a little more helpful in showing us the way to our room but I'm a big girl and can count. The hotel itself was stunning very clean and the staff were also very helpful. There was a vast array of food options and it definitely did not get boring or samey. The fruit and pastries were awesome and you could see that they had been made freshly.    We'd have loved to stay for longer to be honest. I have 2 complaints firstly other holiday makers that just couldn't be pleased. And secondly we were unable to book into the spa for a massage as they were fully booked....not the end of the world. We loved it here and will most definitely be coming back!,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,South London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirstysins

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,CorinaV1980 wrote a review Jun 2017,10,Very disappointing!!!,I just came back from my holiday at this hotel with my husband and our 4 year old boy. I will be as objective as I can and I will start with positives:  - nice water slides and main pool which we really enjoyed  - some nice food  - plenty of sunbed  However I am afraid all this were overshadowed by the negatives:  - very unprofessional staff not welcoming at all not doing their job properly not being there to help and please you. I asked at reception 4 times for another towel and i never got it so i had to share one with my son for a week. Asked for an iron and i was told that this is available just mornings and it's payable!  - my room 5109 absolutely filthy! I never stayed in such dirty room in my life even in a 2 stars hotel when i was younger let alone in a 4 stars! Will attach some pictures to prove that i am not exaggerating! Filthy carpets that we had to remove dust everywhere cockroaches plug outside the wall an hazard near the child head!  - outside area absolutely filthy pools dirty (main one was cleaner) but the kids one disgusting as well as the one near it rubbish left behind floors absolutly filthy and staff around it sooo lazy my husband had to ask them to clean cos they were just sitting and chatting or funny enough jumping in the pool!  - no smoking rules!!!! If you are a non smoker and you have kids i strongly recommend you to avoid this place as you have no rights and all you'll breathe all day will be smoke! I have to say that i was absolutely disgusted firstly by the management not thinking at all at our right to enjoy our holiday without putting up with the smoke absolutely everywhere and secondly with the amount of both french and english people so disrespectful and taking advantage of this situation smoking including near children at the slides pool!  - the customer service in the restaurant was sooo poor: had to run everywhere to get napkins glasses cutleries. Staff was absolutely useless never asked you for drinks or if you need anything.  - quality of food average/poor and drinks soo poor! We had to queue for drinks for ages and get them warm bar staff soo rude throwing them at you! We were really put off to go for drinks sometimes we prefered to just stick with the water from the room and noticed that many others had the bottles from the room!  - air con in tge room is working only from 2:30 which i found it ridiculous as you will wake up boiling and if you came after lunch for a rest had to boil again until 2:30!  To summarise I work myself in hospitality being a reasonable person not enjoing complaining and giving bad feedback as I know when people work hard and try to make happy their guests! I would never come back to this hotel and would never recommend it to someone else as the place is dirty and staff is not there to help and please you! The feeling you have is that you are on your own and you just have to survive! And to finish this place was in some days not appropriate to even be open to the public let alone to be quoted as a 1234 stars hotel! The cleanliness and good customer service should be in any hotel stars are about facilities not about essentials!  So can i just take this chance to not say Thank you for not making our holiday great!,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Eastleigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CorinaV1980
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,lucypurvis90 wrote a review Jun 2017,10,Very disappointing!!,We arrive early morning. I was given a key went to find my room opened the door to find someone else's stuff in the room! went back to reception and they didn't have another room ready at the time so we had to wait. the cleaners were in the room no more than 5 minutes cleaning from the person in the room before! this showed as my sheets were dirty and the floor had all dead bugs around the edges. the bathroom was dirty and had mould! our room every night had ants gnats and flys! once again these were not cleaned up once we had killed them! we had to continuously ask for clean towels in our room as they had taken our old ones and not replaced them .the safe in our room was attached to a shelf in our room however you could remove the shelf so someone could take the safe away. the cupboard the fridge was in didn't shut properly. the food was absolutely shocking! I basically lived on rolls and chips for the 10 days I was there! my husband tries anything and he struggled with the food! nothing was labelled so you didn't know what you was eating! I also had chicken that was pink so not cooked! the had 1 person serving in the pool bar all day and 1 person in the bar of an evening. the manager of the pool bar was very rude to all the Women and had numerous complaints raised about him. the general hygiene of the pool bar was disgusting! there were at least 30-40 wasps around the fizzy drinks machine that they use and also around the water dispenser! the children's pool had mould in it! whilst I was there there had been 2 accidents that had caused a hospital trip from the general care around the pool! they do not supply ice-cream for the children which i have never seen in an all inclusive hotel! the hotel is very run down and hasn't been looked after! a lot of work needs to be done to rate this a 5*. . most definitely will not be attending this hotel again! im not a fussy person when It comes to hotels as I am happy to stay in a 2*. if something is labelled 5* and I have paid for this I expect this to be the case!,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucypurvis90
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Michael G wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Great for a cheap holiday!,Spent a week at this hotel from the 11-18th of June and my boyfriend and I had a lovely holiday. We are a couple of students so we were just happy to be relaxing by a nice pool in the hot sunshine! The slides are great fun! The room was really nice we had a nice terrace that we only used to dry clothes and towels. Our room was cleaned and we got a fresh litre bottle of water everyday. The safe also worked perfectly so we could store valuables securely. The aircon worked fine the only slight issue was that we were give 2 twin beds. We just pushed them together and didnt worry about it but I'm sure you could just ask at reception or perhaps make it clear if you want a double or 2 twin beds when booking. The pools are really nice just try to ignore the wasps as they really wont hurt unless you cause a fuss with them. I was pleasantly surprised with the alcohol nothing seemed watered down at all and the beer was fresh from the bottle- much better than tap I think! All the cocktails are the same but some of the barmen will be generous with the amount of alcohol they are putting in if you ask them :) The food was nice I really enjoyed it for the first few days but after a while it did get a bit boring. The italian corner is great if your bored of the morrocan cuisine very nice pasta and pizza. The wifi works alright during the day its hard to get it working by the pool though and it didnt work in our room.  I will say however that the hotel is incredibly understaffed and we think this is the reason for all the issues. You do have to queue quite a bit for the bar and of you get to breakfast/lunch/dinner time a bit late there is a high chance you wont find any cutlery/glasses. We got around this by just getting numerous drinks at the bar every time and always getting to breakfast/lunch/dinner when it starts.  We were there during ramadan and there were some complaints about the attitudes of the staff but I really don't think the pool/restaurant/bar staff were particularly rude at all. I think i would certainly be a bit reluctant serving beers to holiday makers when I hadn't eaten or had any water all day in 40+ heat!  I will say that the reception staff were particularly difficult. There was one gentleman working on reception that didnt seem to want to help anyone that much which was a shame.  The entertainment staff are great especially Rachid with his amazing card magic tricks!  We enjoyed having chilled drinks by the bar every evening and didnt feel the need for any extra entertainment. Like all holidays it's what you make of it and if you just learn certain things like getting to lunch when it starts everything is a little less stressful and more enjoyable.  We really paid so little for this holiday so it was amazing for the price honestly!,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9296BNmichaelg
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Tracy Goodenough wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Fantastic,My husband my daughter and I have just arrived back yesterday to the U.K after a fantastic holiday. The room was great it was cleaned every day and all of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. the food was great too as I am diabetic I thought I might have problems but never did. There was plenty of food desserts were lovely and if you did not like the look of the main food there was always the option of pizza or pasta. the omelette man makes great omelettes for breakfast one day he even kept some ham behind so that I could have some. the entertainment team are great they are always walking around asking people to join in you play water polo most days and there is aquagym every morning and afternoon. We were always able to get sun beds and umbrellas the pool man with the red cap couldn't do enough for you. the entertainment team work really hard to get people to join in manners go a long way in this hotel and a lot of people didn't use manners but still received great service. I would like to thank Reda Oumaima Sumia Rashid and Hamid for giving us some great laughs especially around the pool and in the disco. Here is some advice that I think future guests should know:    The food in the restaurant is not labelled but the majority of the time you can guess what it is.  The wifi does not always work by the pool and does not work in the rooms but almost always will work in the lobby bar and restaurant.  If you take a taxi agree a price with the driver before you go. When we were there 100 dirham was equal to about ¬£8 so it is easy to work out what you are spending if you go from that.  Watch out for the blue plastic drains when you get into the pool as the heat often causes them to melt and it caused quite a few injuries.  The majority of the insects flying around are bees not wasps and will only sting you if you annoy them. If you ignore them you will be fine.  Do not leave food or drink by the pool as it will attract the insects.  Always wear shoes around the pool as the floor gets very warm.  You cannot wear just swimwear in the lobby bar or restaurant but cover ups do not need to cover arms or legs.  This hotel is not the hotel with all of the water slides that hotel has a very similar name but we heard nothing but bad things from people who had been to that hotel. Our hotel was called Labranda Targa Aquaparc and the other hotel is called Labranda Targa Aqua Funclub. This hotel does have four water slides but be warned that they are deceptively fast especially the orange one.  If you see cats around the hotel do not pet them as they are street cats and are not vaccinated.    We would definitely return to this hotel and this country as we had a wonderful time and had nothing bad to say about it once we got home.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298tracyg

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,babster2168 wrote a review Jun 2017,20,"Organised chaos, the Moroccan Fawlty Towers.........",Just returned today from this hotel and definately have to say i would never step foot in the place again. A few good points always got a sunbed and the showers stayed hot regardless of how they were run however these were totally over taken by the bad ones.  Bland food and lack of choice (especially if you dont eat a lot of meat). Get into the restauarant early as the food after a certain time is not replenshed the pasta and pizza bar you wait ages for and then after you have run around clearing your own table getting cutlery and then drinks is cold. The tables are never cleared and you are forever running around getting things.  At the pool barect a long wait and if ordering a soft drink a minute plastic cup filled possible with the hundred or so wasps hanging around the machine. However if you order alchol you can get a glass to use by the pool in the pool leave on the side etc to get broken and for people to tread on.  Cleaning of the rooms i could not fault however cleaning the pool area between 9 and midday when people are trying to sunbathe and the staff have got the karcher out blasting the pool side with disinfectant and chemicals is just ridiculous.  Earlier this week at 8.30pm we were almost gassed out when 40/50 people had to come running in from outside as someone had put too much pool treatment in and the toxic gas cloud had people heaving unable to breathe and left them with streaming eyes.... the managements response to this ? Absolutle nothing not even a note to say apologies for last nights issue we will endeavout to ensure it doesnt happen again.  I know we were there over ramadam but the attitude of most of the staff was rude and downright absuive we felt as if we were at times in the moroccan version of fawlty towers  Evening entertainment was non existant and at 11pm the bar was shut lights turned out and the bar pitched into darkness regardless of if you had finished your drink or not.  Still as the drinks were watered down and there were only 4 cocktails in the machine (all of which that were sickly and tasted of artificial colourants) and you queued for drinks at all opportunities you could hardly drink enough to get even mildy drunk in an evening you would have had to start with breakfast.... oops forgot there that the bar didnt open until 10am  Lack of wi fi also needs to be addressed at times in the evening you couldnt get a signal as there were so many people in reception all trying to get online    All in all if you can go elsewhere there are plenty of other decent hotels in Morocco out there,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"South Ockendon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babster2168
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,agnessevenoaks wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Good value for money,We visited the hotel in May 2017.the general opinion of the stay was very good but....  Hotel is very nice and family friendly. Kids can injoy the slides and pools all day. Rooms are cleaned daily and kept to the high standard.  Main problem in my view is the hotel staff. Not very nice and always measurable. Very disorganised. At reception desk it is always a problem to ask for anything. For example when my daughter cut her foot they had no first aid kit . I gently suggested they should have one and got just a smile. When it happened again next day they still didn't have any plasters or pads and I was sent to a nurse. (Nurse however only works till 5) I was a bit cross as people kept cutting their feet in the same pool every day. Also we paid extra for a balcony room but had to fight for it as they don't have that information in the system and just give you any clean room they have at the time.Cleanliness around pools very poor . Empty glasses some of them broken. The only person to open your umbrella was pool boy who carried special pin.  Animation team generally invisible during the day. Just some aqua gym and darts . evening entertainment also boring and repetitive apart from morrocan night.  The hotel food was lovely. Big selection of local cuisine but also pasta and pizza station . Unfortunately a big but again....the tables were never set up on time. No clean cutlery and basically you had to look for clean glasses or cups.  We love to explore wherever we go so we booked many trips. As the hotel is in the middle of nowhere the only place to buy your excursions is the hotels meeting point . be careful with them. They really overcharged us and the trips where not the best. Once we went to book a taxi to marrakech the guy offered 360 dihrams return insuring us that was very cheap but at reception we got it for 200.so if you are planning to sightsee it would be worth to do it before you go there and have it ready on arrival . besides the man who sold to us messed up with the pick up time twice so at on occasion we had to wait an hour for a driver and second time we were late. We were then apologized and offered a compensation in a spa but we couldn't be bothered to ask for it.  Generally it is worth the money but be prepared for some disappointments. The country is beautiful and it if I can suggest a trip The waterfalls are a must and definitely the best trip we had. Agadir is also great but 3.5 hours drive one way . I wish you a pleasant stay and enjoyable holiday.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agnessevenoaks

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,DawnM1982 wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Not a 4* hotel,I had been reading the reviews for this hotel before arriving and was slightly concerned as to what we were going to find!  On arrival Ramadan had started so the clocks had changed which our airport pick up didn't take in to consideration so we were stood around for ages at the airport waiting for them to arrive.  On arrival at the hotel we found that the room wasn't ready that's fine it was only 10am. We were told to come back in 2 hours and breakfast was just finishing if we wanted to grab something quick. We were given some forms to fill out the meeting point guy introduced himself so we went to find out some info on the excursions.  Once we'd spoken to the excurions guy and picked the day out in Marrakesh at the palaces and souks. This tour isn't well described though it's a walking tour lots of walking! We had some older people on our tour and you could tell by mid afternoon they were really struggling even we were struggling by the end. And it didn't finish at 4pm it finished at 6pm!!! When we were tired and completely exhausted. We had been picked up at 9am first stop was 2pm - no comfort stops anywhere..... Good luck to you all!!!  We grabbed our bags went to the toilets in the lobby and changed in to our swim wear.  There were plenty of sun loungers free so we made ourselves comfortable for a couple of hours. Just after 12pm I went back to enquire about the room nope after lunch - 2:30pm.....  After lunch and leaving it until at least 3pm we returned to the desk to find our reservation wasn't there they didn't have the paperwork anywhere that i'd handed them that morning. After finding someone who could understand what we wanted and were saying I was getting quite annoyed at this point we were given a twin room not a double a twin. Easy fix move the table and push the beds together.....  The food here is a bit samey really..... you have to be there at the right time as well to get the food as it's gone so quickly! And if you need a glass mug cutlery this takes some time to locate.  The room was cleaned daily and everything replenished the aircon worked well and the blackout curtains were fab for the early morning sun that wanted to beam in to our room! A few English channels on the TV if you look for them.  We were here for 5 days which was long enough I do want to return to Marrakesh but not sure i'd stay here again. It's good for families with younger children really.  It's a shame as this was sold to me as something of a really good holiday the photos online are all enhanced somehow it doesn't look like that now and it certainly needs a good clean and a fresh paint everywhere.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Saffron Walden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnM1982
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,LancsLass2017 wrote a review Jun 2017,10,Still poorly over a week later,I arrived on 21 May 2017. Started feeling very sick a couple of days into the holiday and was up all night being sick and on the loo. Only ate in the restaurant at the hotel. I noticed a few people complaining of the same thing. The afternoon snacks is just pretty much what is left over from lunch ie cold pizza and fish sandwiches which had been left out for ages. There was a swarm of wasps all over the drinks machine in the pool bar and the glasses were not properly washed just swilled after each person. The hotel uses actual glasses to serve drinks which is not helpful for a children's resort when the adults smash glasses in and around the pool.The beds are really hard and difficult to sleep on. I was sick for the remainder of the holiday and hardly ate on the last couple of days. I've been back a week and I still can't keep any food down and i'm constantly on the loo. Nice hotel but hygene is seriously lacking and they need to sort whatever food problem they had that made so many of us sick that week.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LancsLass2017

Great exercise programmes during the day (aerobics step aerobics Aqua gym). Also do a great mini disco for kids on an evening and evening shows    Activities: tennis football table tennis badminton water polo trampoline kids mini park with slide and swings gym    Pools: there are 6 pools 1 with the slides (the slides are ace 2 of them are really fast!) they aren't watched by staff though so make sure you watch your kids! 3 of the pools are really shallow so your kids can easily stand up in them which is ace! The pools are REALLY cold though!!!    Free bus: into the new town!    Cleaners: keep the rooms nice and fresh and clean them daily    Negatives    Food: very repetitive and not a lot of choice. Me my mum and son has terrible tummy problems too which we think is as a result of the food    Drink: very small measures of alcohol bars close earlier than advertised and the slowest staff ever!! Always big queues    Shop: not a lot of essentials things in stock (suncream inflatables icecream water etc) once it was sold it wasn't replaced! So for example I wanted to buy some armbands for my son and they didn't have any I went into the shop everyday for a week and they never got any more stock in    Hotel location: it's in a very remote place we wanted to go out for dinner but t would of been a 30 mins taxi trip to the New town    Beds: super hard I had back ache every morning.

It‚Äôs the staff that really downgrade what could be such a great resort .    Arrived at the hotel mid-morning  The girl on reception looked like she did not want to be there at all . we was issued with our all-inclusive wrist bands and set on our way being told to come back later to check in our room . We had no idea where anything was  no idea when or where we could eat . Hotel maps and times should be issued on arrival to make the first few hours so but better     ROOM  When we got our room we was issued the wrong size room for a 4 person party but we was soon moved with no hassle  The room we was given in the end was fine  Clean and tidy and the maids came round every day to see if we wanted it cleaning     FOOD  I found the food a bit bland at times but it was acceptable Breakfast you had omelettes made to order in front of you  eggs fried to order  scrambled egg sausages pancakes lots of cereals fruit and pasties . Lunch and dinner seemed fine lots of chicken  lots of veg  all well-cooked and a good variety. If you are a wine drinker you will be happy  I found the wine there was fine and if you treat the waiters right they make sure your glass is not empty for long . The snacks through the day were just pastries and cold pizza.    STAFF  Reception staff have no personality and are not very welcoming at all  outside pool bar ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Oh dear ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Mr grumpy needs a good lesson in customer service  I did try and have a bit of a chat but gave up in the end . just go get your drink and don‚Äôt bother trying to communicate and you will be ok . It‚Äôs a pitty because this bar is in a good position and has the music from the pool playing  it needs enthusiastic jolly people laughing and dancing with the customers not someone that refuses to communicate . Some of the waiters in the restaurant really try hard  if you notice them putting a bit of effort in drop them a tip  honestly a 20dh tip (¬£1:80) at the start of your holiday goes a long way     ENTERTAINMENT  The kids club was ok  but the whole entertainment team do not do a great job of trying to get people involved  no enthusiasm there a lot of the time  The main entertainment hall is set out like a theatre just rows of chairs . no tables so you can‚Äôt really take your drinks in and sit there to enjoy anything The guy singing outside was ok for the first couple of nights but soon gets boring hearing the same old thing every night.    SHUTTLE BUS  The shuttle but is a great bonus  this service is great  its free but get your name down the night before  it takes you to the town which has lots of shops there is also a McDonalds KFC and pizza hut . from there its easy to grab a taxi to the market for about ¬£4 and this is an amazing place to go and visit .    We enjoyed our holiday here because we do not let things ruin it for us but there is a lot of work to be done here to make this place as good as it could be.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,EM-Adventures wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Just okay,"Arrived at hotel around 10 am on the 23rd May. Read the reviews before heading out to Morocco but as with all holidays you are always going ro get people who dislike something so we always go with an open mind.    Hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere. There is a supermarket 20 mins walk away and yes you may be approached by beggers as you will be throughout the whole of Marrakech.    Upon arrival we went straight to reception to check in knew our room probably would not be ready till 2pm so was prepared for this (nothing the hotel can do about flight arrival time). Lady at desk didnt really ""speak"" to us looked at our paperwork gave us some forms to fill in...we did that while she issued our wrist bands for all inclusive.Still no conversation! Was then told to leave suitcases in lobby and come back in an hour. Was not given a map directions opening times of any facilities... Just come back in 1 hour. So we hung around the lobby area not really sure what else we could do as it was pretty hot outside and we were dressed for English weather.  An hour passed and we returned to the desk by which time there was a queue. Everyone seemed to be told to go back at 12. Rooms were not ready and was ushered away again for another hour. By now everyone in our party was feeling exhaustedfrustrated and hungry. And no member of staff had offered a map or directions or opening times of restaurants. My husband ended taking a look around and asked reception for a map and opening times so we could at least get a drink and something to eat he wa given a credit card size card with some times and pointed in the direction of the restaurant.    After eating we made our way back to reception and was finally given room keys. We had paid for a family room with Balcony (3 adults and a child). The room we were given (nice size very clean and well presented over looking the pool) only had a double bed and one small sofa that our 9 year old hung off the end!!! No third bed for my niece!!!! So back to reception my husband went....and was given a key to ""suite"" room 6002. Much better size and location near the adult pool ground floor with a terrace patio table and 4 chairs. Finially we were able to change out of our hot travel clothes and make our way to the pool area for cocktails around the pool.    The whole complex is clean and tidy. All pools were cleaned every morning but the hotel does have wasp problem around the sweet drinks at the pool side.    Slides are alot of fun our daughter enjoyed them and made many ""holiday friends"" of different nationalities which was nice to See.    Meal times there was always variety of foods always fresh and hot. We never went hungry. Had some super waiters who couldnt be more friendly and helpful. One or two whos English was limited tried their best to help! Only issue I had was with who seemed to be the restaurant manager (guessing this is who he was as he was dressed in white shirtwhereas all the others were dressed in all black) couldnt be more miserable if he tried not a good front man at all.    Bar stuff were happy and served with a smile.....ok so you have probably read about the old guy behind the bar being grumpy appearances can be misjudged..  Speak a little french to him I think you will find he has a little sense of humour there!!    The animation team I had read great thinhs about and after an amazing holiday in Spain last September was looking forward to the entertainment.... Big let down! We were never encoraged to take part in any entertainment outside the team centre their attention to the clients who get there early and have ""front row seats!"". And what is provided as entertainment is very limited and by 11pm thats your lot everything closes and thats it for the night.    The childrens club my daughter decided she wanted to take part in and she seemed to enjoy sitting in the cool room.drawing with the other children or playing games with them. But never seemed much involvement from the person running it. Infact one day it closed early and my daughter was left alone in the play area. Luckily we werent too far away and spotted the lady running it leaving the building.    Free shuttle bus is a bonus at the hotel takes you to New Town only. You can walk to Old Town approx 20 mins my niece and I did this one day. Or take a taxis costs 50 dirhams max to old town    Excursions at the hotel are extremely pricey. We found a lovely taxi driver we hired for the day he took us to rhe waterfall area camel rides through rhe Atlas mountains and for lunch at a water side restaurant for 600 dirhams. Great guy!    The hotel itself is lovely the staff I am affraid to say need alot of improvement. I have worked in customer service for almost 20 years and the lack of it at this hotel is astonshing (apart from a few who do try really hard in the restaurant to keep the guests happy).    I would rate this hotel less than the 3* hotel we stayed in at Spain purely because I personally did not like the way we were greeted at reception....first impressions make a big impact of any situation...and because for me personally again the entertainment team was a massive let down they could of done so much more to make it more enjoyable for everyone.    Saying this everyone has a different experience. We went with an open mind didnt let it ruin our holiday...and laughed off the bad stuff.    Marrakech is a beautiful place and I would go back but unfortunately this hotel would be a no for me in the future.",Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cornwall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Em-Adventures

Ok we are here for 5 days and I think a week max would be enough due to a few things  You are a way out from town but there are good excursions and trips as well as transport provided at good prices.  The food is good well presented as well as lots of it including snacks but I think I would get bored of it after a week.  The free drinks are ok but small glasses so you need to so lots of trips but it's no drama.  The rooms are clean and tidy ours could do with a lick of paint in places but your not coming here to stay in your room are you.......  The staff are friendly there are a few blokes who are a bit grumpy late in the day but it's Ramadan for them so you can't really blame them no food or drink and it's in it's 30s here although 1 barman I think used to work behind the counter on I'm a celebrity but he's the only 1 who's expression doesn't change.  Wasps there are lots of them and they love the sweet stuff but not hotel fault it's like it everywhere.  I wouldn't avoid this hotel for the bad reviews trust me there are worse and no matter where you go you can find something to complain about I bet the Ritz in London gets bad press as well  So in all remember what your paying for and enjoy your stay,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Carmarthen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NobbyNosis
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,SamSmith007 wrote a review Jun 2017,20,Just okay.,"Okay don't get me wrong we had a great time. Marrakesh is beautiful. However the hotel.. well.. not so great. Where to start?  The food. It was the same food on rotation.. and I'm pretty sure if there was left overs like (fish heads) then they would chop that up and serve it as a stew or something else. There was so variety. It was mainly meat and a lot of vegetables with no labels or anything!  We witness nearly all the kids just have a plate full of chips every night- some adults too!  The entertainment wasn't that great either. The poor guys could only sing ed sheeran songs. The hotel itself was lovely unfortunately the air con wasn't so great. The hotel I must say is miles our from the centre of Marrakesh so be prepared to pay for taxis or get the shuttle bus if they're not full.  Now the best part...  the meeting point guy. Oh yes. The meeting point guy is meant to help us book tours and activities while we're on holiday. Me and my boyfriend booked 4 tours with this guy costing us over ¬£100 each.  The first trip was fine and went smoothly. Our next trip was the camels so we got ready and went down to wait.. as we were waiting we noticed two coaches turned up I asked the meeting point guy which one was ours.. he then said.. ""oh sorry trip cancelled tried to find you last night but couldn't""... this was at 1:45pm! We nearly wasted a whole day. I was not happy. He tried to book us in for the camels again but we were flying out in 5 days time and didn't have a slot available as we were planning to do something else.  So the next day comes and we booked a hiking trip and I was especially looking forward to it as I'm a photographer and love to hike! Thankfully the meeting point man found us the day before we were due to go for our trip at 6am.. he said ""sorry tripped cancelled. I guess you will have to have a refund""...  okay so that's another day wasted. We got our refund in the end. But if you were coming here and booked lots of trips and turns out most of them were cancelled your holiday would of been ruined.  This is not okay and very frustrating to see. I understand there's a language barrier but seriously this guy could of done more rather than telling us at last minute.    On the other hand Marrakesh is a beautiful place and would love to go back.",Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kettering, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamSmith007
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,270VernJ wrote a review May 2017,20,Definitely not 4*,When we arrived the staff were nice and we were approached by a travel agent who encouraged us to book trips in advance as we were only staying for a few days and we could make the most of our time. This was quite helpful however some of these trips were quite expensive and it would have been cheaper to take a taxi and go around yourself. So please do your research before booking. Trips outside of the city are definitely worth booking however the city trips like the mosque tour and visit to Jardin Majorelle would definitely be cheaper if you went via taxi.    Moving on to he hotel itself the rooms were basic but quite spacious and we had a room with a balcony with a nice view. The shower was quite powerful however for 3 consecutive days the hot water stopped working at around 5pm and we were told this was due to issues with their generator which resulted in having icy cold showers. Not cool. The food was mediocre with very little variety. There was an area where you could have freshly made pizza and pasta which was slightly better however the service varied depending on who was working in this area. On quite a few occasions we received very poor service from an extremely rude woman who clearly did not know her head from her tail. The drinks were quite poor as well and I was quite disappointed that there were no real fruit juices served at any point and had to settle for drinking fizzy drinks or this ridiculous sweet artificial fruit drink or water.    There swimming pools could have been cleaner though I did like that there was a separate adult-only pool and the water slides were basic but quite fun. The hotel did offer some entertainment including belly dancers in the evenings however everything ended by around 11pm which was kind of rubbish.    Another major issue was wifi. Wifi was only accessible in communal areas like in the lobby and around the pool and there was no wifi available in bedrooms.    Overall I have mixed feelings about this hotel as some of the staff were very friendly and helpful but there are some glaring issues which need addressing.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270VernJ

With foods not that good sometimes less cooks cooking the foods sometimes not enough foods on the buffet they don't refill. Sometimes they serve row food when you tell them this is row they look at you like you did something wrong they don't say anything back so many other things like you pay for all inclusive you don't get everything for drinking water there only one in the reception so many things not right as a 4 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è hotel as they say 4 stars water slide off when you tell them they don't bother what ever my family said about this hotel it is correct specially service is not that good ‚òπÔ∏èpart from that our holiday was excellent morocco is great holiday you can do things cheeper like quads bike going to places so many other things you can do for this hotel thumbs üëéüèº,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joe00007
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,jackie z wrote a review May 2017,30,Please read before making your choice,I have recently returned from the Labranda Atlas Targa. First impressions lovely quick check in. We went for lunch until room was ready not a lot of choice with food if you are a fussy eater which i'm not. A few tagines only 1 with meat well bones to be exact.... undercooked potatoes and some fish. Drink machine hit and miss if it worked and if you could find cup for coffee.    I got very sick the first day and quite a few other people we spoke to had upset tummies. I put this down to the salad although i was told it was washed in bottled water maybe the flies had been on it.    Lots of wasps so I suggest either drinking water or take a cup with a lid on as they love sweet drinks.    Rooms - spacious and clean lovely walk in shower which was really powerful nowhere to put your toiletries except a small metal shelf that was far too small just enough for a bar of soap. We had an issue with aircon called maintenance who came after calling 3 times without success. So sweat all night not good. We complained and were moved to a suite which was really nice and the aircon worked - bonus.    Pools not very clean and there is an issue with glasses around the pool so many got broken this needs to be sorted out urgently.    Free bus takes you to Gueliz (new town) so if you want to go to Jemma el Fna you need to take a taxi from Gueliz approx ¬£4.00 or a horse and carriage    I would not return to the hotel as there are far better hotels,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiez751

I personally wouldn't say it was a stroll to the supermarket but if u like walking probably ook overall a clean hotel with staff who are friendly but not overly helpful a lt of cigarette butts around though they did provide plenty of ash trays not many umbrellas oh and if broken just help ur self to a stick from the nearest tree it works perfectly sorry would say it is 3* trying to be 4* which it could reach with so little extra effort,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bourne End, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boxer7199

Food was very good we found something tasty every time we ate. The entertainment was low key with a duo on guitar and organ singing popular songs... too many in French for my liking but there were a lot of French tourists at the hotel when we visited.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Grimace wrote a review May 2017,40,Bad reviews not justified...,We have read many bad reviews on here but we are on our final day here and thought it deserved a positive review.    First it is important that we did not pay a fortune to stay here so i am reviewing it based on price we paid also hotel was probably at best around 2 thirds full so again may be different if completly full.    Room was decent size with balcony decent shower comfy enough bed small fridge enough cupboard space etc few minor cosmetic issues and safe did not work. downside was air con was very poor it reached 40 degrees plus few times during our stay and aircon bairly made a difference.    Food for all meals was very good always plenty of choice both meat fish and veggie dishes and also cooked to order as well e.g omlettes for breakfast pizza pasta for lunch and dinner also few times they had bbq going outside cooking chicken or fish  if food ran out was replenished quick only time there was a huge queue was the day they did burgers!! Never had issue finding a table or glasses etc.    Drinks for all inclusive were fine choice of soft drinks beer wine spirits etc and again never any issues with them running out couple of times a bit of a queue in the evening but nothing unreasonable.    All the staff we encountered were friendly enoughwe always made effort just to do your please and thankyous in french it's not hard and it is appreciated but certainly never encountered anything bad like people have put on here.    Pools never too crowded and never had issue at all getting sunbeds everywhere is nice and clean used the bus service down to town a few times doesn't take you right to old town but easy enough to get taxi from drop off point taking you rest of the way for around 30 dirum. Marrakech is amazing you get lost for hours walking around the markets so much to see and do.    We really enjoyed out time here and would definitely come back.

Secondly the Tourist guide guy Nabil ( Nabeel) such a bad guy so arrogant and fake soon as we said we not taking any tours that man showed attitude and gave us killer looks each time he saw us.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,penstemon66 wrote a review May 2017,50,"Comfortable, relaxing hotel ideal for couples or families as both needs are met.",Having read some of the negative reviews I was rather worried about what I would find....however having spent a week there in early May I do not recognise these negative reviews. The hotel is spread out in lovely well tended gardens and is very clean. There are the waterslides running into a pool a separate childrens pool a main pool and then round the otherside an adults only quiet pool. Always plenty of sunbeds so no one needs to be annoying and reserve them. There is a pool bar an inside bar opening at 6pm and a sports bar (which is not all-inclusive). Restaurant is buffet style with a separate Italian corner for pizzas and pasta and yes there is often a wait because it is cooked to order. Large salad bar with plenty of choices and then hot food....always meat / fish on offer and plenty of varieties of vegetables/couscous/rice. ideal for me as I do not like meat. Of course there is no pork. Tables cleared regularly. Sometimes you have to chase up glasses/cutlery but staff willing. wine served to the table lunch & dinner. Everynight there was an excellent guitarist and keyboard player outside and entertainment by the animation team in the theatre (popular with families but we preferred the singer outside). Room always clean/quiet/new bedding and towels everyday. Coutesy bus to the new town daily which we were told is about a 15min walk to the old town and Medina. We preferred to go by taxi to the medina.....100 dirham fixed price each way.(12 dirham to the pound). efficient currency exchange at reception. reception was often chaotic with people checking out/booking in. Not really anywhere to walk to outside the hotel. Generally a very enjoyable holiday/we felt safe whenever we were in town. I would hazhard a guess that some of the nit picking is because people are comparing a holiday in Morocco to what they might expect in England. This is after all Africa and if I wanted an English or European experience I would stay in Europe.

I just wanted to write a review quickly to challenge some of the less favourable ones on here. When we arrived at the hotel we were checked in quickly and given our room on the second floor. Firstly the room was beautiful better than some 5 star hotels i have stayed in. Only minor thing was that it was hard to get a hot shower before 6:30pm but again not a big deal! It was cleaned every day and we always had a good supply of everything we needed.  The all inclusive food buffet was good and had different food for everyone to enjoy as there are multiple nationalities staying here. I found that i could always find a seat and hardly had to queue for anything.  The pool area was very pleasent and there were always spare sunbeds and parasols for us to use. The pools are spacious and very refreshing after laying out in the heat. Even though we are adults we very much enjoyed the slides as a bit of entertainment!! The pool bar was perfect for refreshments and we found there was never much of a queue. The animation team which work throughout the day put on lots of activities that you could choose to take part in. Although there was no presure they always made sure that you were ok and had everything you needed. They were very good at speaking your language whether it be english french german etc. And we did not feel left out even though we spoke little french.  The evening entertainment was varied and we enjoyed just sitting outside the lovby listening to the live singer who was very talented. There i a disco every night for the children so if you are coming as a family the adults can get a little bit of alone time which im sure is appreciated!  Wifi is usually good although did go down for a while. But not the hotels fault obviously!

On our first day there were some vile people shouting at the bar staff for absolutely no reason we saw the whole 'incident' and the bar manager felt with this very well. All staff were very accommodating and spoke in our language as best as they could. Meal times could be a bit busy as it is buffet style and non allocated seating but selection of food was good.  The hotel itself was clean and the room was very big for a double room more of an apartment than a room. There is an adults only pool which was great if you're in a holiday away from the kids!

It is clean safe friendly and has bundles to do for young families and a nice relaxing pool for adults. The staff are great the food is varied and there is plenty of it throughout the day and pretty decent for an all inclusive. The free shuttles into Marrakech are really handy. As far as value for money goes this place is excellent. Morrocan Ed Sheeran (Youssef) is fantastic to listen to in the evenings.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Henry H wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Not for the typically british,We are a family with an active 8 year old. Just returned home after ten days at this hotel.  We had apprehensions after reading earlier reviews on this hotel however we had a totally different experience.  We stayed in a triple room. The ones on the corner of the blocks appear to have a larger balcony. There was no wifi in the room but the signal from the main building and the pool area seem to cover most of the complex. The room was large and immaculate and the room maid was very nice and keen to pleasetho spoke little English. She realised we were three persons and after the first day we always had the right number of towels.  The pool area is impressive. The grounds are watered daily and kept clean and tidy. The water slides were open from around 10am till 1 and the from 2.30 till 5.30pm. The lifeguard couldn't do more for you.very attentive and friendly at all times and always checking we had enough shade and moving the parasols accordingly free of charge.  The pool side bar was adequate though there were short queues at times. With the hot weather there seemed to be a large congregation of wasps at most times but they proved to be harmless.  The restaurant....by far the best I have ever been to in an all inclusive hotel and we've been to many over the years. These always seemed to be at four choices I would have liked to try and only on one day in the evening there was a short queue. All the food was hot and fresh and tasted fantastic. My wife is Russian and I from South America so out food taste is perhaps not the same as that of an avereage British traveller hence the title of this review. However we were spolit for choice all the time. Our boy is a bit fussy with his food but there was always a nice selection of pizzas and pasta cooked to order. Also an endless supply of chips. Choice of alcoholic drinks during meals was minimal but wine was always not far. Just walk to the waiters area and indulge.  The evening entertainment was limited but if good quality though the songs did repeat after a while.  The animation team in particular Rachid were most attentive and always ensured everyone who was interested took part in what was a varied plentiful activity program throughout the day.  There is a free courtesy minibus that takes you to the new part of the city.the ride is about 12-15 minutes. You book your return as you board on the way out.  The Medina is also not far away but we made our own arrangements for that day and it was well worth it with snake charmers and endless choice to purchase just about anything you can imagine.  We like the place so much we can't wait to go back but if you're British I can see a lot of thinks won't be to your taste.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Matt F wrote a review Apr 2017,30,A potentially fantastic hotel - service must be improved,Unfortunately the potential is not yet realised.    Grounds and buildings are kept in excellent order. Rooms are nice and are kept clean daily.    Major issue with room is lack of towels - hotel clearly doesn't have enough towels for all of the rooms as they collect them and then return them later if you are lucky - it really is pot luck - we ended up with one hand towel for two days running.    Food is nice however there doesn't seem to be any attempt to keep the buffet stocked during mealtimes - whether this is a staffing issue or a management issue is difficult to tell.    Desert selection is pretty poor and does not vary from day to day. See above comments about stocking buffet.    Also trying to track down glasses cups plates and cutlery during mealtimes is a mission in itself.    This hotel has major issues in the way drinks are served;  1. There is not enough staff - 1 barman is not enough to serve the whole hotel at any time of day especially not busy times.  2. Why are all of the kids having to get soft drinks from the same bar as the adults? This adds work to the overworked barman - can't soft drink dispensers be provided like in the canteen so everyone can help themselves?  3. Why are drinks being served in glass around the pool? Surely it would be better to serve in decent size disposable cups as the bars are always running out of glasses  4. Why is there no overlap between pool and main bar opening times? It is hot enough to stay by pool until 7-8pm - it is a pain having to go into main bar to get drinks when still in swimming gear.  5. Why is beer served in 100-150ml measures? British people are used to drinking by the pint - 570ml measures so if we have to get four drinks at a time from the bar that doesn't have enough bar staff or glasses we are simply compounding an existing issue and making it worse. Getting bigger glasses to serve beer in would be a quick fix to a simple problem if you were serving draught beer.  6. Why are you pouring bottled beer into glasses? Why not just give people multiple bottles with one glass or start serving draught beer?    Basically the way drinks are served currently is not compatible with the way Britons drink alcohol and as a result it causes more irritation than it needs to as there are some small changes that could be made to make service more efficient.    We did complain about this very strongly at resort and we saw gradual improvements during the course of our stay.    The pools are clean and kept well. The water slides are geared for young children and are unlikely to be of much interest to over 12s.    The entertainment team were constantly active around the pool and seemed to do a great job however continuously playing the same ten songs is irritating after one day never mind a week or more. There is no excuse in the internet age for not having a library of music that doesn't get repeated many times every day. There is certainly no need to be playing 'this is Marrakesh' on loop for an hour everyday either - I am sure most guests are fully aware of their location having had to book the holiday in the first place.    The music entertainment at the bar on an evening is even more limited than the pool dj music library. Everyone will hate ed Sheeran within a day - this guy needs changing. The lack of repertoire means you can hear the same song up to 5 times between 8-11pm. Get some more acts for different nights of the week.    Luckily for us we were with a larger group and the music selection became the source of much hilarity and the butt of many jokes but it really does need sorting.    Notwithstanding the above comments we had a very enjoyable holiday as part of a large group. We also paid less than ¬£2000 for a family of five to go during the Easter holidays.    As such I think a three star rating is fair for this hotel on the basis that it provided good value for the price we paid and we could see service improvements on a daily basis.    I would not be averse to going back to this hotel but I would like to know for sure that the points that have been raised by myself and many others have been addressed first.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattf204
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Nicola S wrote a review Apr 2017,10,Stay away,"Just returned after a week away here with my family. Weather fantastic but that's all I can say about this hotel.  Firstly it's out in the middle of no where so be aware when booking.  Secondary all inclusive here is not what your expecting food is limited and very poor drinks are also limited and watered down and bar shuts at 11pm but also be ready to join a long que.  Water is only served from a water machine in reception by plastic cups no water in rooms really not helpfully in the boiling temperatures when your air conditioning doesn't work.  Crockery is all chipped and cracked in the restaurant and often ran out of cups for hot drinks so again served in plastic cups. The music round the pool will send you deaf as so loud head banging thump all day.  Be ready to be woken at 5.30 am with prayer singing .  Honestly we know people have given this 5 stars but honestly we don't see how we have been to marrakech many times and there are far better places to stay.  The children enjoyed the pool although very cold and the aqua park closes twice during the day for the life guard to have his break.  Evening entertainment was a lone singer with a keyboard singing the same songs every evening which became monotonous would have been far more nicer to have had some morrocan3 dancing or singing   To sum it up poor food poor facilities staff need training in people skills rooms need proper air conditioning and comfortable beds more staff to mange restaurant and bar.  Positive""s - nice weather and large rooms.",Date of stay: April 2017,,"Wiltshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolasB4435HP
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Danielle2324 wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Need to work on their customer service!,"CHECK-IN  We were a group of seven women staying here for 4 nights. When we arrived the place looked great but were told we couldn't check in till 14:00. Not a problem we weren't interested in sitting in the room anyway we asked if there was somewhere we could change into swimwear as it was only 11:00 and were shown to a room behind the reception area where we could also leave our bags.    POOL BAR  Headed to the pool bar where we ordered cocktails...don't be fooled...it might be called a ""vodka sun"" but you actually have to ask for alcohol in the cocktails! The majority (NOT ALL!!) of the bar staff seem as though you're really putting them out when you ask for a drink. We were told 3 different times by different people for when the pool bar opened...turns out its whenever they feel like it. It closed at around 16:30-17:00 each day when they opened the bar inside (you have to put clothes on to go inside the hotel).    ROOMS  We had a lovely room and was clean and plenty of space but with three people in the room we were constantly having to remind the staff we needed three towels. On day one there was only two towels and nobody was answering the phone at reception for over half an hour. We went downstairs and stood in a queue for a decade because it seemed if you were French speaking you took precedence. We were told that they would bring one up right away. Another hour later and no towel had appeared so a second trip to reception to demand a towel immediately had to occur.    Within our group we had three rooms and on each night there was a problem in atleast one if not more of showers whether it was cold or lacked any pressure at all. When they did work the showers were great!    FOOD    Breakfast was ok. They had made to order omelets every morning but the queue at this was LONG and there wasn't any variations on what you could have day to day.    Dinner was very same-y every night. Queues were long and there was no order to anything again if you were French speaking you were favouritised. If you want pizza be at lunch and dinner for the start time and get straight there otherwise you're going to be stuck behind the kids that all seem to order 3 pizzas each! The majority of staff at dinner found it a burden to get cutlery or glasses for you and trying to ask for anything you pretty much had to chase them down the dining area for them to take notice of you.    We were told that dinner finished at 21:30 however we found that they stopped putting out food from around 20:30 and was told by restaurant staff that dinner service closed at 21:00. Another trip to reception to clarify this we were again told another completely different time. Nobody seems to know anything in this place and there is a distinct lack of order.    There was one lovely waiter that was very friendly and didn't appear to have an issue when you asked him something. He was tipped based on his demeanor alone and from there really couldn't do enough for us even reserving a table for us at dinner even though he wouldn't be on shift.    Lunch was the best food and biggest selection but if you want dessert be sure to get that first as they don't seem to replenish it once it's gone and the kids seem to have a habit of putting everything on their plate and not eating it.    There was an a la carte restaurant on site however when we tried to book for the night we were told it ""wasn't working"". This wasn't mentioned at any point until we enquired about it.    POOL  The pool area and the slides were great a large pool and a smaller ""quiet pool"" available. The ""quiet"" pool is very quiet and there is no music but there was also no bar open there either. The only downside to the pool was the noise. We didn't want to sit in silence and enjoyed the music (well known songs but with a random person singing them) but was FAR too loud! We put ourselves as far away from the speaker as possible yet it still felt like we were in it and found it difficult to hear each other.    Activities were put on throughout the day and with some of these the entertainment staff decided to talk through the whole activity on the microphone so if you didn't want to participate it made no difference you were hearing the whole thing anyway (that is if you speak French) for a good half hour at a time.    The entertainment staff seemed to do lots for the kids and there was a separate kids pool also which seemed great for families. The water slides were fun for all and even as a group of adults we all had to have a go beware though there is no system so you may end up with a child's knee in your back. Credit to the majority of them though they were quite good at waiting till the person in front had already gone down but no staff member at the top making sure this was happening. There was a pool guard at the bottom wagging his finger at the adults though when they were breaking the rules and squeezing 4 at a time down the 2 person slide someone had to do it...might as well be us!    All in all we had a great trip and it did us fine for a few days. The rooms were clean and large with good enough facilities but the staff definitely needs to work on their customer service skills.",Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Felsted, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danielle2324

I'll start with the positives -    Nice lobby with plenty of space    Negatives-    WIFI Only in lobby area...what a joke with the technology we have nowadays    POOL Water so cold that you're actually scared to go in    AQUA PARK Absolute rubbish....4 medicore slides for children    POOL GURAD Only saw 1 of them around in 7 days    HEALTH & SAFETY Is poor compared to other hotels I've stayed in    BARS They serve you tea coffee in plastic drinking cups....This something you get from street food let alone in a resort    WASPS & BEES I appreciate they are around in open spaces where food & drinks are being served but this was a joke!!! My son got stung by one of them.    MEDICAL ROOM My son got a little cut in the pool so went to the medical room where there is a nurse sitting by herself in the same sitting position i used to see her everyday with a phone in hand and talking with earphone on.  So asked her if she has a plaster for my son she said she has only one small piece i said can i have another please? Reply was sorry don't have scissors to cut it! I'm like what??? No one has a scissors to cut the plaster....WOW    DINNER ROOM Often cutlery/napkins missing no one around to give you any....worst is whilst you're eating they actually kind of force you to take the plates away and if you make the mistake of moving to get a drink then be prepared your half eaten food is gone.    FOOD Poor choice of food and cheap as hell stuff being served to guests everyday.  I'm cool with that BUT the worst is food shortages and if you ask any of the staff a question they just point blank ignore you.    ROOMS Are okay with a old school TV    FACILITIES IN ROOM No Kettle in roomIron are you serious!!!!    Asked reception for a Kettle to boil water for my baby daughters milk but response was sorry all 3 are out!  So you only have 3 Kettles in the whole resort????    ROOM CLEANING You have to beg the cleaners to clean and change sheets    I'm sure I could've listed so many more negatives but even after a week being back to the UK that i still get so angry with this resort and the staff.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Michelle M wrote a review Apr 2017,50,2nd Visit Better than the firstüòÅ,This was our 2nd visit in 2 years. And I can honestly say we weren't disappointed. Our daughter needed some antihistamine as she come out with heat rash. The onsite nurse contacted a Dr for advice on medication and the reception staff couldn't do enough for us. She had one of the hotel drivers take me to find an open pharmacy which were few seeing as it was a Sunday. They didn't want any money for there help. The food was very tasty and lots to choose from. A bit of advice go at the beginning of meal times to avoid the rush. They have upgraded the hotel restaurant area and now have an Italian kitchen which cooks pasta and pizza fresh with your choice of topping. This area seemed to be a favourite. Rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels every day. No complaints by us.

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,tgnarsi wrote a review Apr 2017,20,Wouldn't go again.,"Have just spent nine nights here and I can honestly say that I won't be going back there. My family and I are quite easily pleased and are not usually complainers but I need to leave a review. We arrived at 11am but couldn't check in until 2pm so were told to get something to eat and drink from the snack bar. When we asked ""where it was"" we were just pointed to the doors. Eventually we found the pool bar and were told snacks were in the other bar at 4pm-5pm - this was sandwichescold pizza and some pastries. You were only allowed one of each item which was put on a plate by a staff member.There was no bottled wateronly plastic cups beside water machines. You were not allowed to fill up plastic bottles with water. A rule we had to ignore as we needed water at night because it was so hot.  Pool bar opens 10am-6pm but we soon discovered pool bar opens when it feels like itnever before 10.30am and closed anytime from 4.30pm. Other bar is then suppossed to open. A waiter told my husband that the bar was allocated 6 bottles of each spirit whiskeyginrum and vodka and when they have gone you have to go without. Bar kept running out. There were a few irate people when this happened early in the evening. Everything is rationed and it's suppossed to be All Inclusive.  The beds were rock hard and the air con didn't work in our room and we visited the reception on 6 seperate occassions each time being told somebody would meet us at the room to fix it. By 8pm and no-one had sorted it dispite the man on reception telling me it was fixedI lost my temper and made him come to the room. He then told me it wasn't working and the next day we moved rooms only to find the shower wasn't working properly.We wasted most of the day waiting for some- one to fix the air con so just made do with the shower. The air con was absolute rubbish. We never had enough towels and were constantly asking for towels as were a lot of people. We had the same hand towels for a week and when we asked the maid to changed themwe were told to change at reception because they were dirty.Everybody I spoke to had complained about something from bedstowelsair con food queues. If only they all wrote a review the hotel might just get its act together.  Meal times were manic. Never enough tables glassescups and about 3 salt pots. Food wasn't all thatthe same every night but we didn't starve. Italian corner was a nightmare and you waited up to 30mins for a pizza. There wasn't enough staff and they certainly worked at their own pace. If you were French at this hotel you got better treatment everywhere.  Entertainment was in the theatre where there is no air con and very hot.Mostly spoke in French. We sat outside in evening where there was live music but they played same songs every night at least twice.  On the plus side the pools and the slides were really nice.The hotel was very clean and nice looking.  This hotel is so disorganised unorganisedchaos.You might have an enjoyable time if you didn't have any problems once you got used to the way and times the staff work at. Unfortunately I didn't come across anyone who didn't have a problem.  There is nowhere to put your luggage to keep it safe and is left in reception area. On our day of departure a tablet was stolen out of one of the bags.",Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tgnarsi
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,Zara T wrote a review Apr 2017,50,No complaints! Please read my review...,Ok so this was was my second stay at this hotel - a week on the 3/4/17-10/4/17. First time I really enjoyed it but this time I absolutely loved it! It has many many bad reviews which is quite sad to read because I don't have 1 fault to state! The staff at reception are absolutely lovely who bent over backwards to help us with things such as trips to printing off our boarding passes! The restaurant.. ok food can be repetitive but is it not at home? I mean how many of us cook different meals every day of the week 3 times a day? the hotel itself was very busy and I cannot fault how well the hotel and staff dealt with and looked after everyone. As for the tax that everyone has to pay it is actually down to the booking people to advise you of this - not the hotel.    We were all inclusive and the drinks flowed nicely in the heat especially around the pool but if you got too hot there was a very special man who would put your parasol up and come and check on you later to move it if needed! Now thats service!    The slides - I'm an adult and loved them!    The adult only pool was boring but of course it would be when you've sat at the other pool with an atmosphere and music.  The pool bar is great and handy but some reason it gets you drunk :/ (bad joke)    Bar staff are so friendly and will give you their right hand if needed! They worked so so hard!    The rooms are spacious - just what you need and are cleaned daily unless you put do not disturb on the door (handy when hungover)    I don't have children but the animation team worked very hard day and night to give parents a break plus the kids loved it and put on an odd show that everyone got involved with.    Evening entertainment - Youssef (Moroccan Ed Sheeran) was AMAZING!!! I have actually asked him to sing at my wedding that I've decided to have in Morocco! He is amazing and just sings so well! I cannot sing his praises enough.    A few of the staff names that I can remember all deserve a massive thank you and you all worked so hard!! Youseff Medhi Ashraf one I nicknamed boss man! thank you again!    We will be seeing you all again in September providing I have annual leave left!    Ladies and gentlemen please please don't be put off by bad reviews as we all know its easy to write bad stuff but no one mentions the good!    Plus this hotel is so clean!!! I couldn't quite believe how clean    Trust me you will all (any age) enjoy this place    Happy holiday and thanks for reading.    happy to answer any questions if I can :)    Zara,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538zarat

Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,talhatmahmood wrote a review Apr 2017,10,Never Again!!!!!!!!,I just got back from our family holiday on Monday 10th April - From the minute we got to our resort to check in we had to pay additional hotel/location taxes of ¬£16 each which we wasnt advised of? Then my child and some what we were hungry from our travels but was told the restaurant was closed. They didn‚Äôt offer any room service or any complimentary snacks as there is no food left in the kitchen I find that very hard to believe! And was told to book a taxi and go out to eat which the nearest place was 20 mins away. So much for all-inclusive (although when we did eat food was not up to standard) or any form of hospitality which ended up costing me more.    After returning and coming back to our room the AC unit wasn‚Äôt working and the room was like a sauna. When calling reception for help they told us that they didn‚Äôt have anyone to look at the AC until the morning and was advised to open the window (so mosquitoes can come a take bites out of us!). we had a very awful first night with our child crying/moaning because of heat. The next day we complained (we were not the only couples do so at the time) and was moved to a new room. However more inconvenience was caused on the third day as we had no water at all and had to use the main lobby toilets eventually a shower later that evening when they managed to fix the problem. Only to have no hot water issues a day later I can somewhat get past having a cold shower but not for my wife or my 2 year old. Overall we feel like we have added more stress rather than feeling relaxed as one should when returning from a holiday.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talhatmahmood
Labranda Targa Club Aqua Parc,dazzafoster75 wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Excellent,"I traveled here on 3rd April for a week as a group of 5 2 adults and 3 kids aged 6 10 & 10. I've stayed in Morocco before (at the sister hotel Les Dunes Door in Agadir). Firstly the hotel is situated close to the airport so transfer was less than half an hour whcih was great after the many queues for passport control (about and hour) and a second bag scan (about an hour) we were more than ready to get to the hotel and start our holiday!    Check in was a doddle and the lady at reception (can't remember her name sorry) was really friendly and although our room wasn't ready as we turned up just before lunchtime we got our wristbands and went for an explore.    Just outside reception is the main pool which has a shallow end great for the smaller kids and goes up to about 1.5 meters in depth. The pool is a good size quite bracing when you 1st get in as it is not heated but it's fine after about 10 seconds or so. This is the area around where most of the daytime entertainment takes place such as fun games darts dancing yoga etc.    Just up from there past the pool bar on your left you can access the water slides these were a great hit with the kids (and adults) and are open from 10:30am to 12:30pm and then from 2:30pm to 5pm (possibly 5:30). There are 2 ""slow slides"" the curly white and yellow ones that are perfect for younger kids and 2 faster ones the blue and orange ones which were great fun.    Just to the right of the slides is another pool with no shallow ends approx 1.5 meters in depth which was the lesser used of all the pools and is situated next to the kiddie pool (with small slides and kiddy buildings) which is next to the kiddy club along with small park (swings trampoline etc). The kids club looked really well run full of activities and all the young ones seemed to be having fun though none of our kids used it.    The main restaurant can be a little chaotic especially if you don't get a table at the 1st sitting it can be a hassle getting clean cutlery and glasses once a table has been used once. The food itself was great with lots of choice each meal time some of the options were repeated such as the lamb tangines but there was always plenty of choice along with the hot plate sections where omlettes or fried eggs were made to order at breakfast or stir fry fresh chicken burgers or fish dishes were made to order at lunch or dinner. The red wine was pretty decent and certainly drinkable at lunch and dinner. I would say that the restaurant staff are overworked and could do with a couple of extra hands to help clean away and re set up the tables. Any delays are not their fault I didn't see a single one dawdling at all just too much to do with too few people.    The cosy all inclusive bar is fine usual beers wine cocktails and soft drinks the barmen were really good with the kids too (maybe because they always tried to order in french) and deserve praise for their hard work especially with some finicky customers. The night time singer (acoustic) was also pretty good and created a nice atmosphere in which to enjoy a few chilled out drinks outside if you didn't fancy the night time entertainment.    The entertainment was held in the main auditorium and was aimed mainly at the kids starting with kids disco then a nightly show performed by various members of the animation team.    The animation team were superb left you alone if you wanted or involved you if you were up for that particular activity. A special shout out to Jimmy Waime Oumaima and the other lady who's name I can't remember. They were all superb.    We didn't use the Spa so can't comment on that nor the quiet pool (which looked very quiet if that's any help).    As others have discussed the rooms are of a good size with a large shower room shower always had hot water and good water pressure. We had a terrace with a small table and 3 chairs. Cleaned daily with fresh towels and bedding so no complaints there at all.    We would definitely come back to this hotel hopefully the management invest in a few extra hands to help out in the restaurant at meal times as that would be my only recommendation.
