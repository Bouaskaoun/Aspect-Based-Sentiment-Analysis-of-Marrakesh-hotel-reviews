Le Meridien N'Fis,SkitheBoat wrote a review Yesterday,20,Disappointing,We stayed here for 1 night. The stay didn’t start off well. I had reserved our room on the Bonvoy app as a Marriott member. I was told at check in the rate was wrong and I was charged twice as much for the room. Irritating but we didn’t have anywhere else to stay and had just arrived tired from a long journey.  The lobby and grounds are well kept and attractive. Our room however was not. It was large but extremely dated. I was shocked that this was the state of the room.    It is a convenient location to the airport and it appeared clean and safe. However I will choose a different property next time.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/809darcih
Le Meridien N'Fis,Bob D wrote a review Mar 24,20,AVOID this hotel,A hotel with so much potential. And such a disappointing front desk staff and concierge. I stayed here five nights. Reception greeted me as if I were another lanyard-wearing group tourist. Reception seems more friendly with each other than with guests. Concierge hides behind a little cage and gives very little if any new information. I had to consult the Internet for better suggestions. Bar staff were fabulous. Housekeeping was inconsistent. Marriott needs to get rid of this property and let them rebrand themselves under Red Roof Inn. A truly nice hotel that could do so much more under new management. Breakfast buffet was large but underwhelming. All food served here was never that appetizing. The upside is the mall across the street with some very good places to eat and people-watch. I would never stay at this place again.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onebigepicurean
Le Meridien N'Fis,Isakka wrote a review Mar 18,20,Good bad mixture,This hotel reminds of marriage. So many good memories with some inconveniences that one has to live by. Amazing location in the heart of Marrakech excellent well trained staff good amenities. The rooms need some face lifting upgrades good up to date renovations and minor fancy touches like a bigger screen TV more furniture as the spaciousness of the rooms with a little furniture gives a feeling of voidness. All in all for the rate they are charging it is a good value for money.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isakka
Le Meridien N'Fis,Psnpsn wrote a review Mar 17,10,"Pretty exterior, ugly interior",Titanium ambassador. But even if I wasn’t I’d still have left. It isn’t that they didn’t meet my Titanium expectations it’s that the hotel just didn’t meet any reasonable expectation. We checked in for 4 nights. Left the morning after the first night. Everyone seems nice but there is just so much you can do with a property that so clearly needs to be renovated- perhaps even razed. The gardens ambience are pretty. We were put in the galleys on the bottom floor. Could hear everything in the hallway. They moved us to same type of tiny decaying room but up on top floor corner so it was at least quiet. Every interaction with the front desk was 30 painfuk minutes because of lines. And add in a protocol of lengthy staff pleasantries where they Astaire at a computer and run around asking each other questions that didn’t solve anything (but still far better than rudeness that also doesn’t solve anything.). The staff were all nice but I quickly realized only one guy knew what he was doing but they were all aware the hotel needs a total face lift. It wasn’t cheap either. We left after the first night booked a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom new Airbnb condo for less money. I’m a loyal hotel guy with my lifetime Titanium status but Marriott has to step it up with local competitors like that. This is a two star hotel on four star grounds charging prices that in a city as affordable as Marrakech approach five star rates. When in Marrakech go AirBnB. I assume Marriott will dump the license they have on this and it will be soon be an Intercontinental- a brand that seems to specialize in big crummy hotels surrounded by lush grounds and numerous pools.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Psnpsn
Le Meridien N'Fis,jessytequila wrote a review Mar 16,10,Avoid it’s a 3 stars old fashion hotel with a poor management,We where there to celebrate my and mom birthday.  5 rooms 10 people  We did call before to have the rooms in the same level and we get an informal approval but we had been spread over the buildings for two of the 5 rooms and after arguing.  Also we ask for an early check in for elder people disabled for one room  was ok but we never had it and we have to wait until 3 pm ( arrived at 12am).  We ask for a late check out when we leave and we got two rooms on five approved and was a nice thing  Unfortunately this hotel have a serious management issues they are people working there trying to do the best they can and some others just dismissed and we cab see that on the attitude  Very nice people on the food and beverage ( manager  maitre d hotel manager etc) giving the best service and making this horrible experience in better way  The lady in charge of the customer relationship it’s just a joke  she knows nothing else than apologizing  The GM I ask to meet as we had a several issues when we get the rooms ( you will see the pictures) was telling me the room given is one of the best and I was showing him the broken toilets in the same time  My daughter has to ask and change two time the room  She find the room not cleaned out ne with personal staff of previous guests  Other room same view on swimming pool and was just in direction of the swimming pool with threes view and personal letter for welcoming somebody else.  This hotel is old and need an urgent refurbishment it’s not a 5 stars more a three stars n’as because the lobby is nice  The swimming pool area was always dirty the workers was putting the music on their personal mobile during the time work and more looking their phone than taking care about customers  management concerns,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ile-de-France, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessytequila
Le Meridien N'Fis,Prichardo wrote a review Mar 13,30,Served it's purpose,Hotel is ideally located for new and old town opposite a great mall with good coffee shops.  Hotel is very tired and really needs bringing into the 21 century rooms where very clean but shabby bathrooms shabby amenities less than average no coffee machine in room for a hotel of this level (they claim) it shook have one. It should be a 3 star at most tbh.  Beds were very comfortable A/C awful locks on patio doors didn't work but were 1 floor up do dent worry to much but use safe.  Staff were ok on service in hotel but slow concierge and hotel reception good.  Breakfast buffet was really good 8/10. Fresh and staff here were v good.  Pool was really nice beds were great but pool service was awful also go to carrefour across the road and buy your own beers as they charge $8 a bottle which is madness when out of the hotel they are $4 max.  As said served it's purpose price was good for what you get I would actually stay again tbh for a couple of nights but this is a heads up what to expect.,Date of stay: March 2023,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londonboy98
Le Meridien N'Fis,John B wrote a review Mar 5,20,Not a representative Le Méridien property.,Convenient is a plus the pool and gardens are beautiful. The rooms are not even a 2.

Le Meridien N'Fis,TOG11 wrote a review Feb 2023,30,A Pretty Good Hotel,The Le Merdian is a pretenious but declining hotel. The public parts of the hotel plus the grounds are outstanding. The rooms are large and clean. But the maintenance in my room left something to be desired. The bathroom door and appeared to be partially eaten by termites and the repainting was definitely subpar. When I arrived the front desk took an excessive amount of time to get connected (I was with a tour group). I needed to exchange money in thst evening. They said that they were out of money but would have it by 8 AM the next morning. Next morning same story. The morning breakfast was large and good.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Arman R wrote a review Jan 2023,30,A disappointing Le Meridien of Marrakesh,We spent new year in the beautiful city of Marrakesh. Le Meridien is in a great location very central to the mall that is located next to the Buddha Bar. The hotel did not stand up to the level of other Le Meridien hotels around the world. I do not think it is 4 stars. It might deserve 3 stars. For example the rooms are old and need to be renovated. The carpets throughout the hotel looked dirty. On the other hand the breakfast that was included was great.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Neck, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArmanR3333

I took my first trip to Morocco without my husband and wasn’t sure how I would manage without my translator/husband. Upon checking into the hotel Youssef Abbajeddi and his excellent English skills helped me immensely.

But actually I was VERY pleasantly surprised with the hotel. As a Marriott Titanium I got upgraded to a suite upon asking the room was very pleasant and well designed. The hotel grounds are superb as pointed out by others and the personnel is super-friendly.    Special thanks to Mr. Abdelhakim (bellman) Mr Abdulilah (concierge) and Ms Aisha from Housekeeping all made our 5-night stay highly enjoyable.

Le Meridien N'Fis,FoCoMom wrote a review Dec 2022,10,Needs renovation - Freezing.,The hotel is in huge need of a renovation. The heater clanked all night and I told the front desk in the morning and ask to look at it. Heater was the same when I came back and no heat. I called the front desk numerous times. Engineering agreed and shut off the noise and brought a space heater that keeps shutting off and no fan. I stayed under the covers calling the front desk multiple times asking for a new room with heat. Finally they brought a blanket. I said that's not sufficient -I'm freezing. Crazy.

Le Meridien N'Fis,WhereSheGos wrote a review Nov 2022,20,Not impressed,As a Marriott elite member I expected a little more attention today. The checkin staff wasn’t super friendly. The bell boy took my luggage and quickly said here’s the pool and took me to my room. There was no explanation from the front desk on amenities or breakfast. No recognition of being Marriott elite. There is no executive lounge. You’ll just get a voucher for a free drink. Good luck getting a bartender to get a drink for you. When initially checking in my room was on a high floor with a large bottle of water and fruit basket. Room seemed clean. I unfortunately had to extend my trip and book another night. Here’s where the issues came up. I was told my room would be ready in 20 minutes. After waiting over an hour I received a room key. I took my luggage up and the room didn’t look like it was ready. No water no bed cover no fruit basket like the day before. I tried to ask the room service woman if this was ready but she only spoke French. Once again I took items downstairs frustrated and asked for a room that was actually ready. The front desk woman told me it was ready and when I said no she made another call. Eventually another 15 min wait and I got a new room. She gave the key to the bell boy and not me nor did she inform me what my new room number was. I followed along and got put on a low floor facing the pool with very dated furnishings. What’s worse is the power socket was hanging and when trying another outlet it ate my convertor. After multiple calls they sent someone from engineering. He spent an hour working on that and moving a desk around. I’m left without a convertor and using the usb cord to charge items. All this hassle and I coulda been put in another room. Called the front desk multiple times with no response or delayed. I asked about my water/fruit 4-5 times and was assured it’s coming. 3 hours later and nothing. I’ve wasted more than half my day in Marrakech moving rooms getting an electrician and praying for a bottle of water. Oh and I finally got a drink ticket only to see no one at the bar for a long time. Once again I had to chase down multiple people just to get a weak cup of coffee in a small cup. The service is extremely lacking here and my experience staying here was frustrating.    The property is large and there are multiple entry points and elevators so leave your room early to make sure you can exit when you planned. There’s a basic pool like any other big chain resort. They have a hairdryer iron bathrobe and slippers in rooms. The rooms are dated and the bar looks like an old smokers lounge. Menara Mall is directly across the street making it convenient to eat at Costa Coffee or Burger King’s rooftop. It’s a 10 min ride to the airport and will cost you 100 dirhams. The hotel has a money exchange next to the front desk for convenience.    Overall not impressed. You can do better Marriott! I’ve never gotten such poor service and lack of attention especially being a Marriott elite. If you don’t care about service dated rooms or love the American all inclusive hotel feel this is for you. A riad is a better experience or other nicer fancy hotels close by.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereSheGos

Service was good though they didn't place room slippers and there is no provision for making coffee in the room. The towels look like could do with a good softener they were rough. One would expect this as a minimum for a 4 to 5 star hotel. The rooms are spread out and the wings have only 4 floor or so so it looks very spacious.    Breakfast buffet has a reasonable choice.

Le Meridien N'Fis,GT2161 wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Room for improvement,The hotel is well located; it is a 15 minute walk to the old town. There is a mall right across the road with a range of fashion/shoe/sportswear outlets and also a Carrefour supermarket. Taxis are always available right outside and it is only about 10 minutes ride from the airport.    The extensive grounds are beautiful and well maintained with palms olive trees and garden areas with many plant species identified on signs. There is a good size pool and plenty of loungers all functional enough but now in need of some refurbishment.    The hotel is certainly dated. However the public areas are all well maintained and clean.  We were upgraded to a suite which again although dated was in good repair and kept very clean. That has made our stay so much nicer and we were very grateful to the management. We did not see any other rooms.    There was a very strong breakfast offering and one could eat inside or on a pleasant outdoor terrace.    In the main the staff were friendly and tried to help. Special mention goes to Youssef and Taoufiq most helpful concierges.    However unlike a true five star hotel the staff never anticipated your needs. Sometimes several requests needed to be made to get matters resolved. Sometimes they did not get resolved at all. We heard frequent complaints from other guests who had expected far more from the Marriott brand. Management need to seek out and listen to this customer feedback and act upon it. Not avoid and ignore. There is a good base to build from if they seek to improve.    That said we greatly enjoyed our stay. With a more customer focus from the management a refresh to some of the tired decor and an injection of Marriott’s service standards in could be truly five star.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GT2161

There is a shopping mall right across the street.    The property is spread out with several buildings to navigate. I found the interior to be dated and somewhat worn.

Le Meridien N'Fis,pbmtl wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Go somewhere else,The worst hotel from the Marriott chain I have been to. This hotel is in terrible condition and in need of major renovation. If only it was old and clean but no. Everything is dirty.    We checked in and were escorted to our room. The corridors look like the one in an old hospital. The carpet in the corridor are dirty and stained if not burnt. There is a strong cigarette smell everywhere in the building. When we got into the room the floor was sticky and the overall impression of the room was just like being in a cheep motel room.    We started to unpack and realised the that bathroom was in terrible condition. Miror dirty rust and dirt at the bottom of the miror. The shower had multiple hairs sticked to the tiles. All crome was rusted. the shower curtain had lipstick all over. The minibar fridge was not closing and was not functionning We had to unplug it to close the interior light. We wanted to get prepared for dinner so we took the ironing board out of the closet. Is was in a terrible condition. We started to iron our shirts and realised it was full of grease. We ruined two shirts. The AC was not functionning.    We went at the pool and no towels were available. The attendant (very nice) went to get some and came back 30 minute later!!! The bar was left unnatended. When the bartender finally came he was rude and clearly didnt want to be there. The glass fence separating the kids and the adult pool was so dirty that we could not see thru. One of the glass panel was broken causing a serious danger to guests.    I went to the reception to tell them about all of this. The lady at the dest was very nice but she told me she could not do anything before she would reach to the manager. We left for dinner. When we got back the offered us to change to a suite in front of our room. The suite was old and worn down as well but at least it was clean. They did nothing about our stained clothes.    I wrote back to the hotel management about my experience and the revenu manager replied to me that they would share my feedback with their staff as a teachable moment!!!    They clearly don't care about their guests.    Oh forgot to say that the gardens are beautiful!,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Montreal, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pbmtl

Le Meridien N'Fis,TheGoatTravels wrote a review Aug 2022,40,"An excellent Hotel, superbly located, with especially lovely staff and a great swimming pool",We really enjoyed our time in Le Meridien - the swimming pool was especially appreciated in the hot summer heat.    The staff are lovely - we had an excellent check-in experience with Ilyas as well as our check-out with Youssef. In particular with the afternoon heat a little overwhelming the Riad Bar allows you to some time to relax in a cool space where you can enjoy some wonderfully warm and kind hospitality from Maria and the team.    The Hotel is very clean throughout and the breakfasts are pretty good with a decent choice. The only small negative is that the Hotel is a little unloved / tired in places but hopefully soon it will get the investment to bring it up to a better standard.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGoatTravels

Le Meridien N'Fis,Marilynn K wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Disappointed,This hotel was a true disappointment. It should not be branded as Le Meridian as these standards would never be accepted elsewhere. The room was very basic nothing luxurious about it at all. Could be compared to a dorm room. No extra amenities such as coffee maker etc. Our room was also infested with mosquitos and the hotel did very little to take care of it. Ended up switching rooms on the last night only to have the same problem. The front desk staff was not overly friendly or helpful.    I’ll give the property credit for its great location and well kept grounds/beautiful gardens throughout.    Overall the place needs a gut renovation or to be rebranded and labeled as a 3 star hotel.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilynnk2017

The hotel itself was lovely the rooms maybe look a bit dated but they were spotless everywhere was so clean. Each day 2 little bottles of water were left in the room which I thought was a nice touch. The breakfast buffet was delicious something for everyone with a fabulous fresh fruit selection pastries omelettes continental pancakes etc. The location was great - across the road from a shopping centre and a few restaurants and about 15/20 min walk to the souks. The pool was a good size also spotless and nice complimentary towels provided. The only negative was that the wifi was terrible everywhere in the hotel but I suppose it's a good excuse to switch off from home!,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leannefitzg

Le Meridien N'Fis,PhineusFlog wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Very Pleasant,Thoroughly enjoyed my 6 night stay at The Meridian. The complex of buildings isn’t new but the age adds to the charm and hominess and it doesn’t have that sterile “I’ve been here before” feel. The spacious gardens in the courtyard are filled with all kinds of plants that give it a botanical garden feel with many different associated scents. It makes you slow down going through it.    For the age it is very well maintained and housekeeping keeps the rooms immaculate. While you don’t have a balcony per se you can open your sliders and sit in the open doorway which is very pleasant if the sun isn’t hitting you.    I had breakfast every morning at the hotel and it was very good with a lot of different choices. The servers and cooks are also very good and attentive. Pro Tip #1: don’t leave your table unattended or the birds will swoop down and either drink your juice pick at your croissant or both.    The pool is very large and if there is one complaint it’s that you get shooed away or are at least made to give your towels back at about 6:30 pm. Not optimal if you’ve been working all day.    The lobby staff were also very helpful. Overall a very pleasant experience and highly recommended.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,Massachusetts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhineusFlog
Le Meridien N'Fis,Hanna Moussa wrote a review Jul 2022,50,"Exceptional hotel, outstanding professional staff and beautiful hotel location.",Le Meridien N’Fis hotel is one of our favorite hotels to stay in when we visit Marrakesh in Morocco. This is a beautiful riyad/palace with amazing well-kept gardens and facilities. The whole hotel is amazing outdoor gardens with various plants including lavender Jasmine and flowering plants spread such a very nice mix of scents that gets your day off on a good foot every morning. The swimming pool is gorgeous and very well kept and has a restaurant with outdoor space both with amazing and professional staff. We also used the Spa services and had exceptional Hammam with full body scrub. Staff provided exceptional service and were very professional and experienced and the facility was very clean and sanitized. Besides the state of the art yet authentic and culturally designed hotel grounds the hotel rooms were very clean and well maintained and housekeeping services were exceptional. Most importantly the hotel staff Is outstanding and took great care of us with very personalized service from the guest relations management and front desk to food services housekeeping and spa as well as hotel restaurants. Especially at the front desk (Imad Lamia Youssef Fatema Zahra Ilyas and Hamza) and the gust service manager Mss. Wassila the food and beverage manager Mr. Akensous Lahcen and Mr. Abdelkhalek the spa manager Mss. Fadwa and the spa staff Mss. Maria Mss. Nadia and Mss. Hasnaa. Everyone there provided exceptional service; we can tell each of them loved their jobs and taking care of their hotel guests.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ojo62 wrote a review Jun 2022,20,Who certified this hotel as a five-star?,I am sure many three-star hotels even some B&B in Marrakech will score better than this overrated hotel. The hotel decor and furniture are dull and dated and the carpets are worn-out and dirty. The reception staff are not welcoming at all; they have no concept of good customer service. I was ignored on two occasions whilst waiting for their assistance.    My allocated room was basic and dark nothing short of a dormitory with a double bed.    Credit where credit is due; most of the hotel staff were friendly welcoming and helpful; the breakfast lounge staff and the manager were exceptionally helpful. Also the house staff particularly those preparing the rooms are committed and helpful.

It’s not a Riad but it’s a great hotel with all the amenities you can hope for. The rooms are slightly dated but are more than sufficient for your stay. As a Marriott Ambassador the service was exceptional and so was the breakfast - a blend of a traditional Moroccan and continental breakfast.    The concierge team was available to help with whatever I needed and they ensured I was extremely comfortable throughout my stay.    A very nice pool area and good gym facilities.

Le Meridien N'Fis,boo_tofu wrote a review May 2022,50,A Sanctuary in the Red City of Marrakesh,It was my first visit to Marrakesh and I had the opportunity to stay in this beautiful hotel while attending a week-long business conference here.    It was a nice change to have the hotel located so near to the airport (less than 10 minutes by car!) and yet be conveniently located nearby to the main attractions in town! There is even a mall located across the street from the hotel which also houses several cafes restaurants and clubs that seems to be really packed in the evenings. There is even a Carrefour Supermarket in the mall in case you need some last minute necessities or snacks.    The hotel is quite wide spread and the building blocks are separated through a huge courtyard that is beautifully landscaped with plants and flowers and a few mini water features and fountains (typical to Moroccan architecture) - it also has a huge pool area that is very welcoming especially in the hot afternoons!    My room came with breakfast and the buffet is well spread with mostly local fare and some pastries. Love the moroccan traditional tea that is served daily here!    The room I was assigned to was well appointed - a bit dated but comfortable. It has a mini balcony which allows one to step outside to enjoy the morning breeze.    As mentioned earlier this hotel is centrally located and is within a hop and a skip away from the many attractions. A short taxi ride leads you to the famed Medina and all it's souks. It is also not too far away from the Koutoubian Mosque which seems to take the central point of attraction for the whole city! Just to share the mall in front of the hotel the Menara Mall has a roof top food court on the top of it's building that offers a breathtaking view of the city and you can even catch flights landing and taking off from the nearby Airport!    But what makes this hotel stay a memorable one is indeed their staff. Mr Yousef the Les Clefs Dor Head Concierge and his team; Ms Wassila of Guest Relations; and almost all the staff I encountered from the reception restaurant and to housekeeping were genuinely friendly and ever so accommodating!    Highly recommended for stays especially with family!

While I preferred maybe a Riad inside the Medina my friends were jealous I was at Le Meridien and I was able to escape the madness. So take your pick. It’s about a 20-min walk or a 5/10 Euro/dollar cab ride depending on how well you bargain.    The rooms are quite nice and have everything you need. The pool area is large and nice. The staff is friendly and the breakfast is good.    The hotel is a little old so it’s no longer luxurious but it’s still quite nice.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Natasha B wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Absolutely fantastic experience,We found this hotel whilst in Marrakech as we had had such a horrible experience at the hotel we had originally booked. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by attentive and friendly staff who couldn't do enough for us.  We were given a double deluxe room with a pool view and it was absolutely fabulous. There were complimentary water bottles fruit bathrobes and roses waiting for us in a beautifully decorated room overlooking the stunning grounds and Atlas Mountains.  The pool area and surrounding landscaped gardens are beautifully maintained and the strobe lighting in the evenings give this hotel a truly special feel. The pool staff couldn't do enough for the guests - there were plenty of towels and sunbeds available and parasols were moved throughout the day to ensure guests were kept comfortable.  The staff at the poolside bar and restaurant were fantastic and a special mention needs to be given to Abdul for being so friendly and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble for him.  The LM Bar offered a warm and inviting ambiance where we enjoyed several drinks and watched the football matches in a really friendly environment.  We tried the restaurant buffet one evening and room service another and the food was divine. Very authentic and fresh. Again the attentiveness of the staff was amazing and we felt really valued and looked after. There was live entertainment as we ate at the buffet and this gave the experience a nice touch. It's such a shame that not many guests take advantage of this dining experience as it really was superb.  The buffet breakfast was good and we were able to eat outside each morning. Again the staff were incredible.  When our flights were delayed we asked if we could stay a little longer and this was accommodated straight away at a very reasonable cost.  We were travelling as a couple looking for a romantic getaway and this hotel offered us everything we wanted. There were several guests travelling as families with children of all ages and whilst there was no entertainment specifically for children this didn't appear to be a problem at all and it was lovely watching the youngsters making new friends and learning about each other's culture.  The receptionist who checked us in was absolutely fantastic and we are truly gutted we didn't catch her name before we had to leave so that we could acknowledge her personally in this review. She was phenomenal and one of the reasons we will be booking again at this hotel next year.  Thank you to all staff for making this a truly wonderful experience. We cannot wait to return next year!

Don't fret about the location! It's super close to Jemma al Fna and tours will happily pick you up from hotel lobby.    The rooms are clean and comfortable.

Le Meridien N'Fis,nldogbert wrote a review Apr 2022,20,"Rooms are poor, not up to Le Meridien standard","I had a one night stay at this property. I was quite skeptical in selecting this property after reading the different reviews and saw that in general is was not the best property. However I was hoping that things would have changed during the last two years of quiet time for the hotel so I took the decision to try it especially as a Bonvoy elite member.    Location  The property is located about 10 mins drive from Menara airport - depending on the time of the day taxi from the airport will differ. I arrived quite late so there was not much barganining nor options for me in the end I managed to get a ride (after leaving the airport and walking towards the area where all taxis will be parked) for 150 MAD. (At the airport some even wanted 300 MAD!). From the hotel back to the airport I managed to get one waiting in front of the hotel for 60 MAD. (I overhead the hotel concierge getting one for 70 MAD for a guest earlier).  Other options are using the bus service - there's 2 the special Airport Shuttle (30 MAD for roundtrip) and the local buses (only 4 MAD one way) which will stop at the Menara shopping mall and from there it's a short walk to the hotel.  From the hotel walking to the old city of Marrakesh is doable about 15-20 mins or with one of the local buses (which stops as per googlemap) in front of the hotel or opposite the shopping mall (along the main street). Following the indication on Googlemaps should be fine (as at times there's no bus stop signage). I found the public transportation to be surprisingly organized in the city and did not mind using it to get to the local attractions.  Around the hotel is the large shopping mall which seems to be the place to be for higher end eateries and shops. Other than that there's a few local shops within walking distance and further afield is the main train station (about 15 mins walk down the boulevard). There seems to be some construction ongoing to beautify a park close to the hotel. The famous Le Mamounia hotel (featured in the Netflix series Inventing Anna) is close by for those interested.      Check In  I arrived at the hotel just after midnight. I was actually surprised to see the lobby area still quite busy. There was 1 person at the only check-in agent working that night infront. It seemed like it was more of some casual chit-chat rather than anything hotel/facilities related. Anyway despite both of them noticed me waiting they continued to chat for another couple of minutes.  As I approached the front desk associate after he completed his talk he was still not really ready to help me and tended to them before again a few mins before I was attended. In my opinion he did not seemed that interested. Anyways during the whole process there as not much interaction at all. Since I was not informed about the room type nor anything else I enquired about upgrade as a Titanium member and I was curtly informed that I was upgraded to a King Executive Deluxe room. I asked indirectly if it was that the only benefits for Titanium members and was curtly told yes and breakfast. With that I was requested for my payment method (with some small technical issues so it did take a bit longer than expected).  All in all the whole check-in process took close to 20 mins. I was just given the key without any further explanation of the hotel facilities nor breakfast hours. I asked about the direction to the room and was just pointed to go left and I'll find it (which was not true as it involved going through some walkways to another building).    Room  The route to the room was actually very beautiful even at night with the beautiful gardens so I was at this point quite optimistic of the property. When I found the right building I still had to take a lift up (the lift was on the small side). The hallway leading to the room was left in a rustic feel which was nice.  Upon entering the room I noticed that this rustic mood was extended. I would say if this was shown to someone who did not know they were staying at a Le Meridien they would have though they landed in some countryside 2-star hotel/motel. I tried to be positive but after further exploration of the room it just became a disspointment. From space point of view it was ok. There was a long cabinet for the TV and a small area with small dining table and chairs. There was a small working desk too.  The balcony door opened up to a French balcony with a view towards the garden. Sleep quality was ok with noise level minimal. The mattras however was at the edge of needing to be replaced. For me I was lucky as it was still cool outside so I could leave the balcony window open to keep the room cold. However during the hot periods this is going to be an issue as reported by many the air conditioning in the room just does not work - it just works in fan mode and that's it. I just turned it off as even at low speed it was quite audible.  Internet speed was ok. There was tea/coffee making facilities in the room and there was a fruit bowl and bottle of water in the room (not sure if this was based on status of because this was an Executive level room). The TV size was ok but quality of the picture (not sure if this is due to reception/TV set) was not the best with a mix of local and international channels. They did try to ""update"" the room with modern items for example there was an additional USB/plug port next to the bed.  The bathroom/toilet area was on the smaller side. Again very tired and in need of some renovation to get it up to standard for a Le Meridien. The toiletries provided was some generic brand ""Bienvenue"" which I did not bother to use. There was only a bathtub with a shower curtain water pressure and temperature was ok. At this stage I did not even wanted to try and see what colour the water was (as reported by one of the reviewer on this issue). What was really dissapointing was the towels - I could not believe my eyes when I saw that it was so used that it was not only not white anymore but it was so used that the sides were fraying. Other than that there were lots of sign of patching here and there to keep things working.  There was a bathrobe provided but looking at the state it was I did not even dare to touch it and I was surprised that it was there. The wardrobe in the room was basically close to falling apart with the very quite disgusting used ironing board.  All in all I really do not know how this can be of any standard of a room under a Le Meridien or even as a Four Points even as a Ibis Budget it would not be up to standard.    Breakfast  The breakfast was served at the main restaurant of the hotel. Again the walking route to the restaurant was beautiful showcasing the local culture. I was greeted friendly at the entrance and table selection was free. The restaurant itself was quite plain and breakfast is served buffet style with some sections where you are served by someone (e.g juices cold cuts cheese etc). Other than that they did have quite a number of hot dishes option.  They even had a small area serving the famous traditional Moroccan mint tea. They had an outside area mainly with live cooking stations - for eggs to order and some traditional Morrocan breakfast bread/dish. On a warmer morning it would have a been a nice area to sit outside as it faced the beautiful gardens of the property.  Service in general in the breakfast service was good and up to standard.    Service  In general after the not so nice experience while checking in I found the morning/day crew to be much more friendlier and helpful.    Overall  All in all this is one of those property that you want to like and return especially with the beautifully decorated public areas of the property and the well kept garden however based on the room state and functions and elite recognition this property just doe not meet the level of being part of any International chain. I am surprised that the Marriott group is fine with their name associated with the property for such low quality being delivered. For the rate I paid it was certainly not worth the value. I really wonder when the promised renovation/upgrade will happen based on what I have read from previous reviews and response from management of the property.",Date of stay: March 2022,,"Eindhoven, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nldogbert
Le Meridien N'Fis,Claire V wrote a review Mar 2022,50,Must stay!,The Le Meridian hotel in Marrakech is a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of the city- while conveniently located only a quick easy and safe 15 min walk to the main square and Médina. Also not far from airport and very close to train station for travel considerations. Though the hotel is very nice- with beautiful Moroccan lamps a lush large garden and beautiful pool and FABULOUS fresh daily breakfast which has something for everyone - what made our stay so wonderful was undeniably the staff. Everyone at the hotel was great but Yousef the Concierge absolutely MADE our trip to Morocco. Yousef is a kind and welcoming man and a wealth of information. He helped guide us through our stay in Marrakech and actually all of Morocco. As president of the country’s concierge association he has an extensive network and helped us plan excursions in the city and beyond. Yousef helped us coordinate a walking food tour cooking class day with a local guide to help explore camel ride and dinner in the Agafay desert— and so much more. When we needed help with COVID tests and other things Yousef was only one call away. Even when we left Marrakech Yousef was a resource to us.

Le Meridien N'Fis,KayakingGirl wrote a review Mar 2022,40,5* service but 3* rooms,The staff make this hotel a great place to stay. Rooms are tired and need refurbishment. This hotel gives the impression that the ownership has not spent money on upgrading for a long time but the management overall is very good. All restaurants were excellent and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  If you like to eat a large breakfast the buffet breakfast is a feast.  Spa facilities are limited but the massage was reasonably priced at 240MAD for 30 minute. Gym is smaller than it looks in the photos (good use of mirrors in the hotel photos) but still adequate.    Nice location about 15 minute walk to Medina but not a very accessible walk the kerb stones on every street are huge!  Good selection of local cafes and restaurants nearby.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Paul R wrote a review Dec 2021,20,No Heat on a Cold Night and other issues,A lifetime Titanium Bonvoy member (31 years/2474 nights). I asked for and received an upgrade to a suite: 240. Minor issues but none important. I checked out after one night telling the desk clerk that I might be back in one hour and to please hold the suite for me just in case. We smiled at each other and exchanged a “fingers crossed” gesture.    No flight. The hotel did not hold my suite and instead assigned me to room 40. It had no heat.    A portable electric heater was brought to room 40. It generated a bit of heat in the coils but the fan would not function. I asked for another room but was told none were available. It was a cold long night interrupted frequently by a pack of barking dogs outside the hotel property.    I requested a late checkout from room 40 the next morning but was told it was not possible. Remember I am a Titanium member and a late checkout is supposed to be guaranteed.    Upon check out at 11:59 a manager came to apologize but it was too late to give me a warm room the night before. He offered a coffee but I had just finished breakfast which was quite good. He asked what he could do and I suggested that he could save me a taxi ride by taking me to the airport and he agreed.    The hotel is like me old and tired and subject to making strange noises as temperatures change and walls and doors move expand and contract. Marriott correctly lists the property as Category 2. Other than a fine lobby and a beautiful pool area It is certainly no better than that.,Date of stay: November 2021,,"Kansas City, Missouri",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulR354
Le Meridien N'Fis,JoeH_LA wrote a review Nov 2021,20,"Beautiful Pool, Not a Five Star Property",I will echo what others have said: this is not a five-star property. Also it’s a little soulless.    The tougher question was whether to give 2 stars or 3 stars here. Although it seems possibly a good value for what you pay I was going to give 3 stars but because I suspect management knows about the shortcomings I am giving 2 stars.    The pros:    Comfortable bed and there were no bed bugs or insects in the room. The water was constant and hot (more on water below). The pool is beautiful and the grounds are beautiful. The breakfast felt a touch institutional but overall strong marks in that category. The housekeeping staff was very good and the room felt refreshed and clean each day. I found the WiFi sufficient and only experienced one significant interruption and one or two instances where it wasn’t strong enough for my video conference (i.e. WiFi sufficient but not five star in this department).    Cons    As others have said the pool is freezing and I wonder a little what good is a pool if you can just look at it? Housekeeping was very strong but perhaps a little inconsistent (some days I had two small water bottles left for me somedays not). The fitness center would be sufficient at an airport hotel in the U.S. but small for the standards of a five star property and in need of an update. When I walked into the room the HVAC was squeaky so I turned it off (fortunately my stay was in November so I didn't need it). On the last full day I went to draw a bath and the water was yellow (see pics). I drained it and ran only cold water and it actually had a bluish tint. Mostly I think something was wrong with the hot water. This was the only bath I drew which made me wonder if I had been showering in that yellow water the days before?    The reason I am giving 2 stars is that I think they are aware of the problems. On checkout at the front desk (FD):    FD: How was your stay?  Me: It was ok I think there's a problem with the water.  FD: Oh it wasn't clear?  Me: Oh so other guests have complained?  FD: Oh no you're the first.  Me: Ok . . .    At this point I start looking at Twitter on my phone waiting for the checkout to be processed for a minute or two and then:    FD: I've called and told them about the water and we can give you a free night off of your bill.  Me: (surprised). Oh ok thank you.    Me: Yeah it was really kinda bad here's what it looked like (and I show photo on my phone).  FD: (Looks at phone). Oh ok.    In case English isn't your first language the nuances of this interchange:  I never said at the beginning that the water was unclear yet somehow the front desk clerk lept to that conclusion while also claiming I was the first person to experience it.  I never asked for a concession. That they gave me a free night was generous and what a five star property ought to do but that they did so before I asked or explained the problem made me feel they are trying to blunt the possibility of bad reviews. And finally if I had handed this photo to a front desk clerk in the U.S. they would have been shocked and called over other people to see. The total lack of surprise of the front desk clerk upon seeing my photo of the yellow water bathtub was telling.    If this were a Protea or a Doubletree possibly I would rate higher but it doesn't deserve to call itself a five star property and get a high rating here.,Date of stay: November 2021,,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeH_LA

That being said we felt this hotel was quite bare for a Le Meridien. We were ""upgraded"" to the highest floor which was a non-smoking floor but the entire floor smelled like cigarette smoke. Our room wasn't as bad but there was still a vague smell. The room also had tile flooring and the bathroom was cramped and minorly stained which made the whole room feel like a Hotel Ibis.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Maher wrote a review Nov 2020,50,Home Sweet Home during pandemic at Le Meridien N’FIS,This was a long stay. Due to relocation. As such I've requested from the Hotel if they can guarantee Breakfast in the room as well some kind of meal ( as the lounge is closed and its long stay and considering the Covid 19 situation. As well as room upgrade.    I was pleased to read from the Ambassador services that the hotel happily accepted my request. I then went ahead with my booking without asking for details. Le Meridien is like my home in Morocco for me since 2106 with many fond memories. therefore I had full trust on the GM Mr. Abdulgahni Hadri and his team.    My arrival day was 14 th August 2020 however due to Covid 19 flight changed to 19th August. I've contacted the Hotel and Imad from front desk got in touch with me and assured me its fine to amend my booking.    He did make the changes and got back to me. an example of highly skilled experienced professional knowledgable guest focus along with his colleagues Mouna Lamia Hatim Yousef El Mahdi Wasila.    The Director of rooms Mr Jamal Khalid is a professional experienced and a kind human. Who takes time to speak to me making sure I am comfortable with my stay and my family.    My check in with Mouna on 14 August 2020 with smooth room was ready as per my request with deep cleaning. High floor was not available but It was blessing in disguised as I like the room I was allocated.    The Hotel seem to be fully prepared with the Covid 19 health and safety guidelines from the entrance and across the property including the employees.    Food and Beverages Director Mr. El hassan associates Tawfick Ahmed Mustafa Sameer Essam Rashed Abdulkaleq AbdulrahimMeriem Layla Gizlan Hasna. chefs Abdulallah Ahmed mustafa Mohamed Abu jouma Kamal Khalid Naima making Mesmen and the last chef specializing in Moroccan food. have gone above and beyond to make sure breakfast snack are served with the highest standard with delicious taste. The team had the time and showed interest in taking of my feedback and they bent backwards to get me some of my favourite food.    I would like also to mention the stewarding professional who I see them working hard to prepare various eating outlets. So it comply with food health and safety.    House Keeping lead by Miss Sabah and her team Fatima Aichi Naima Hasna Mouna Fatima Zahra Salima Hanan Sabah and the males house keeping at night has been extremely professional with attention to details. Keep it our room a safe and healthy place to live in. Some days they did little touches to the room and it made my day week.    Sales team lead by Mr Omar Benjelloun has always been welcoming and willing to give rates that make me as a guest pleased. Not only that whenever he says in the lobby or around the property showed great hospitality.    The Maintenance/Engineering team spot on with response with any issue in the room TV phone or light. In fact an associate name Abdul Rahim made my stay memorable one as he fix the very bright bed side lamp in a creative way and that what you call champion.    The Concierge at Le Meridien Lead by Chief Concierge Youssef who is extremely professional caring knowledgeable not only that. He actually  In many occasion advised and helped remotely. In Particular with relocation this time time around. His great Services would not be completed without the Professional  human experienced personal of Taoufiq Said El Balaghi Abdelhadi Bouiaabou Rachid Chaoqui Abdelilah Mustapha Amine.    IT represented by Mr Ayoub. A young energetic  professional problem solver. He is there to help with any IT issue. He helped fix a problem with my Mac book.    The SPA team Lead by Fadwa are always professional caring accommodating. Noor Maria Nadia and the pool guard Talal.    The ladies at telephone exchange always professional and help with directing any queries to the right personal as well as making sure any issue reported in the room is dealt with efficiently.    The security team lead by Zakria are equally professional friendly and keep this vast property safe for us guest to enjoy.    The gardening staff are also professional Friendly I see them early morning. Keeping up the beautiful unique garden in good shape.    I would like to take this opportunity to say a big thank you to the Le meridien N’FIS.    As well know most hotels around the world were either closed or run a small operations with limited outlets benefits etc.    however The management and associates of Le Meridien N’FIS. Has provided same service standard I would Expect pre-COVID 19.    Not only that the staff has remained composed and professional upon my arrival on 14th August 2020 despite Marrakech was not open for local or international visitors since March 2020.    This meant low occupancy but this did not stop them from providing a Genuine First class hospitality with a smile in their face. Even if things gone wrong they did it better next time around. Open for feedback from GM ( I would like to briefly mention Mr Mustafa Aloui who recently joined Le Meridien N’FIS management team.

Le Meridien N'Fis,mdemo wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Could be great,Having read the mainly poor reviews we had low expectations. If you can get a good deal it does the trick but if paying rates as some have suggested is just crazy.    The good  Helpful staff with good English ( we do speak french)  Good breakfast but atmosphere like a school canteen  Excellent location  Good elite recognition ( free breakfast and drinks vouchers nightly)  Grounds and pool are lovely    The bad  Rooms are completely outdated  Bathroom was dangerous as to use the shower you had to step in and out of a high bath tiles falling off shower head loose ( luckily we were upgraded to a suite next day which was much better)  Management poor this is indicative of generic replies the management post obviously not even bothering to read the content of the poor reviews. A recent poster made this point as well.  Restaurants were empty ( to be fair why eat in a 3 star hotel when Marrakech has so many fabulous offerings.    In a nutshell the hotel has the potential to be a great resort/city break venue but they seriously need to renovate rooms and common parts. I hope Marriott will inspect this hotel and enforce required standards.

Le Meridien N'Fis,pacifist206 wrote a review Mar 2020,20,Ibis quality masquerading as a Marriott,"If you look at the response to any reviews on TripAdvisor this hotel always gives the same standard template message. This is whether you have a rat in your room or if the ceiling is falling down on your head. No person takes ownership in the template language so it is a generic ""management"". That in itself should be an indication that they have no interest in making improvements but feel obligated to pretend like they are!    Location is spectacular but the property is absolutely exhausted if not dilapidated in places. Given their location they are probably booked heavily by tour companies so they perhaps don't feel the compelling need to make changes. What surprises me is that Marriott is letting them get away with this because it tarnishes the Marriott Brand and even the Le Meridian Brand. (For comparison see my review on Le Meridian New Delhi where I stayed last December).    The shower head holder was broken the tiles in the bathroom were chipped and the lights in the room had fused bulbs. Every time I tried to see someone I was told the front desk person was away for an hour. This was whether I needed change or whether I wanted to complain about the fused light bulb.    The door did not shut properly when I left the room. Fortunately no one had walked in and taken my computer or anything. So good on that front. I just had to be careful moving forward.    The breakfast was pretty decent however the coffee machines did not work on two of the three days I was there. The omelette station and fresh flat bread station were amazing. Some of the fruit (not sure if it was a papaya or something else) was raw.    From the crowds at breakfast it is clear the place has plenty of guests so Marriott probably does not give a rip!

The staff are just wonderful and were helpful at all times. As a platinum member we were recognised as regular customers which is always lovely! We were invited to the exec lounge and the gentleman who works in there was just so service minded - it was a delight to go in there. Rooms are comfortable but as it is an older property - it does feel a little dated - however this does not take away from the comfort - the black out curtains are great - all hotels should have them :) and the bed - though firm was not uncomfortably hard. It is really relaxing around the pool - water very cold though so maybe better for swimming in hotter months. There are loads of sun beds - so great to not have to fight/try beat the crowds for them. We had two lovely dinners - the Moroccan restaurant and the bbq grill at the pool - both very nicely done. Breakfast has lots of choice and especially enjoyed the anchovies.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ian S wrote a review Feb 2020,30,A bit of a disappointment,5 Star. Not really. Felt very much like a corporate venue and although the staff were all pleasant and accommodating it didn’t have the warmth of welcome we have had elsewhere. Nice gardens. Had to insist on viewing three different rooms before we were offered one that satisfied our requirements of a quiet garden view. First offered was adjacent to pool and no sun. Second was on the other side of pool overlooking workmen relaying a patio area. Third time we found a ground floor room that had an outside seating area with table and two chairs. Beware here most of the rooms do not have balconies only sliding windows. Of the advertised restaurants only one was open. Again not quite as advertised. However the one that was open and serving Moroccan food was excellent and inexpensive. Special mention to the restaurant staff we ordered a special lamb joint for two and it was excellent. The breakfast dining was a bit disorganised and chaotic but there was plenty of choice. The bellboys were great ordering taxis no problem and stipulating in advance what the fare should be.

This was the worst mistake I made first we get there and we are treated like crap there isn’t even an offer to assist us with our bags. We leave for our tour and get back that evening to a room that has no heat they send someone to fix it they tell us it will be working within an hour so we step out when we return there is a portable heater in the room ( A PORTABLE HEATER ) did I mention I’m traveling with my two year old they didn’t even offer to change rooms they just put it there. The property is old and disgusting it feels like a motel I’m really surprised that this is a Marriott property. The service is terrible no one does anything they couldn’t even warm up food for my daughter - room service answer was we don’t warm up food but we have food no thank you we tasted the food at breakfast and it was terrible.

It was good value and adequate for us but I would be disappointed if I stayed here for a special weekend away. The resort is looking very tired (though they seem to be slowly upgrading). Staff were friendly but not really that well informed and the food was ‘ok’ but nothing special.  Probably the most annoying part was that the WiFi in the room was useless. I had to sit in reception to get a signal for emails.  I think Marriott may be investing in upgrades which would be good as it’s a great location and has potential but for now it’s just a ‘pit stop’ and not a key part of any break.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfreeb4ugo

In fact as we checked out in the morning there was a very long line of at least 10 deep. 3 or 4 other people were working the desk and not serving anybody but they suggested that the one gentleman was the only one who could do checkouts. I was charged for items in the minibar that we didn't use. They confirmed it was a mistake but it just took too long to correct so I just paid it. The location is good but it's run poorly and as mentioned the rooms are in desperate need of a makeover. Very old and dingy.

Le Meridien N'Fis,PhilipS132013 wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Great Short Break!,My wife and I enjoyed a short break at Le Meridien and cannot speak highly enough of the staff. They are totally dedicated and did everything they could to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The Chief Concierge Youssef Mamouni was outstanding! He organised a trip in a hot air balloon for us which turned out to be truly memorable. If anyone reading this who plans to stay for a few days it is definitely worth it! To watch the sunrise over the Atlas Mountains was a once in a lifetime experience. The company is reputable and the equipment and safety procedures are of the highest standard. The pilot was an examiner and at the top of his profession so we had total confidence in him.  Youssef also organised a road trip to the Atlas Mountains with Mohamed El Mouwahidi. Again it was superb! Mohamed's driving was impeccable and his vehicle (4x4 Land Cruiser) was in tiptop condition. He took us to 3 valleys (0930 - 1830) and explained everything along the way as well as Moroccan culture which one often misses out on during short breaks. We stopped at the Ourika Garden restaurant for lunch which was excellent and we felt truly spoilt. Again - a truly memorable trip and we did not feel ripped off in any way unlike some of the other areas within the Souks. Keep a tight grip on your wallets and do not go with anyone who says they will show you the way. No matter how friendly they appear they will eventually demand money as we found out to our cost!  The hotel could definitely do with a major makeover but the gardens and pool looked beautiful and were well tended. The breakfast was fine and there was plenty of choice. Wassaile (spelling probably incorrect) the lady who worked on the lobby desk and in the restaurant as the maitre d' was so friendly and also took a great interest to ensure that we had everything we required. In the end we tended to overlook the tired furnishings because the service was of such a high standard.,Date of stay: January 2020,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipS132013
Le Meridien N'Fis,Josh C wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Reliable but underwhelming,We were traveling as a couple (22m/f) from the 7-9th of January. We paid £228 for the ‘Executive Guest room 1 king with garden view. Room 242. I will attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of what to expect.    We were silly and didn’t pre-sort a taxi to the hotel and ended up paying 100MAD from the taxi rank outside departures. On the return the lobby staff sorted a taxi for 50MAD to give a rough estimate of the expected price. It takes about 10-15 minutes probably not a reasonable walking distance for most.    We arrived a few hours early (1pm) for check-in (3pm) but fortunately the room was already made and they allowed us to go in early. The check in process was fast informative and professional. You are offered complimentary decent WiFi on arrival. The bellboys then take you to your room we only had travel bags that we carried ourselves but I saw them carrying suitcases etc for others if requested.    First impression of the rooms would be nice but minimal. It’s was very clean but as other comments have mentioned has a bit of a tired/outdated feel. There wasn’t anything wrong per-say?? however compared to other 5 star accommodations it was a little lacklustre. It was missing a lot of finer details (kettle sewing kit toiletries etc).That being said it did appear that other accommodations in the area weren’t too great so in comparison it was undoubtedly a good place to stay.    The room contained a bed large wardrobe containing a free safe set of table and chairs bed side tables chest of drawers as well as a mounted TV with a large table beneath. There was a paid mini fridge which had expensive prices. Attached was an en suite bathroom containing a toilet and bidet sink and shower/bath.    The king size bed was VERY comfortable enough pillows and cover providing very good nights sleep. There was plenty of space to store all items even if you were staying for a prolonged period of time. The chairs are comfy and we sat for a while to play cards/board games.    The shower was the bathroom highlight powerful with good working heat options. As a massive bath fan I really enjoyed this feature but maybe a little small for bigger guests.    The hotel has an overall welcoming feel with lots of staff available at all hours to meet requests and keep things running. The grounds are quite aesthetic and feels perfectly safe/secure with guards and sufficient lighting which is appreciated for Marrakesh. While we didn’t use the pool there is a nice unheated pool that would be good for warmer months with plenty of chairs and loungers dotted about.    The hotel contains a spa fitness room and business suites. Oddly I didn’t see any prices either online or in the hotel for any of these. I even went to the spa to see what was on offer and there’s not even a ‘menu’ which is rather odd.    Our stay included free buffet breakfast served from 6-10:30. As others have said it’s very good! The prices for non inclusive breakfast however are astronomical so ensure you get it included! There is a large selection of fresh fruits (strawberry mango peach orange kiwi and a few others). A daily rotating pastry section : breads every morning pain au chocolate one croissants the other. A heated section including kofta patties beef sausage potato croquets scrambled egg boiled egg and an assortment of fried vegetables. There’s an omelette station outside providing orders free of charge including tomato mushroom cheese ham and onion as well as an assortment of herbs/spices. Standard fruit juice and hot drinks are available too. Overall very tasty very worth the addition and will set you up well for the day.    The location is very useful in my opinion. It’s one of the nicer areas in Marrakesh surrounded by other hotels. Opposite the hotel is a large mall with plenty of supermarkets (?)and eateries providing all you need to survive on your doorstep. In general it is around a 20 minute walk to a majority of the major sites (Koutoubia palaces smaller gardens main Médina). The Jardin Majorelle and Yves Saint Laurent museum was a 15 minute 70MAD taxi ride most likely an hour+ walk.    Overall I would recommend it for both the location and the accommodation. I would consider it a safe bet for international travellers. However perhaps due to the geographic region it is a rather lacklustre 5star. I would compare it to many 3/4s I’ve stayed at in more ‘classic’ travel areas.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshcole2504

Dark and uncomfortable room unclean hallwayspaper thin walls so noisy environ in room. It was abnormally warm and so I tried using the AC but it did not work. It took 5 conversations with the staff and 2 service calls with maintenance before a manager finally admitted they turn the AC off in the entire hotel this time of year. Why don't they just say that up front. Breakfast was another story-it was an unorganized display of different foods you had to hunt for silverware and what drove alot of people crazy were the auto coffee machines that were either out of service 9 with no signs indicating same) or dispensed the wrong beverage-like hot chocolate instead of coffee.

Le Meridien N'Fis,NimNada wrote a review Dec 2019,20,Very very dated,Bonvoy members you need to lower your expectations if you are staying here. The hotel is very dated and the last upgrade was in 1999/2000 (20 years ago!)    The property is JUST recently become Marriott so it’s missing that magical touch.    Everything is old. The towels the walls the beds the bathrooms heating /cooling system etc.    They only have 11 suites and the rest of the rooms all look the same.    The photos on all the sites are from the hotels hay days where it was young and beautiful.    I must say the pool deck and out door facilities are beautiful.    I heard one lady from North America scream at a poor house keeping person saying it’s lower than a motel in the US but it’s not the staff’s fault people!! They work there and do their best to give you a 100% experience with what they have. Please don’t abuse the people!    Imad at reception and Toufek at concierge are the most amazing people! The hotel is full of good heart.    Feedback to Bonvoy you need to let platinum/titanium guests know that an upgrade is coming.    The price is high because it’s across from the mall in the middle of the old city and new city and walking distance to some very nice restaurants!    If you want to change money to smaller bills (Dhs) ask the front desk in the morning ... or ... go to the Carrfeur grocery store in the mall and buy something small.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Matt F wrote a review Dec 2019,20,Not a 5 star in my opinion.,I was here for 4 nights this past week. Like some of the other reviews i can concur that the rooms are very tired and worn. I stayed for 2 nights on a bottom floor with an outside view and then switched to a 3rd floor interior view. If you’re a “lite” sleeper don’t stay on the ground floor or with an outside(non courtyard” view. It’s just too damn loud. You have motor-cycles going by at all hours and dogs barking on the outside of the property. If you get a low level floor you run the risk of people above you moving the heavy furniture table and chairs at late hours.  The WiFi in the both of my rooms was horrible. I would go down to the pool or lobby and it was fine. My two co-workers reported the same. It’s really really bad. The hotel grounds are kept up very nice and all the employees would accommodating.  The breakfast in the morning was probably one of the worst I’ve seen in long time. The selections are few and quality is low.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Kabukijuul wrote a review Dec 2019,30,"Ok, but dated","We stayed here primarily because it was a Marriott hotel and I needed to fit in stays to maintain my status. I wish however that we had stayed in a Riad in the Medina. I think that this hotel perhaps colored my perception of Marrakech which I did not like. The hotel is very dated and needs a renovation. It was however clean.    The front desk made a big deal that we were ""upgraded"" but I can't tell to what...the room looked exactly like what I booked. It was comfortable enough but lacked any sort of personality.    With the exception of excellent orange juice the breakfast was just ok...the made to order eggs finally appeared on our last day. The entire dining room reminded me of a college cafeteria instead of a restaurant at an upscale resort. We chose to eat all meals except breakfast outside of the hotel.    The hotel was a bit too far to walk to the Medina without exhausting yourself before you got there. Every time we took a taxi we got ripped off. We did better than most paying around $5 for a ride most places. However I did not see a taxi with a ""working meter"" once during our time in Marrakech. I am sure that they worked for the locals lol! I think that if we had stayed inside the Medina it wouldn't have been such a production to go anywhere and we might have enjoyed our time more.",Date of stay: November 2019,,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kabukijuul
Le Meridien N'Fis,Laiza wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Le Meridien Marrakech,The service was great. Concierge Yousseff went above and beyond to make sure we had a pleasant stay. I was celebrating my birthday and they made sure I felt special. They put rose petals on our bed along with two towel shaped swans. Petals in the bathroom also. They brought me a birthday cake and gave us drink vouchers to the hotel bar.    The outdoor area of the hotel is beautiful. We didn’t get to use the outdoor amenities though because it was cold.    The bedroom and bathroom are outdated. Small shower tub. The water pressure was weak. The AC in the bedroom didn’t work.    Breakfast buffet was okay. Nothing elaborate. The Moroccan pancakes were good as well as the tea.    Location was great- relatively “far” from the craziness of Médina and right across from Ménara Mall which had decent food options.    Spa Experience- my husband and I got massages. The massage was relaxing and probably one of the best massages I ever had until I had my boobs massaged. I was so shocked. It felt so uncomfortable. Wish the masseuse would have explained to me what a typical Moroccan massage included or what areas i would like to have massaged. This ruined my massage experience. The massage table was very uncomfortable too. I would not recommend it.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lscm88

Someone had cut their hair and had left chunks on the floor & on the pillows which is absolutely disgusting!!  There were no tea/coffee facilities which is quite poor as most people would like a tea/coffee after travelling. The food in the restaurant was quite average and all three coffee machines didn’t work properly - when you would select one type of coffee it would pour you a different type.

It has one King Bed room and another with two double beds. Both bed rooms come with their own spacious bathrooms with shower tub toilet and bidget. There is also a hafl bath at the entrance. There are two separate living rooms a bar and dining room.  It has it's own private terrce space with covered gazibo dining for six longe seating and sun loungers.  It is probably 1500 sft indoor space and another 1500+ SFT outdoor for a total of 3000+ sft.  The interior décor is Moroccan theme.  Had a fruit and treats plate to welcome us.  The view from the suite and balcony covers pool city and gardens.    Breakfast is a nice spread with outdoor or indoor seating.  Outdoor egg bread and mint tea stations.  Juices and some Moroccan dishes.    All the staff is very friedly and helpful.    There is a small spa and a small but decent gym.  There are 3-4 onsite restarents.  The pool is beautiful and lots of chairs and gazibos.    There are some fountains and the night time illumination of fountains and pool is beautiful.  Several onsite orange pomogranate lime and olive trees.    There is a mall right across the street with about 20 different restaurants.    Only about 5 minute taxi ride away from Medina and costs 40dh for taxi.  About 10 minutes from airport.

The amazing gardens were between the lobby/restaurant/lounge area and the building with our rooms. My room was large with a king sized bed table and chairs and a nice bathroom. It was clean and comfortable. I had a a view from my small balcony of the gardens. It was a fairly easy walk to some of the nice restaurants in Marrakech. Taxis were about $10 to the Medina. It is also possible to walk there. The mall across the street is another option for meals. The entire staff was very nice and accommodating. The buffet breakfast gave enough choices including omelettes to get all of us ready to go in the mornings.

We had a few maintenance issues with the decor and heating but when brought to the attention of management these were quickly corrected. I give this hotel an excellent rating in the context of Morocco where almost all hotels are great when new but very poorly maintained. Méridien NFis has modernized some rooms but thankfully not overly redone the decor. In our room warm turquoise tones offset the dark Art Deco style furniture. Wide choice of items for breakfast.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Gordon C wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Slightly Tired But Elegant Moroccan Hotel,Because of Marriott's interesting Bonvoy booking and check in system when we turned up to the hotel they had no record of our reservation even though I'd checked in on their app. The staff were baffled but friendly and helpful.    The following morning we took advantage of the hotel's beautiful pool to enjoy the lovely 24-degree November sunshine. The pool was quiet. There was a faint smell of wood fire in the air from the local area that was augmented by the wood-fired grill the poolside cafe. Even though the sun was out it felt Autumnal in a very Moroccan sort of way.    The hotel was probably built 30 years ago and some elements of it are looking a little tired but it is charming and retains a distinctly local feel with the beautiful grounds and furnishings.    The staff are helpful friendly and eager to please and the hotel is conveniently located just 10 mins drive from the airport and across the road from the Menara Mall.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Shelley-bel wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Good location,I’m not gonna lie I was very concerned about staying here after reading some of the bad reviews. But glad I went with my experience of the Marriott hotels and decided to ignore the bad reviews. Now I’m the sort of person who likes to moan if things ain’t right. But I really couldn’t find anything to actually moan about this hotel. I was very pleased I stayed here I was very pleased with the service and staff and overall experience. Defo would stay again. Hotel is 10mins drive from MAK transfer costs (approx. MAD150 for 2adults). Location is perfect! The hotel is centrally located. Right opposite the Manera Mall which has lots of shops for window shopping and great entertainment for children on the 3rd floor the whole floor has every arcade game amusement bumpercars ice skating and lots more to keep them entertained. There’s a Chilis (American food) restaurant opposite which we found the food great and reasonably priced. Also opposite hotel is a Paul’s patisserie and a restaurant called Nadab which was also nice food. Anyway back to the hotel. I’m a gold Elite member and booked 3 nights with points which doesn’t include breakfast so I was expecting to pay MAD200 per person for 3 days but was pleasantly surprised when they said they upgraded our room and then said that they would include breakfast complimentary (I was waiting for a catch) but there was none. I thought it would just be continental but it was full breakfast; which includes a large variety of the normal hot stuff plus Omelettes to order and fresh crumpets and bread made by the lovely ladies outside. When we got to our room we were welcomed with a vase of freshly cut roses and a medium fresh fruit bowl with complimentary waters. The room and hotel was just like the pictures the service and staff very nice and accommodating the room as expected with all the normal amenities towels bathrobes and slippers safe mini bar (not free) but still enough space in fridge to store own drinks. Lots of toiletries bidet iron an extremely large bed (could easily fit 2adults and 2small children. Lots of storage and what I always struggle to find in most hotels nowadays in the bathroom lots of hooks to hang things on and a clothes line to dry stuff on. We were on the ground floor which had a private patio area with tables and chairs could have done with a couple sun loungers (im sure if I asked they would have brought them).The room and hotel is clean tidy spacious and the gardens are beautifully kept. The front door has a dead bolt and also security chain so felt very safe. We didn’t need to use the aircon so I can’t comment on that. The internet all over hotel was good and the Tv had enough channels to entertain my husband. The pool was a little cold so didn’t go in.  There was a little noise from traffic outside and the aeroplanes going by but nothing major.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shelley-bel

Don’t have much of a say when it comes to hotel bookings for business trips.  Service is very slow and none of the staff seem to know what to do or when to do something. Breakfast well below average. Rooms very outdated and the noise levels from outside (road and corridor) are immense (!!). Can’t stop sneezing for the first 20mins every time I re-enter the room and feel like it’s because of dust or some other allergy to something I don’t normally have. There’s a long list... and I get the same feedback from colleagues too.  The location is alright to be fair (20-25mins walk to anything good) and that’s probably only why i gave it a 2/5. The nicest people from the hotel seem to be the security guys with the dogs who are out by the front gate. They helped colleagues and myself twice with taxi drivers who seem to charge whatever they feel like on the spot.

Le Meridien N'Fis,MioCat wrote a review Nov 2019,30,"Definitely not even a 4-star hotel, less 5",The location was great: away from noise but close enough to the medina. The ambiance is very quiet which is a matter of taste if you want a place with a lively atmosphere then this is no for you.  The ground floor and the pool are very beautiful clean with a very nice decor but the rooms are day and night difference. These rooms are beyond old worn out and in need of intense restoration. I got to see two rooms because I reserved one with a pool view and got one with a dead-end back wall so I went back to the reception area to have it corrected and they gave me what I reserved: a room with pool view. Beware they make make these type of mistake to their own convenience. Both rooms were old and shabby with stained courtains.  The breakfast was the same everyday which was not a big deal to me but what I didnt like is that the coffee was instant coffee from a machine and not freshly made; no fresh made option available.  Another reason to deduct stars is that the internet was super slow so slow that you cannot use a remote login if you need to login for work. Luckily I had my own internet so I didnt have to rely in the hotel's.  The towels were crunchy they felt like toasted bread which is not bad if you want to use them as a body scrub. Bring your own towels if you want soft fluffy ones.  When I arrived Marrakech I found out there are much better options for the price I paid here again my opinion is conditioned to their decayed rooms super slow internet and never-changing breakfast wtihout the option of fresh made coffee . Also if you are a tea drinker there is no kettle to heat water in the rooms like in other hotels.  In conclusion for the money you pay here you can get a much better room much better breakfast ambiance and service somewhere else. This is a three stars hotel it does not measure up to four less five stars. Just because the lobby and the pool are beautiful it doesn't mean it should be a five star hotel.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Yonkers, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miocat7

No offer of help with luggage when we could have used it dragging bags up the stairs but once at the check-in desk and we didn't need help staff were insistent on helping.

There was a welcome reception for Bonvoy members while we were there which was nice and bumps them up from 1 star to 2. Rooms were dated but clean. The AC was intermittent especially at night and couldn't keep the room cool overnight. There was smoking everywhere in the hotel and the entire hotel reeked of smoke which shouldn't be the case with an international hotel.

I complained and the helpfull staff did give me another better room. Better but not by large. Still stains in the curtains lower part of the bed etc. Sound proofing is mediocre but since it was a room on the quiet side not to much of an issue. But you will hear everything in the hallway. Internet is free and the wifi connection good but anything but fast. However that maybe a problem everywhere in Marroco.

There was no knock nor did the person say who the were. Since I was standing near the door we opened it and to our surprise no one was there. My first thought was housekeeping but there was no housekeeper in sight and no large housekeeping cart visible. Now typically housekeeping will knock. As travelers we know this to be standard. So common sense tells me someone was trying to come in to steal something. There are 10 of us and this happened to three other rooms (one room on a different floor) in our group. One room had the inside lock on but one individual did not and two men came in but quickly left. When this was brought to the attention of hotel staff at the front desk by one person they were told it was someone coming to check the mini bar. Now anyone reading this can choose to believe this or not. However that’s a bunch of crap.

Cons: by far the customer service (outside of the man working by the pool to deliver towels who was fabulous) was horrendous. At check in we were given vouchers for a free drink in the lobby bar. The bar was empty and when the bartender saw we had vouchers he ignored us. Finally when we placed a 50 Dirham bill on top of the voucher he got us a drink 😒. My son fell ill and we decided to stay an extra night. I went to the front desk and was told it was impossible - they were fully booked. I was devastated and scrambled to find a hotel nearby to move us to and lo and behold in my searches found a room online in the hotel. I booked it went back to the same front desk clerk and she just said ‘yes I see you now have a room’.

This is not a 5 Star property. This hotel is in DESPERATE need of a full RENOVATION!!!    My husband and I a Marriott Platuim members and travel all over the world. This Marriott is the worst I have ever stayed in. I have stayed in courtyard hotels that were nicer then this hotel.    The staff were friendly and nice. I was very offended when the complimentary fruit tray was sent to our room. The bananas were rotten and not fresh. Shame on you Marrakech Merdian Marriott!!!    P.S. The bath towels are very hard and needs replacing. There were no wash cloths in my room.    The pool are looked nice. But I was too busy to use the pool.

Everyone was very nice and friendly specially Youseff who helped and accommodated us from the moment we stepped into the check in area.  The hotel has nice areas a gorgeous pool good breakfast with the nice touch of having someone with a morrocan outfit serving mint tea.  The rooms are spacious and very clean. My only but will be: the AC wasn’t working properly and the WiFi terrible but since we spend most of our time outside it didn’t bother us.  It is located 30 min from the Jemma el fna square and just across the street the Ménara shopping mall with a good selection of restaurants.

I generally enjoyed my stay at this hotel for three nights. It is in walking distance for many places and across the street is a nice mall and group of restaurants. It is a modern looking hotel with most amenities one might need. The bathroom was clean and very satisfactory for my needs. The air conditioning system was noisy and not super efficient. It was not as cool as I would have liked until early in the morning. The front desk staff was friendly and offered good advice when needed The breakfast buffet was okay but definitely not spectacular.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Dr_WellTraveled wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Among The Finest Hotels In Marrakech!,Wow what a lovely property! Frankly it was the high point in our month-long driving trip through Spain Portugal and Morocco.    The Le Meridien has a well-established reputation as one of the finest places to stay in Marrakech – and it definitely is. My wife and I are seasoned world travelers and Platinum Elite members. We stayed for five nights on points at this marvelous resort hotel and couldn't have been more pleased.    The hotel is a very well maintained mature property with a full array of services. There are several quality restaurants room service a nice indoor bar and lounge -- as well as an outdoor bar with food service next to the pool area. There is also a workout room and a private spa with massage services. The beautiful courtyard garden is quite impressive and candidly it rivals other famous gardens in the city.    The friendly and attentive staff are readily available and most speak some English. We found the bellman Saaid to be particularly helpful during our stay. He arranged taxi transportation for us on several occasions and always informed us of the modest agreed upon fare.    We rarely dine at hotels however the food and beverages were consistently top drawer. We ate three meals at the Moroccan restaurant and enjoyed a variety of authentic and well-prepared dishes. Dinning indoors or outdoors was just lovely.    Breakfast was included with our stay and offered an array of interesting hand made breads several fresh juices a virtual smorgasbord of fresh fruits sliced meats and cheeses. The omelet station was a personal favorite and the chef would make it to order. The adjacent stations had a man making fresh mint tea and a woman making fresh flat bread and local items.    Several coffee and cappuccino machines were scattered about the dining area. We enjoyed our breakfast on the patio while overlooking the splendid courtyard garden. The entire breakfast experience was a sumptuous affair and quite indulgent.    The concierge staff are true professionals with impressive credentials are well traveled and speak multiple languages fluently. We found their assistance to be exceptionally helpful. Currency exchange is also available at a reasonable rate.    Just across the street is a convenient and attractive mall with several casual bistros novelty food stands and a well-stocked supermarket. The mall really comes alive after sunset and attracts many seeking an active nightlife.    Our experience at the Le Meridien was simply marvelous. We felt quite pampered throughout our stay. While in town we visited a couple other noted properties just out of curiosity. However for location quality of services and attention to our needs we believe Le Meridien offers remarkable hospitality. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Florence, Oregon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dr_WellTraveled

Le Meridien N'Fis,Mark P wrote a review Sep 2019,20,Avoid this Dump,How in Gods name does this place have a 4 star rating. No disrespect but the people that are giving a 4 star rating either have low standards or don’t really know what qualities of a good hotel are. I am a life time Marriott member. I have been around the world staying in Marriott’s for over twenty years. Booked this hotel for 3 nights and only stayed one night. It was so bad I had to change hotels. First of all the staff is very nice. They do the best they can. Very friend and the service is great. Location is excellent. Across from some restaurants and a mall. The Pool probably attracts most families. People are complaining about smoking. The bar and a few other spots you can smoke. After all your in Morocco. The air conditioning in my room and my travel companions room was less than adequate to cool the room down. Very uncomfortable considering it was 95 degrees out. The internet was totally unreliable. It would take over a minute to load a page. Streaming a movie was impossible. Just could not do it. This hotel is severely out dated and run down. You can’t keep putting lip stick on a pig forever. It’s pretty obvious that Marriott did not put a dime in this property when they acquired it a few years ago.  SHAME ON MARRIOTT FOR MISLEADING THERE LOYAL CUSTOMERS about this property. Stop using photo shopped photos. In fairness it is a category 2 hotel. I probably should have payed attention to that. I’m sorry but you lifetime Marriott members that are looking for a place in Marrakech Morocco this is not the hotel. There are quite a few better options around the area including one right across the street.

The personnel in the lobby and reception are courteous and helpful. It is important to check your rooms’ air conditioners as some have very noisy ventilators. Look also for toilette´s flushing system that may not be tight and water is continuously running.

Le Meridien N'Fis,worldlee2 wrote a review Sep 2019,20,Smoky property in need of significant renovation,Starting with the positives this property is well positioned within Marrakech - it is close to the airport walking distance to the Medina and nearby a mall with a grocery store. Additionally the staff is warm and friendly and the gardens on the property are well-maintained.    But that said it is shocking that this property is part of the Marriott family. Our check-in took excruciatingly long - I am not sure what was going on behind the desk. When we left the dated lobby and headed towards the guest rooms we were even more horrified - the hallways and guest rooms are in need of a complete renovation (and likely have been for a long time). Guests are smoking everywhere - at the pool in the bar etc. It is really not a comfortable place to stay at all. The Wifi was so slow that it was not functional - this is a basic amenity that all properties should have sorted out not to mention one that belongs to a major international hospitality brand.    We also had some service misses - at one point I asked via the Bonvoy app if I could have a bottle of wine delivered to the room to be ready when I arrived back after dinner and was told to dial room service rather than the agent taking care of the request for me.    As another example I confirmed my late check-out via the Bonvoy app but the staff neglected to extend the lifetime of my key so I was locked out of my room after noon and had to return to the lobby to get a new key.    While the price is great I would not recommend staying here - spend some more and stay somewhere more comfortable where you will enjoy a smoother experience.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"San Francisco, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldlee2
Le Meridien N'Fis,Mike S wrote a review Sep 2019,10,Avoid at All Costs - Not Worthy of the Marriott Brand,"I have stayed at over 150 Marriott properties all over the world and this was by far the worst hotel in the portfolio that I have visited. The overall property very dated and poorly maintained and seems more like a budget property (comparable to a Roadway Inn or Motel 6).    First the property was marketed as ""smoke-free"" but that apparently excludes smoking in the lobby bar (which is connected to the check-in desks making second-hand smoke unavoidable) smoking at the pool and smoking at the various on-property restaurants.    Speaking of check-in it was a disorganized and confusing mess. Since one of our rooms wasn't ready we were provided with a ""temporary"" room before being relocated around the property later in the day. One of us is a Marriott Bonvoy Gold and was ""upgraded"" to a King Room with a garden view.    The wifi at most locations on the property (including most importantly the rooms) was too slow to be useful. We ended up having to buy local SIM cards for our unlocked iPhones in order to have internet access. Thankfully there's a shopping mall right across the street and the SIM cards were inexpensive -- the point is that it's a major (and unexpected) inconvenience when you can't rely on hotel-provided internet especially when traveling internationally.    The bathroom was hideously dated damaged and not very clean. The tub was slippery and it was small miracle nobody was injured while showering. Speaking of which the tub did not drain properly so the tub would fill up with water while showering. Also the shower curtain does not extend to the full length of the bathroom resulting in the bathroom floor getting wet during every shower.    The one highlight was the staff's willingness to accommodate our request for a late check-out allowing us to enjoy our last full day In Morocco. Check-out was super speedy the bill was accurate and overall this hotel is extremely affordable.    One additional interesting note -- after completing the survey on Marriott's own web site 2 different guests in my group received the same form letter from hotel management staying that they're taking our feedback seriously. The real problem is that Marriott even continues to allow this property to be affiliated with the brand not whether or not the local hotel management is interested in our feedback.    There are so many other options in Marrakech that are both in a better location and a more authentic Moroccan experience -- including even another Marriott option. I would recommend to anyone to stay there instead.",Date of stay: August 2019,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikeandthecity

Le Meridien N'Fis,SS9 wrote a review Aug 2019,20,Extremely outdated,Our greet at the hotel was truly horrid however the higher management staff immediately rectified this by connecting with us and explaining the situation. I just admit the kindness and immediate call to action by their staff after seeing our angry reactions.  The hotel was refurbished back in 2000 and it is my belief that they’re still living on the reputation of the name ( le meridean) to get them by. My family and I were surprised that the rooms were this outdated. Clean -yes  however extremely outdated. Towels have no more fibres left in them the bed springs are no longer helping keep the mattress shape. The bathroom toilet bowl is rusted. I am not talking about luxury however when you compare the hotels within the same price range star ratings & location they put the meridean to shame.

The rooms (and the hotel) are dated though. Could do with a little maintenance. We got a suite with a bad air conditioning unit in the living area and although the maintenance crew tried to sort it out they fell short and gave an electric fan to make due with.    Had to wake up extra early for a Moroccan bath but when we got there it was still closed. There seemed to have been some misunderstanding with the times. Very disappointing.    The staff were polite pleasant very helpful and apologetic for the short comings of the hotel.    Three stars for the breakfast buffet and attitude of the doormen IT manager tea man and location.

Overall experience was good but still wanted to write this review as I stayed at many Marriott hotels and really feel that this one is not worth its 5 stars and certainly not following the standards of the Marriott.  As I want to give justice to the hotel I also put what I think is positive first.  Positive  - Very good location. The hotel is just opposite the Menara Mall allowing you to shop and dine  - Availability of taxis outside of the hotel  - Carparking facilities within the property  - Very friendly personnel especially at the reception  - Smooth check-in experience  - Nice lobby  - Beautiful gardens  Negative  - Rooms look really old and need serious refurbishment. I heard from the staff that helft of the rooms are unavailable as they are in the process of doing some renovation work  - Internet connection is really poor in the rooms. Each time I had to go to the lobby to return ly emails  - When I stay as a guest in a 5 star hotel I like to feel the luxury service. Most of the 5 star hotels I stayed in had all the amenities I had hoped to find in a hotel and more. Minibar only includes water and soft drinks. No crisps nuts chocolate.. It was a pity not to have coffee and tea making facilities in the rooms which we commonly find in three star hotels. Basically a guest should be able to get everything they can from a lower category hotel and beyond. When I get a boiler coffee and tea in a Holiday Inn Express I am surprised not to have it in a 5 star hotel Marriott chain.  - Breakast selection is acceptable however we did not feel the food was fresh: juices and fruit platters were not being kept at the right temperature. Once we made a remark the staff said that this hotel is always audited and that they strictly follow the Marriott Standards  - There was a very bad smell in my toilets every day,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Casablanca, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorsar

I filled all our details & try to make a payment. We were so tired cos of early flight & hectic day . It took me little time to find my card . Checking guy was so rude with me & told me to move aside. I managed to get my card & check in with heavy heart that we r staying in 5* this kind of treatment. Security guy took us in our room very basic room no kettle no iron very basic bed . Thanks god we booked 3 nights only. Next mrng we went for breakfast none of the staff can spk English so many people only two coffee machines r working. Basically u have to stay in que for ur turn . Ask for kettle in room next morning about 10 am & they delivered kettle in the evening after calling three times. U can get these facilities in 3* star why this hotel called 5* cos they got big building with swimming pool. Very disappointed.

Le Meridien N'Fis,MrsLShankland wrote a review Jun 2019,20,The most redeeming feature of this hotel is the pool...,Had several issues and a rather distressing experience for the first couple of days: issues with car pick up terrible check in with no orientation on breakfast times/WiFi login (not your usual enter hotel room number) air con not working during 41c heat awful room with stained walls and rugs chasing for a cot for our baby awful member of reception who didn’t take our concerns seriously chasing several times for a fan for the room chasing for ice over an hour long period chasing for most things really. There’s a difference between laid back and just rude and sadly it was the latter here. Within 48 hours we were trying to secure a new hotel or flights home.    We asked if we would be charged for breakfast if we ordered room service given it was included in our stay and advised just the tray charge yet asked to sign for 545 MAD (£43!) when we did order. Advised we would not be signing the bill explaining it should only be the tray charge yet towards the end of our stay I had to advise staff to remove the 545 charge again.    Spoke with an interim manager who was very kind to move us to a suite which we were not expecting. He also provided us with a bottle of champagne and a free 30 min massage. Sadly the massage was the worst I’ve ever experienced (think of someone slapping oil on your body up and down like they are painting a wall). He tried his best to make things better but sadly the damage was already done.    Service at the pool and during breakfast was incredibly poor with serious preference given to those who spoke French or Arabic. Service at lunch was great and the staff were wonderful with our baby.    The food was also incredibly bland most of the time which one doesn’t expect in Morroco. The highlight food dish was the grilled chicken which was very tasty. The rest was so bland. We heard many guests complain about the food but unsure how many actually talked to the hotel. In the end we opted to eat away from the hotel as much as possible.    The floor in our room was also rather dirty at times. Given we have an 18 month old baby who isn’t walking yet we could see his knees and hands were black with dirt from the bedroom and living room floor.    Only these three members of staff were truly wonderful:  Ghizlane  Hassan  Taofiq    The rest need some serious customer service training. Overall the hotel needs a refurb and coaching on what it means to be part of the Marriott group now. I’ve never stayed at a category 2 hotel and sure as heck won’t be again. Truly terrible and I really question a lot of these 5 star reviews!!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Strathaven, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsLShankland

Le Meridien N'Fis,Seattle52 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Good and Bad,"I am vacillating giving this hotel a 2 or a 3. Many good points:  GOOD:  1) Grounds are lovely  2) Pool is great refreshing and clean  3) Staff - mostly great attentive  4) Breakfast Buffet - very good diverse selections loved the ""pancakes"" and mint tea  5) Bar - great service and nice place for relaxing drink and pizza after long day  6) Pool restaurant - decent selection loved the outdoor pizza ovens and bbq  7) King bed pillows - very comfortable and clean decent bedding    BAD  1) No recognition for Marriott/Bonvoy Titanium Elite for life status. The room we were given has to be if not the worst then one of the worst in the hotel. Room number 478 had horribly marked stained walls dirty rugs terrible tile floors air con didn't work it was disgusting. We slept with the window open at night unfortunately to see and hear the noise and lights from the mall across the street. We had booked on points and the only reason we can think of for this terrible room was because we were on points which some hotels place no value on. Paying customers only matter.  2) Front desk - I called 3 times the night of our arrival to ask for someone to come repair air con - no one ever answered my calls and I let it ring a very long time from about 6 pm until 9 pm.  3) Move rooms or change hotels - we woke early continued to look at the online pics of hotel which didn't look anything like the room we were in. We decided to tell the front desk our problems with the room  but were prepared to leave. The front desk gave us a new room #142 so going backward in terms of high level room. We went to check it out still needs to be updated but at least all walls were painted white and rugs tile appeared clean and in better condition. Not overlooking mall this time just garden. Bathroom was also better - overall even though dated it was 80% better than first room.    Bottom line the hotel would be great if they would just do some room updating. It could be a quiet oasis away from Medina. I believe the 5 star reviews are either fake or people are given the better rooms.    We had planned to stay again after our 10 day trip through Morocco but cancelled it and will stay at another property. Its disappointing as clearly this property does not reflect the Marriott/Bonvoy philosophy.",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seattle52

Le Meridien N'Fis,Rima wrote a review May 2019,50,"amazing, loved it",This place is really beautiful and relaxing. The service we recieved was excellent kind welcoming professional staff and generous as well. The place is clean fresh beautiful and we got more than we needed. Even small nice gifts placed when left home (bowl of fruit water bottles chocolate). It's so spacious it has many options and more than one restaurantå. The suit we got was spacious and had more comforts than we even needed. Room service excellent. The garden is the best part of this place it's like a paradise. Big colorful (full of different flowers and trees with the best smells) relaxing (fountains and bird songs everywhere) never ending. We visited Jardin Majorelle later and we were not so impressed because we had seen this garden which to us felt nicer. You feel so in touch with nature. The pool was also nice. Just across the street there is a mall.  We didnt feel the need to leave the area during our stay (2 nights) since we felt everything we needed was there (both inside and outside the building).The breakfast was very generous with so many options both western style and more oriental and even there the staff were amazing.

Without any problems they organized all the activities I wanted. Their suggestions were constructive and interesting and in communication with them I felt like I was their friend and not a client. The rooms would benefit from a bit of a refurbishment but the service was so good that I did not even feel any flaws.  The location itself is excellent practically all is accessible on foot. Moreover the hotel works with trusted taxi drivers so this aspect is not problematic either. During breakfast and dinner there are plenty of local options that were very interesting to me. Especially interesting were breakfasts where they present how to make local pancakes and rolls as well as mint tea.  I'm a gold member at the Marriott program and I really got all the benefits I should and so much more. In fact this is one of the hotels for which I would say that it is extremely fond of elite members and I even paid with points.

In particular Youssef Mamouni the Chef Concierge who went the extra mile to organise very special evenings for us at Le Tobsil restaurant and La Sultana - amazing locations and food. Everything Youssef suggested to us did not disappoint. Thank you for making our trip to Marrakech a very special one Youssef.    In addition Hamid on reception was extremely helpful even when we had to change rooms - he was always polite and made sure we got what we wanted.    Said was the final piece in the jigsaw that made our stay so good - he organised our taxis and ensured that we got everywhere we wanted to go and back! Said was again always so welcoming and friendly.    The location of the hotel is perfect - just a short walk outside the city walls and on the route for the Hop On Hop Off Tourist bus which we made full use of. The pool area of the hotel was beautiful as were the gardens. Gardeners were continually working to maintain the beautiful shrubs and flowers - stunning.

Le Meridien N'Fis,iverge wrote a review Feb 2019,30,"Beautiful Grounds, Friendly Staff - Rooms Need Renovations ASAP.",I really loved this hotel's convenient location beautiful well-kept grounds and the staff were extremely friendly. My only complaint is the poor state of the rooms and halls.    As a Marriott Bonvoy Ambassador I received a suite upgrade which I really appreciated.  The suite was very good in size with a separate living/seating area but the furnishings were very old and the ceiling and walls were still the original plaster. No USB ports for your devices other-than connecting to the back of the TV which you have to leave on to charge. The mini fridge didn't work and when reported to the front desk nothing was done about it. The electric power went off in the room each time you used the hair dryer which tripped the breaker. The bed was very comfortable which was surprising considering the poor state of the room otherwise.    The halls were dark and ugly with a worn out carpet runner that had too many stains to count. The halls also smelled very bad of smoke.    Breakfast was in the restaurant which was very good all the staff were friendly. They had an egg station juice bar fresh fruit yoghurts fresh bread pastries cold cuts and cheese. They even had a gentleman making fresh mint tea and a woman making flatbread.    The hotel outside grounds is beautifully kept. Every day I'd see staff cleaning and attending to the gardens.    The gym was extremely basic with semi-functional equipment. Very poor upkeep as there were no towels and no working air conditioning. I included a photo which sums up the condition of not only the fitness club but the poor state of the rooms as-well.    The hotel is located in a very safe area and is across a mall with a grocery store cafes and restaurants. For a quick bite to eat I'd suggest The French bakery PAULS it had baguette sandwiches and salads. I loved their fresh pastries too. I counted 4 separate coffee machines and none of them made a decent beverage all were too watery.    This hotel has a lot going for it location beautiful gardens and friendly staff. What they need to do is update their rooms and the hallways. I understand some people might consider the dated rooms charming but you have to strike a balance between offering a locally inspired design with modern and convenient amenities that international travellers expect. This is where the hotel fails. Especially when you consider they are operating under The Le Meridien brand.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iverge

Le Meridien N'Fis,Sebastian wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Excellent hospitality just needs some renovations,Overall it was very good stay and I recommend staying here. I received excellent Marriott/SPG Platinum Premier (Titanium) recognition. I booked two rooms and both were upgraded to include one to a very nice suite. The courtesy and kindness of the staff was really nice. The only improvement was some minor updating to the rooms to make them a little more modern as they were kind of old and maybe an executive lounge though I have not stayed in a Le Méridien with a lounge before so maybe none of them have it.    Staying in this hotel was a welcomed relief after staying at the terrible Sheraton Casablanca the night before which I also wrote a review about. The Sheraton Casablanca must learn from this SPG/Marriott hotel. I am an avid Marriott/SPG loyalist.    Booking: As a SPG/Marriott Platinum Premier member I used the SPG application to book. No issue booking.    Pre-check: As our stay approached I contacted the hotel via the chat function on the SPG/Marriott mobile application. They were responsive and were able to meet my needs through the chat. They said they would check on availability the day of check in to try to get us an upgrade/suite.    Location: The hotel location was pretty good. There was a mall and restaurants across the street . It was a short taxi ride to the Médina. The property was beautiful with a nice pool and garden.    Check in/Elite Benefits: Our experience went very smoothly. We were greeted by Said who took care of us during our entire stay. There was an elite check-in set up and no waiting. We received our upgrades. I also selected the points bonus as our platinum premier gift which included breakfast in the hotel restaurant as well. We did not have to choose between breakfast or points. That is always a major plus.    Lounge: There was no lounge though there were a few bottles of water in the room along with some fruit which was a nice touch.    Room: The suite was pretty nice. The bed was comfortable. The television was ok and so was the other technology. It would have been nice to have some outlets/usb outlets on the night stand so I did not have to unplug the bed lamp.    Special Touches: We had a nice big bottle of water and fruit waiting for us in our rooms. Said was also a nice touch throughout our stay. He was always there to greet us in the morning and evening. He also arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport along with always serving us nice tea while we waited. He always carried our luggage wherever we went. He hung my coat up in the room after he brought our luggage up.    Breakfast: Breakfast for platinum members was in the restaurant downstairs. The selection was pretty good. There were made to order eggs/omelettes as well as some Moroccan food and a selection of the usual breakfast pastries meats and cheeses. The fresh squeezed juices were very nice.    Check out: Instead of using mobile check out I decided to see the front desk. Prior to going up to our room to leave Said asked us when he could arrange a taxi for us. He also went up to our room to take our luggage which was very nice. Check out at the front desk went smoothly. Said served us tea and got us a taxi. We thanked him for his kindness and excellent service. The only issue with check out were that I received points for only one of my rooms. I will have to rectify with Marriott/SPG. I also did not receive my platinum welcome bonus for both rooms.    Overall it was a very good stay at the hotel. There was only a need for a few touch ups a minor concerns. I look forward to returning. I recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bougietravelbug

Le Meridien N'Fis,SineadDublinIreland7 wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Tired hotel in a great location,We spend a week in Le Meridien n’Fis at the beginning of January. It’s officially a 5* hotel but probably more like our 3*/4* standard.  The hotel grounds were beautiful with the lovely plants labelled so you’d know what they were. Also there’s a lovely swimming pool (which we didn’t use as it was too early in the year and not really warm enough!).  The hotel location is really good. It’s about 30-35 minutes’ walk from the J’emaa el-Fnaa square (the walk was quite pleasant and safe – we did it by day and in the evenings). Hotel is just across from the Menara Mall where there’s a good Carrefour supermarket (handy for buying snacks wine water etc).  Bedrooms are perfectly adequate but definitely a bit tired and in need of a refurbishment. The rugs beside the beds looked grubby and in need of a good steam clean! Also there were only two available sockets in the room (and these were not located beside the beds). On the plus side the beds were comfortable; and bathrobes were provided. Bedroom doors were shabby and the carpet in the hall leading to the rooms was stained. Good enough choice at breakfast … but weirdly there appeared to be a real shortage of small spoons and napkins seemed to be in short supply also. The room where breakfast is served is adequate but not particularly pleasant and relaxing. We did enjoy the freshly baked crêpes!  Reception staff were generally nice and facilitated a late check-out for us in a very nice way.  Hotel Wi-Fi was ok – a bit unreliable at times. Small but good gym with nice big windows/plenty of natural light.  Assistance/advice from concierge Youssef could definitely have been better. We asked him for restaurant recommendations on the first day of our stay and he suggested one place only (which turned out to be quite expensive). When we asked him about city tours he appeared to lose interest particularly when we asked about the Hop On Hop Off tour (we wondered if that was because he wouldn’t get a commission on that). The city map he provided was a black and white photocopy (strange but true 😊).,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SineadDublinIreland7

Le Meridien N'Fis,DErtg wrote a review Jan 2019,10,Disappointing property,"This property is in such disrepair that it has completely destroyed my confidence in the Le Meridien brand. It was so bad that even though we had paid for three nights we just left less than 12 hours after arriving and went to another hotel. I've stayed at about a half dozen Le Meridien properties around the world (Frankfurt Munich Philadelphia and Arlington in the last 6 months) and generally expect a well designed and executed property that is a step above your average Westin Sheraton etc.    This property reminds me of a crappy airport howard johnson. Massive gap under the door so every time a door closes down the hallway the elevator dings as it's passing your floor a person laughs 3 rooms away you hear it all (good luck sleeping and I’m not a light sleeper). The door to the ""balcony"" didn't fully close either so all the outside noise came in along with the hallway noise. The room was dirty mildew on the shower walls and floor tiles molding shower curtain dirty floors to the room stained towels dry rotting railing etc. All of those things proper maintenance and cleaning could have fixed. On top of that and it just was a dated and run down property.    If you are looking to enjoy your time in Marrakech I recommend you look at another property. We discovered after changing hotels that this is one of the older hotels in Marrakech and is absolutely showing its age.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jacqui W wrote a review Jan 2019,10,Disappointing,This hotel was a let down in service and amenities. The hotel is dated and basic. It feels like it hasn’t been updated since the 70/80’s. The bathroom was old and had a door stopper in the middle of the floor that managed to catch both of our toes when we went in to use the bathroom.    The beds were comfortable and it was opposite a mall with good security. This is where the positives stop.    The mall had a fountain that plays loud music which makes it impossible to sleep until it finally stops late into the night.    The service was the most disappointing. Everything seemed to take so long and no one seemed to care about anything. We left two room keys in our room when we went out and house keeping took them from the room. We had to get new ones and when we told them our disappointment at things being taken from the room we were told “ok”. They made us new ones and when I said it worries me that it seems normal to remove things from a guests room I was given no response no apology or reassurance things would not continue to be taken from our room. Finally on the day we were leaving we left our cases in our room checked out and asked them to collect our cases and keep them safely at reception for our pick up at 2. When we came back at 1:30 no one knew what we were taking about and the bags couldn’t be found. It took 30 mins for them to work out the bags were in the room we checked out of and get them back to us again without an apology for the delay or worry caused.    We do not recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquiw610

So I believe I can notice differences and give objective rating.  Sometimes people make a difference even when the place is not great or the system is not working at its best. While my journey in Morocco I stayed in Sheraton Casablanca and in Marriott resort in Fes. People there made a big difference with their love kindness and attention. Here in Le Meridien not only the cleanliness rooms and service are below average even people are taking guests for granted. I felt that I was just a number.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Beatriz J wrote a review Dec 2018,10,"Disastrous, unforgettable for all the wrong reasons",When we looked at the photos on the website we were thrilled at the prospect of our stay but when we arrived reality hit us like a brick. The five star hotel we had booked had the quality of a Spanish three star motel but the price was extremely high for what we got.    We booked our stay for New Years Eve and those were the only clothes we took out of our luggage since the closet was tiny and couldn’t even fit the contents of half a suitcases.    The furniture seemingly modern in the online photos was old and cracked and had in fact just been repainted and repainted over the years.    The bathroom had a two inch step that you would trip over every single time you exited and the water pressure was practically non existent.    Our heating was broken for the first three days and we were freezing everywhere else in the hotel.    Due to all this we tried to get a change in room however when we were showed alternatives even those allegedly going for a higher price all the rooms were exactly the same; an absolute scam seeing as the description of our booking was a ‘Superior Room’.    Additionally we tried to get a change in hotel but we were told by the staff that the only way we could get a refund which our booking policy said we were entitled to was if Expedia got into contact with them; they provided no help with this and we never got an answer. The only ones who could’ve made the cancellation fast enough would’ve been the hotel receptions staff however they chose not to help at all.    Finally the quality of the food was awful the breakfast buffet is expensive and has no healthy options for breakfast the fruit isn’t even fresh it’s all preserves something ludicrous seeing how rich in fruits the country is. The New Year’s Eve dinner is priced at 1700 dirhams which is only 100 dirhams less than at La Mammounia one of the best hotels in all the city.

The hotel is in a pleasant neighbourhood close to Marrakesh's airport and opposite Menara mall which has some nice restaurants and a Carrefour. We found this location to be far more inviting and civilised than the medina.    We had booked interconnecting rooms which were quite bland and dated though they were reasonably spacious. The hotel's gardens were nice and well maintained and the pool was also a good size.    On the whole service was poor; staff were mostly polite but not especially competent. Initially receptionists did nothing to recognise our SPG Gold status - we had to tell them what additional services we were entitled to ourselves. Nonetheless the cleaners and security personnel were more welcoming though they spoke little English.    Dining was very average; writing this I cannot even remember what I ate for dinner here - it was really nothing exciting though. Also when we went for drinks at the Al Abbassia bar there were no staff anywhere to be seen.

I had a Marriott $100 certificate I was not able to use it because the person at the front desk said that the merger was not complete and could not use the voucher. Unfortunately another staff member said that was not true. I learned this after eating all of our meals off property. We also stayed at a top notch Marriott over in Fes and they provided us breakfast each morning. I do not know why we could not get breakfast at this property as well. I was certainly confused by this. I found the concierge not terribly helpful and there was one front desk staffer who was just belligerent.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Robert C wrote a review Dec 2018,10,A very bad hotel in a beautiful garden and Marrakech neighborhood,"First it is important to point out that Le Meridien N'Fis in Marrakech is situated in a lovely and central neighborhood of this wonderful city: L'Hivernage---and that the gardens are well-maintained. Having said that I would counsel visitors to Marrakech to run away as fast as possible from this hotel staffed by a discourteous indolent staff who will not move a finger to provide the guests to whom they owe a salary even with the minimal help that most travelers need. For example the down-right rude reception staff were ""out of money"" when we arrived so we could not exchange a few dollars into dirhams: a front desk of a hotel that ostensibly has no cash to provide change (a claim so odd for a touted 4-star hotel that I believe it was a downright lie by the clerk to avoid the little trouble of counting a few bills). The two rooms we saw before deciding on one were very dated the carpets worn and in need of cleaning the bathrooms old and tired and the AC cut off because they claimed ""it was winter"" even if the temperature in early November (not exactly winter as the staff dismissively claims) was in the low 80s during the day and not much cooler at night. I had to swat five flies in the bathroom and the smell there was not really fresh so I hate to think of what could have been attracting the flies on a corner top-floor room. The beds were hard and the sheets not fresh. The included breakfast was average---nothing special which the room price should have guaranteed---served in a cavernous very large room that looked and felt like a school cafeteria (it did have a nice terrace though). Needless to say right after breakfast we almost ran out of there (through the ridiculous warren of guards dogs barriers that momentarily made you feel you had committed some crime and were in prison---I saw that other hotels in Marrakech handle security with more finesse and efficiency so that guests do not feel they are institutionalized every time they leave or arrive at the hotel). My earnest advice to future travelers to Marrakech is to run and run fast from this poorly maintained hotel that does not honor the otherwise good chain of hotels to which it strangely belongs.",Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4535UArobertc

Cab ride from the Médina only cost 50 Dirhams. The breakfast buffet was one of the best on our 2 week tour with plenty of choices and helpful staff. Our first room smelled musty and they quickly gave us another room. The concierge secured a dinner reservation at a great restaurant. Other tour members enjoyed their hammams.

Le Meridien N'Fis,islington3164 wrote a review Oct 2018,50,"Beautiful Hotel, Exceptional Service in a Great Location","We arrived at the hotel at nearly 11 p.m. after a confusion over our flight from Casablanca. The hotel is no more than 10 minutes from the airport and we were greeted with smiles and a big welcome at the reception by Mouna Karbane (more about her later). After we checked in we were taken to our room and given a brief ""room tour"" by the porter. As we had spent 6 hours at the Casablanca airport which as some may know is outdated and has limited eating options we were starving and wanted room service and luckily room service is available 24 hours and our food which was just a simple club sandwich with fries arrived promptly we thankfully put some much needed food in our stomach (and we also had some of the fruit which greeted us in our room upon arrival). Beside having received great service which continued throughout our stay upon arrival our first impression of the hotel was wonderful. The room itself was large was well air-conditioned (much needed in Marrakech) had a big bathroom comfortable beds and plenty of TV options. Next day we woke up later than expected but early enough to get to the breakfast buffet with which we were very pleased. it offers a wide assortment hot ""western"" dishes such as scrambled eggs. potatoes an omelette stationetc. a very wide assortment of hot Moroccan dishes cold cuts yogurts all types of breads and pastries delicious fruits freshly squeezed juices and another station with freshly made msemen. Of course plenty of coffee and tea. After filling up we took of the medina and choose to walk. While maybe not something to do at night or if the sun is scorching the walk was no more than 20 minutes long and pleasant with gardens on either side. After a long day inside the craziness of the medina we returned to the hotel and I went to the Menara Mall right across the street from the hotel to get some water at the Carrefour while my friend went to the pool. the pool is large with sparkling clean water in a beautiful setting which leads me to the overall setting of the hotel. It's gorgeous. The hotel is composed of several buildings set around a series of gorgeous and well kept gardens with at least one really beautiful fountain which lights up at night. The lobby and common areas are equally enticing with a very Marrakech vibe throughout. I do have some minor negative comments: 1) Yes as some have said the hotel does need a little updating. The hotel is older and has been very well-kept but a touch-up wouldn't hurt 2) The bath/shower is a little slippery and it's a bit high to get in. There was no bath mat at least not in our room and as I'm older i was a little scared of slipping. A mat really would have helped. 3) Also in our room there is a very small step down from the room into the bathroom. The hotel should level these off immediately as I can see a toe stub happening in the middle of the night and in Marrakech where you walk and walk a toe stub would not be good. None of these items in any way affected our stay or my rating but they should be addressed. On our last night we went to the reception to ask for a late check out the next day and coincidentally Ms. Karbane was on duty and told us it would be no problem. As this is a big hotel with many guests I was a bit hesitant that we'd actually have the late check out confirmed. Next day we went to check out and not only was Ms. Karbane on duty but she remembered our name and gave us our bill without asking for our names. Wow!! Ms. Karbane (and indeed the entire Le Meridien staff) should be commended for the exceptional service we received while in Marrakech. it's little things like this that make us want to go back and when we do we will make sure that we stay at Le Meridien again!",Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Miami, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islington3164

The Medina is walkable in ~30 minutes and actually a pretty nice stroll. If you are looking for the traditional morrocan Riad experience this place is not for you. That said the hotel was well maintained and a nice quiet reprieve from the noisy old city after a few days in the Medina. The pool is pretty but very cold and the rooms are quaint but come with all expected amenities. The breakfast and dinner at the hotel were phenomenal and affordable or included for us which was nice. Good place for families that want to go to Morocco too as it feels slower and safer than the streets of the Medina with easy acccess.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielsincavage

Le Meridien N'Fis,technical c wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Old Charm Hotel With Traditional Hospitality,Marrakech is an upcoming city in Morocco and some parts of the city are undergoing major urban transformation whereas some areas continue to maintain its antiquity.    Le Meridien Hotel in Marrakech offers charm from both the worlds. While it is conveniently and centrally located seemingly in the transformed part of the city the hotel has the charm of the old world richly preserved interiors and richly preserved grounds and charming staff with old tradition that believes in nothing short of the royal treatment for the guests. My wife and I had privilege of staying at this hotel from September 30 to October 2 2018. The staff truly impressed us including their courtesy and attitude. We encountered wonderful staff in all of the departments beginning with front desk to doorman to concierge to housekeeping and in the restaurant as well as in the management.    We were truly humbled by Mr. Omar Benjelloun Director of Sales and Marketing who made time from his busy schedule to meet with us and to explain how this hotel is being integrated into the new norms of Marriott (I am Platinum Elite at Marriott and now also at SPG) and how the SPG culture is slowly blending into Marriott culture so that the guests at SPG would have same perceptions at all of the hotels in the chain giving the guests the same feeling of being home away from home. I must admit that the staff at this hotel has the right attitude because culturally they already make you feel as if you are visiting their home and they tend to treat you in the kindest manner.    To name few of the finest staff we encountered Youssef Mamouni the Chief Concierge was most delightful gentlemen ever ready to help with whatever we needed inside and outside of the hotel with our smallest needs to arranging our transportation within and outside of the city. He is as his duty requires the most approachable person on the property extremely courteous and with superb public relation aptitude. A true ambassador for the management.    Another fine example of your staff is Rachid Tarmoud in the restaurant. A really a top performer in the restaurant despite pressure of rush and despite the pressure of crowds. Despite pressure and managing the most difficult logistics Rachid was always smiling always very pleasant and always very eager to help. He was never flustered or aggravated. He was always calm pleasant and warm but above all extremely efficient. Thank you Rachid for this excellent service.    And we were indeed very lucky to have been assigned to housekeeper Ilham Mahrani and to experience the service from one of the best housekeepers. Ilham adds to the hotel the brilliance and efficiency that are always first things to be noticed if they were missing. Ilham has a very pleasant personality and adding to that she has finest work ethics that you rarely see in this position. Once she is done with your room it is meticulously finished with all your request in terms of towels fresh sheets water etc complied with and leaving the room spotless well groomed and neat. Thank you Ilham for your superb service.    As far as the restaurant and food is concerned the breakfast is excellent; however try to avoid rush period from 7:30 am to 8:30 am when groups are trying to get in and out quickly to catch their tour buses.    If you are a Marriott Loyalist you will find some of the benefits still in the works. This include recognition special treatment as elite separate line for elites for check-in and special favors such as upgrades. They are in the works and will soon be implemented.    Hotel grounds are beautiful and are even more pretty at night when grounds and fountains are lit. Hotel is across the street from the mall and that provides additional options for eating out and or strolling in the vicinity. Other attractions in the city are very easy to reach by cab.    Although we tried but because of short stay we may not have had an opportunity to thank all the staff who treated us with dignity with respect and hosted us brilliantly. We request the General Manager to do that on our behalf and for which we thank him in advance.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Darien, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/960amirr
Le Meridien N'Fis,Ghaz S wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Long weekend away,The hotel though a little dated has a sumptuous entrance and lobby with the friendliest and most attentive team to welcome you.  Youssef at the concierge desk was happy to sit with us and plan our stay book our excursions and restaurants and make suggestions suited to us as three women travelling together.  Breakfast was delicious and very generous. The square ‘pancake’ bread made fresh in front of you was delicious! Avoid if watching your weight!! :)  The gardens and pool area are well maintained very easy to laze away a few hours.  The only area where some improvement is needed is the bar. Not everything was available presentation of drinks changed depending on who was serving and one of the staff showed little interest in his job. A real shame as the bar is very popular in the evenings and could be busier with a few small changes.  Housekeeping were excellent as were the reception staff and of course the concierge team and porters.

Constantly have to shut off your connection and re-connect - Laptop phone tablet doesn't matter.... horrible.    The location is a bit far from the city center and you will need to take a cab for almost anything. This is my first visit to Marrakech and in hind site would not choose this hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Werebit87 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Not recommended,"This was our first Morrocan trip . The check in process took awhile but this was not the fault of the hotel. There is still some issues with the Marriott system integration. We were welcomed with a cold morrocan drink which was very nice. the gentlemens at the check in was really nice and accomodating.    Room  The property definitely need some refurisbment like the people who mentioned before. For its age it's quite decent as there was no paint peeling or water damage. There was no towels available when we arrived in our room. Overall everything in the room functioned as it should.    Staff  This is where everything went downhill. I mentioned before that there were no towels in our room so we call to have some delivered. The room attendant came into our room without knocking and used her cardkey to enter our room this scared the life out of my wife. she act like everything is fine and went on with her business.THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE anywhere in the world. The towels are stained yellow as you can see in my pictures I would recommend those who prefer hygenies to bring their own towels.  We then asked for room service to deliver utensils to our room they brought us only one set which took them 15 minute we called again and they literally told me we brought them to you already why you need more?I mentioned I need another set as we have two people this kind of service for le meridien is mindboggling. Next day We then asked for help with the Taxi to dinner knowing that we were constantly paying tourist price the day before( known issue in Marrakech) the attendant who handled our luggage just wrote down the address for us in English and told us to go outside and hail a taxi(wow thanks as my phone cant do that) I mentioned could you help us he keep mentioning just go outside. Luckily the bright spot to this was outside the security guard was nice enough to help us negotiated a price 2x instead of 5x what we suppose to pay. i left baffled being a loyal spg member for years.    At checkout the gentlemen who checked me in was busy checking out another customer. So I waited for 10 min and this one another attendant at the lobby notice I was waiting and he had to signal over the to a lady who was having a chat with the concierge person and possibly another customer. She reluctantly walk over with a attitude and mentioned ""you have nothing leave your card and can go"" I was like oh my god I never wanted to stay here again for all the other choices in the Marrakech. What drove me here was my loyalty to spg for years and this is definitely not right. When I left the same attendant helped me with my luggage and hailed a taxi he definitely deserved the tip I gave him.    The bright side of this hotel is the hat the breakfast is ok the view from the outdoor seating area is nice and cool in the morning. The Bar which opening in the evening was good we had a couple of drinks there and it was wonderful. We didnt have the chance to enjoy the pool so I cant comment on quality.    They need to do retraining for their staff here. No one says anything to you inside the hotel no hello no good morning. nada nor do they even smile aside from the lovely elderly man at the reception for breakfast.There are definitely bright spots and some nice people but my interaction above just creates a bad taste for my whole experience.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Benjamin L wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Great but slightly dated,Stayed here for 4 nights using up our spg Marriott points.  The room was nice and quaint with fresh fruit and tea on check in and bottles of water provided in evenings. The showers have low pressure so are not as powerful as you would expect but they do the job. Very clean and tidy rooms just a little bit dated considering it’s a “5 Star”    Staff are very friendly and happy to help especially with taxis out the front of the hotel.  Would suggest hailing a passing taxi if you can rather than the taxis that sit outside as some say they will take you to where you want to go but change their minds - not hotels fault.  The few things staff were unhelpful with was changing currency into smaller denominations it’s not that hard to do and would have been a nice thing for a guest to be able to do but no one wanted to do it. The second thing is that it would’ve been good for the hotel to do airport transfers as very odd for a Marriott to not do and it’s not that far away. We enquirer before coming and they refused to organise transfer but did tell us to get the bus.  Closest cash machine is in the mall opposite    Would suggest going to supermarket or restaurants opposite hotel for breakfast as it’s quite expensive in the hotel for a buffet breakfast.    We made use of the pool which had attentive pool staff offering towels once you approached the hut on the far side.  Pool seemed to be a little cold at first but nothing a few laps can’t help with and very refreshing if you get too hot on the sunbeds plenty of umbrellas and no reserved sunbeds so can always grab one.    There is security at the hotel but seems to be more to check cars and just to make guests feel safe otherwise very lacklustre as everyone walks through the metal detector unchecked even if you set it off.    Used the business centre where you can print off boarding passes for free which was great!    Only 20 minutes walking distance to town if you want to avoid hassle of taxi.  Easy to find from airport just take the 19 bus and tell them your hotel or say the savoy as it’s very close by.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1734OZbenjaminl

Le Meridien N'Fis,William F wrote a review Jul 2018,20,Poor service,My family and I stayed at this hotel for a week whilst staying in Marrakech and this by no means reached the standard I would expect from the brand let alone a 4-5 star hotel. I have stayed at this level hotels across the world and haven't been this disappointed with the level of service before. Not only was service slow by the pool (having to ask 4 times and wait 30 minutes for towels) in addition breakfast wasn't fully set up an hour after they claimed to be open (causing us to go on a trip without a real breakfast). However I was most disappointed by the concierge and management. I left my work pass (from my job in London and made of plastic the same as a credit card) in the power socket to keep electronics charging whilst we were out the room. I returned at the end of the day to find the cleaner had snapped the card in half and left it on the table after two days of complaining the concierge staff never got back to me then once I finally got in contact with someone they claimed they could do nothing to help. To get a replacement card is around £100 and I haven't seen such disregard from staff for a guest's personal property being broken by an employee. After two days of complaining they took off one lunch bill equivalent to half my bill to change the card. Despite this I must say the bar staff were very nice and accommodating especially putting up with us Brits watching the World Cup. I would recommend anyone to come and see Marrakech amazing city with lovely people but I wouldn't recommend to anyone to stay at the Le Meridien N'fis.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1092JZwilliamf
Le Meridien N'Fis,happytravels1212 wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Disappointing,"We booked this hotel with SPG points and were expecting a good experience as we have stayed at other Meridien properties in the past. The hotel was clean and the grounds are pretty -unfortunately that's it. It seems this hotel has been either starved of investment for the last 10 years or so or the management company (i.e Starwood) has not visited this property to ensure it is in line with ""standards"". Note for hotel management: no need to send me a standard response since you are most likely well aware of the issues and there are probably good reasons for the poor condition of the hotel. We stayed on the SPG guest floor and the rooms are very tired. Chairs in the room were heavily soiled and had cigarette burns (in a non smoking property). The furniture in the room was beaten up artwork and mirrors crooked etc. The pool was a good size however the pool furniture is partially broken or worn out. We were given pool towels that were in shreds (large pieces hanging off). As in every hotel there were good and not so good staff. I was surprised when I tried to buy an ice cream by the pool at 501 PM and was told that the restaurant closed at 5 (so no ice cream). Hotel security seemed ""make believe"".

My room was a standard but pleasant hotel room (nothing really special but nothing bad about it either). This place has four restaurants of which I used three of them. One is only open for the buffet breakfast (which is free) and was very good with a great selection of food. Two are open for dinner - the Moroccan Restaurant being excellent - try it out. One is only open for lunch/brunch near the pool (nothing special). The service both at the front desk and at the restaurants was super. The thing that impressed me the most about this place was the grounds. They are expansive very well kept and act as an oasis for all the birds in the surrounding area (even better than highly regarded local park in the area).

Some examples:    - Calling to ask for band aids and being told they only provide this from 9am onwards... really?! I then had to take my bleeding foot downstairs and demand one from the concierge who pulled out a first aid kit reluctantly.  - Walking into my room after a day out to see a card was already inserted all the lights on. Still not sure what went on here.  - Room being cleaned but basic provisions not being replaced! Super annoying to come back after a day looking forward to a nice shower only to see they haven't replaced the body wash or lotion. Call to ask for it and they say they don't have any left at all in the hotel until tomorrow - what on earth?!  - Rude service: calling to ask for all these provisions that should have been provided anyway and getting passed on from one person to the next like a government office  - Awful room service selection for a vegetarian. Even the vegetarian dishes are terrible the pasta felt like a readymade meal that was just heated up and brought to me  - Wi-fi does not work! Thank god I bought a local SIM else I'd have been completely stuck. The network is unreliable.  - Poor quality infrastructure.

It made us feel really welcome. Special thanks for the incredible attention to detail and impeccable service from Mr. A. El Moudali at both breakfast and the bar every day. And I would be seriously remiss if I did not highly recommend talking to the head concierge Mr. Youssef Mamouni. He helped us plan multiple days on our short trip and everything he suggested and set up for us was nothing short of perfect. We absolutely hope to return and would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Michigan,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6403MXjessicaw

The stay was enjoyable except from few things work was carried out early morning Saturday at 8 AM which has annoyed me. The breakfast staff are very careless except from one or 2 persons the rest are not interested if you are there or not if you need anything or not….  Outstanding reception staff very very helpful…. The rooms are bit outdated and need a bit of refurbishment…..    The hotel is located in very quiet good location opposite the new Menara Mall which has a lovely view of Marrakech and only few min ride to the centre and to the airport… the swimming pool area and the Garden are great and well maintained    Overall the hotel is little priced....,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RahhaliUK
Le Meridien N'Fis,Kim H wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Good location, excellent value, beautiful gardens",I stayed a week and a half at Le Meridien NFis. The hotel is located well with a 20-minute walk or a few minutes by taxi to both the Medina and the Gueliz area with most restaurants and bars. The new mall right next door from the hotel had several nice cafes for breakfast and a food court for quick meals.    The hotel looks good with is gardens and flowers. It could use some fresh paint here and there but I wasn't bothered by this. The gym is small yet enough for the casual work-out. I didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food. My room on the second floor was quite typical nothing to complain about and nothing amazing either. The bed was one of the widest I've had anywhere and comfortable for sleeping. The mini-balcony opened into the garden which meant sunrises and birdsong in the mornings. The staff were friendly and polite with a special mention to the doormen.    Le Meridien NFis is a good hotel and gives excellent value as Marrakech has a lot of expensive hotels that are further away.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Helsinki, Finland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499KimH

As many have mentioned the rooms are rather dated but really not bad for the price. They have just renovated the gardens with new fountains. The location is close to most of what you'll want to see in town and the staff is nice; very accommodating and always polite. We enjoyed the pool area. The food available was a bit ""meh."" Nothing approaching gourmet and limited ingredients for much more than pizzas salads tajins and basic fare.    But be cautious asking the hotel for recommendations. We found the same balloon excursion for half price online. And our ""private guide"" the hotel hired us another day basically trotted us around the souks would avoid answering questions about what things should cost and dumped us in the hands of shifty shopkeepers. We got royally ripped off by one ""wholesaler"" who - amidst his grand cavernous ""antique"" business lied and sold us silver-plated brass as ""solid silver."" The price we paid under false pretense will forever color Marrakech as one of the places in our travels where we got screwed. Be smarter than us and be an expert on anything you may want to buy BEFORE you go looking. Anyhow not entirely the hotel's fault.

Le Meridien N'Fis,AlexS wrote a review Feb 2018,30,Business Jolly,As part of a 'supplier funded' product launch we were invited to Marrakech and booked into the Le Meridien hotel for 2 nights. Location is quite good  opposite a small mall  and not far from the Medina.    Regarding the hotel the lobby is pleasant the bar is great  and the hotel generally quite nice. The rooms are basic and bit dated  and the beds aren't the most comfortable but it's acceptable.    The pool area is very nice (although obviously being Jan/Feb  it was a bit cool outside)  and the food at the poolside restaurant was good quality. Service is excellent and the drinks kept flowing (both at the poolside  and in the main bar).  It also has a small gym and a SPA on site. Unfortunately  I didnt have time to book a massage but their prices seemed reasonable.    Overall for a quick trip funded by someone else it was a pleasant stay. Would I stay here on a vacation? Probably not as I prefer something a little more comfortable. But if I'm back on business and want easy access to the airport and Medina then it's perfectly suitable.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Thrapston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexSmith1969

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ukienomad wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Not a 5 Star hotel,Good location but not a 4.5 or 5 Star hotel as far as I’m concerned. Standard Rooms are a nice size with a sliding door that overlooks palm trees but you can’t go out; only has a small ledge so you can’t sit out. Decent size bathrooms with a. Ice size tub one sink a bidet and always hot water. Does have a small refrigerator and a safe in the room. No bathrobes or no conditioner in the bathroom. Beds and pillows were pretty comfortable. Didn’t have much contact with the staff so not sure of the friendliness. Breakfast had many options to choose from and an omelette bar and freshly made Naan bread. A variety of kinds of coffees are available from the machine. Pretty area in the atrium but they are doing construction there right now so you can’t walk in some of the areas. The hotel was nice but not awesome. They have a workout room spa and an outside pool. The is mosque is about a 20-30 minute walk to the Médina and the large souk where you’ll see snake charmers monkeys and entertainment of all kinds. I had greater expectations for this hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Tiffany H wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Customer Service Goes A Long Way,Normally I post reviews months after returning from a travel. I checked in earlier today and have been so impressed with the level of customer service I wanted to post a review before today ended. If you're like me these reviews can be your deciding factor. I remember reading through the reviews and didn't know if I wanted to stay here or elsewhere. Let me say I am so happy I decided to stay.  So let's get my one drawback out the way so I can focus on all the good. Yes the property is a bit dated showing wear and tear in some areas. A replacement of the linens and curtains would really help. That is my only con to this property.  From check in I was greeted at my shuttle and assisted with my bags. Another gentleman greeted me right before I made it to the check in desk. I looked up a few seconds later and he had returned with warm mint tea. Nice touch and so yummy. The gentleman who checked me in was very polite and exchanged small talk as I hit checked in. I was recognized as a SPG member and provided an upgrade to an Executuve room with a pool view. The bellhop brought my bags to my room and explained different features of the hotel on the way up. Once in my room he provided some details of room operations. Check in and getting to my room were fairly typical experiences. However I doubt you'd be surprised how often these things don't go so well.  Shortly after getting to my room I head out to have lunch by the pool. The waiter please forgive me I'm horrible with names helped me decide on something for lunch. From there I hang by the pool for about an hour. I return to my room where I had placed the food mot disturb sign out to find flowers waiting for me. I'm not sure if this is something for Valentine's Day or how loyalty guests are welcomed the first time or anytime fir that matter. I must admit I blushed.  I decide to relax in my room until dinner. By now I had removed the do not disturb sign as I knew I'd be awake. Right before I'm about to head out fur dinner I get a knock. It's housekeeping. I get to the door and I'm greeted with a letter a chocolate square and two bottled waters. At this point I'm grateful and puzzled at the same time. I don't think I've ever had quite a welcome to a property. I mean I've been giving a Welcome Drink coupon or two or even a fruit basket. However I've never had customer service with the extras like this. Everyone is smiling greeting and so polite.  I highly recommend this property for your upcoming stay. There's restaurants a sports bar (open at night) a pool gift shop etc. Also it's not far from the airport. When I was driving in I saw what appeared to be tourist out and about taking pictures. That makes me feel safe about the area. Tomorrow I will venture out a bit as there's a bank nearby. I need to exchange money for The Medina (market/souq).,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanyh149

It offer the hospitality of a great group with its services quality and professionalism. Mohammed the doorman or Lamia at the reception or the concierge (forgot the name) are rally great people and know how to deal with the guest. Breakfast is unbelievable ready made omelette fresh pancakes and marroccaine bread fruit and a wide selection of pastries. Rooms are clean and service is made the right way.

We broke it up with our desert tour on the 2nd night (checked our bags after the first night and then came back after our night ""camping"" in the desert for 2 more nights) so we got to see two different rooms.    The good:  -BREAKFAST IS AMAZING...it was a great spread and we were able to eat outside on the patio most days. The buffet and fresh eggs were pretty extensive and similar to most European/luxury hotel spreads but the fresh msemmen were absolutely incredible!  -It's a relatively easy walk to both the new and the old sections of the city. (about 20 minutes to the Medina) It's also super easy and cheap to get a mini-cab if you go out to the street.  -Great service at the restaurant and throughout the hotel. They gave us two nice rooms that were big and worked hard to make everything run smoothly for us.  -There is a gym though it's not anything special    Where they could improve:  -It is definitely a bit dated. I've stayed at quite a few Le Meridiens and this one was not quite the same level of luxury that I envision when booking.  -The bed wasn't awful but when we went to our next 2 hotels we were amazed at the difference.

We had lunch one day at the pool restaurant and it was very good with a 'normal' range of western hotel dishes as well as some local ones. The Moroccan Rose was a bonus!    The only downside was the bar area which really lacked any form of atmosphere. Nice attentive waiters but that couldn't make up for the empty disco feel.

Try out the food in the souks and on the main square. Be careful with tuk tuk carriage taxi drivers excursion sellers they might take more than expected so don't forget to bargain. You are supposed to.  Ouryka valley is nice place to see but a waterfall on the top of the hill isn't so interesting (and you need to be fit to climb there). Try out argan butter there delicious!

Le Meridien N'Fis,Districtdweller wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Solid Western hotel near the Medina,My wife and I used SPG points to book four nights at the Le Meridien in January 2018. We got upgraded to an executive level room which was quite spacious and comfortable. The hotel was a 15-20 minute walk to the Medina and every can-driver in town knew where it was. While it didn't have the charm of a Riad the hotel was a nice refuge from the sometimes-chaotic Medina and the staff was extremely helpful. It was too cold for us to enjoy the grounds but the pool and gardens (and tennis courts) looked lovely. The room was a bit dated but that was somewhat expected given the reviews we'd read and the small number of points required.

I booked a garden view room but really had no view at all and the walls were paper thin so you could hear every time one of the other guests open and closes their doors or talked in the hall way. When I asked about tour guide recommendations the staff was less than helpful. The towels are dingy and the bath mat was not changed and had a hole in it.

Le Meridien N'Fis,249Jamal95 wrote a review Dec 2017,30,Adequate at best but good location,We booked two rooms at this Hotel and visited just before Xmas as a family of three adults. Being an international chain we were told to expect a better standard than the locally owned hotels which we were told looked better in pictures then the reality. Unfortunately for us this also applied to the Meridien N'Nifs as when we arrived the heating didn't work in the first room and we were moved to a second room on the same floor but the room was infested with ants the excuse was that it was on the ground floor. We were then moved to the second floor where the heating didn't work either so we were provided with a portable electric heather. The rest of the facilities in the room were adequate but looked 'tired' and the general standard was not of a five star hotel as claimed by the Hotel. For a double occupancy room we were not provied with a second bath robe and had to ask a few times before we were obliged. The grounds of the hotel and the breakfast were very good with lots of choice and it also has a great garden facilities such as complimentary tennis. I wish I could write a better review for this place which could easily be a great place to stay in with updating as it has a great location in Hevernage area of Marrakesh. At the moment it has all the hallmarks of a cold indifference of an international chain with clientele to match as the place didn't have any vibes of rest of the customers having a great time or being obviously happy or friendly.

The staff are very professional and helpful. The lobby and gardens are beautiful. The swimming pool area was very pleasant with cabanas and sun lounders and always an attendant on site to provide you with a towel or set up the umbrella for you.    The room was spacious and with a nice view to the gardens. New toiletries were provided every day as well as new towels. The temperatures outside hit the 45C on the day of our arrival and we could notice that the air conditioning was struggling to keep the room cool. However once the temperature went down to 40C the AC went back to a good performance.    We had breakfast at the hotel every day and we thought it was of a very good quality and with a wide variety of food types. They had Moroccan breakfast with very nice harissa soup and a cook that would prepare crepes and other food right there for you as well as plenty of cold meats cheese fruit salads cereal and hot choices such as scrambled eggs potatoes and so on. We had dinner once on the restaurant by the pool it was a buffet and we thought it was nice.    The hotel is located just opposite a shopping mall with a Carrefour and plenty of restaurants you just cross the street and can shop for anything you need or try one of the restaurants on the top floor terrace where there is also an entertainment area/arcade with small ice-skating area for kids.

The window coverings had seen far better days and just looked dirty. Although we were part of a tour group we definitely deserved a better dinner than we received our first night at the hotel. I am not exaggerating when I say the food provided by the hotel was absolutely the worst meal we had during our 15 day trip to Morocco. If cold and tasteless was the aim they definitely achieved that. The only redeeming factor was the location of the hotel. It is across the street from the Menara Mall so you have other dining options. It is also about a 20 minute walk to the main square and souk.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Thornton, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newmexone

Le Meridien N'Fis,madibhai wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Great Location / Beautiful Grounds and Service / Dated Rooms,The Good:    Good location - across from the Menara Mall - has a super market there you can buy everything. An ATM as well to get cash. The mall has a food court and a kids entertainment area that is open until 1030-11. Short walk to the Souks the Medina the Qutubia Mosque - about 20 minutes. You can cab it for for 50DH    The grounds of this hotel are wonderful. All of these plants and flowers everywhere. Large pool with a lot of chairs and semi private areas to just relax. A few pool side restaurants as well. The hotel has restaurants in it but we didn't try them.    The staff is very attentive and definitely try to make your stay the best possible. Specifically Imad at the front desk is super helpful. They give you tea as soon as you walk in. Nice people and nice lobby.    Also a short ride from the airport.    The Bad:    The rooms are old the hallways are old. This doesn't look like a Meridien. It seems like a lower category hotel category 1 Meridien is surprising but this is exactly what it is. The wifi kept on going in and out even though we were upgraded to the higher level wifi it still wasn't that strong. The towels are thin and old. Just seems like an old place.    Overall - it is 2800-3000 points a night or $80-$95 a night centrally located adequate facilities with so so wifi in your room.    Still worth staying here and I would stay here again.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,new york,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madibhai

Should spend a bit of time strolling through the gardens and pool area as it makes good photo ops. The rooms are big and comfortable albeit a bit dated. Service is very friendly and English is spoken proficiently by the staff. Location is convenient. Foodwise...so so quality and quite expensive.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jonathan C wrote a review Nov 2017,40,4 Nights in Marrakech,My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel is very nice as were the staff. My only complaint is that it's a bit outdated but overall quite nice. As an SPG Platinum member I was offered the complimentary daily breakfast which was very good. However there are no suites at the hotel for room upgrades. The internet was also quite slow but we didn't use it too much.    The hotel is in a good area across from a mall and large grocery store but it is a bit far from the main tourist areas. The walk from the hotel is along a busy street (with sidewalks) and takes about 30 min to reach the main square (2.5 km / 1.5 mi). We took the bus from the airport for 30 dirham and the Le Meridian is the 1st stop about 10 min away (well it would't been if the bus driver didn't miss it which it then became the last stop!) Leaving the hotel the concierge called us a taxi who didn't use the meter and charged us 150 dirham! Not the hotel's fault I suppose but we should have had them negotiate the price with the driver beforehand.    Overall it was a nice stay and would definitely return.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanC1001
Le Meridien N'Fis,Sarah P wrote a review Nov 2017,40,"Great hotel, escaping from the busy city",The hotel is great to combine your city trip to Marrakech with a bit of sunbathing and relaxing near the amazing pool area. Marrakech can be quiet overwhelming so after exploring the city we had lovely afternoons at the pool. The main areas of the hotel are great beautiful garden nice hotel bar. The rooms though could definitely use a touch up which I believe once this is done the hotel will be one of the best places to stay if you choose not to stay in a city riad. Very convenient is the Menara mall across the street where you can enjoy nice local breakfast at the many restaurants with outside terraces.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahP_Amsterdam

Yes the rooms are a little tired need a referb but they were very clean and house keeping done a great job.    As soon as I entered the hotel with my wife the staff were on me like a swarm of bees doing anything to make my stay for my wife and I as comfortable as can be.    The staff couldn't do enough from wheeling my chair for me to helping me up and down the odd step.    Where the rooms lack in upkeep they make up in service. Probably the best staff I have encountered on any holiday ever.    At the end of the day we didn't spend a lot of time in our room we went there to see Marrakech and sometimes its the people and staff that make the hotel not the lack of a lick of paint.    I would definitely recommend this hotel had a great stay big thanks to the staff you guys made our holiday.  ps    The breakfast was wonderful.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Herefordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyf183

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jennifer S wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Wonderful city,This hotel is extremely comfortable and the location was perfect for us as we used the taxi services which are not expensive. This enabled us to get a good view of the city both the old part and the new. It is situated opposite a shopping mall which is extremely useful and rather attractive. Mind how you cross the dual carriageway!!!    The grounds of the hotel are spectacular and very well cared for. The pool area is lovely and also well cared for with a reasonable cafe close by.  The room although must have been quite luxurious when new is somewhat jaded and needs a facelift.  The foyer and other parts are extremely well decorated in typical Moroccan style so giving a really good impression to visitors.  There is a restaurant but in my view is a waste of time and appears rather half hearted.    The staff could not be faulted always ready to assist. In all  I would definitely recommend.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Staines, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifersL9209YM

Stayed by myself and was upgraded to a suite and had an array of local foods and a bottle of wine waiting for me in my room. The food lasted my entire stay and I still couldn't finish it all. There was also breakfast included if you had status which was decent. It was walk-able to the train station (15-20 min) and a bit far from the city center (20-30 min) but it did the trick for a quick stay.

You can immediately notice how outdated the property looks. It could use a fresh paint job to bring out the bright colors of it's former life. It seemed a bit deserted too no where near capacity. The pool was nice to relax but again just seemed like it needed a bit of life.    Elevators broke down a couple times while we stayed there and we had to use either the service elevator or the stairs.

Le Meridien N'Fis,mav68 wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Room Needs Refurbishment,The hotel is located 1.7km away from Koutoubia (it is a mosque and the highest tower in Marrakech). It is about 25 mins walk or just a short taxi ride away (10 mins about 20-30 MAD). The Koutoubia is very closed to the old town where the Souks is.    There is a shopping mall opposite the hotel which is called Menara Mall. It has nothing much to shout about. There are a few eatery outlets which is good though. Carrefour is located on ground floor and the basement you can get virtually anything here where food is concerned.    The hotel has a nice lobby particularly at night. It has a great pool area as well.    The room is very huge which is good but the deco is lack of Moroccan and it is time to get a complete overhaul. The bathroom is old the bed linen towel is old ... it is definitely not those nice Meridien you have tried overseas.

The property itself is well protected making you feel secure at all times. The pool is huge and very opulent and has a nice view of the mountain ranges in the back. The pool is surrounded by greenery that is very well managed and aesthetically appealing. The rooms were top notch with Moroccan furnishings and very large. I had a sitting room huge bathroom that with ordinate finishings. The shower was also large and had waterfall facets.  The service here was fantastic. My room had fruit and a bottle of wine waiting for me. The front door attendants helped me with my bags to my room and were very helpful on suggestions in the city and hailing a cab at a fair price.  The free breakfast buffet for Platinum members have both American and Moroccan offerings and they will even cook a lot of foods in front of you and describe to you what it is. All the juices are freshly pressed also.  I also was able to get the room for 2000 points a night on SPG and this is incredibly cheap and a steal for the value.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Southside wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Surprisingly nice,Forgot to post earlier about my wife's and my stay at this hotel for about four nights back in April. I want to post now because we liked it quite a bit.    One thing that surprised me about the hotel was that we liked the location. I wrestled with whether to stay at a riad in or right near the medina. But having stayed at a couple of nice riads earlier in our trip through Morocco and having seen how hectic and jammed much of the medina is at night we didn't feel deprived by not staying there. Also the neighborhood the hotel is in very nice though not exotic with some good hotels and restaurants within walking distance and a convenient though limited shopping center (but including a supermarket that has a good selection of wine and liquor) across the road.    Our room also was a pleasant surprise. Perhaps we got a refurbished one? Anyway it did not seem old and worn out the way some folks have described rooms here. It was a ground floor room with a patio facing on some gardens so a pleasant place to hang out at some times of the day.    In fact I'd definitely recommend getting a ground floor room for the patio since I don't believe many or any other rooms have balconies. I'm sure there are some sides of the hotel where the patio views and settings are a bit nicer than others but can't recall which they'd be.    Beyond that...beautiful grounds and nice competent staff including the fellow at the door and the woman who seems to fun most of the show behind the front desk.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oakland, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Southside

There was a body hair on the tray which held their shampoo etc . I cringed when seeing this. Waited 2 days to see if it got removed by housekeeping....did it? No! Had to remove it myself. Urgh! Shower curtain had mould on. Not very hygenic. Towels had a very odd smell to them...m ? My Little boy wouldn't allow me to take towel near his face.    Drawers were falling apart in one of the bedrooms.    Breakfast choice was limited. The day i went for breakfast at 6.30/7am the 2 things i had (paratha and omlette) were not available although breakfast is meant to be served from 6.30 to 10.30.    The pool was nice. Kids enjoyed.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Mizan A wrote a review Aug 2017,10,NEVER AGAIN... very poor service,I was recommended this hotel by a friend who travels to Marrakech 4 times a year. However as a family place I would never recommend it to anyone. The service was very poor. No kettles in the room thus you couldn't make a cup of tea if you wanted one and if did order one from room service (first you would be like to get through) you would get one about an hour after ordering.    Breakfast was very poor too with little choice and coffee machines not working. Notwithstanding breakfast started at 6.30am it was very rare to see all the choices out at the time. I asked for a tea spoon during breakfast the waiter nearly snapped my head off when barked WAIT.    Found staff not as helpful as one would expect from a Hotel with this standing. We had our little boy's life jacket stolen from the back porch of the room. When we reported it we were told (very unsympathetically) nothing can be done. Found the staff rather rude. The female staff member at reception was very stuck up not wishing to engage as if she did not really care. Other items from the back porch went missing too. So be careful in putting anything out to dry as they may go missing and the staff would rarely assist.    Only decent thing about this hotel it is right in front of the Mall and had a nice pool for the kids. If you want to be next to the mall better of booking the Savoy pay a bit more likely to get a better service.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/208mizana

Le Meridien N'Fis,IanEastLondon wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Very good and centrally located near everything but with quiet ambience,The hotel is very centrally located in Marrakesh on one of its main roads.    I received excellent fast and friendly service when i stayed there for a period of 6 days.    The hotel has a excellent range of services for business guests and holiday makers. It has an extensive array of well maintained facilities spread across a large plot of land. The gym and spa area is large enough and filled with modern equipment which is conducive to rigourous workouts and recovery and beauty treatments. The business centre is well resourced and open 24/7. Hotel's WiFi services are easy to use and good and at the nearby cellular shop in the Mall one can even purchase a local SIM and very cheap prepaid data and voice packages or top up with fast up-and download speeds.    The rooms are very comfortable large enough for singles or families and secure. The staff especially at front desk and front door are friendly and knowledgeable about hotel services the city and its sights. They also albeit when asked know the appropriate charge rate and can find/arrange/negotiate the best prices for taxis which to the uninitiated can usually be twice or thrice more if you decide to negotiate it with the taxi driver.    The hotel is on the doorstep of a mid sized shopping mall that has a major cellular (mobile service provider) retailer a range of shops (sports and jewelr grocery/ covenience clothing shoes etc.) and it has an excellent food court near the rooftop area and restuarants on the floor level There is even an ATM to wihdraw local currency etc. A pharmacy is nearby as well.    Small areas for improvement (during my stay in mid July 2017) were: 1) replacing the two coffee machines at the breakfast area so that they don't break down as usually as they did 2) fixing the Starwood TV channel in the rooms so that it smoothly plays their advertising videos without any loss of picture/ sound etc.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,East London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanEastLondon
Le Meridien N'Fis,pranjals wrote a review Jul 2017,30,"Very Average, avoid this place",Firstly: There is a serious attitude problem among the staff. They refuse to speak english or in general dont care to talk to an english speaker.    Secondly: There is little or no regard for SPG status. As a platinum member we had communicated our needs to them before and on arrival we were told that we dont get anything special.    Third: This property is very old and housekeeping is barely tolerable. Dont ask for a tea/coffee machine because they dont provide it. The breakfast is lackluster. The area is far from everything except for a mall which is practically empty.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ed C wrote a review Jul 2017,40,"Nominally A Top Hotel, But Niggling Annoyances",As a top hotel goes this one had all the expected amenities as well as some beautiful gardens. Unfortunately It really does not understand modern international digital clientele. The WiFi was weak in our room and while it did have some electrical outlets on the counter they were too close to the counter-top to be usable. Modern international tourists tend to travel with combination electrical plug adapters which may include USB ports. All of these adapters tend to have a common form factor and for Europlugs require some support at the bottom of the outlet.

The lobby garden and common areas looked amazing but the rest of the property certainly did not live up to the Le Meridian brand standard. Carpets were peeling off in the corridors lights in lifts were not working room doors were flimsy and the deadbolt did not work. Worst of all tons of used cutlery and china from room service were left along the corridor which made the place smell stale. There is a door beside the lift which the staff used where there were a lot more used cutlery and china from room service behind it. They were just strewn on the floor and looked extremely unhygienic. The towels in the room were not white at all (more beige) which is unacceptable of a self proclaimed 5 star SPG hotel.

The personnel with whom I had contact were pleasant and helpful. The location is fine...just across from a shopping mall. The room was clean. The bed and bedding were comfortable. Complaint: The bell person/baggage handler literally dropped a small bag in the room. Ouch!  I had dinner in the hotel at a buffet. It was better than I expected. As a clam lover the mussels were very good...ditto the veggie salads. There was fish beef with gravy baby shrimp etc. Cream puffs and small chocolate cakes for desert were also quite good.  I returned for the breakfast buffet and was pleased once again. There was an egg station preparing omelets and eggs to order. There was a companion station with a chef preparing tortillas/oil/eggs/semolina. (I don't know the name.) There was a smoothie station. And of course the usual fruit and baked goods. They also had sausage and mini burgers. All in all a very nice buffet breakfast.

We approached the front desk of the hotel and were greeted by Fatima Zahra who offered to help. Not only did she provide us with great suggestions for keeping ""in touch"" using certain apps but then she handed us her personal phone and told us to call home to help put our minds at ease.

The hotel grounds were a delightful oasis of floral colour and fountains.  We were so busy during our stay we did not get to use the pool and similar facilities.  Breakfast was good though the restaurant can get noisy not helped by music being played one morning with very strong bass through a Bose sound system which was frankly headache-inducing (the reason I have not awarded 5 stars).  We spent 4 nights here sadly we could not spend more.  A rose on our pillow one evening was a nice touch.

Le Meridien N'Fis,ChristopherMW wrote a review May 2017,20,Dirty and tired and not worth the price. I would not recommend.,"The goods: Beautiful gardens and pool area. The Malin & Goetz products in the bathroom. Breakfast was ok nothing spectacular good selection of juices but nothing to stir the juices with and as a result were mostly water when you did pour.    I'm trying to be objective and fair in writing this and have saved it for the last in order to present the concerns fairly. Upon arriving on the SPG preferred Guest floor the first thing you notice is the carpeting and that is is grossly stained and for the majority of the length of the hallway had come away from the frame work that it was to be attached to on the floor exposing the strapping it was to be nailed/glued to. Halfway down the hall there was a large gap where the two carpets did't even meet. It was as if they were going to be ripping the carpet later in the day and replacing it this however was not the case. We arrived in the room dropped our bags and went back out again with out having a closer look. This was to have been the crowning touch on our stay in Morocco we thought we would end in a top class Hotel but it was far from it. The bathroom was very dirty with black mould along the bathtub and the tiles and behind the door on the floor the dirt was caked into the corner big chunk of the tile missing from bath room floor. The fridge when you opened the door wobbled in its framework and the back mould again around the inside was gross. I went to the front desk and asked one of the ladies behind the desk if they were doing renovations on the third floor of the ATLAS wing as it was in very rough shape and I wasn't really impressed the response was a bland ""No not that she knew of "" and with that walked away. The next morning I asked if we canceled the rest of our stay because we were not happy another lady said this is an online booking I'll have to find out ( it was booked on the SPG website) and again I mentioned we were not impressed and explained why I was offered to move no apology what so ever. She said she would waive any cancellation fee's if there were any. I was travelling with my best friend and I wanted this to be a treat to him so the decision was his if we stayed or left. The decision was to stay as we had putt our cloths in the dresser after checking how clean it was and it was going to be a hassle to check out and find another hotel and to pack everything up and move to another room. As a result we just limited the time we spent in the room. The drinking glass I asked for on the first day stayed dirty in the same spot on the desk for the entire 5 days garbage ( discarded apple core ) stayed in the in the bathroom garbage can for two days. For 180.00 a night very very disappointed.    The ladies in the spa were not very welcoming and was if you were disturbing them with your questions as a result decided not to use which is unfortunate as would have enjoyed the hamam. I did not use the workout area but my friend did and he said it was basic but good.    Given the choice of beautiful high end Riads that came in around the same price point when we were booking this trip I now wish I'd booked a Riad where I would have felt more like a valued and welcome guest rather that just another check in.",Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ottawa, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristopherMW

Le Meridien N'Fis,steven m wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Enjoyed it so much that I doubled my length of stay,I had intended two stay two nights but was so delighted that I extended for a total of four nights. This property exudes a lot of charm and real hospitality. Every staff member I came in contact with was warm cordial and outgoing. Greeted upon arrival with a traditional glass of Moroccan mint tea I was brought to a third-story room with a view of the tranquil gardens. This first room I stayed in exuded the well-worn manier of an aged relative sort of chic but also with some antique furnishings. A bowl of fruit a vase of roses and a bottle of mineral water magically appeared when out of the room. These charming touches make an SPG member feel very welcome. The Malin + Goetz amenities were also nice and the cleaning staff were tremendous. Housekeeping brought two bottles of water and placed a chocolate on the bed every day just before dinner.    Ultimately after two nights I decided to switch to a ground-floor room so as to have an outdoor terrace. These rooms I can highly recommend; the furnishings seemed slightly nicer and as I entered the room the maintenance staff had just touched up the paint in two places -- it felt very fresh and the outdoor space was magnificent.    Just across the street from the property there is a shopping mall with Maroc Telecom banking and huge Carrefour with great selection of food alcohol and appetizing items. So my terrace was the perfect place for a quiet apéro with a Russian friend who had been traveling for two months in Morocco.    The swimming pool area is also very tastefully furnished and charming; it's a great place to unwind after a long hot day of sightseeing. The guests seem to disappear after 6pm and by 7pm you might have the large pool entirely to yourself!    Finally the breakfast buffet was sumptuous and has many many items. While typically not included with a Starpoints award reservation the price is certainly reasonable and worth paying extra especially as the award nights are so reasonable. Did not try the other hotel venues as friends recommended several excellent restaurants but also found the Cafe Extrablatt just a few blocks away to be fantastic.    I especially liked the hotel's location adjacent to the upscale Gueliz neighborhood -- very refreshing to be here in such a quiet place after a long day sightseeing or wandering through the Medina. The railway station is within easy walking distance or a quick taxi ride away.    Finally I noticed the concierge was remarkable. A hapless British couple with three noisy children wanted a guide to the Medina and voila within ten minutes the most charming fellow appeared and whisked them all away. Such a well-connected concierge is yet another reason to cherish a property such as this.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenm00001

Walk across the street and you are at the new mall central to the new city development. Walk down the street toward the tower and you find yourself in the old city.

Le Meridien N'Fis,MissVirdee wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Not bad,This is my 5th visit to Marrakesh so in a nutshell:    The Best Things:  -Hotel is opposite the Menara mall which has many many restaurants which are much more affordable compared to the hotel. Mall also has many lovely shops  -The pool has 1.3m 1.4m and a kids pool which is below my knee  -The Breakfast is nice continental cold food and hot breakfast also moroccan fresh pancakes a good selection.  -The gardens are very nice and very large  -my friend had a bee sting the man from reception came running out with the first aid box  -The bathrobes and slippers are nice and not too heavy  -its just 5mins drive from the Airport    The Bad Things:  -i was told i will be upgraded to a superior deluxe garden room...on arrival i was so let down. as it wasn't as i had hoped. I went to reception and the lady with curly hair didn't seem to care. she said i had to wait 2 days to be changed to a different room.  -None of the rooms in the hotel have a balconyits a small space of 1ft with no outside table or chair  -the money exchange counter in reception is always shut when we go there for two days we went without dhirams.  -the lady on reception with dark curly hair is rather rude and abrupt however all the men are are ok.  -you can be waiting at the reception desk for a long time before someones actually acknowledges you  -we ordered a taxi to the airport and it hadn't arrived i had to remind reception twice before it finally came.  -The rooms are very old and plain not up to the 4 star standard. in London this room would be classified as a 2 star .. see my pics  -The room fridge was filthy with not a lot to offer...see my pics  - you can hear people in the room above moving tables and chairs. You can hear people talking laughing in the corridor.  -there was no tv guide like most hotels have eg. channels 100-200 News 200-300 Movies 300-400 Bollywood  -wifi didn't always work it asks you to pay for a certain amount of gb /mb. When i went to reception the woman with the dark curly wasn't helpful she just wanted to get rid of me but next day the man at reception tapped in a few things and it was ok.  -the dinner buffet was £23 which really isn't worth it. You get more for your money at Menara mall or Extra Blatt    Next time I will stay at the Es Saadi Hotel- friendly hotel just 7 min walk frm Meridien,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissVirdee
Le Meridien N'Fis,Dave B wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"Wonderful stay in Marrakech, impeccable customer service",First time to Morocco and to Marrakech. Apart from having a great time in the city the service we received from the hotel was 10/10. Youssef and Taoufiq and the bell staff were the best I've ever experience.    In our explorations we purchased some goods from the local market and had to make arrangements to ship them home to Canada. Unfortunately we had planned too much and only had 24 hours to figure out the logistics. Youssef and Taoufiq were incredibly helpful and made all the necessary calls to organize everything for us - short of paying for us they did everything.

Le Meridien N'Fis,RickY wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Great Place Centre Of Everything,Hi    A great hotel very nice and cosy with marble interiors.    Few bullet points to help people.    We traveled from the UK.    1. Merina mall is opposite (not very good for shops all local top brands very empty)    Great restaurants outside across the road pizzas kebabs etc etc.    Also has a supermarket like tesco sort. Get everything you need there including alcohol.    2. Great Chinese restaurant with live singer etc across the road too called Buddha bar. Stunning interior.    3. To go to most places in a cab it costs 10min travel around 30/40dirim. Locals always try rip you off and never a set rate. They will always say yes no problems etc.    At night cabs tend to do the same and say it's double fair but we just give a bit more as it's a new place for us.    Please note they never have change so please take small notes or your money will be gone.    3. Have to go to the massage place i think called la bonia it's amazinggggg scrub you down and teas and relax and brilliant atmosphere. It's around £20 for one but you can do a couple one same room for all treatment it's really fun.    4. The markets (very very dangerous if you don't like people annoying u every second to buy things) keep your bags close. I wouldn't recommend this place but if u want cheap magnets then fine or just get out to save your holiday fun.    Another greattt restaurant my personal favourite was place called Azar. It is stunning food good priced and includes sisha upstairs and belly dances around 10pm. It's really a place to be it's stunning.    Airport from and to is around 15min drive away so very very close.    Moneys can be changed at the airport without any issues.    Camel rides are awsome too it costs around 200dirhms each for about hour or riding. Again about 15min drive from hotel.    You get shops like H&M etc in the other malls which are good but not cheap so save your money.    Also it's a must to go to the atlas mountains waterfall    But....It's two hours away drive....But worth it.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jennifer C wrote a review Mar 2017,40,"Beautiful grounds, needs a refresh but worth it",This property is in an excellent location of Marrakech and across the street from a shopping mall with restaurants and a Carrefour grocery store. The grounds are gorgeous with lovely blooming gardens and a tranquil pool area. The common areas are tastefully decorated and the staff is attentive and welcoming. Our room was on the 5th floor facing the back of the property and I recommend this location because it was quiet and comfortable to sleep with the juliette balcony doors open. In the mornings we would have coffee on the terrace in the garden and it was relaxing and felt worlds away from the bustle of the medina. My only criticism is that the rooms and hallways need to be refreshed and I understand that this is about to happen. The size of the room was perfect but I found the decor dated and worn. The rugs in the hallways were stained and old. Aside from needing a refresh this property is a gem.  Tips: Table du Marche across the street does a good and inexpensive lunch/dinner. Avoid the others except the dessert place (forgetting the name but they do an excellent ice cream). Negotiate the petit taxi (the chartruse ones for 3 people) to J'ma al Fna for 20 DHS during the day and 30 DHS at night. Get the taxi yourself don't have the hotel people get it or you will overpay.

Le Meridien N'Fis,DCM2211 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Excellent hotel not far from the Medina,Many visitors to Marrakech prefer to stay at a Riad in the Medina. If however you want something a bit less hectic and with more facilities then Le Meridien N'Fis is a great option. It is about a 15 minute walk from the Medina or a 5 minute taxi. It is situated in the upscale part of town (L'Hivernage) leafy boulevardssmart restaurants and apartments.  We stayed here for 2 nights. It was very comfortable. The room was perfect (good size with everything you would expect). Water and fruit were left in our room each day.  The pool and pool are were excellent set in lush gardens and there was a clay tennis court for use by residents.  Service was friendly and attentive. The hotel accommodated us with a late check out which was great.  We ate breakfast here. It was the usual buffet style extravaganza. Quality was good especially the fresh juices.  So in summary this is an excellent option in Marrakech given its location facilitiesservice and value for money (we paid c €125 B&B). I would have no hesitation in staying here again.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCM2211

Le Meridien N'Fis,Richard G wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Nice staff but nothing to make me return,I spent three days at Le Meridien N’Fis trying to find reasons to rate it higher than Average however having stayed at about ten other Le Meridiens throughout the Middle East and Asia I ultimately left feeling there was no reason to reward this hotel with a better rating.    There was nothing here that left me feeling that the hotel cared that I was there or if I’d ever bother to return. If this was an unbranded 3* or maybe 4* property in a touristy destination then it would be fine however it is a Le Meridien and there are brand standards and expectations that this hotel failed to meet.    I know that there are numerous four and five star reviews here and I can only assume that these are from people who have never stayed at a Le Meridien before or they are simply thrilled to be on a package tour that has put them in the kind of hotel that provides soap in the bathroom.    Check in was fine and I was thanked for being a Platinum member of the hotel’s loyalty scheme SPG. However this was where the recognition ended. The SPG app showed me as having been allocated an Executive Room with its own Private Terrace (which by its nature must be on the ground floor because otherwise you’d break your neck from the fall) however I was given what had to be a standard room on the next floor up so why modify my reservation to show an upgrade when I wasn’t given one (and I know that other Platinums have been given suites when available as required by the SPG programme so why I was upgraded to an Executive Room electronically and then not given one at check in is beyond me). This is the first time as a SPG Platinum that I’ve not had a recognisable room upgrade. I’m not being entitled by making this observation - I reward Starwood with more than 75 nights of my hotel stays every year and the hotels are supposed to reward me back. I was there mid week in February which is wildly low season so it was hardly packed.    No matter I was there to spend time with my sisters not sit out on the terrace.    The room itself was clean and parts of it have been refurbished and replaced recently. Some of the wood furniture and plastic electric outlets looked old but the refurbishment did a decent job of sprucing up the bedroom and bathroom. The king size bed was good and I slept well. In the room there were no tea/coffee making facilities which is a really basic amenity for a hotel of this type and in the bathroom there was no toothbrush or shaving kit which I have had at every other Le Meridien I’ve stayed at. Also no international plug sockets which is unusual in an international hotel these days. The hot water pressure in the shower was very low and enabled only a slightly-warm shower when mixing it with enough cold to keep the shower flowing. The internet was erratic and required multiple logins throughout the stay with speeds and usability ranging from great at 5am to totally unusable in the afternoon.    The breakfast buffet was a solid 3*/4* offering with mostly preserved/tinned fruits and Danone yogurt pots in a land where fermented milk is a staple food. The omelet lady was a star. In fact most of the staff were friendly and I liked the fact that the hotel clearly has a policy of employing older and seasoned hotel professionals rather than just take on cheap young things to deal with guests. I also like the fact that the hotel offers the Make A Green Choice housekeeping option whereby you get 500 SPG points for not having your bedclothes and towels changed. This was offered to me as a tick box when I made the reservation on the SPG web site and I also hung the MAGC banner on my door handle for the duration of my stay. Sure enough my bed was not made (although the bins were emptied so I know somebody had been in there). However when my stay points posted a week after check out sure enough the 500 MAGC points were not there meaning I’ve had to contact both the hotel and SPG for them. If a hotel offers this option (and my bed wasn’t made while I was there) then they should honour it without the guest having to check and chase two weeks later.    It cost an incredible D100 in a taxi for the short journey from the airport to the hotel (and D70 back on the last day). Taxis to the medina were D20-30. One day we walked it in about 20 minutes which is altogether better for your health and blood pressure than negotiating with taxi drivers (this is a city crying out for the rigour of Uber). Across the road is a shopping mall with a Carrefour where they “accidentally” charged our credit card more than £800 for 48 small cans of local beer and then spent more than 15 minutes to reverse the transaction after some agitation. There’s a bank to the right of the shopping mall but the hotel offered fair rates of exchange for sterling cash.    It sounds like I’m just finding reasons to dislike this hotel and really it wasn’t awful however it didn’t give me any reason to come back unless I really needed the SPG qualifying nights. The only material Platinum benefit I got was the 500 bonus points at check in (just like a Design Hotel) because of course there’s no Club Lounge or happy hour drinks and breakfast was already paid for in the room rate.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bangkok, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarichard
Le Meridien N'Fis,SuperTraveler100 wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Solid 3 star Hotel. Rooms need renovation.,Overall solid 3 star hotel. Great staff and pretty good location right across the mall. As other reviews have mentioned rooms do need a massive renovation. As we came into our room the toilet did not flush properly (Splashes all over the place) sheets needed to be changed as they were dirty and towels were rough. Upgraded as a gold member to the executive room was older and the halls especially the carpets are in desperate need of changing and repair. We were disappointed that on the website it mentioned that AC is provided yet there was no AC. The day we arrived was extremely hot so we requested a fan and was provided one. Rooms smelled musty as there was little ventilation and appliances/cabinets were old. The free wifi also needs to be improved. Was not very reliable and disconnected everytime we came back to the room.    The grounds however are very nice. The pool and the gardening are very well taken care of and the gym is in ok condition.    Depending on what price point you are at this is a overall a good 3 star hotel at best.

Le Meridien N'Fis,bohemian1011 wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Nice hotel in a good location,My wife and 9-year old son and I stayed in an Ambassador Suite at Le Meridien N'Fis in February 2017. We were quite happy with our stay. The grounds were quiet and beautiful the staff polite and professional and it was in a excellent location for our purposes. We ate breakfast in the hotel each morning but didn't end up trying either of the restaurants on site for dinner - choosing to eat out in town instead. The suite was somewhat dated but it was large and had one and a half bathrooms which was nice. I do a fair bit of research before I get to a location but when we arrived I was surprised to find a four-storey modern mall directly across the street from the hotel - with a huge arcade and kid-friendly food. It was certainly not something we were looking for in Marrakech but ended up coming in handy to entertain my son as a reward his good behavior during the day. There were camel rides available a two-minute walk from the hotel and we felt safe and comfortable walking all around the area.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bohemian1011

Furnishings were appropriate for the space but again very worn looking. The bed was one of the worst I've slept on in a long time very uncomfortable.    Breakfast was good and there were many selections to choose from. It's very chaotic at times when the restaurant is full...people walking from every direction. The second day we had an early departure and went to breakfast at 6:30am (opening) only to find it was half set up. No omelet chef no crepe station no napkins on any of the tables.

Upon checking in the gentleman (Adel) was very friendly and helpful. Before I went on my trip I have been in communication with the two amazing concierge Youssef & Toufiq! They were so helpful in booking me camel and quad ride and giving me great restaurant recommendation. Once I checked in Toufiq already knew who I was! (Youssef was off the first day) Every employee knew me by my last name and always greeted me when they saw me pass by the lobby. The next day Youssef was there and he already know who I was as well! The communication between all the employees were amazing. Another employee I want to recognize is Said Lachheb! Said helped me get a taxi to a restaurant in a area I was uncomfortable going to but I wanted to try out the restaurant (Dar Cherifa) badly! So Said called the restaurant to have someone pick me up from the main road and escort me back after I was done with dinner. He also booked me a taxi and made sure the same taxi came back for me to pick me up! I have never experienced such an amazing service at any other hotel!!

Le Meridien N'Fis,Hotbikes wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Make the most of the Le Meridien N'Fis Concierge Services,My family enjoyed a fantastic trip to Morocco largely made successful by the planning of the concierge at Le Meridien N’Fis particularly Mr Mamouni. The team here communicated with me via email for weeks before our trip with all of our options prices and dates so we knew exactly what to expect. I asked for suggestions of places to visit and he suggested visiting Essaouria and the Valleys of the Atlas Mountains. These two trips allowed us to see the diverse geography and cultures of Morocco. At our request Mr. Mamouni also arranged an excursion to the desert which included a fun off roading experience as well. He arranged for very knowledgeable and friendly guides who had very comfortable land cruisers for our tour helped us with shopping and were very flexible with our needs. Beyond planning activities Mr Mamouni also help us arrange phone and financial services at short notices and transport to and from the airport. I usually don’t engage with hotel concierges beyond restaurant reservations and tickets for entertainment but that was not the case here. The concierge services with Le Meridien N’Fis were essential to our trip to Morocco because in our effort to learn about the different Moroccan cultures we spent most of our time away from the hotel. I loved visiting Morocco’s cities but getting out to nature and the countryside was the best part of my trip.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotbikes

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jak M wrote a review Jan 2017,30,Well located but room disappointing,Stayed over Christmas/New Year booked through BA Holidays in Deluxe room with requested pool view by e-mail. Seven minute ride from airport. Reception said Deluxe rooms do not have pool view despite its website stating to contrary. Stamped my foot and asked to speak to Duty Manager. Was allegedly upgraded to Executive room with pool view on third floor in main building. Not convinced looked like a Superior room on website but it was buffered from traffic noise and call to prayer. Corridor dark and dimly lit. Room had floor tiling and painted walls rug each side of bed. Minibar under tv had water beer sodas. Safe above eye level in wardrobe. Only 7 coathangers. No tea/coffee making facilities. No information about hotel facilities - restaurants opening times local excursions - apart from Spa and laundry. Bathroom had tiled floor and walls with good lighting and hairdryer. TV had English news channels and one film channel. Lunch in café by pool. Bar served food from 5 p.m. Did not use Moroccan restaurant open at 7 p.m. Did use Al Menzeh restaurant accessed through garden and open at 7.30 p.m. - recommended. Youssef Mamouni Chief Concierge was excellent with advice and arranging excursions beyond Marrakech. He was very apologetic that an excursion to Ouarzazate departing at 7.15 a.m. had me doing the drop-off rounds of hotels for 1 hr. 35 mins returning to the hotel at 9.45 p.m. This was the excursion organiser's fault but Youssef did take it up with him.

Le Meridien N'Fis,winegaltravels wrote a review Jan 2017,30,Not as expected--more value than luxury,We stayed for only one night on New Years Eve. The highlight of this hotel is definitely the staff--especially the 2 concierges who were very helpful in making recommendations booking a car to the airport etc. Also the front door and bell staff were terrific!    The overall property and rooms are in need of updating though. I am a frequent Starwood traveller and this is not what I would expect from a property billed as a 5 star luxury hotel. If you are looking for a value hotel that is clean with some more amenities (pool several restaurants concierge spa) and in a central location this is probably a good pick.    The room decor was dated and showing wear the bedding was thin and not very soft (as were the towels) and the bathroom was very small and most in need of an update. There was only a tub/shower combo and the tile was very 80's. Others reviewers have commented on the non-working AC--that was our experience as well. There was a small refrigerator/mini bar stocked with a few soft drinks and sparkling water which was a nice touch.    This hotel is about a 20 min walk to the Medina and across the street to the Menara mall so a very central location. On the downside our room faced an inner courtyard and we could definitely hear the street noise.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winegaltravels

We were given a renovated king size bedroom and the staff could not be more accommodating. I believe the hotel overall is quite underrated given the other reviews I had read which initially made me quite hesitant on booking. I would suggest the hotel keeps a better supply of lower denomination currency as tip are greatly appreciated by the staff but often times they don't have anything less than 50 Dh. Concierge was very helpful. Pool was lovely and nice to sit by during a sunny December afternoon. The hotel is across the street from the mall which has a Carrefour you can purchase bottled water and alcohol at reasonable prices. We enjoyed the Starwood loyalty night within the bar as well great added bonus for SPG members recognising our loyalty. For us it was a nice reprieve from the hectic Medina and a quick taxi ride in. Do not pay more than 30 Dh each way for a taxi that is the fair ""tourist"" price. We also greatly appreciated the roundtrip taxis arranged in the evenings to avoid finding one on the street coming back after a nice meal.

We asked to cancel our reservation we were told this was not possible we went to the pool bar to have a drink to gather ourselves almost nothing available - I asked for gin and tonic - I was offered gin and tropical juice - not really a pool bar when its practically empty....  We decided we could not stay we asked again to cancel our reservation the manager failed to listen. We called Expedia booked another hotel advised the manager who then offered an alternative room - it was too late at this point as we had paid for another hotel - the manager said we needed to check out and charged us for our entire stay despite us being in the hotel for less than an hour and even had the cheek to charge taxes etc. for the full stay!

The lobby is really nice and you are served hot delicious mint tea while you fill-in the archaic long essay required to check-in (other hotels don't have this so I don't know what's up). Anyway the hotel has a very nice garden with different varieties of Moroccan plants. However the rooms are extremely old and tacky. Our Deluxe room had a white tiled floor from the 1980s the walls had no texture and everything had been painted with a thick coat of hospital-like white oil paint. The AC did not work. I had booked the room through hotels dot com. I was so disappointed that I left in the morning and wasted on night. I write very honest reviews so I am saving you the trouble of wasting your trip.

For service I'd give it a 2.5 on 5 (the bad experience with the receptionist was compensated by an overly friendly concierge). The hotel is located within the new city and less than 15 minutes away from the airport and the old city. The room was neat and well-kept (but visibly old) and the wi-fi range didn't extend to our room somehow. The room didn't have a kettle or an iron box however they delivered an iron box and an ironing board on request. The breakfast was quite disappointing.

Le Meridien N'Fis,upstategirl1949 wrote a review Oct 2016,40,"Nice location and grounds, dated hotel!",This hotel held lots of promise when we arrived. The grounds and pool area were lovely but the rooms lacked any style at all. The bathrooms were old and there was nothing to make these rooms friendly or homelike. the wi=fi was poor at best. The restaurant offered a good but not great breakfast for the caliber of this hotel. Not at all like other Le Meridians I have stayed in.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Spartanburg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/upstategirl1949
Le Meridien N'Fis,qc_at_heart wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Average,Arriving at the hotel we were first greeted by the people working in the lobby area. They were extremely friendly and helpful. We had to fill out some paperwork for the hotel and they showed us wear to sit and brought us tea right away. We then went to the counter for checking in. This went very smoothly as well.    We had a room with two single beds. The room were a decent size but I agree with other reviews that the rooms are looking dated. There was also a small table and two chairs in the room. I have stayed at other Meridien Hotels and I found this one to be sadly lacking. The fridge was broken on the bottom and the door did not close properly even with the air-conditioning on full blast the room was still very warm.    We ate breakfast at the buffet which was quite good just make sure you are there early enough as it gets crowded and they start clearing everything away right at 10:30.    One morning I needed to exchange some money the counter in the lobby is divided into three. The person working in the first area informed me to go to the last area. He was on a computer. There was a women in the second area and was on a personal phone call. I waited over 10 minutes and finally went back to the first person asking if someone was going to help me. He said something to the woman who was still on her personal phone call she answered him but remained on the phone. Then someone else entered the area and started talking loudly to the woman and the person then proceeded to a back room she got off the phone right away walked three steps over to help me. So needless to say I was not impressed with their service. She could have gotten off her personal phone call and helped me a lot sooner. There was no reason to have a guest wait a full 15 minutes in front of you and not help them.    The hotel does have a lot to offer a small gift shop restaurants bar area pool and small gym area. The location is also very good. There is a shopping mall directly across the street.    Transportation to and from the hotel was good about 2km from the Medina.    We had snacks in the bar a couple of times and the service was excellent. We returned a few times because the service was so good and before it got late was a relaxing atmosphere.    There are a lot of hotels and Riad's in Marrakech. I do not know the quality of the other hotels and therefore cannot say but as Meridien's go I did expect better.

Le Meridien N'Fis,SJBMB wrote a review Oct 2016,40,"Dated Hotel, But Look Beyond That, Excellent Location and Great Staff",Okay so the hotel is dated and hadn't changed cosmetically much in the 10 years since our last stay but the amazing positive for me the staff are friendly we remembered Yoseff from our last visit his restaurant knowledge is fantastic and ensured some amazing venues it was 10 years since he last helped us but he didn't disappoint. Thanks also to Said from bell service for always making a taxi appear just as we needed it. Also he would agree the evening taxi fare in advance with us and the driver so no awkward haggling at the end of the evening.  The rooms are kept clean the cleaning staff work really hard. One minor criticism the cost of drinks poolside however as per other reviews there is a Mall across the road.

It had previously been very comfortable and well located friendly staff and good food the breakfast always a pleasure outside in the shaded central gardens... it still is! I was very pleased to find the rooms as I recalled them very comfortable and quiet. Only difference since my last visit was the new shopping mall across the road... probably a handy addition?  I was working there again and so needed the wi-fi... it's fine and the service was excellent restaurant reception... all as I remember it before.

Made reservations in a nice restaurant with great value for us and also for a camel ride tour. Always very friendly and helpful. The check out time is at noon but the camel ride finished at 1pm so he suggested us to check out at 2pm with no extra cost at all. Thank u so much!!

Le Meridien N'Fis,Shirley S wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Wrap your trip up at an Oasis,This hotel or I could say resort made us blink in case it was a mirrage. After travelling through desert-like landscapes for hours our arrival at The Meridien was as refreshing as any desert oasis could be. The lobby area was expansive and decorated opulently yet with an invitation to sit and enjoy the furnishings or just listen to the lilting live piano music.  After an efficient check-in stroll through the palacial gardens to whichever wing has your room. Look to the right! An enticing swimming pool with childrens pool and a bridge under which you can find yet another pool....surrounded by lounges sun umbrellas many privacy curtained all colour co-ordinated. A snack bar with full beverage availability delivered to your chosen lounge. How's that?!    Afterwards one can walk across the street to a high-end shopping centre where every shop is available and tapas at surrounding outdoor cafes beckon. Oh just over a ways camels and dromedaries rest in the shade waiting for excited tourists to take a ride; 100 dirham only it's worth it.    We had breakfast included! Haute cuisine and plenty of it! Recommended!    We loved our stay at The Meridien!

Very stylized decor lobby and a wonderfully relaxing garden area in the middle of things.  First the room. Adequate simple decor. Clean comfortable bed. Gigantic pillows! Free wifi for 24 hours. And you get to guess how to call the front desk the concierge or get a wake-up call.  Now for the restaurant. Beg and plead for your own paper napkin and be ready to steal a knife from a neighboring table (make sure it's vacant). Pretty fair variety of food including on-demand omelets and some kind of freshly-made local breakfast fare. Make sure the scrambled eggs aren't cold before you load your plate. The staff seems to always be in panic mode (although a quiet panic mode) especially when it comes to the coffee makers not making whatever they're suppose to be making.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Claire M wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Hit and miss,We never quite knew what kind of service we were going to get during our 7 day stay. Some staff were overwhelmingly polite and genuine and others cold unfriendly and completely lacking in service. The rooms are ok not 5 star probably between 3 and 4 star by European standards but they are comfortable enough. Our bed smelt of damp throughout our stay. The bathroom has plenty of amenities which was topped up daily although on one day they left us without towels or toilet paper. Similarly the breakfast service was good some days but awful on others. We had to ask for serviettes every day and this seemed to be an inconvenience. The tables were only ever partly laid spoons missing no coffee cups nothing ran smoothly however there was always plenty of choice to suit any palate or dietary style. Smoking is allowed in all the restaurants but there are some non smoking bedrooms. We were asked to write a review on the hotels tablet whilst at dinner last night however when I looked at the review it was obvious that they staff had completed 90% of it leaving me to write in why the hotel exceeded my expectations. It didn't so I started the review again and strangely the question relating to exceeding our expectations didn't come up. On the plus side the hotel is well located to walk into many attractions including the souks (20 mins) and is situated in the more affluent part of the city amongst tree lined avenues. If you go expecting 3 star you will be pleased with this hotel. The pool area is particularly lovely with a restaurant and bar and free pool towels.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Tadworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purplerain1901

Le Meridien N'Fis,CRC888 wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Dissapointing Stay,On the plus side the hotel grounds and reception are as nice as they look in the pictures. In particular the poolside recliners are the best we've ever used with deep comfortable matresses.    However the rest was not so good. We may have been a bit unlucky that quite a major seminar was on the week we were there which took over the catering in the evenings and at lunch time in the pool restaurant no al a carte menu was available on the day we arrived.  The rooms are very tired and do not reflect the modern standard expected from a Meridian Hotel. The carpets in the hallways are not clean and the room cleaners knock on the doors frequently. The drawers in the sideboard are very difficult to use as the rails seem to be worn out. On our first day we had to have maintenance repair three electrical outlets which fell open exposing live wiring as soon as we tried to plug our devices in.    Our biggest dissapointment was the total lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room. DISGRACEFUL!!! We have traveled the world and have never once encountered the same anywhere. Even 2* hotels have that. When we asked if we could have a kettle from reception we were told to contact room service if we wanted tea or coffee. Not acceptable at all!    Finally whilst all the staff were very polite and helpful we found the concierge ( a tall bespectacled gentlemen wearing a formal suit with tails) to be arrogant and dismissive. We wanted to book a trip to the atlas mountains and he was very keen for us to hire a private driver and only after some pushing did he reluctantly produce a folder brochure of trips and astonishingly was not happy that we wanted to read it by the poolside and made me promise to return it! (Let's not forget that we are the customers and ultimately pay the wages.)    We choose an excursion but he flatly refused to book us on a group trip at 325 MAD each and was only prepared to book a private driver for 1000 MAD so we declined to book. We eventually booked the same trip in a cafe in the Medina for 640 MAD for both of us which was cheaper that the hotel prices. I seriously think that the concierge gets paid a finders fee by private drivers why else refuse the group booking?    What was going to be a luxury stay in a exotic location was spoilt by the lack of tea & coffee making facilties which meant waking up 5 mornings in a rwo to no hot drink and the pernicious nature the of concierge.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bushey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRC888

Hairdryer fell apart so couldn't use. Fridge not very cold. Air conditioning was useless and some days it was 43 outside!  Grounds are very well kept and attractive and very clean. Pool area is good and plenty of sun beds.  So much choice at breakfast and lots of healthy options. It was relaxing to eat on the terrace overlooking the gardens.  The evening bar was being refurbished which was a big disappointment to me because I had nowhere to wear my evening dresses. I feel this should of been mentioned at time of booking.  Wifi worked well in all areas but bit annoying that you have to keep logging in.  There was a charge on our bill at the end for the mini bar which we did not use but this was promptly taken off.  We left some items behind in our room after checking out and I had to email four times before getting a response thankfully though these items were found and neatly packaged up for us to collect.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Anthony Daniel L wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Overall I was not impressed,We chose this this hotel because I am an SPG member and were looking for an inexpensive holiday in the sun. The equivalent price per night was £70 or $100 USD or 2000 SPG points for night - cheaper than a Four Points near an airport so 'check' on being in budget.    I'll also note that I loved Marrakech and had a great time exploring the city and the surrounding area and would recommend you visit but perhaps stay in another hotel. Also despite some of the negative things I'm going to share the staff were mostly pleasant polite and friendly - especially the waiters at the pool restaurant.      I've stayed in many Le Meridien hotels and really like the brand but this one is showing it's age. I didn't have huge expectations given the price but this one was pretty dirty. The carpets in the hallway were totally gross covered in all sorts of stains and spots and in need of desperate replacement. The room was clean but not that comfortable dated furniture and decor for example.    The gardens are well manicured and very pretty and the pool is very nice. We spent most of our time by the pool. A couple things about the pool that I found disappointing though: 1) no atmosphere. there was either no music or the same 5 songs played over and over - and over. 2) there was no chair service well not for us. We did see a group of people who were really well attended to and the rest of us had to get our own drinks from the bar. I also found it strange that the policy was 'no glass' by the pool but these people were being brought glass dishes cups and glasses. 3) Pool chairs. This isn't unique to this hotel and it's a problem worldwide but people would hold a chair with a lousy newspaper at 8am and expect their chair to be there when the returned at 2pn. We saw fights break out between guests which was unsettling.    The breakfast was nice and was included in our rate. There were all sorts of things to eat and the service was great so top points here. I'd recommend you sit outside though and go early. Between 9 and 10 it gets very busy..    The main hotel bar is a little sad. It was mostly closed but when it was open it wasn't very nice. I look forward to sitting in nice hotel bars and this one was a disappointment. The fact they allow smoking in side is completely disgusting for example.    So I wouldn't stay here again not unless they put in some upgrades but I would come back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonydaniell
Le Meridien N'Fis,Muz T wrote a review Aug 2016,30,"I like this hotel, but disappointed today","I am currently staying in the hotel it is a hotel I have stayed in many times but this is the first time I have brought my children. First I would like to say it is a hotel I like a lot hence the reason I have come back on many occasions. Unfortunately today I have been extremely disappointed in one aspect of the service. As an SPG member I particularly booked this hotel as they offered a very good deal which was book a family package and save 50% off the second room and they then offer a deal and I quote ""kids under 12 eat for free from the kids menu with purchase of an adult meal in the restaurant"" This is great for us as I have three children ranging in age from 4 - 8. I ate in the Mediterranean last night and this is the deal I got but today I ate in the restaurant by the pool and apparently the deal doesn’t apply here I am not someone that normally moans but I did go and enquire at reception how the deal worked. After many confused looks and a few phone calls to head office I was reliably informed that the deal only worked for breakfast and buffets and not for lunch or evening meals ordering off the al la carte. I don’t have a problem with this but I suggest if you are staying here don’t pay the overinflated SPG prices and walk across the road to the shopping centre and order better food for a fraction of the price.",Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/muzt2016

We had adjoining rooms with our kids. The beds were not heavenly Sheraton beds which was disappointing. Hard beds and hard pillows. Free breakfast for all which was appreciated.    WiFi worked great in one room but very weak in the other room.    Pool was nice and relaxing. The mini cabanas were awesome and free to use. Hotel is beautiful.    Breakfast could be better. Very limited selection. Presentation of food and setup very weak. Fresh juices were nice. They have egg station and Moroccan pancake station. Not enough choices. Staff not attentive and no one ever came around to clear our plates. We were always missing napkins and utensils.    As for green choice we never received them and had to call front desk multiple times to get the cards.    Huge supermarket Carefour is across the street in the mall. Great to pick up alcohol water and snacks. Huge alcohol selection in the supermarket.    Mall was OK. Didn't recognize any stores that we have back home. The mini food court on the top floor was great. Kids loved to eat a lot at Pizza Factory. Pizzas were 50-70 dirham. They have cafés ice cream hamburgers etc. You can eat on Terrace outside or inside among all the kids arcades. Lots of other restaurants outside of the mall and surrounding areas to try. Didn't try hotel restaurants.    If you go right out of the hotel walk down 5 minutes there is cheaper spa/massage place which my husband enjoyed (Hammam Massage). Massage was $300-350 dirham. Cheaper than hotel. We also tried hammam in souk which we paid $270 for whole experience of scrubbing /massage which I reviewed on trip advisor.    Location is 30 minutes walk to souk or quick 10 minute ride. Small taxis charge 20 Dirhams to souk and allow only three people. Grand taxi charge 50 dirham and allow four. We would either get the concierge to get the taxi or grab from right outside hotel. We stuck to the above prices as concierge suggested and didn't have a problem. Concierge staff are awesome. Taxi to airport was 100 dirham.    We got dropped off at jemaa el fna square. Tons of taxis to take back. For return tell them you want to go to Menara Mall which is across from Le Meridian otherwise they will charge more.    Souk was OK. After spending a month in Egypt souks didn't catch our interest. Also not big shoppers. Nice to go people watch and walk around. Just be cautious and you will be fine.

This experience continued with all the front desk staff to name a few Adil Emad and big shout out to Mahdi top professional who does night shift and helped me a lot in my queries to find a masjids to pray the early morning prayer (salat fajar).    Concierge desk are one of the best I have seen in my last ten years travels to name. A few Tawfick and his colleague.    The staff at the SPA Nour and Fadwa are friendly professional and also very helpful. The SPA is clean the hamam and the steam room is excellent.    The security the bill men the garden and breakfast buffet staff are all friendly  professional attentive. The chief at the egg station and the ladies who make the masman are equally professional.    I am staying in a non-smoking 2nd floor (239)in an excellent spacious room with garden view. Room is in excellent condition and it was look it after by one of the professional  excellent  with leaving personal space and respecting privacy house Keeping I have come across and I have been living and in hotels in the last six years. It normally takes a while until house keeping personal to do or keep the room as you would like while keeping the Hotle standard day in out. Khadija did and managed to pick up my preferences in my second day not only that she is been creative in organizing some items in the room and that just made my stay special and pleasant.    This is my 5th day and I could not wait to write a review.    Also would like to say the success of this Hotle and customer satisfaction is due to excellent genuine professional individuals and clearly there is a good management style.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maher2018D

Le Meridien N'Fis,A98101 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,"A great value considering price, location, service and needs",With the right context and expectations the Le Meridien N'Fis is an excellent option in Marrakesh. We visited during Ramadan and just after Ramadan. During Ramadan the hotel seemed less full and we received excellent service. It's tricky for first time guests to get used to how the taxis work where things are etc. but the staff was great in helping us find our way around. I cannot say enough about the staff -- ask them to help and be gracious in thanking them. We were able to get connecting rooms for our family and overall had a lovely experience. Having the mall across the street is a great help after a long day in the medina or out exploring. The clay tennis courts are great and the garden is very lovely.    I also agree with the disappointed reviews from others. First this property is not on par with Le Meridiens in urban centers like New York or Shanghai. It's more like a Four Points Sheraton. Second this property isn't a riad a super lux hotel or a boutique. If you expect that you'll be disappointed. Third this property isn't brand new.    But given the price location service and our needs this place was great.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,Seattle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A98101

Le Meridien N'Fis,Paul S wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Relaxed visit during Ramadan,After reading the reviews on this hotel I was a bit unsure as to what to expect. Upon arrival we were greeted with lovely traditional Moroccan mint tea as we filled in the necessary forms and sorted out the city tax. Concierge was on hand to escort us and luggage to the room whilst describing and pointing out the features of the hotel as we went. The room was clean and adequate and had no issues regarding bedding or the quality of the towels. I do advise to tip every other day for pool staff and maids. We tipped around 20 dirhams and felt the benefit of this. We were provided with water bottles and fresh fruit daily in our room. The hotel was a bit quieter as it was during the Ramadan period however this was suited as we desired a relaxing experience. Dinner was buffet style most nights however the food on the A la Carte menu was really nice. All in all a good relaxing experience in a clean and comfortable environment. The location of the hotel is also very convenient with little cost to travel by taxi to most points of interest,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsU5760HY

It's a half an hour walk to the Medina and 15 minutes from train station.  We stayed there over the weekend and one of the staff members (Muhammad) was very helpful to us since we are Shabbat observant. They have an unbelievable breakfast and a beautiful pool area.

We were treated to an upgraded room with flowers and fruit to great us as they found out that my friend was celebrated a big birthday. The breakfast is amazing! A huge buffet with everything you could want (perhaps the only thing missing was dark/wholemeal or rye bread) with staff place to cook your eggs to order along with traditional Moroccan pancakes and special Moroccan spicy sausages as well as the special soup for Eid (as it became Eid while we were there.

Le Meridien N'Fis,WadihFromChiTown wrote a review Jul 2016,50,"Great service, location, and breakfast",I rarely write reviews even though I travel a lot but this time I felt it is worth it. The hotel has a very nice location away from the very busy area but not too far. Cross street there is Menara Mall with a super market for your convenience.    I'm platinum member and I used my certificate to upgrade my room to a nice suite overlooking both sides: the pool and the mall where we enjoyed a water music show every evening from e mall. I opted for breakfast as my welcome gift and it is well worth it.    I live in the US but was born in Morocco and I can tell you that the service and hospitality in this hotel is by far one of the best from the doorman to the waitress and waitresses paying by the reservation desk. However I have to give a special thanks to the concierge Youssef Mamouni who helped us book our activities at fair price: Carriage tour (recommended) tennis class dinners show... We went to Chez Ali show which turned out to be lame as the owner has died and his kids are not doing good job at all. Mr Youssef was able to refund us 50% of the total from the tour agency without me asking.    The rooms amenities are okay did need some interventions to get the water pressure right and the fridge replaced.    We stayed 5 nights and enjoyed what Marrakech had to offer for the families. The hotel was quite and clean and safe for our kids. There is a kids zone in the mall that the kids enjoyed and we enjoyed the massage place next to the hotel since the one in the hotel was so expensive.    I stayed here 3 years ago with my coworkers for a short stay and I will define lay come back again.    Make sure to be safe at night and do your shopping during the day.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Homer Glen, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WadihFromChiTown
Le Meridien N'Fis,angieraven wrote a review Jul 2016,50,I can't fault it really,Firstly let me say that we travel a lot and we never go back to the same place twice. However Marrakech has a certain draw to us. I think it is because it is only 3hrs 20mins away from London and yet you feel like you are a million miles away.  We first stayed in this hotel as it was free with our starwood points so why not I say.  We have now been back another 3 times. We find that we can totally switch off here relax and enjoy our time. Marrakech is manic don't get me wrong. Its night time could be over whelming to the modest person. However this hotel provides an escape from all that. The pool is totally superb of that there is no doubt.  We have never experienced bad service except the Spa never seem to have anyone there to book anything in. I went 3 times to try and each time no one was there so was disappointed with this. However this is the only issue we had with service. The gym is well equipped could do with a set of 3KG weights I did find the 4kgs ones a little heavy for some of the stuff I do ( we aren't all hefty blokes in the gym you know!).  Breakfast again a great choice no complaints and we ate once in the restaurant this time around which was also good. Its not a five star hotel but I don't think it warrants any down marking as we have always really enjoyed our stays here and the staff have really been excellent. Everything is clean and tidy too. We will be back again maybe September for another quick getaway.  I should note that it is now in a total prime position right opposite the new 'shopping mall' that we have seen slowly constructed over the last 3 years. It has a vibrant buzz to it. :-),Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieraven

The bedrooms are well equipped and comfortable. It has an excellent large pool. The staff are very helpful though not that friendly (for example once at breakfast not one person said good morning).

This was the CLEANEST place I have ever stayed in...ever. The gardens on the grounds are beautiful and you can tell they are well tended to. The staff was absolutely excellent from the time we arrived to the time we left. Everyone was multi lingual which made communication easy because we didn't know any advanced French.  We were here during Ramadan and the Iftar buffet was the best food I've ever eaten.  The highlight however for me was the bar tender Abdelkhalek. He made great coffee ( recommend the cortado) and some of the best stiffest drinks we had. Make sure to get patisseries sample plate in the bar/lounge area. Those deserts are amazing.  The onsite spa was great as well. We all got the eucalyptus scrub treatment and it was life changing. I felt so smooth and amazing when I left out of there. My skin on my whole body was GLOWING.

Le Meridien N'Fis,ATF London wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Great Hotel,"My daughter and I arrived on a very hot evening and got picked up at the airport by a taxi (booked through British Airways you could have booked the taxi/private transfer through ""Get Your Guide"" it would have been slightly cheaper)  Our first impression looking out of the window of the taxi when we arrived was very good Le Meridien had a luxurious Morrocan feel about it.  As soon as the car pulled up outside the doors were opened by the doorman and a bellboy appeared and took care of all our luggage booking in was quick and easy. The bellboy then guided us to our room who showed and explained to us where everything was. (Make sure you have 20Dhrm tip approx £1.40)  That evening we went out for dinner and we felt quite safe over the road there is a shopping complex with a supermarket (Carrefours) and some restaurants or if you turn directly right out of the hotel there is another restaurant that is about 5 mins walk they were very good and a lot more reasonable than the ones over the road. (I felt charged more because they were in the shopping complex)  If you want ATMs they are nearby you can either go over the road and turn right and it is about 5mins walk or directly turn right also 5mins away on the same side of the road in fact it is just before the restaurant we ate in.  In the morning after a refreshing night sleep we went down for breakfast this was a buffet breakfast you could have a choice of continental cooked (beef sausages omelettes scrambled or boiled eggs) or a traditional Moroccan breakfast. All very good If you are only there for 3-5 days not a problem any more I think I would get bored. My daughter being vegetarian loved the breakfast with all the veggies and fresh fruit she ate so much I wondered where she put it! The fresh orange juice was lovely. The other juices like carrot cucumber and beetroot tasted watered down according to my daughter but the orange wasn't.  After breakfast we went into town in the heat it took us about 20 mins and that was because we were sauntering. If you don't want to walk into town take a taxi it is no more than 20 Dhirams in total not each! It is the same for the trip back from town.The people in the hotel warned us not to get ""conned""  If you are unsure about it all there is someone who will ""guide"" you around for a price (300 Dhrm) the concierge can sort that out for you or you can go through ""Get Your Guide"" before you leave the UK. The guide will walk you into town from the hotel whilst giving you a brief account of the history of Marrakech and what you will find in Marrakech town. The tour takes about 3 hrs I would recommend this because with a guide you won't be bothered or dragged into shops and made to feel guilty that you don't buy anything. Being 2 females it made us feel safer and more confident about what to expect.  When we got back from our trip into town we were greeted by the hotel staff with lovely cooling glasses of lemon and mint drink.  The pool was lovely too and very welcoming due to the temperature reaching 40+ during the week we were there. Towels are supplied by the hotel.  We also used the spa facilities and we had the Hamman and scrub (350 Dhrm) i would suggest you have that on your first day that way you get a better tan :-)  All in all we had a wonderful time even though it was Ramadan. I would recommend coming out in Ramadan because everywhere is quiet but still open.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Mrs B wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Amazing level of service,This is an great hotel for convenience. Shopping mall across the road for food and shopping. Ten minutes from the airport and ten minutes by taxi to the main medina square palaces and other attractions. Only 20 dirhams to many places. The hotel is great for arranging excursions for you. The hotel has beautiful gardens. The rooms are ok. The breakfast is amazing. Fresh orange juice and Roti everyday. The pool is lovely but very cold even on a very hot day. Had nice lunch near the pool. Would recommend this hotel if you get a good rate. Thank you to all the staff at the hotel for excellent service.

Le Meridien N'Fis,csldn17 wrote a review May 2016,10,Not up to Le Meridien Standards,Firstly our bedsheets and pillows were stained with old blood stains on both nights. On the first night we called the front desk who kindly exchanged our bedsheets. We were understanding as we know that these incidents may happen even at the best hotels. However to our dismay on the second day once we came back to the hotel in the late afternoon we found that our bedsheets were once again tainted with old blood stains. Again we called front desk who exchanged our bedsheets. We find that the use of bedsheets that are stained and are in desperate need of replacement to be completely unacceptable even in lower grade hotels.    Secondly we were both first time travelers to Morocco. We found the service of the front desk and concierge to be satisfactory when they were around. Unfortunately there was often no one around to assist us. On the first night around noon we had asked the front desk if it was possible to call a restaurant to help us make reservations. The front desk told us to wait for concierge to return. However we were told that concierge would not return until 5pm. We do not believe that asking front desk to call a restaurant in the absence of concierge is too much to ask. We ended up having to make the reservation ourselves using the lobby wifi on our mobile phone.    Lastly on our last night I had attempted to request water at around 1am. I called front desk and requested a bottle of water. Instead I was told to call a different number and front desk hung up. In the many hotels I have stayed at front desk was more than happy to redirect my call or for such a simple request as this to simply assist us.,Date of stay: June 2015,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csldn17

When we were show to our room we were pleasantly surprised spacious immaculately clean large bed along with everything else you need not to mention the amazing view of the pool and mountains. The bathroom was also kept very clean and the bath was a real treat. Also in the bathroom there were many toiletries and robe and slippers. The rooms were cleaned twice a day and we were left complementary water and fruit. Breakfast wasn't amazing but there was lots of options and as always staff were very accommodating. Location wise we were impressed opposite the hotel is a shopping mall and super market also a handful of lovely restaurants on the top floor on the shopping mall there is many more restaurants and fast food places etc the views from the top are amazing so recommend trying it out. To the main square it's about a 20 minute walk or 20 dirrums for a taxi where you will find lots of places to eat and all the crazy markets it's a must if your in Marrakech. Over all I really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech 5 star service and 5 start resort!

We walked but you could easily get a horse and carriage (taxis too) to travel the attractive boulevard between the old city and the hotel.

Set in among some nice garden areas there are a selection of restaurants on site and a great pool area. Situated opposite the Mall and other restaurants too. Rooms comfortable with a minibar and nice bathroom. Great choice of breakfast in the morning with hot and cold options. Situated about 10 mins from the airport it is great for an overnight visit or even a short break. Would highly recommend. Only moan I would have is that the price of beer is rather expensive at almost £4 a bottle for 330ml. They are sold in the mall opposite for a £1 a bottle so you can stock the fridge up. Would not put me off staying again though.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bickington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy123101
Le Meridien N'Fis,rtlaw wrote a review May 2016,50,"Balancing all of the variables, the best choice in Morocco!",I am currently staying at Le Meridien N'Fis and after being here for 2 days I am glad that I made this choice. Morocco is an incredible yet overwhelming experience for the first time. The sights sounds smells and the culture will first overpower you and then entice you. There are numerous suggestions to stay in a riad in the medina for that more local experience and others which say you should stay in a four or five star hotel (big name chain) outside the medina. You can only make that decision based on your needs but I will give you my suggestions as to why I think Le Meridien N'Fis is a great choice.    #1) It is great to be close to the action but not in the action. The local part of staying in the Medina will wear off very quickly every time you leave the riad and are confronted by the daily frenzy of the central square medina and souq. They are all incredible culturally but it would be too much to experience this every hour of every day for a whole vacation. Le Meridien N'Fis is a 15 minute walk or a 5 minute cab ride to these sights so you can go enjoy and then retreat to the comfort of your hotel in the middle of the day to relax enjoy the pool or eat lunch (especially if you are traveling with children!)    #2) And speaking of the pool it is incredible. Surrounded by beautiful fragrant gradens the whole area consists of a large pool for adults (connected to a children's pool) a pool front restaurant and bar serving delicious grilled meat and fish and everything from a cold beer to the ubiquitous yet equally delicious mint tea. It is very hard to walk by those grills and smell the food and not sit down to order something!    3) It is only a ten minute ride from the airport-great for a quick arrival after a tiring flight but more importantly for the day you are leaving when you will not have to leave so early as you are very close to the airport.    4) The hotel is an older hotel which means the rooms are not as updated but it also means they are much larger than the cookie cutter tiny rooms prevalent in today's market. The rooms are nice the bathrooms are large many rooms have a balcony there is good wifi and the service is quick and only a phone call away to get you whatever you need.    5) Right across the street there is a shopping mall with a large Carrefour supermarket a kid's arcade with a great food court as well as four or five street front cafes and restaurants serving coffee and pastries to steaks and seafood selections. As you know especially with children this (especially the supermarket) is a life saver!    6) There is a great buffet breakfast included in the rate. Very important to eat well before starting your day especially for the kids who prefer their pancakes and Nutella more than the grilled sheep's head sold in the central square    7) Being a Starwood brand your frequent guest staus will be recognized. This is true in general but particularly at Le Meridien N'Fis. They not only recognize the status with the usual amenities (fruit platter and water free Internet) but also offer very generous suite upgrades to the Platinum members. And the new manager Abdelghani Hadri and the Experiences Director Khalid Jamal are on site to make sure your experience is five star (they will even arrange private guides and tours for you which is a must do!)    In conclusion I chose Le Meridien N'Fis when considering many factors as it ticked off more boxes than the other hotels in Marrakech. And therefore for me it is the best choice in Marrakech!,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"nyc,ny",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtlaw

Le Meridien N'Fis,PawelJZ wrote a review May 2016,40,Good City Hotel with huge garden,Le Meridien N`Fis is located in Hivernage district. It is a large chain hotel with a huge and wonderful garden. I spent 4 days in this hotel after staying in one of the best rated riads in the medina of Marrakech. I chose Le Meridien mainly because of the location and really big swimming pool but also took into consideration some positive reviews about this facility. I was greeted with some mint tea upon my arrival which was nice and asked to wait in foyer as my room wasn`t ready to go into- they were still cleaning it. It was understadable since I had arrived at about 1 pm. However after waiting for nearly an hour I became quite dissapoined and even angry. After reminding the staff at the reception desk that I was still waiting to get the key to my room they finally managed to allot me the room. Somebody took my luggage and showed me the way. It was the only unpleasant situation during my stay. However it really shoudn`t take place in a five star hotel. I would expect the staff at the reception desk to inform me precisely about the time needed to make the room clean and ready for the guest. None of this happened. Fortunately later on everything was fine. My room was located on the ground floor with the nice view of the garden. I had real pleasure in enjoying the big swimming pool and walking on the grounds of the hotel. Breakfast was also fine with plenty of choices. It is also worth recalling that the hotel is located close to the airport and within walking distance of the old city center - the walk to the medina takes about 20 minutes - alternatively you can take a taxi or a carriage.

When we came back it was really nice surprise as they delivered fruit basket which was a nice touch. Beds were cumfy and bath and shower was good. Overall hotel did give good vibes.

I have to say Marakesh is nice -especially at early evening hours at the big square and the shopping alleys but i have to say that i was very afraid and it is dangerous and not totally safe to walk alone in the narrow streets and the shopping allies especially after getting dark .

Our trip to Marrakech didn't get off to the best start as our airline lost our baggage during transit and we spent 3 hours at Marrakech airport filling out forms and phoning back home to British Airways. Obviously we were looking forward to relaxing in our hotel after a stressful time in the airport. We arrived to be met by a sour faced woman at reception who grunted rather than greeted us on arrival. After telling her my surname and booking details she proceeded by telling us that the hotel was overbooked and Le Meridien had moved us to a sister hotel 5km outside Marrakech for the first 3 days of our 7 day holiday. After arguing with said sour faced woman for 30 mins her manager finally came out and resolved this by finding us our ""original room"". The room itself was very dated and a bit smelly. Not what we are used to as we tend to stay at Starwood hotels. Anyway we couldn't move rooms as the hotel was ""fullly booked"" but I imagine all of the rooms were shabby judging by the other photos posted on tripadvisor. The room had sliding doors but no balcony just a steel gate. In terms of food one of the restaurants was permanently closed and only the moroccan restaurant open. Food was good but menu stayed the same the entire week and only contained about 9 dishes so not much choice. Close proximity to the main square and plenty of taxis to get around to further afar. Unfortunately the hotel is located in the new part of town which resembles a building site with a number of hotels being built in the close vacinity.

We ate there a few times at the different outdoor restaurants and found it a nice change of pace from the chaotic Medina.

Breakfast and reception are both very disorganised.  Don't expect a lie in - even with a 'do not disturb' sign someone will knock on your door every five minutes. Cleaning staff seem to have their loud morning chat in the corridor too.  Would recommend a different hotel.  Probably a good hotel if you have lots of kids and want a large pool.

Nice large modern room with lovely view over the well maintained grounds. We literally came away just to get some sun and relax for a few days. We found the hotel to be lovely and peaceful and a great place to relax.    We ate in the hotel most nights and really enjoyed the food although we did order off the menu as opposed to having the buffet. Breakfast was also good and we received good all round customer service.

Was looking for a well deserved break somewhere warm and good value seeing that i was on a budget at the time. It ticked all the boxes for me. The hotel was lovely and clean staff very helpful and polite. I travelled in late July 2015 and the weather was around 43'c. hotter than i expected but i wasnt going to complain lol. Room was air-conditioned and just paced myself. Stayed here for 7 nights which included a lovely buffets breakfast with a huge choice of fresh foods ie tropical fruits cereals traditional Moroccan pancakes omelettes freshly brewed mint tea. Lovely pool which i use to chill out next to on the sun loungers after breakfast before it got busy. Huge well kept Andalusian garden. The hotel is not too far from the railway and coach station about a 10 minute walk. The was also a new built shopping mall across the road and taxi were quite cheap to get around to local spots. Just take note that there is a night club next door but wont be of any concern if you ask for a room situated in the part of the hotel which is not next to it,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/core1981
Le Meridien N'Fis,Irene L wrote a review Mar 2016,40,"Great location, beautiful hotel and outstanding service!",We recently spent 6 nights at the Le Meridien N'Fis.    Location: This hotel is centrally located between the old and new parts of Marrakech. We liked it especially because it's close enough to the main spots but away from all of the hustle and bustle so you can relax. It is across the street from Manera Mall which was very convenient to purchase snacks and water. Manera Mall also has many fabulous restaurants that we visited.    Grounds and hotel: The grounds of this hotel are beautiful and always maintained. There's gardens all around with labels of the various plants. Although we did not use the pool we did walk past it and it was clean. The lobby is spacious with beautiful decor and comfortable seating.    Restaurant: We had the opportunity to try all of the restaurants at this hotel. Breakfast was wonderful there was an omelet station and station where fresh Moroccan pancakes were made. There was a salad bar and a variety of pastries and breads to chose from. There was a self serve hot beverage station and fresh juice available. There was also a hot food section. Dinner restaurant portions were generous and delicious. We visited a few times. There bar often did not have some of the ingredients to make drinks listed on the menu. Also food items on the menu were not available (reason for 4*) Room service selection is good and quick.    Service: All staff that we came across at the hotel always greeted us with a smile. Adel at the front desk was always helpful and friendly with us. He provided excellent service. The doormen/bellmen were wonderful also. Always assisted us in flagging down a taxi and confirming location and costs before we left the hotel.

The staff were all excellent whether offering advice (thank you Yousseff the concierge ) or serving food in the restaurants. We enjoyed the well kept gardens and fountains which must be a real haven in the hot summers. Food was of a good standard and the rooms always clean. Nothing was too much trouble for us and my husband celebrated his 70th birthday in style with a lovely cake with candle. Thank you to everyone who made this holiday so memorable.  I recommend the 3 valleys day trip with the meal in a family home; ask for Abdu whose English is excellent and who has a good sense of humour as well. Yousseff arranged the trip round the souk with Majoub and he was a fount of knowledge and very good about letting us take a break so that we were not overtired.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Wembleygal wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Great Property with a Local Flair,I’m very puzzled why this property is receiving so many negative reviews -- especially from the American guests.    I liked the combination of Old World and new. The garden and properties were classic and very pretty. Just walk around the property and breath in the lovely vegetation and wildlife.    The location is perfect. Only a 20 – 25 minute walk into town but right across the street from a modern mall with a large grocery store and many restaurants and fast-food outlets. It was and a quiet and restful area.    All of the staff at the hotel were helpful and kind – service levels were excellent.    The breakfast was good especially if you sat on the outdoor patio. I loved the local pancakes / flatbreads. While there was not a lot of variety from day to day but it was plentiful and healthy.    We were given an upgrade to the SPG level. The room was modern and comfortable. The shower was amazingly powerful although the drain was a little slow. The bed was large and comfortable and we slept very well.    I was disappointed that the A/C was not turned on at this time of year but we borrowed a fan and kept the patio door open at night so the room was reasonably cool. The TV had very limited English channels and while we brought a tablet with MHL cable somehow the Samsung TV was disabled and we couldn’t get the transfer to work. The Wifi in the room was rather slow.    On one day the maid forgot to clean the room. Not a big deal as I have certainly had that happen a few times in American properties. It might have been a communication issue.    We were impressed with the food and drinks in the bar – very good quality although a bit overpriced for Marrakech.    The pool area was lovely – clean and quiet.    It thought it was great value-for-money (especially as I managed to get a BRG rate).

We always have to request for hot water as there was no kettle provided in the room. They provide a daily supply of bottled water in our room. Toiletries are not properly replenished every day.

Even not being there he called and assured me everything was taken care of.  Now the downsides...  It needs to be renewed. Like badly renewed. When we got there the first time you have this wonderful lobby but the corridors to the rooms the doors and some parts of the room you can see they are old and need restoration.

We sat in the bar the the first night and the bartender was friendly and just simply a happy guy that made our evening. In fact everyone we encountered at this property went our of their way to make us feel welcomed and for that alone it deserves four stars.    The rooms appear to be original (probably early 90's) and if you are looking for a tired mid century modern style this is the property will work for you. If your primary concern is service and a clean place to sleep than this place is perfect.    Although I believe the staff is doing a superb job with what they have to work with if the owners would just do a little updating this could be a five star again. We stayed here in early 2000's and it was amazing and that's why we came back.    If you want a five star new property than you should probably look elsewhere.

I was also upgraded to an executive room which features a small private terrace (it really wasn’t that fancy).    Check out was quick even though there was a couple in front of me.    Room:    I was upgraded to an executive room at check in. It has a small private terrace and featured garden views. The room is large. The room itself is rather dated so you can see the wear and tear in the room and bathroom. There was a nice welcome amenity of fruits and a large bottle of water.    The bathroom was also decent and had quite an expanded selection of bath products. The tub itself has anti-slip strips which I actually appreciate because I’ve been trying to not get killed when I shower in a lot of hotel showers. However it didn’t look too elegant (very haphazardly installed) but this could be an easy fix.    There is a king size bed to the side of the room. It was comfortable and I had a good night’s sleep. I have some mixed feelings about the switch right in the middle of the headboard. On the one hand it’s functional on the other hand it’s a bit of an odd place to have it. On the bed there’s a welcome package – do look through it. Some of the interesting offers include a complimentary coffee/tea at the hotel lounge and there was also a complimentary pass to Maison de Photographie in the medina.    Grounds:    The Le Meridien N’Fis is actually a resort. It is actually quite a sprawling property and the grounds are quite lovely. I loved the nice fountain feature and while it was too cold to swim in December it looks pretty nice. They also have a tennis court.    Wireless:    It was fast stable and complimentary.    Business Center:    They have a couple of computers in the lobby. They also have a printer. I did make use of it to print out a boarding pass.    Breakfast:    Breakfast was not included in my rate and it was 200 DH per person. There was a nice selection. They have a very cool selection of freshly-squeezed juices including Moroccan fruit mixers. They were very refreshing.    They have a very nice selection of pastries and they all tasted excellent. The selection also changes over the course of breakfast. They also have a small section with Moroccan offerings: soup and flatbread. They have a hot selection (beef sausage potatoes etc) and eggs made to order.    Service:    I thought it was attentive and friendly. No complaints.    Overall:    Le Meridien N’Fis is quite a lovely five-star hotel. The rooms are rather dated but I still enjoyed my stay. The lovely grounds actually make it quite pleasant to spend some time in the hotel even though I didn’t spend too much time lounging around. It could be a great idea to lounge in the hotel by the pool during the hottest hours in summer.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/solewalker

With a little out door table and chairs..  The buffet breakfast was beautiful yogurts fruit cereal pastries and different types of bread there was also a lady making fresh roti's and of course an egg station and also a selection of hot breakfast items.  Opposite is a shopping centre which has a grocery store (but be careful the hotel does not allow you to bring in food and drinks from outside!)  We did eat the restaurant at the hotel it was ok not worth it when you can walk 10 minutes down the rd to the square which is filled with local people with monkeys snakes and ladies with henna (all very aggressive watch out ladies the women there will grab your hand and start putting henna on it within a second.)

Le Meridien N'Fis,Navid N wrote a review Jan 2016,40,"Well located, value hotel with all the essentials",I booked eight room nights at this property using Starwood points and had a great experience. Firstly the concierge services of Youssef and Taoufiq were invaluable leading up to our stay. They even assisted in obtaining our train tickets on the ONCF which was a big help. Fatimah at the front desk was helpful and professional and a pleasure to deal with.  The property may be a bit dated but rooms are generously sized the breakfast is comprehensive and the gardens/pool area are beautiful. The hotel is a very short drive from the airport and directly across the street from a commercial mall (with full supermarket) which was convenient for picking up a few things. I would recommend a room toward the back of the property for more quiet.  Even though we were not in the Medina it's a reasonable walk to the center of town or a very inexpensive taxi ride.

It was lacking in many areas from tired outdated rooms without any AC to poor service at checkin. We had to wait more than 20 minutes for a room even though we had arrived well after 3 pm (their checkin time). The wifi was abysmal and when we complained we were told that the IT manager would contact us the next day. He never did. The room was so stuffy we could barely breathe. We had to open the door yo the balcony at night to get fresh air but we stopped doing this after a bird flew in. The concierge was very unhelpful when booking restaurants.

Food very variable. Sometimes great sometimes terrible but they did try again if you complained.    The overall service was highly unreliable if not dreadful. The saga of the telephone was the low point. The telephone did not work for calling local numbers. If took two hours to get the hotel to simply admit the telephone (well none of the guest phones) was working for local calls. The hotel managed to waste all this time by claiming someone was looking at (but not) someone would come to my room (but didn't). Finally after calling again someone came to my room and claimed to have fixed the phone. I made him wait while I tried it. It still didn't work.    Finally I saw the manager who said I could call via the operator but be charged the direct dial rate (1/6th the cost of an operator call). I made her put here promise in writing because I did not want an argument when I checked out over the phone bill.    When I checked out I found I have been charged 75 Dirhams ($8) for making a call on the day when the phone was completely out of action. I had also been charged 150 Dirhams ($16) for a direct dial local call that should have cost 20 Dirhams. The bill was corrected when I complained but the discussion went on so long my transfer driver threatened to leave us.  .

Originally I was not excited to stay in what I viewed as an American experience but after 12 hours of travel the familiarity and comfort of a Starwood King bed was welcoming.    Pros: excellent and welcoming staff good food beautiful grounds nature outside of your window versus cars/motorbikes clean excellent concierge (Yousef) that set us up with a fantastic tour guide (Abduel). (Yousef also made excellent dinner recommendations!) There is also something to be said about staying outside of the medina - it is quiet and peaceful with many excellent food options surrounding this hotel.    Cons: American prices    Advice: make a reservation at the hammam for the first morning to scrub off the travel then venture into the medina with a guide (Abduel!!). Taxi into medina should only be 20DH. Taxi to/from hotel should be 70DH. Tour half day for 150DH but worth much more.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/313daniellee

Le Meridien N'Fis,loveDCA wrote a review Dec 2015,20,"Don't judge a book by its cover, public side is nice but rooms need work","After a 6 night stay I agree with what many have said about this hotel. The public spaces (lobby restaurants gardens pools and gym) are all great. In regards to the staff the concierge bellhops and gym staff are very hospitable and top-notch. However the front desk staff could be more hospitable to their guests. I interacted with a couple of their front desk behind-the-counter staff and each time they seemed annoyed. More on that later...    As many have shared the rooms need a lot of improvement. Furnishings/lighting seemed cold and poor-quality. The toilet flush was too strong (as in you'll get splashed) while the shower water pressure was weak. But the worst part was the climate control. The temperature outside was very pleasant for November but the room would heat up because of the amount of sun exposure. When we started our stay the air condition worked fine and kept the room comfortable during the day and night. About mid-way through of the stay the climate control would only provide heat even when the setting was on ""cool"". I went to the front desk staff and was told that the air condition was turned off and the whole system was on a heating system...which made me feel like I was imagining the first couple of days when we were cooling the room. She was unapologetic and unconcerned when I told her that we had a different experience. So every night we slept with the sliding glass door open - our sleep interrupted by the occasional late night scooter on the road a conversation in the courtyard or the one night when a fly decided to roam around the room because the sliding glass door doesn't have a screen. I complained in their post-stay survey which triggered a response from their general manager. He confirmed that the building can only be heated or cooled and they use heat at night and cold during the day they are in the midst of appealing their owner to update the rooms and that the front desk encounter was most likely due to a language barrier. I replied to his email offering a couple of suggestions such as a sign informing guests about their odd climate control system and also mentioning that we had cool air at night when we started our stay. But not surprisingly I haven't heard back.    The quality of the rooms and the lack of hospitality of the front desk staff are more like a locally owned and managed motel don't expect any quality assurances normally provided by an international chain known for high standards.",Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveDCA
Le Meridien N'Fis,Sleddoggie wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Standard hotel with good service 20 minute walk from medina.,We stayed here for 3 nights and were pleased with the hotel overall. As you will see on some other reviews it is a bit dated or worn. But to be candid the slightly frayed carpet in the hallway did not impact my vacation at all. We found the staff to be quite friendly and helpful. My husband and I enjoy walking and found the walk to and from the medina enjoyable. This hotel is located across the street from a carafour grocery store which is a great place to stock up on Moroccan olive oil wine and culinary grade argan oil at reasonable prices provided you remembered to pack your wine skins to check the items safely in your luggage. We did enjoy the bar area after time out and about in the medina as it had a reasonable wine selection. Later in the evening it did tend to get a bit smokier. If you are interested in morning spa treatments I recommend booking more than one day in advance as I was unable to secure a morning appointment but did not want to commit to a time in the afternoon because we did not know when we might make it back to the hotel. If you organize a guide to tour the medina through the hotel I recommend you do so the day prior or early in the morning as the three they normally use were booked by 9:30a when we finally decided to use one. The concierge did arrange one who was perfectly acceptable but we understood it was not a regular one that they use.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Rahul P wrote a review Dec 2015,30,Such a let-down for a Starwood Property,"I was leaning between 2 and 3 stars for this property but a 3 is more fair. This is not the worst hotel you will ever stay at but it is just disappointing and feels very ""budget"". For me the positives of this hotel are: (1) Some nice grounds and an attractive pool (2) a good breakfast buffet with plenty of choices - the freshly made buttery mafrouk was a highlight and (3) the hivernage area of Marrakech is peaceful compared to the medina and new city although sometimes a little too quiet.  For me the disappointments:  (1) Very economic furnishing and finishing in the rooms. The property needs a renovation sometime soon the age of the place is showing with cracks and gaps all over the place. I was not a fan of the hard bed and having a shower that splashes all over the mirror because it is next to it seemed illogical.  (2) Even on chilly November nights it was very stuffy in the room. There is no window just sliding doors and when we tried to switch on the air-conditioning to cool down the room it spit out hot air (realized this when we woke up after the first night feeling sizzled). Other fixes like a fan in the bathroom or a less overbearing comforter would have helped to make our stay better. We slept terribly at the hotel.  (3) Extremely long to check-in or talk to concierge/ask for help. Only the doormen were efficient in helping us get taxis from the hotel.  If this was a boutique hotel I would be more forgiving but for a Starwood property we were sorely disappointed - the recent reviews seem to concur with my opinion that the hotel management needs to act fast to keep Le Meridien N'Fis from slipping into the mediocre category.",Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Montclair, NJ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahulpat

Unfortunately the rooms are very dated and I guess the best way to describe the feel is a bit smudged. Feels like everything is just a bit smudged or stained. I did stay in two different rooms because we left for one night to Essaouira. The first room was older and the water pressure in the shower was abysmal. I had the unfortunate situation that my room backed up to a dance club that was raging until 2am. The next room had a lovely view of the Atlas mountains. The room was slightly more up to date but still very dated. The hair dryer was so old that it wasn't useable.  -The food. Most nights we had to work at the hotel so we needed to eat dinner there and the only options were the buffet or the menu at the bar. We opted to eat at the bar most nights. What was disappointing was there were no Moroccan dishes on offer at the bar. You could get a burger pizza or a steak sandwich. You would think they would add some local food to the menu.  -Sadly in our current global climate the security at the hotel is not great. There is one gate that opens from the main road and that is it. No additional security inside the hotel.    Overall as a starwood junkie i would stay here again and it's pretty good value for money.

My husband had a meeting at the convention center and the location was perfect for several reasons: 1. He could easily walk to the convention center 2. There is a nice Grocery store directly across the street 3. You can walk to the Medina in 20 minutes. 4. It is very near the airport.  I found our room to be extremely nice reasonably large and with everything we needed. We had a nice balcony looking over a beautiful garden with birds singing. There was a beautiful pool several restaurants and bars and the staff were very accommodating. Breakfast was good buffet food almost exactly like most other hotels of this size but good good coffee and nice staff. For these reasons I give the hotel a 4 star.    It is not a 5 star hotel. It is older and shows signs of age. That is not a problem in itself because the grounds are actually quite lovely. What does give it the 4 star is that the rest of the food at the hotel is just ok.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jamal S wrote a review Nov 2015,30,"Good value, but rooms are somewhat subpar",There seems to be a little bit of confusion out on the Internet on exactly how to rate this hotel. 1st of all SPG rates this hotel as a Category 2 out of 7 - but then there are other sites (like Hotels.com) that rate this a 5 star property. I think the moral of the story is that the truth lies somewhere in the middle BUT always trust the SPG ratings before anything.    Here's the good:  The service the whole time we stayed at Le Meridien was very good - the concierge and front desk was very helpful overall. Met most of my standards. 4 stars.  The restaurants were ok to very good 3 to 4 stars.  The pool area and surrounding gardens were definitely amazing and was a very tranquil setting - 5 stars. I just wish the rooms lived up to that billing which brings me to....    Here's the bad:  The room that we booked was the Ambassador suite (upgrade through my SPG status) and I was excited given the pictures I saw on the Internet. However the room just did not meet the standards that my wife and I have when we go on vacation. 2 stars at best.  The bed was rock hard and generally uncomfortable. The room when we 1st entered had a bit of a moldy smell - we aired out the room as best we could but was just never right. The furniture is a little run down and needs replacing. It's basically exactly what you'd expect from a Category 2 SPG hotel - honestly I'm spoiled by the Cat 567 that I normally stay in. Also we had the luxury of spending the previous week of our vacation at the Westin Palace hotel in Madrid - and later on some time at the Royal Mansour hotel not far from here. That place is on another level - makes most other hotels look subpar.    So the moral of the story is that this hotel is a good value no question - I booked with my SPG points (it was less points for 5 nights than some SPG properties charge for 1!) so can you really ever complain about a free stay?! Not really. But overall we place a lot of value on the rooms (bc we spend most of our time there order frequent room service etc) and they just were not up to our lofty standards. But given that it's the only SPG property in Marrakech and the relatively low cost it's worth trying out - just make sure you have proper expectations when you do.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Santa Clara, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notdrj
Le Meridien N'Fis,Fridaysmom wrote a review Nov 2015,30,Reasonable place to stay near the convention center,I had stayed for the preceding 4 nights at a beautiful riad near the medina but moved here to be closer to the convention center where I was attending a congress. The hotel served its purpose and appeared a better place to stay than the hotels adjacent to the convention center--the Meridien being about a 7-10 minute walk. The gardens of the Meridien are quite pleasant but decor in the rooms is quite dated. In addition for my first night I was put in a room which had no view and was near both the hotel generator and the elevators. I thought I could tolerate the room for a few nights but it was really noisy so I moved to another room. This room had no bathrobes or bottled drinking water as did the first room so it appeared housekeeping was either a bit spotty or they had different standards for different parts of the hotel. The breakfast buffet was quite plentiful but the bar left something to be desired given extensive smoking and loud music. I also had a weird experience with the bellboy in the hotel given that I borrowed a roll of tape which I returned to the concierge quite soon after using. The next morning the bellboy asked me where the tape was and wouldn't believe I had returned it. He glared at me as I was leaving with an accusatory look (as though I needed one more thing to take home!) and didn't offer any help as I lugged my extensive amount of luggage out to the curb by myself. So although the hotel served its purpose I can't give it my highest recommendation especially as it did not seem to live up to the standards of some other very nice Meridiens in which I have stayed.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Sedona, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fridaysmom

We were asked to sit in reception where we were served a glass of hot mint tea nice touch. After 15 mins. the receptionist rang the bell and we were escorted to our room. Room was OK but no better than that quite sterile furnishings and appearance. We stayed there half board and enjoyed the first two nights where we dined in the main restaurant however for no reason that was explained to us for the next 4 nights the meal was served in the breakfast hall buffet style. The environment was again very impersonal and sterile food was average and barely warm. One benefit was that the hotel offer lunch instead of evening meal as part of a half board package. We did this on several days so that we could dine out in the evening which suited us better. The grounds and swimming pool were very nice albeit the pool is unheated thus very few people used it as the water was freezing. Service from the staff was patchy some were very nice others seemed to have attitude. It's about a half hour walk into the Medina and souks so if I were to return I would elect to stay in a centrally located riad.,Date of stay: November 2015,,"Worthing, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrownieHongKong
Le Meridien N'Fis,KellyinHouston wrote a review Nov 2015,30,Not up to Le Meridien standards!,This is at best a 3 star hotel. The grounds are lovely and the staff are very kind. I booked through a conference website and paid in advance or I would have left after the first night. Despite providing my SPG card upon check-in I was not given a room in the SPG building. My towels were stained and had been bleached and washed so many times they were very stiff and still ugly. I MIGHT have used them to clean my house but certainly not my body. The sheets are also quite stiff. I lifted the bed linens to look at the mattress (old habit after an infestation of bed bugs) and the mattress was stained and gross. I had no slippers nor bathrobes. I took a bottle of water out of the minibar only to find that the seal had already been broken so perhaps it was not bottled water but refilled with tap water.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Amal D wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Back again,Once again my congratulations of the service standards of the Meridien N'fis. I was looked after again very kindly and gracefully by the Nfl team and my thanks to Youssef and all the concierge staff for their attention.  The room on the ground floor was nicely leading to the beautiful garden full of fruiting trees fountains and plants from all over the globe; it is a mimic to Majorelle Park.  Breakfast is a very pleasant satisfying experience hosting authentic Moroccan food as well as international cuisine.  Concierge seems to be dealing specifically with one fancy tour operator. We were planning to visit Ouzoud waterfalls. They had only weekly tours on Thursday based on minimum 4 passengers; otherwise the two will pay the fare of four. Confirmation was possible only Wednesday night! In the booklet of hop on hop off bus there were other much cheaper daily options. Concierge agreed to call that company and I finalised the booking.  Overall hotel is very good relaxing and comfortable. I will be more cautious with cashier next time or settle my dues through booking agents.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Spain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10amald

Hotel location 20 minute walk from the Medina 30 minutes from the botanical gardens. Located opposite a new shopping mall music and a couple of lively restaurants open until 10pm + a Carrefour. Taxi from airport 200 MAD return was only 100 MAD.    Taxi's cheap easy to use. No real hassle at all from locals really don't bug you to buy things in the Medina all really friendly watch out for mad scooter riders in small alleys. Hotel staff helpful and friendly not many people staying pool lovely but FREEZING cold! WIFI was free but on day 2 we suddenly couldn't connect and wanted payments. Rooms I'd say only a 3* need updating. Breakfast a good selection. Bar usual prices for that type of hotel. We struggled to find anything to eat near the hotel in walking distance but easy to get a taxi (use the beige ones) food on the whole really good value and cheap.

Le Meridien N'Fis,moira t wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Lovely & comfortable hotel in heart of Marrakech,My friend and I were traveling in Marrakech in March. We are Starwood preferred guests so we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely. 2 bathrooms very comfortable bed lots of room. The pool is really wonderful the food at the pool was good and it was overall quite relaxing. The pool wasn't heated so chilly in March (it was high 80s air temp but the pool was cold - fine for me - not for my friend).    The staff was very accommodating. We were greeted with tea upon arrival. We planned a few day trips so they set us up with a driver to take us to the Atlas mountains and also a guide to take us around the Jemaa el Fna and the medina. As we were two females traveling alone it helped us feel more safe although i must say it wasn't necessary (but appreciated) as we never once felt unsafe alone or with a guide.    The complimentary breakfast was tremendous! We filled up on basically anything you could dream of and delicious juices ever morning. There is a bar in addition to the restaurants which we went to one night. Played Euro Sports.    I read someone say there were disappointed because it didn't feel like you were in Marrakech. What i liked about it was that it was a little retreat of modern comforts at the end of day exploring. You must be respectful of the local culture and religious customs every where you go (and you should certainly still do this at the hotel) but it was nice to know that at the end of the day when we were back at the hotel it was a little more relaxed (like you could be in a bathing suit and have a cocktail and it was fine).

Outside pool is also great and breakfast is just phenomenal! Housekeeping personnel was very responsive to random requests (such as late night laundry or hair dryer (the actual ones in a room are not the greatest)). The main 2 things that we did not enjoy is very low pressure in showers and the cashier (Fatima). On a check in date Fatima was very ignorant when asked a question about internet and did not want to help out while we were waiting for the room. Next day we tried to exchange some currency and she was very unprofessional i.e. did not provide exchange receipt rounded up (more than cents) the amount being exchanged for the benefit of the hotel kept talking on her cell phone etc. Other than that we enjoyed the hotel stay.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York, New York, United States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustynaK_13

Le Meridien N'Fis,Talha K wrote a review Oct 2015,20,Real Disappointment!!!,This hotel is nothing like what you may expect from Merifien. I booked rooms for myself and friends through a popular website and I feel that the rooms given by the hotel were extremely (and exceptionally) basic.    First of all the check-in time took atleast 30-45 minutes. There was only one person who came after a lot of bells and then took her sweet time for each of our check-in confusing who-is-who everytime!    The room itself had barely enough furniture to call it furnished.    The breakfast was also quite basic. Having garden chairs with no carpeting or decent tiling in the dining area made it look more like a dining mess or a cafeteria rather than one of a established hotel.    On the plus side the hotel is a walking distance away from the central district. It also has a good flower garden and a good enough pool.    On the whole the poor service at the hotel greatly outweighs the few pluses it may have. In short I will never choose this hotel again!!!,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalhaKidwai

Sometimes water in the shower during bathing has less pressure. We have stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and enjoyed breakfast a lot. The manager responsible for breakfast was always on duty with scrutiny. The hotel did not charge us for internet even usage in the room. Employees are friendly and smiling people. They do not want you to bring food and drinks from outside and there is a notice for it. Lamia has helped us whenever we asked something. This hotel is good in compare with Moroccan standards. I have checked the hotel room first by visiting and then I made a reservation after some negative comments read in TA. Do not hesitate to stay here for such a good price.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Susan A wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Good hotel but not up to the usual Le Meridien / Starwood standard,I have been a regular visitor to Marrakech for more than thirty years and this is the place that I stayed on my first trip back in the early 1980s. Since then I have stayed at this hotel on many many occasions although never reviewed it until now. Over the years the standards at the N’Fis have fluctuated greatly and it has ranged from being a top end hotel to struggling to make three stars mainly due to the Moroccan mentality of poor maintenance. This lack of maintenance is starting to show more and more now with things such as stained and grubbly looking chairs in the dining room cracked and broken tiles in the bathrooms wobbly shower fixtures and a room fridge that is so iced up and in need of de-frosting that water is dripping from it and the door can barely close. Irritatingly as well the poor water pressure in the bathroom meant that showering took forever and a day due to the slow trickle of water. You get the picture. That said the hotel has a sort of irresistible charm that somehow always seems to draw you back and make a return visit inevitable.    In terms of positives the rooms are really spacious and have tiled floors which make for good hygiene as well as offering coolness in the heat. Our twin beds were comfortable and bedding was clean. Breakfast is really good with plenty of choice .The pool area is still so lovely even if the loungers are a bit wobbly and tatty looking whilst the gardens are really beautiful and offer a sanctuary from the madness of the city. However I would caution against using the poolside restaurant at lunchtime. Although there was nothing wrong with the quality of the food a prawn avocado and mango salad costing 120 MAD (roughly £8) had just two measly prawns which was a complete rip off! By the same token we were charged 35 MAD (£2.40) for a poolside cup of tea which was a teabag dropped in little more than half a cup of lukewarm water. Poolside service was a bit hit and miss too and unbelievably with temperatures hovering around 32 deg there was no ice cream available during our four night stay due apparently to the freezer being broken. One other thing that I shall mention is to check your bill and watch out for the automatic addition of a ‘UNICEF’ donation that the hotel levies.    Overall and despite any moans and groans I think that N’Fis offers good value for money. Admittedly it’s not up to the expected Le Meridien / Starwood standard and it’s certainly not delivering a five star service despite its official five star rating but then neither is it charging five star prices.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Matlock,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanA238

Le Meridien N'Fis,LeeScottRob wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Just short of a 5 star experience,I have just returned from 11 nights in Le Méridien N'Fis and had the best time!    The hotel is opposite a shopping mall (it's still not open which is a massive disappointment because it would give you a little something to do in the area) and based a good 20 minute walk to the Medina. There are a few shops and restaurants in the area and some very pretty gardens/parks etc but this will not be your typical Riad experience so dispel any of those illusions!    The hotel itself is lovely admittedly it has the impression of a more basic 5 star feel to it however the gardens/pool/restaurant/lobby etc all are amazing. I just felt the corridors and rooms weren't exuding utter luxury but very passable all the same.    What I did find highly commendable was the service we received. Said who's the porter is the pinnacle of excellent customer service and there wasn't a thing he couldn't do for you. Our room maid gave a makeover to our room on a daily basis (I don't know how she put up with us!) and the amazing people that worked in the restaurant by the pool and the guys in the evening restaurants. I wish we had the time to say goodbye to you all! Unfortunately the service we received by the pool bar was very below par and I eventually stopped using it as it became so bad and gave my business to the smiley and friendly staff by the pool restaurant. My biggest criticism of the hotel is the lack of service in general by the pool. There is a fortune to be made by better service checking to see if the guests need anything a fully stocked menu as opposed to most of it not being available better quality ice creams that hadn't melted and then refrozen etc.....all these things can easily be rectified and quickly would make a big difference!    The food in the hotel was all excellent. A little expensive considering but presented beautifully and tasted amazing. I had the fillet steak one evening and was super impressed! We did venture for breakfast which had lots of choice and very fresh. I especially enjoyed the Moroccan pancakes! Small drawback was that there wasn't any smoked salmon but you can't have everything!    The spa and gym looked really good. Didn't use the spa as being in Marrakech I preferred to venture to the hammam so unable to give a comment there.    I didn't find the concierge desk very helpful. I wanted to book some trips and when I enquired the gentleman was plucking prices out of thin air not referring to any notes or computer screen for example so I politely said my thank you's and booked some excursions independently. Maybe I caught him on a bad day.....    All in all we very much enjoyed our stay and would love to come back another time.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Mike D wrote a review Aug 2015,30,Good with Reservations,I stopped at this hotel for two nights (August2015) on business. It is worth saying it is a resort hotel full of families and children but can provide reasonable accommodation for the business traveler.  Although I stayed in an upgraded/refurbished room it was difficult to tell. Not up to 5 star quality room and bathroom(small) felt and looked dated. Air conditioning just managed in the heat. Channel choices on TV very limited if you are English. Wifi in the room kept dropping and the business centre computers were nearly always occupied by children play games or watching films. (I know it was summer what do you expect) What the hotel does have are sme exceptional staff particularly the concierge service. Abdelhapid (concierge) was excellent first class and couldn't do enough help you.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Wagabaddog wrote a review Aug 2015,40,"Excellent Location and Great Value, But...",Le Meridien is centrally located near the train station airport and old Marrakech. If you're not willing to tow your luggage into the back alleys where you'd find some of the quainter riads and you like being able to enjoy a big pool during the blistering hot lazy afternoons then this hotel is probably better suited for you. The facilities are ample and it's right across the street from a brand new mall--so you'll have something to keep you busy all the time.    On the down side this isn't a riad so the charm level is a bit shy aside from the lobby. The rooms have weary desert hue paint and can use cheering up with brighter colors. I was fortunate to get an upgrade to a suite but most rooms are somewhat tight. And for Pete's sake the huge pillows are uncormfortably rock hard. Also while the service is good it's decidedly third world compared to actual third world service (such as the generally exceptional service at typical Bali or Bangkok resorts).    Overall Le Meridien delivers on value and the location can't be more central; you can't be next to everything after all.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Adil A wrote a review Aug 2015,20,Disapointing stay at an outdated hotel.,"Going to to this hotel I knew it wasn't the newest nor most modern but I wasn't expecting something this bad and outdated especially for a ""5 star"" hotel part of a multinational group.    The room is spartan with no style (a moroccan tile hanging on the wall and a pot are the only pieces of art) the furniture is small old and scratched up pretty bad. This is clearly the weakest point of the hotel I have been in better looking rooms in a 3 star hotel in morocco.  The bed is ok prettly comfortable the AC was working very well thankfully.  There is no balcony in the rooms just a banged up sliding glass window.  The walls are showing their age with a bad thick of paint barely hiding the cracks.  The bathroom is small and lacks some amenities you expect from a 5 star hotel. (no magnifyig mirror tiny thub no separate shower single faucet). It's still functional though...  The pool is nice with plenty of space... when there aren't kids running around... the kids pool is right next to the adults' so don't expect to nap or read by the pool without some children bomb diving and splashing you.  The service is nice and freinding from most of the staff but I'll get to that in a minute.  The food is fantastic compliments to the chef... If only the drinks weren't so overpriced!  Our stay was prepaid with breakfast and dinner included but we still had to pay for soft drinks and water... such a bad surprise it was not mentioned in the offer when we booked.    The desk staff is not what you can call helpful or forthcoming when we checked in no information was given to us about what services we had for free and what wasn't we were left to explore and constantly ask around instead of just enjoying the trip to the fullest I still have no idea if the snacks that were in the room's fridge were free or I would have had to pay them dearly at checkout.    The checkout is where the most disappointing surprise was awaiting us: during our stay we opted for the ecologic option of not having the room made necessarily and that should have been rewarded by a rebate on drinks or what they call SPG points for club members.  Our tab at checkout contained no such rebate and had quite the amount of hidden costs and ""donations to charities"" we never requested.  The lady at the desk lied her way out of granting us our due by saying that the ecologic option we took only grants us the SPG points and we aren't members (thanks for not asking if we wished to become members by the way!!) when confronted by what was actually written on the voucher she came up with another liesaying that we had to present the voucher before hand at the restaurant which is not in any way possible since the voucher is hanged on the room door for the cleaning lady to collect instead of doing the room.    This is really not the kind of service I expect from a 5 star hotel. Instead of being granted perks and freebies we were lied to and cheated out of the bare minimum.  Basically the checkout service we got was pay this pay that oh pay that too and leave already!    When I have a long way ahead of me to go back home arguing with an incompetent person at the checkout desk is not something I need. So I paid all the taxes the soft drinks and even the charities imposed on me and left never to come back again.    This hotel gets two stars from me only because the lower staff was so friendly and the food was actually really good.",Date of stay: July 2015,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235adila

This seems like a three-star maybe four-star by American standards. That said it is a quite nice hotel. The pool is probably the best part it's huge and beautiful. The garden grounds are also beautiful. It seemed mostly empty while we were there probably because we went during July when it's scorching hot in Marrakesh. Biggest frustration is that this hotel has a no-outside-food-or-drinks policy. What the &@#$? I have *never* seen a hotel before with this policy and frankly it's insulting to guests.

That was definitely not the case with this hotel. The website and brochures state one thing and the hotel is something entirely different. I stayed here the last week in February and the weather was in the high 80s. The air conditioning did not work. The satellite channels consisted of news only in English. I have yet to receive the iron or ironing board I requested (not provided in rooms only available by request). For several days I was unable to connect to the internet. The buffet breakfast was severely limited according to the standards at similarly rated hotels in the area. The room did look lovely and the view was fantastic. The gardens and grounds were beautiful. If you go to the bar be prepard to choke on cigarette smoke however!.

From the outset the reception was welcoming and warm with smiles all round and helpful staff to get you to your room in the rather unorthodox lay out of the hotel.  The grounds are very neat and tidy with a super pool the tennis courts are well maintained and a pleasure to play on (even if the score was not in my favour).  Breakfast was absolutely top class and the staff ready at every turn to help see to your every need.  A special word for Youssef Mamouni the Chief Concierge whose advise and recommendations were all spot on well done.  The hotel is close to the airport so no long rides and it is also central to everything with a huge shopping complex opening right across the road.  My room was very quiet and well looked after by housekeeping and a pleasure to return to after a hard day of sight seeing.

Le Meridien N'Fis,PhishyGuy wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Exactly what I expected but a bit more,We are SPG Platinum members so we share an allegiance to Star Wood properties. Upon booking for our 2 week holiday to Morocco we always try to find and book SPG due to status and use of points. Prior to arrival I knew the down falls of the property and didn't have my sights set to high. Just wanted a well appointed room clean a good pool and serviceable a/c. We stayed at Le Meridien 2 weeks ago as the 1st stop in our 2 week holiday throughout Morocco. We arrived very late in the evening (or ealry am) and was greeted by staff and check in was quick and seamless. We had the suite which was great in size and per other reviews a bit dated but was clean. Our 3 nights went well in the hotel the pool is fantastic the bar is good enough for some cocktails prior to or after an evening out. THe staff was very nice and always had a smile on their face. If traveling back to Marrakech I would again stay at this property. Maybe in the near future SPG will give this place a bit of a face lift to compete with the other higher end properties. I must also give a big thanks to the Conceirge Youseff. What a very helpful and pleasant man. As I arrive at any new location country hotel; I am the concierge nightmare as I always arrive with a list of questions of sights and restaurants I've researched prior to arrival and looking for answers. Youseff was very patient (great English) and offered his personal opinion on things and I basically allowed him to book all of my lunches and dinners based on his opinions and what he gathered as my taste. We were not disappointed Youseff knocked it out of the park. Every restaurant recommendation was spot on and he even got the the thumbs up from my very picky wife!!!

Le Meridien N'Fis,1BriKat wrote a review Jun 2015,40,A well located hotel with a great pool,We stayed at the Meridien recently for a short 4 day break. We had stayed at this hotel about 10 years earlier and wanted to return. The location is excellent in the area called The Hivernage and there are several other top class international hotels nearby that you can walk to for a drink in the evening. We booked half board and we could use the voucher for either lunch or dinner. The rooms in the hotel are not quite up to the standards of a 5 star Meridien hotel in the USA or but the large pool area is excellent with comfy padded loungers and a bar and poolside restaurant adjacent. The service in the restaurant was excellent.  There were no coffee making facilities in the room. I think the hotel should provide a kettle as many people enjoy a cup of coffee or tea before breakfast. The buffet breakfast had a good choice of hot and cold foods. The mattress and pillows were unfortunately very hard. We did manage to have the pillows changed after the first night but obviously nothing could be done about the mattress. Many international chains are now using pillow top style mattresses which are much more comfortable.  There is a large supermarket opposite the hotel and a major mall which will be completed shortly. It is possible to walk into the medina area or you can take a cheap cab ride. We did visit the Mamounia hotel for drinks one evening. The setting was superb and the drinks were great but the price was exorbitant. The Meridien cocktail bar both inside and out does lack ambiance and several liquors listed on the menu were not available.  To summarise we would recommend this as a good reasonably priced hotel for Marrakech particularly if you want to lounge by the pool. By chance in the new city we found an amazing pizza restaurant called Catanzaro which is definitely worth visiting. They have an extensive menu with very reasonable prices and it is only a 10minute cab ride from the hotel. The hotel also needs to join the other international hotel chains and offer free wifi in all the rooms not just the lobby.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Worth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1BriKat

The concierge and the front desk are very rushed to help you and don't seam to concerned with your happiness. The bellmen (Said especially) and the other service people are very helpful. The food is also not good but I have found that to be the norm in Marrakech. You are paying the same prices that you pay in any other city and to be honest you are not getting the same hospitality. I can tell that they cater to many different types of tourist and that can be frustrating but a smile would go a long way. We stay with Starwoods often and have been platinum members for years and are now gold perhaps we are used to the red carpet. I feel that if we were in a Riad we would have more help with recommendations and getting around the city.

Didn't feel ripped off by the currency exchange and found it best to change money as we went along. The breakfasts were great however we tried the buffet dinner on the first night a it was luke warm and not great. We did however try the main evening restaurant on another occasion and had tasty food that was value for money. The hotel is a short and very cheap taxi ride from the centre of Marrakech although if you value your life I would say that you are not feeling well to the taxi driver and ask him to drive slowly. I wasn't well on the last day so only found out this was a good idea too late. I sent a text to my husband to say that I would never criticise his driving every again if I survived the holiday!  Top tip: make sure you get change when you change your money so that you have cash for tips and taxi rides. The taxi drivers try and pull the 'I don't have any change' trick and although the trip into town only costs a couple of quid it's the principle of fairness that made my hackles rise when they said they had no change for a 50 diram note (all of £3.50!),Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Stamford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarnackSteph
Le Meridien N'Fis,FionaDawn wrote a review May 2015,40,Great Pool And Lovely Staff,Having read some of the reviews for this hotel I was not expecting much. However we were pleasantly surprised.  Firstly the rooms they are a bit dated. We were in 143 which was a first floor room over looking the garden. The garden facing rooms don't have balconies there is however full french windows. The rooms are a decent size and the beds were comfortable.  There was no kettle and the mini bar was limited. The bathrooms could do with a re - vamp but we're clean.  The rooms were kept immaculate and the cleaner seemed to be on our floor from 9.00am to about 2.00pm everyday.  Best bit of the hotel was the pool which was really quiet at times we had it almost to ourselves. It is probably primarily a business hotel so a lot of guests are working during the day.  We didn't eat in the hotel as we had a hit list of places we wanted to eat in for dinner. For breakfast every day we went out the hotel and turned right and there were a number of cafes offering breakfast for about £3.00 within a 10 minute walk.  Location was good it was a 15 minute walk to the Medina or about 30 dirhams (£2.00) by taxi. Taxis were easy to get if you stood still for a minute one appeared.  There is also a large mall straight across the road which was about to open just as we left.  Wifi is paid for in the rooms which is now standard in Starwood properties and free in the lobby.  I would recommend this hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,winey1 wrote a review May 2015,40,Pleasant surprise,I will have to be honest and say that I didn't have high expectations for this property due to it only ranking a Category 2 in the SPG world. I was heading to Marrakech for a last minute birthday celebration and we snagged some free rooms here for 3 nights. I found the location to be convenient as it wasn't very far from anything. This property borders the very exclusive area of Marrakech and is only a short drive from the Medina or about a 15 minutes walk which we did manage one day. The rooms were clean and comfortable the pool was large and very nice and the people were friendly. The only small complaint I have is the food and service at the pool is sorely lacking. We did manage to have who I think was the manager attend to our every whim on 2 seperate occasions and for that we are eternally grateful. The bartender was having a hard time and I'm going to attribute it to a language barrier. Also the bar inside needs a little help as far as the entertainment and the cocktails although again our waiter was fabulous. All in all I would recommend this hotel as far as the price quality ratio. It's certainly not a super luxurious resort but it was far above a Category 2 in my eyes.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winey1
Le Meridien N'Fis,ShesSavvy wrote a review May 2015,30,Served Its Purpose,"Let me begin by saying we used points and since this was our only option in Marrakech we stayed here. About the location...it's less than 10 minutes from the airport. We paid for an airport transfer through the hotel 500 dirhams (approx 50 euro) roundtrip going by cab would have been much cheaper.    I booked a pool view guestroom and since we're SPG Gold we always get placed on a higher floor. To my surprise they gave us a room on the second floor facing trees (we literally could not see anything but the trees next to our window) and on the total opposite side of the pool. It was quite outdated and the walls were paper thin. Somehow this was supposed to be the renovated building. The next day we moved into another building on the top floor but still not facing the pool. We thought the other buidling was outdated this one was so much worse. Also most of the towels were dirty they must not use bleach on them.    Food...As for the buffet breakfast it's not included if you pay with points it's 20 euro a day. Very high especially considering food is super cheap in Morocco but we paid it. We ate lunch in the cafe the first day and never again. Surprisingly lunch was cheaper than breakfast but neither of our dishes had any flavor so we had no desire to eat there again.    While the concierge and bell staff are helpful just know they likely get a cut of the services they recommend. We booked a city tour through the hotel. Our guide was nice enough and very cheap only 25 euro for both of us for 5 hours he hustled us in the market by taking us to overpriced high-pressure shops including argan oil co-op (""certified by the government"") antiques & jewelry and a clothing shop. Although we negotiated I'm sure we still got taken advantage of and our guide got a nice commision. Another incident after taking a cab roundtrip one night we came back out shortly after to see our cab driver handing the bellman some of the money we'd just given him.    About the area...They are building a new mall right across the street that is scheduled to open this summer. There are quite a number of restaurants in walking distance of the hotel. The better ones are off the main strip. The closest ATM is about 2 blocks away.    Next time we're in Marrakech we'll either stay in a nice riad or a luxury hotel.

The hotel has good facilities the gardens are all tidy up and are interesting the property is big and fairly well located within easy reach to all you could be interested in enjoying at Marrakech. However there are a few let-downs:    a) the rooms the restaurant the property in general clearly need a revamp (my bedroom although clean had a funny smell the shower/shampoo/etc sets were not perfectly changed every day the towels very worn out  b) the breakfast is bland there's a few options but nothing very attractive  c) the staff in general are welcoming bad note to reception that when faced with an issue with my pre-paid/not pre-paid booking didn't handle it with empathy and the customer focus I'd expect from a Le Meridien property    You still get a good value for money and you'll be look after well but if I'd choose Le Meridien for a small city break no I wouldn't.

The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the train station down the well manicured and champs elysees inspired grand boulevard. Or a 5 minute taxi ride to Jmaa al Fna.

The bar has live music every night and a block from the hotel you can find an Italian restaurant as well as a Moroccan restaurant.    This hotel is what you make it.

Le Meridien N'Fis,cranberryqueen wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Great hotel outside of the madness,Firstly please do not expect the hotel to be the same standards as Europe etc. It is North Africa so of course things will be a little bit different. Yes the hotel is not to the same standards as other Meridien hotels but we still enjoyed our stay.    Lobby area is lovely free wifi here so there are plenty of seats so that you can sit and check emails.  Check in went smoothly We were guided to our room and the restaurant bars etc was all pointed out to us while we walked to our room...it was a nice touch.    Room  Our room was an upgraded category (deluxe I think). Spacious room on ground floor so we had access to a terrace with table and chairs. Bathroom was ample with shower over bath. All areas of our room were clean no complaints. We weren't in the main building but it's only a 2 min walk away so it wasn't an issue. Bed very comfortable.    Restaurants  Breakfast  It was not included in our rate but we decided to have breakfast every day at the hotel. The food was good with a selection of cereals pastries fruit plus there is also an omelette station and pancake station where you can have something made for you there and then.  My only complaint about this is that a lot of things did not have labels on them to tell you what it was.    Lunch  The pool side restaurant was ok. Food is not great and we found the service to be quite bad. There are not enough staff to be serving the restaurant plus poolside.    Dinner  We only had dinner here on the first night as we arrived after dark and couldn't see anything in the immediate area. The menu is not very exciting but the food was ok if you just want something easy. There are other restaurants in the area (Azar Café Extrablatt) that have a better selection of food to choose from.    Drinks  There are 2 bars in the hotel one near the lobby and the other outside and inside a sort of tented area. The bar near the lobby was not to our liking cheesy live music and big TV's with football on it. The other area has a Moroccan theme nice décor with comfortable seating and live local music also Shisha is available here.    Location  The hotel is perfect if you don't want to be in the heart of things but it is only 15 minutes walk to the old town (Jemaa El Fna) Koutoubia Mosque. We felt safe walking in the daytime and at night. Also close to the Menara Gardens which is a nice walk during the day. A little but further to walk to the main train station which has a beautiful entrance. The sightseeing tour bus also stops outside the hotel which we went on one day.    Pool  The pool area is very nice plenty of sun loungers. My only complaint is that the pool was too cold for me so I never went swimming. Sometimes it was difficult to find the attendant to get pool towels.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Patrick H wrote a review Apr 2015,20,Sub-standard experience at the Meridien,I stayed at the Meridien N'Fis from 12 - 15 April 2015. Overall it was a sub-standard experience. The biggest issue is the staff attitude in general. Starting with check-in: staff were chatting with each other and I had to interrupt their discussion to be able to check-in. This does not provide any warm welcome feeling!    Then I had dinner at their restaurant where my dining experience was marred by the incompetence and questionable behaviour of their staff: serving me the wrong dishes average quality food dirty table cloths (I had to change table twice and later I noticed that they dont change table cloth after every guest - so I can just imagine what other unhygienic things happen behind in the kitchen!).    The problem with this hotel is that they operate under a well recognised international brand but manage the business as an average local brand. If they want to operate under the SPG brand they should at least have the decency to act as such otherwise it gives a bad name to the brand. Hopefully someone within SPG management will come across this and try to address that.    I have been a loyal SPG member for more than 13 years and I have to say that this was the worst ever experience I had at any of their properties.

The hotel was reasonable value compared with similar standard ones and well positioned in the more upmarket Hivernage area of Marrakech. Centrally located between the New City and the Medina about a 20 minute walk to each. Our hotel room was tired and in need of refurbishment but everything worked and we were on the fifth floor with a view of the internal courtyard gardens which were well maintained. There are some local cafes and restaurants 5 minutes walk along the main road if you turn right coming out of the hotel. There is also Cafe Extrablatt about 5 minutes walk if you turn down the first right road next to the hotel. This is a buzzing and trendy cafe but don't expect any alcohol.  The pool area is quiet clean and pleasant with probably around 50 sunloungers but it wasn't busy when we stayed so no rush to get a space. Some loungers were broken and should really be replaced. Pool areas are really important to travellers on holiday and little things like broken beds and clean sunbed mattresses will make a big difference. The landscaped gardens were well maintained and provided some serenity from the bustle of Marrakech. The hotel bar at night showed football on large screens but also provided some entertainment with live contemporary singers.  We were impressed with some of the staff including housemaids porters reception waiters and concierge. Very friendly and helpful and most spoke English. Imad on reception was excellent and Said our porter was most welcoming and helpful. However one female receptionist was not so friendly and seemed totally disinterested and unhelpful.

Having stayed back in 2003 and while it was nothing much to write home about the location and the service then made me chose to stay again this time.  Unfortunately this time was an utter disaster. For starters the swimming pool was out of action until we checked out (4 days stay). But this is nothing compared to our experience following a complaint about the housekeeper going through our stuff and helping herself to almost half a bottle of Hermes perfume.  The Duty Manager in his infinite wisdom decided the best thing to do is to knock on my door 30 mins later with the housekeeper and her boss asking me if I was sure about it and she was going to be in trouble if I did not change my story. I mean are you for real?! On what management course did you learn to confront your guests this way emotionally blackmail them to change their story and effectively admit they are lying?  This made our stay at Le Meriden untenable and once we got dressed told him we are checking out next day. He offered us a free meal which we declined. The next day as we were checking out and waiting for our taxi my girlfriend made a comment that he made no attempt to amends by at least a token discount on our food and beverage bill to which he replied "" offered you a meal which you declined and this is the procedure"". It seemed as we were checking out unhappy there was no point appeasing us. But the best is yet to come as he turned around to stay if we are still unhappy he can call the police about the housekeeper. This is as we are waiting for our taxi. I mean he had a good 18 hours to do this if he was so inclined - and the only thing we wanted to have the housekeeper not setting foot in our room again- and he instead sat on his hands. But wait still as when my girlfriend complained about his lack of empathy and stubbornness he turned around and said "" I have so many guests in this hotel and you are the only ones I'm having problems with"". Exactly how dare we complain?!  These are the worst customer service skills I have come across for a very long time. With the exception of a few people most of the staff there seemed disinterested in their jobs and pretty much by the numbers service.  On top of that the facilities seem tired and -check this out- they have a shop selling fake designer bags which I think is a first for a 5 star hotel and possibly not that kosher too.",Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariomW5886IG

The entire staff was friendly everyone from the housekeepers to the Concierge were fantastic. I was surprised and impressed by everyone. When I first checked in the bellman escorted me to the room and showed me around which is something I haven't seen much of at Starwood properties as one would think . Its something I would expect in a 5 star 5 diamond hotel.    As far as the property goes there was good and bad. The tower I was in was separate from the the main hotel. You didn't have to walk far but you had to walk outside and Marrakech is cold at night. I also felt my room and the whole hotel was cold in general. Maybe because they do leave some the doors open leading to the outside but whatever the reason it was colder compared to other Starwood hotels which was not comfortable. The hotel is in a great location it is walk able to Jemaa el Fna Square and Koutoubia Mosque. There is also Grand Mammounia Casino that is within walking distance too. It is about 10 dirhams to the airport by cab. The nearest ATM unfortunately is outside the hotel and down the street about 7 minute walk at a local bank. Outside there is a huge shopping mall under construction. I was not impressed with the food there. I did not try the breakfast but I order some Moroccan lamb steak and it was not good.    The Concierge desk was great Taoufiq and Youssef were so helpful with their knowledge of the city. Even prior to my arrival they had been corresponding with me regarding tours and shuttle pickups. Imad at the Front Desk is another outstanding member of this staff. He's so friendly and patient you can ask him so many questions and you never feel rushed by him.

I wouldn't pay the rates they are asking to stay here however. The place could definitely use some renovation the rooms have really thin walls and are a bit worn down (though clean).

Check-in was efficient late at night and service was friendly.    My suite was huge with dining table and two sofas. Wi-fi was reliable but power outlets were hard to find.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Raji C wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Beyond all expectations,Recently I stayed with Le Meridien N'Fis. It is my second stay and without a doubt this stay was amazing. On arrival I have been assistated with my luggage met and greeted with a big smile. A very warm welcome by every one in the lobby gave me a sense of being at home. At the reception the service was excellent providing me with a fast check-in. The receptionist asked a bellman to escort me to my room assisting me with the luggage. He was very friendly and helpful he was also aware of all facilities within the hotel. This explains how far is the company providing sustainable training to its staff. When I entered the room I was surprised that I was upgraeded to a better room than the one I booked. All my preferences and requests were fulfilled which explains the uncompromising service the hotel is providing.The view the bed type everything were perfect. Rooms are clean warm and accommodating. After few minutes of check-in I received a call to ensure that everything is OK and if I liked the room? It was a very unique touch of care and a bespoke service from the hotel customer service.    I would like to mention housekeeping guys they are amazing. In every and each time I meet them on the colidors they greet me with a genuine smile. They kept my room clean and fresh all the time. A big thank you goes to them.    On my departure day a noise coming from outside waked me in the early morning. There was an event on the main street blocking the road for almost 5 hours. Guests werw supposed to be informed by an servive desk or at least to place an apologizing letter in the room explaing what's going on. Still I have to admit that upon check out the cashier gently inquired about my stay which was a memorable one and very personalized.    I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to every one who made my journey and my stay a lovely one.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rajic2015

Breakfast offered so much choice you had to stop yourself and we ate there on my wife's birthday and the lamb was divine; wine reasonably priced so a god night.

Very impressive from outside (and interior) with extremely friendly staff.  Bags carried from cabs and then on to rooms (there were 6 of us in 3 rooms) reception very helpful and quick and complimentary glasses of mint tea provided at check in  Escorted to our rooms with explanations of situation of restaurants/bars/fitness centre  Nice clean rooms with garden views.  Coffee and shish pipe in Arab tent expensive at £30 so would miss that. Did not eat breakfast in hotel got taxi to Market Square £2 to eat well and inexpensively there.  Really good market at night with good food and reasonable prices.  There is one really cheap cafe which only sells soup (in a big cauldron) sticky sweets and mint tea - 25 pence for each choice!

The hotel is good but it totally lacks atmosphere which is the thing you look for when visiting Marrakech...    The price we paid was very high compared to the riads so I do not recommend this hotel in terms of value for money (and wi-fi access in rooms was not included in our rate... this is really not acceptable!).    A part from this I cannot complain: rooms are large and clean and you have all the facilities of a big international chain.

Le Meridien N'Fis,jhw765 wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Great stay - pleased who choose to stay here,Le Meridien N'Fis    We recently stay two nights at the Le Meridien N'Fis and enjoyed our stay. We are SPG members which influenced our choice and I am glad we choose this hotel for our nights in Marrakesh.    We got in touch with concierge Youssef before our trip as we had never been to Morocco. He has been with the hotel for many years and knows a great deal about the city country and speaks many languages. He was extremely helpful with all of our questions and set up a car from the airport to the hotel (which we recommend doing instead of a cab).    When we got to the hotel we were greeted by very friendly staff and custom Moroccan tea. The lobby is very authentic and inviting. Youssef meet us and asked what else he could do to make our trip better. We asked for some recommendations for dinner and he made our reservations – both meals were extremely good. He knew the best places to go.    The pool at the hotel is beautiful and quiet large. A perfect place to relax on hot hot afternoons.    We went to the Medina later in the afternoon and Youssef told us where to enter as there are many gates. We got a cab from the hotel and they helped us with the rate (more about the cabs later). We spent some time in the Medina walking around and shopping. There were plenty of cabs available but we choose to walk. It was an easy walk home from the Medina to the hotel.    The cabs in Morocco do not have meters. We did all of our cabs through the hotel or restaurant we were at to have the rate negotiated before we agreed. It worked out very well and recommend having them do the same for you.    The rooms at the Le Meridien N’Fis were also nice and very comfortable for western travelers. The rooms are big and quiet with air conditioning that works well! And when we arrived there was a beautiful fruit plate in the room. A very nice treat!    We highly recommend staying at this location. I wish we had more time to book a treatment at the hotel and another Hammam. I know Youssef would had great recommendations of where to go and would recommend you plan that ahead of your trip.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Lutecia wrote a review Jan 2015,30,"Ok location, friendly and very efficient service but the facilities are tired.",I spent three nights at this establishment and summary is that the soft side (service) is very good but the hard side (facilities) is fairy poor. I did not encounter any staff that is unfriendly or rude and literally everyone was friendly and provided efficient service. On the other hand the tiredness of facilities are quite noticeable. There may be newly refurbished rooms but the executive room that I stayed at was on all honesty the shabbiest room I have ever seen among the Starwood hotel group. So if you do not want to spend over 200 pounds but would rather have something better than less than 100 category this place is indeed a great choice as the stay can be fairly pleasant provided the expectation is kept low for facilities.    The following are some snapshots-    Check in: very efficient  Breakfast: good selection from fresh fruits to hot breakfast. Quite satisfying  Bar: limited selection for food. Avoid if you cannot stand the smoke smell  Pool bar: quite pleasant and decent options for lunch  Spa: seems to be rather short staffed and relaxation may not be provided much if the visit is over busy time of year  Bathroom amenity: decent. Conditioner separated from shampoo(I.e. Not those mixed ones!) provided in ample quantity  Towels: relatively new and decent quality  Concierge: helpful and efficient  Welcome fruits in the room: this was very disappointing. All too ripe and seemed like it was sitting in the room for some days! They should either provide nothing or serve something decent  House keeping: room was kept very clean as any other part of the hotel  Wifi: inconsistent and slow.

They couldn't give me a better room so they sent someone in to move the two beds apart. It was weird.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Philip A wrote a review Dec 2014,20,Look Elsewhere...Not hard to find better,"We are currently staying at the Le Meridien and have to say it is a bit of a disappointment to say the least.    The hotel is very close to the airport so you should have no problem finding a taxi and it should be very cheap. The hotel is located on a very busy street corner so you can hear lots of road noise at all times of the day and night.    The lobby is fine and the gardens are very nice but that is where the positive ends. The room is very basic which is fine but the door is very thin and you hear every conversation and door close in the hallway. Breakfast is not up to Le Meridien standards but does have an egg station and Moroccan crepe station still not worth the $25 they want to charge per person.    The service from the front desk is HORRIBLE.. From the concierge on down. We had multiple reservations and told them 4 times so we would not have any issues with the key card but they never added it to the system. When we went back to the lobby to sort it out the manager on duty at the platinum check in desk could not even lift his head up to acknowledge we were standing there (yes I am an spg plat). The concierge was more interested in recommending a shop he would get a commission at than helping you... ""Make sure you tell them my name the concierge from the Le Meridien sent you"". The evening concierge was just as unknowledgeable.

Le Meridien N'Fis,DrMedhat wrote a review Dec 2014,40,"Very good Place , take care",Perfect location with easy access from airport and railway station in a relatively expanding quiet corner of Marrakech. There is a new mall building complex under construction just across the road. You can pleasantly walk to Medina in 25-30 minutes or take a taxi and insist on running the meter for 10 Dirham's.  Check in was swift apart from reservation issue which should have been covered and paid by my company. I was asked to pay in Dirham's or pay a deposit by credit card or cash till that issue was resolved. For unknown reasons my active gold credit card was not accepted by cashier. I handed SR 2500 in cash in 5 notes he dropped them in a shielded area of his desk then held four notes in his hands telling they were only 4 notes only SR 2000. Also he showed the envelop with foreign currencies with no more SR! He also assured me that SR 2000 was enough as a credit or down payment. I was ripped of SR 500 (about $150) in a second. Take much care when handing over notes give one by one counting in audible voice.  Room is spacious and comfortable. There was no kettle. Get your traveller kit if you would need tea or coffee. Electricity plugs are 220 European two pins. I usually have an extension electricity wire to fit my laptop mobile chargers and kettle. Internet is both costly and weak in the rooms free but slow in the lobby. Data SIM cards are much cheaper readily available either from Malls railway station airport or city centre.  The room on the ground floor was nicely leading to the beautiful garden full of fruiting trees fountains and plants from all over the globe; it is a mimic to Majorrelle Park.  Breakfast is a very pleasant satisfying experience hosting authentic Moroccan food as well as international cuisine.  Concierge seems to be dealing specifically with one fancy tour operator. We were planning to visit Ouzoud waterfalls. They had only weekly tours on Thursday based on minimum 4 passengers; otherwise the two will pay the fare of four. Confirmation was possible only Wednesday night! In the booklet of hop on hop off bus there were other much cheaper daily options. Concierge agreed to call that company and I finalised the booking.  Overall hotel is very good relaxing and comfortable.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Linda P wrote a review Dec 2014,40,Calmness and relaxation,Although not in the Medina this hotel is well placed and provides a relaxing atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Getting into the Medina is no problem - it's a pleasant walk or you can take a horse drawn carriage or a taxi. The tourist double-decker open topped bus stops right outside the hotel so you can hop on that and do the tour to get your bearings and hop on or off as you wish.  The rooms are large and comfortable the gardens exquisite breakfast excellent and staff friendly and helpful.  There are just a couple of reasons why I have not given it a 5 rating.  On the first night we were looking forward to a Moroccan meal and our appetites were whetted by the porter taking great care to point out the restaurant and describe the dishes available. Unfortunately we found a group had taken over the restaurants so we were left to eat in the breakfast room and it took some negotiation to get Moroccan food rather than the western buffet. If we had known this was the situation we would have saved out hotel meal for another night. As it was this experience put us off eating there again.  Our return flight was a late one so we planned to use the room until the checkout time of 12. Whilst we were at breakfast that day all the towels were taken from the room so we could not have the planned showers and relaxation before our journey. The result was we went out for a walk and had lunch out instead of in the hotel.  These are small points but ones which could be put right at no cost.  On the whole it was a very pleasant stay.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leek, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaPP60

In the surrounding area there are many very good restaurants and bars. The gardens within the hotel are beautiful and provide a very relaxing atmosphere. The swimming pool is good but would be better if heated and as the loungers are properly managed by the hotel there were always some free when we were there. If people leave towels etc on loungers for hours the staff will move them to the side if someone is looking to use the area.  The food was good with a fair choice at breakfast and restaurants offering different menus at lunch and in the evening. The bar is a large welcoming area which is very well staffed and has entertainment every night.  The room we had was very comfortable offering a separate lounge and bedroom with an en suite containing separate shower area and bath and another WC in the hall. The bed was very comfortable and although the towels were changed daily there were no problems asking for more if required. The room and hotel in general was very clean and staff helpful and friendly.  I have been in better Meridien Hotels but have also paid twice as much.

As a SPG platinum member I was first upgraded to an executive room but because we travelled with our 9-year-old son the general manager Mathieu de Tonnac decided that we needed more privacy and upgraded us to a 4th floor Ambassador Suite! Our son could sleep in the living room. This was a greatly appreciated gesture. Then we received champagne (Moët & Chandon) and a huge fruit plate!  The hotel has a vast lush and well maintained garden and a nice pool (but the water was very cold). I was surprised to see so many flowers in bloom in november even roses.  To whole staff was extremely friendly and helpfull especially the concierges Youssef and his assistant Taoufiq as well as Saïd the doorman.  I was nicely surprised to find the hotel in better shape than I feared when reading some reviews. True the decoration of the rooms is not modern but with moroccan accents. Also true the curtains are ""tired"" some with small holes in it but it did not impaire the room darkening so we didn't care. The bathroom was big with separate bath and shower and still looked as new. There was an extra toilet in the living area nice for our son. On the downside the pillows were too hard for us to sleep well. Also we had some issues with the room service twice we didn't receive what we ordered but the food was OK.  Breakfast was included since I choosed it as platinum amenity. The offering was sufficient but not great if you have to pay the 200DH for it.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Paul V wrote a review Nov 2014,40,A nice resort in the heart of the city,We stayed first in LeMeridien before we went on to Rabat and stayed in a traditional Riaad in the medina. LeMeridien was a nice way to ease into the whole Moroccan experience. Situated on a main street with lots of shops and attractions within walking distance but far enough from the old center of the city. The rooms were clean and presentable the pool area kept immaculate and the restaurants on premise varied enough for the average American and foreign traveler who isn't quite ready to immerse themselves 100% into the culture. We ate on premises for 1/2 of our meals and ventured out to the city and suburbs for other experiences.    When I travel my partner and I find it more convenient to engage a car and driver (cost is about the same for 2 on a tour bus). Most of the drivers are quite familiar with the city and attractions and make a wonderful tour-guide. Of course we researched the attractions and places we wanted to see and our driver also had some other suggestions. He took us to a wonderful modern restaurant on the edge of town that specialized in Moroccan delicacies and tagines. Our driver also took us to a place where we were able to ride camels.

Breakfast was good but often needed to replenish things which took quite a long time. Would not stay again despite the spg points. Many Americans on our visit- perhaps because of spg?

Le Meridien N'Fis is an average hotel but honestly the service is terrible.  My company pre-paid for my room and other 3 colleagues. We did it through the spg website. They never acknowledge the payment despite the fact our coordinator sent a form with all the company credit card information but the cashier was extremely rude.  Don't stay here. They will try to steal your money whenever they can.  Besides that construction work is going on and I saw a few rats on site. Terrible!

It was our first visit to Marrakech. Upon arrival and throughout our stay the staff were attentive informative and nothing appeared to be too much trouble. Youssef Mamouni Head of Concierge was extremely knowledgable and assisted us on a number of occasions. The seating in the lobby could do with being spruced up and I believe not all the rooms have yet been refurbished but this is ongoing. We had a very pleasant room on the second floor. The Moroccean restaurant was good. In my opinion the hotel is perfectly placed for sight seeing.

The management is always around and visible making sure that we are taken care of this is very important to us as we travel a lot and seldom get this level of attention. This is our 5th year in a row and we generally stay 1-2 weeks in october. This time we decided to spend most of our days by the pool with our daughter and had most dinners at La Marocaine restaurant. We needed a lot of rest and moroccan cuisine. We feel that the food quality has improved again and the service remains outstanding to us certainly due to the stunning moroccan hospitality culture.

Le Meridien N'Fis,HerewecomeLondon wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Amazing staff!,Just returned from a 7 night stay at Le Meridien N'Fis. The staff here are remarkable. We were travelling for the first time with our 7 month old daughter which was a challenge in itself. We found the staff at this hotel to be thoughtful helpful and incredibly efficient. Every query was met with a smile and each staff member went above and beyond. I had the flu during our stay and the room service and breakfast staff presented me with a hot lemon and honey drink each morning and evening. We had to call the UK due to an issue with our debit card and was disappointed to find that the call was very expensive. My husband spoke with the General Manager Matheiu who reduced the charges by 50%. Calls are expensive from morocco to the uk so this made a HUGE difference to us and ensured that when returning to Marrakech that we'll stay once again at this wonderful hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jam wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Average stay,"Stayed at this property last November and it seems from the current reviews that nothing has changed. The location is in the 'modern' part of the city though not far away from the Old Medina. The welcome was lovely the elderly porter was very accommodating. The rooms are standard and needs to be refreshed a bit. I do remember having to request for toothbrush and toothpaste in the evening and it came the next morning. There was very weak wifi in the room which was very inconvenient since i was traveling for business and needed access to my emails often. I brought this up with the reception who just suggested i come downstairs to use the wifi in the public area. I passed by the spa reception to have a look on my second day but was greeted very inappropriately with ""What do you want?"". Obviously i had my spa experience somewhere else after that better value for money and definitely better service. The breakfast is ok and enjoyed the Moroccan dinners with music in the evenings.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ann C wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Somewhat isolated-refreshing to get away from the Medina,"Overall this place is average. In Euros the price is fair for what you get.  -The WORST pillows ever!- clumpy and hard far too thick- I slept with NO pillow because they were so bad.  -There are old towels in the rooms that are rather dingy and thin.  -The service was hit or miss- beyond inconsistent sometimes it was 5 star sometimes it was beyond poor.  -The breakfast was good some days and poorer on other days- some days they were well covered and strong other days it seemed like they did not care- literally. The seating takes a bit to get used to it is not very comfortable. The Moroccan ""crepe"" we highly recommend. There is also a traditional Moroccan soup with fresh lime served daily that was nice. There is no bacon or pork sausage (We assume because they are mostly Muslim and therefor do not deal with pork). Bahim is an omelet master and will make you very happy with your egg selection. Taha is the hospitality manager and will make sure all of your needs are met.  -The pool has potential however there is algae in the tile walls and they monitor you with the towels other pools do not seem to mind if you take the towel to your room here there are very strict that you leave it.  TIPS: LE6 is a restaurant you will see if you turn right out of the entrance(very short walk). Their prices are fair and food was good.  We also recommend hail a cab from the street as apposed to having the hotel get one for you (you can barter a better price I.E.: 20 DH to go to the big square)  We enjoyed click-excustions (found on line) for day trips.",Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nashville, Tennessee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K1078RKannc

Le Meridien N'Fis,Felicity_ssimo wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Impeccable customer service,This is the first time my husband and I stayed at a Le Meridien property. We were extremely impressed with the customers services we received. We've both stayed at many hotels that offer good customer services but Le Meridien N'Fis stood out because of the personal touch. Mathieu( the hotel GM) and his team sure knows how to make you feel special.    When first arrived at the property we were informed that we were upgraded from the standard room we booked to a suite. The front desk gentleman also told us Mathieu the GM will be here to greet us in a couple of minutes. We just finished the 2-day Toubkal trek and showed up at the hotel tired and dirty (we were literally covered in mud when we arrived at the hotel!). But the hotel staff did not judge us because of that and Mathieu gave us the warmer welcome.    In addition to complimentary fruit plates breakfast and all the normal good stuff we were invited to the cocktail party held at the hotel lobby on Friday night which turned out to be one of the funniest night we had during our 2-week visit in Morocco. The Le Meridien had a focus on art and culture. There are many art work being displayed at the hotel lobby. The artist of these work was invited to the party so he was able to share the story behind these paintings. I found it generally hard to meet people when you stay at a big chain hotel but we were able to meet people with very interesting life story at the event.    I found the hotel room a bit dated but I would stay here again without hesitation because the service makes up for it.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cassis, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Felicity_ssimo
Le Meridien N'Fis,Malo G wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Memorable - Will return,I stayed at Le Meridien N’FLS at the end of August with my wife and daughter initially for 4 nights and returning for one final night after travelling elsewhere in Morocco during our ten-day vacation. The location of the hotel was about a 25-minute walk from the town centre which we opted to do in the evenings when it was cooler as it also gave us a nice opportunity to mingle with the locals as they slowly strolled around the outskirts of the Medina enjoying the beauty of their city. In the daytime the taxi fare was 20 Dirham.    From the moment we arrived at our hotel which is situated on a beautifully modern tree lined part of the city with a new Shopping Mall being built nearby we were impressed with the warmth of the welcome from the staff and their professionalism throughout our stay.    Before our arrival we had contacted the hotel with a few specific requests through concierge staff Youssef and Taoufiq and these were all provided exactly as requested. Throughout our stay the staff were courteous and friendly. The restaurant staff who took very good care of our requirements at breakfast and evening dinner and for them no request was too much. Ghyzlan in particular who looked after the area where we often dined was a real treasure. One long-established staff member who made an immediately engaging impact on us by his professionalism calmness and breadth of knowledge was Said who everyone we spoke to regarded as a key part in the machinery of the hotel. I am surprised that the hotel management has not sought to have his image as the face of Le Meridien N’FLS as his unforgettable approach to making our stay as comfortable safe and happy as possible is an incentive in itself for our assured return. We came to regard Said as a friend and having since recommended the hotel to a number of friends who have vacations planned in Marrakech we have mentioned him as a good ambassador for the hotel.    In terms of the hotel itself the grounds with the water features and rich variety of pants is stunning; our connecting rooms were spacious - with TV and minibar - comfortable and well maintained; the food was of a good standard and on our bed and breakfast package we ate well. Their attention to detail was reassuring as we were able to secure the same rooms when we returned for a single night prior to our return to the UK; and Said in his usual inimitable fashion secured our rooms for most of our final day so that our luggage was left safely in our rooms until we returned to collect them for onward transportation to the airport. There was also a rich selection of good inexpensive places to eat around town when we wished to eat out. Wifi only being free in the lobby was not a real problem as we had the alternative of selecting one of the billed package options which was not overly expensive and could be shared by up to three devices.    The swimming pool and sunbathing area was excellent as was the Hammam which we treated ourselves to after a hectic day of travel. Having thoroughly enjoyed our time in Morocco together with our stay at Le Meridien N’FLS my wife and I intend to return in the near future and look forward to another stay at this hotel which we can thoroughly recommend.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malog885

Le Meridien N'Fis,a114411a wrote a review Sep 2014,10,BEWARE. This is not a 5 star hotel,I would say it's a 2 star for the following reasons:  1. The rooms are outdated and dirty. The walls are paper thin. You hear people walking above you you can hear your neighbor talking opening their sliding glass door... The doors to the room slam the minute you let go of them disturbing everyone on your floor. I did not sleep through the night for the 3 nights that I was there. Had I not prepaid for the rooms I would have checked out after the first night.    2. The breakfast is mediocre at best. Granted it was free since I'm a Platinum member but I would have been outraged if I had paid for it.    3. I asked the concierge once to recommend a restaurant. He told me the name and confirmed the reservation in front of me. By the time I got back to my room I forgot the name of the restaurant. I called him and asked the name again and he basically said I will write it down for you pick it up when you leave. Really??? This should have been done when I first approached him.    Being that I am a platinum SPG member with 88 nights stay so far this year there was no real recognition of my status. No upgrade offered. I reserved 2 rooms. 1 was a superior room and 1 was a deluxe room. After I arrived in the rooms I checked out the pictures of the rooms on the SPG website. The rooms we were given were both superior rooms according to the website. When I went to inquire about it I was told nicely they they upgraded the one room and they were both deluxe rooms. Both rooms were on the second floor looking at tree tops with no views at all. Thanks for the upgrade    This is by far the worst hotel I have stayed in within the Starwood properties. That being said there are a couple of positive things about the hotel.  1. The staff is very courteous and professional with the exception of the concierge.    2. The grounds and the pool area is beautiful.    3. Nice location conveniently located especially since a new luxury mall is being built right across the street.    4. Wifi worked great    Marrakech is a great city but this Platinum member will never stay at this property again.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Miami Beach, Fl",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a114411a
Le Meridien N'Fis,212CID wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Great staff,Me and a friend stayed for a week at the end of August our first time in Marrakech. The hotel itself is more alike to a 4* in the UK rather than a 5*. Within the grounds are some fantastic gardens our room overlooked them and it is certainly a very good view to open the curtains in the morning with a bit of birdsong and the smell of greenery.    The room itself was in good condition akin to what you'd find in any large international hotel chain. Mini-bar safe TV and table. We didn't really spend much time in the room so we didn't need anything extravagant. Unfortunately the wifi is only free in the lobby in the room there is a 80dhm/day charge. However there are plenty of sofas in the lobby (and bar) to lounge upon. Yes it was slightly annoying having to go there to connect but it was nice to not be checking my phone every five minutes.    We did bed and breakfast which was a standard buffet fare. Eating out is much better value in Marrakech proper that full board isn't really necessary. We ate in the hotel the first night the food was very good but you are paying hotel prices.    To get into town there are usually taxis outside. On the meter (if you can get it) you'll pay 7 dhm to the Jeema el Fna however if you need to get somewhere in a hurry then pay no more than 20 dhm (30dhm by night). They're currently building a large shopping centre nearby with a Carrefour but it's about 25dhm to the other large one if you fancy a bit of food shopping.    You can walk into town from the hotel it'll take you about 45 minutes though.    The pool isn't as big as it looks in the pictures but it is still big enough. We never had any issues getting a deck chair and they give out towels by the pool. One day we saw the staff conducting a life saving drill complete with defibrillator and oxygen masks. Certainly it fills me with confidence that such training is being undertaken by the pool attendants. The front desk staff speak very good English too.    What really impressed me about the hotel was the staff all are very friendly and willing to help wherever they can. The concierge Youssef is fantastic full of knowledge about the local area and places to visit. He set us up with a great hammam (Les Bains de l'Alhambra) and if you fancy some shopping in particular then he can point you out the place to go. Service with a smile at its finest.    A particular mention goes to Hassan (if I've got the spelling right) at the front desk. We had an issue changing some money and came up a bit short which was only noticed a few hours later. He gave us the difference on our word and a handshake where I know many other hotels would have simply raised their hands and given the 'you should have told us at the time' excuse.    For me the staff are what make this hotel yes it could do with a little bit of sprucing in places and it is annoying about the wifi but I know that if I need help then they will do their absolute best to assist. That is worth more than anything else to me.    I have recommended the hotel to others and look forward to returning in the future.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"East Finchley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212CID
Le Meridien N'Fis,kbush520 wrote a review Sep 2014,40,Good not great,"First off (as many others have stated) the hotel could probably use a renovation. Definitely not a US / European 5 star standard but it's still quite nice - just simply a bit outdated. Keep in mind that it may not meet your initial ""Le Meridien"" standards.    Used points and SPG suite night awards for a nice suite with a small balcony. Room was very comfortable wifi reception was solid (although wifi is pretty spotty in other areas of the hotel) and everything was clean and tidy. Only tried the breakfast here (SPG Platinum members receive it for free) and like a lot of other facets of the hotel - it was good but not great.    Location: the hotel is about a 20 min walk / 20 dirham 5 min cab ride from the Medina. Some people may hate being that far away others may like having a little distance from the hectic pace of the old city. Personal call here. I for one didn't mind taking the short walk in the morning. There are a few restaurants around the corner and a huge mall is being built across the street. Overall not a ton of options for dining but a short walk or cab will get you to some great places (go try Azar!).    If you're using points - definitely not a bad option. Staff was very friendly too!    FYI paid 70 dirham to the hotel from the airport 100 dirham heading back to the airport at night (all taxis are more expensive in the evening).",Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbush520

Le Meridien N'Fis,nabz72 wrote a review Sep 2014,40,A good base in Marrakech ...,First time out in Marrakech on a short break with my son I looked at trip advisor for guidance. Having reviewed some of the hotels I had originally been looking at where the official photos just didn’t match the traveller photos I decided to go with a brand where you know at the basic level what you will get.    The Le Meridian is a very good good hotel but there are certainly some areas that could improve. Five star rated it most certainly is but it is not comparable to a 5 * rated hotel in Europe or the Middle East and nor should you expect it to be.    One thing that is certainly 5* is the service. The staff across the hotel were polite helpful and able to answer and deal with pretty much every request quickly and efficiently. Constantly being asked around the hotel if things were ok or if I needed anything certainly made you feel well looked after and welcome.    Stayed here on a half board basis so evening meal was included. Breakfast had a great variety and more than enough choice for most palettes. The chef on the egg station gets my thumbs up though for doing a great job he was eggtastic. Perfect every time.    Evening meals were a buffet with core ingredients daily beef lamb chicken vegetable rice and fish. Food quality was good but if I’m honest I doubt I would book half board again as there just isn’t enough variety in flavours maybe a grill selection or a change of cuisine would have been nice.    We had lunch one afternoon at the restaurant near the pool and this was disappointing my son had a pizza which was pretty awful and my beef sandwich I’d say was average and nothing to write home about so food quality here certainly could be better.    On to the room. Good size room with all basic needs covered. Excellent bed providing fantastic sleep quality. Decent pressure on the showers is always welcome rather than the drip you get at some hotels so another plus here. I suppose if I was going to be picky about the room lack of face towels was noted.    The hotel has one decent size pool ranging in depth from 1.2 - 1.6 metres and also a shallow kids pool alongside. The pool was never crowded and if you brave the morning chill of the pool you’d have it all to yourself. Pool area used to get a little busier in the afternoons but mainly with sun worshippers rather than people using the pool. The grounds of the hotel are lovely to wander around and very well maintained and make for a nice relaxing evening stroll.    On a final note. The hotel offers overpriced in room wifi but you do get free wifi in the lobby and the bar. Now this could be a ploy by the hotel to attract guests into the lobby to make it feel lively and if that is the case it works as you’ll see a huge range of laptops tablets and phone on display and being used. However no free wifi across the hotel is a major let down for me and something that needs addressing.    Overall a nice well located hotel 15 minutes walking to the Medina and about 20 minutes walking to the new parts of Marrakech.

Le Meridien N'Fis,René R wrote a review Aug 2014,40,Good location near Medina,Our first room was #143. The hallway needs to be updated in this portion of the hotel because the paint was chipped and the walls were banged up. It was a small room and the air conditioning didn't work. We could hear birds chirping all night which didn't help the sleep quality on top of a hot room.    On our second night we requested a change to a suite and were given #224. We stayed in this room two nights. In this building the hallway was very nice. We had two bathrooms a king bedroom living room dining table and a large furnished private patio. There was a beautiful carved heavy wood sliding door that was interesting. In this room as in the first the air conditioning did not work. We asked maintenance to fix it and they said they did but there was no change in the temperature.    On the beds were very heavy synthetic duvets which were not appropriate for summer weather especially given that the air conditioning didn't work.    It was odd that there was no sofa bed in the living room. Our teenage son was with us so they had to bring in a rollaway bed. I had a discussion with a manager upon check-out re extra charges for our son. She said that it was SPG policy to charge extra for children over 12. We stay at SPG's almost exclusively and in the U.S. there are no such charges. I phoned SPG and was told it is up to the individual hotels. I brought this to her attention and eventually she removed the charges.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Gatos, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renery

Le Meridien N'Fis,CalliW wrote a review Aug 2014,20,Understaffed.....,My husband and I stayed here a year ago and had a completely different experience. Yes the hotels rooms are in need of an upgrade but for the value they are spacious and clean. The pool and grounds are great but the best thing is the concierge!    Now the bad news....the staff at the front desk is rude and not helpful. I had to wait 45-1 hour for my room even thought I was checking in 4 PM (and I am a SPG Platinum Member!) The staff seemed annoyed and it took three calls to get someone to come up and fix the safe and the shower (it wouldn't drain.) I felt sorry for the employee running the snack bar at the pool since it was one man despite the fact that the pool was so crowded that you couldn't get a seat. Even when he ran out of supplies such as ice he had to run and refill them himself (which often meant waiting 30-45 minutes when you went up to the bar. Breakfast included orange drink instead of orange juice (in a country with oranges running 20 cents per kilo this is a shame:( Finally when I checked out my bill was incorrect and it took some arguing to get it fixed (e.g. the menus at the pool say 20% off for SPG members. When I mentioned this they said it was taken off but I reminded them that I looked at the prices and it wasn't included. Then they said they don't offer 20% off to SPG members so I offered to go get the menu and then they finally took the 20% off.)

This is my second visit to lovely Marrakech but my first stay at the Meridien. While the staff were friendly and helpful the food great and the gardens and pool lovely I found the rooms to be outdated. This is not to state that the rooms were not clean; in fact the cleanliness levels of the property in general was good. The location of the hotel is good too within a 15-minute walk to the souks and a 20 min drive to the airport. While I enjoyed my stay at the Meredien I would recommend that the hotel commences renovations to its rooms.

Some of the staff is quite helpful others clearly dislike their jobs and couldn't be more unpleasant.  What's crazy is that you see the same wait staff at all hours of the day!  There is nothing near the hotel which makes me wonder how another reader could say it's perfectly placed! One must take a taxi if one wants to go to any of the Gueliz restaurants or shops. I love a good walk but not necessarily in heels. The medina is a good 15-20 minutes away by foot. We were there during Ramadan when there are few to no taxis about after nightfall.

Le Meridien N'Fis,cherylph wrote a review Jul 2014,30,Le Meridien But...,That's essentially the gist of it; the big thing is that I wouldn't have chosen this hotel without the incredible exchange rate of SPG points per night per room (3500 per night for a 2 person room) making it a free stay. I imagine if I had to pay for it I'd be pretty disappointed.    There was nothing particularly awful about the place; the rooms were large and comfortable. The bathrooms were clean and spic-and-span. It was just that the entire hotel is obviously due for a renovation and it shows. It's very very old and I don't think the maintenance has been kept up. The pool was the exception but aside from a few people here and there rarely did we see people using it. The place is dated and it shows.    The internet was free due to SPG program but the coverage was spotty and unreliable; taking a look at the rates I found it to be expensive. If you were there for work this would have pissed you off.    The thing is that the staff? Super nice and helpful. So if you're looking for a personal touch this would be a good hotel for that. We were having an argument with a local taxi driver (classic told us one thing quoted us another at the end) and we had someone come out and assist us.    Marrakech is gorgeous and the medina is amazing. But if I was paying I'd probably choose a different hotel closer to the Koutoubia.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylph

Le Meridien N'Fis,IlariaK wrote a review Jul 2014,20,Pool and grounds are nice...that's about it!,"We stayed at this hotel using points and my husband is a platinum member. Our stay was ok but I would be angry if I had paid for this ""5 star"" (not!) hotel.    For the pros: the grounds are really lovely! Huge gardens lots of plants and palm trees. The pool area is nice and the pool big enough for a lot of guests. The rooms were very clean and the bed linens were crisp and beds very comfy. Most staff are fairly friendly. Walking to the center takes about 15-20 mins.    The Cons: The lobby is hideous. Ugliest couches I have ever seen: 70s meet 80s and splatter paints everywhere (it’s on the glass doors as well). The hotel overall is pretty tired: the rooms have seen better days: we had one suite which was ok (except for the awful couch) but the regular room was really bad the decor dated and the fixtures (especially the doors) in need of remodeling. The carpets in the hallways are gross stained burned...    Do not stay at this hotel during Ramadan it is insane! At sunset EVERYONE disappears. there is no staff around at all. No one at the reception cashier no porters no bartenders…CRAZY! I understand religion and customs but this is an international 5 star hotel service should be at a certain level all the time! They should schedule/take turns or whatever to make it work...Not here. My family and I were sitting at the bar ready to watch a world cup game and there were no staff around no bartenders to get a beer...once they re-emerged we were told we would have to wait 30-45 minutes for food cause everyone was 'breaking their fast'. It was past 8pm and we have 3 children...If you cannot provide 5star service during Ramadan then you should discount your rates accordingly!    Speaking of food the food options are non-existent- not really options actually! The ""Morocaine"" restaurant has a regular menu posted outside of it  but I was told that menu was not available and they only had the buffet (340dirhams) or I had to order from the bar (SEVEN food choices). The upscale restaurant is closed. the pizzas we got had no tomato sauce at all it was basically flat bread with melted cheese.    At the bar they were out of draft beer and peanuts! Yes I said ""at the bar""! LOL    Breakfast was nothing special. the usual tired fare in a very ugly restaurant. The foul modamas was the saddest thing! Service was hit or miss in both bar and restaurant but pretty sloppy overall.    Due to my husband's platinum status we had free internet but otherwise you'd have to pay (and it was down a lot)    As I said we used points but overall if we had had paid for this hotel we would have been LIVID!",Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Saratoga, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IlariaK

The dinner we had one evening there was not much option for a vegetarian the soup was very watery with little taste. My friend ordered a chicken tagine and it was very oily and not very tasty either.

Le Meridien N'Fis,COL333 wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Good option for long stay,We stayed here for a week and were happy with our choice. The riads are generally recommended for the authentic Marrakech experience but I think the hustle and bustle of staying in the medina would be tough going for a week. The Meridien has lovely grounds and a fantastic pool area which allow for a relaxing element to a holiday in Marrakech. It is also a 5-minute taxi to the medina (agree a price first and don't pay more than 30 dirhams).    The staff here are very friendly generally especially in the restaurant and bar and a special mention goes to Said one of the porters. However service delivery was a little variable with some of the reception staff less effective.    The breakfast was of quite good quality and was available from 6.30 to 10.30. We ate one evening at the daily evening bbq buffet and found it to be one of the more enjoyable meals that we had in our week in Marrakesh. The hotel bar is also good although we didn't try the nightclub next door.    Marrakech is an interesting holiday destination and we had a very enjoyable break. In my view it's not a destination that would suit everybody. I don't think it would suit people with mobility problems or with young children as the small windy and uneven streets of the Medina would prove difficult.    Alcohol is not freely available in the old town so if you want to drink on a night out it's best to have specific venues in mind. Otherwise trying to find a good watering hole can prove difficult. Prices for alcohol tend to be on a par with those in London. Indeed if you decide to get involved in activities most days and have drinks every night it's not a cheap location. Passport control can be slow inbound and outbound so I would recommend getting to the airport two hours before your flight just in case there are delays.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COL333

Le Meridien N'Fis,JamieN_Global_Sole wrote a review May 2014,40,"Overall Rating - Average 1/2 to Very Good: Great Customer Service, Good Area in ""New"" Marrakech, Good Hotel Grounds...","The Le Meridien N'fis is located on Mohammed VI avenue in the ""new"" part of Marrakech. It is literally 10 minutes from the Airport maximum to the hotel property. The area that Le Meridien is located in is very clean safe located in the newer part of town. In the future there is a mall that is being built right across the way and will make this property's value go up even more for travelers. If you walk down Mohammed VI you will find plenty of restaurants and other shops to avail yourself within walking distance. In fact there is a great little Coffee House called ""C house"" that I would recommend travelers to go enjoy (delicious coffee pastries and food). The hotel is located about a 5 minute cab or 15 minute walk from the old part of town / main square ""Jemaa el-Fnaa.""    Disclaimer: there are areas of improvement that I will outline below post providing my positive impressions.    The property itself: the lobby and entrance is clean spacious very hospitable. The reception and greeting is very pleasant and the customer service is on par with the SPG / Le Meridien experience. As well the grounds with the pool area / tennis courts are extremely lovely. I spent a day and half just desert sun bathing and extremely enjoyed the pool area. The room itself is comfortable (improvements required). The garden area is very nice as well.    Customer Service: is incomparable by the reception the housekeeping staff and the concierges (Touffiq and Youssef) are extremely helpful. Both concierge's assisted me in booking a guide to take me through Jemaa el-Fnaa excursions with camel ride / desert dune riding and shuttle service to and from the hotel. As well I noticed that other clientele of the hotel were being equally provided great customer service. Each night the turn down service waters the welcome SPG gift is truly awesome as the water is appreciated as well as the fruit plate and chocolate at night (thank you SPG!).    Restaurant / Breakfast: the free breakfast I enjoyed as an SPG Platinum/Lifetime was certainly very good. They do need to ensure they have plenty of Mint Tea on hand - it runs out way too much (of course because it is delish!). The assortment and choices of food are plenty and can't go wrong with the breakfast here. The hotels main restaurant (the only one that was truly open in the evening if you didn't want to go out or wanted a late bite to eat) was Les Morocains (see suggestions below) but the Chicken Tangine is very good!    I highly recommend the Camel Exercusion and Desert Dune riding - great service! Affordable (extremely so) great experience by Desert Dune Excursions. Pick up tea the excursion itself and drop off - all safe efficient and way too much fun!!!    Suggested areas of improvement:  (1) While appreciated the guide service and it was essential for me (I typically do not avail myself of this option while traveling to destinations) and the guide was knowledgeable however what is a bit of a put off is that as they take you through the Souk the guide has tie ups with different vendors and while they say it is a ""free visit"" you are compelled to go to those vendors to purchase any goods. Of course this is typical of other Asian countries that you experience the tie-up vendor but you really should go explore on your own to shop. I would recommend that you go on your own to the square and explore even if you are a single female traveling on your own (as I was for this particular trip). During the day no one truly says anything and you can weave your way through the souk. As well while informative as a guide of the history most of it was an external walk through. You can take a cab from the hotel if you don't want to walk and they will drop you off right in the square and then grab a cab back to the hotel from that same area - about an 6-8 dirham ride (less than 1 USD). Otherwise this is completely walkable and Marrakech is split into 2 main avenues Mohammed V an VI. As well do ensure to go in the evening and try out the street vendors (the guide cautioned me away - what he did not know is I have been to India Singapore and other parts of Asia innumerable times and eaten on the streets with food vendors). Nice and appreciated that he cared but typically most travelers going out to Morocco will more than likely be more seasoned as a traveler (again not all but most at least in my case).  Plus point: the guide pointed out where the movie ""Sex and the City"" was shot - for me a definite fun fact since this is one of my fav. I did appreciate that he pointed some ""safer"" places to go grab a soft drink tea etc. and people watch so to speak.    (2) The rooms on the property are not what i would call ""typical of SPG properties - they are bit older a bit more run down and while cleaned daily and to the best of the housekeeping's abilities they are outdated for sure. I would recommend the property to invest some money into renovating the rooms and updating the decor to more of an authentic Moroccan ""look and feel"" I realize that they are going for more of a ""fusion"" feel but truly the culture and style of Morocco is what folks love world-wide so embrace it in the design as well!!!    (3) The staff in the pool area is initially ""snobbish"" - I had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a pool chair after repeatedly asking. Annoying to say the least. As well while the hotel food is good in the restaurant I really do recommend the wait staff in the restaurant Les Moroccains really step up their game - I saw that customers were waiting for exhaustive amounts of time and the wait staff was a bit out of it at times even yelling at each other. One other night I went to the outside patio area an again the staff acted as if I did not belong and I had to ask for the menu and seating 2 times - again not what your looking for especially when you've stayed at lovely SPG properties worldwide.    (4) Garden area should have intermingled seating so that guests can enjoy the property and beautiful views more.    If and when I return to Morocco I would recommend staying at a Riyadh or other properties due to the few above improvements but again this was a free SPG stay for me and the customer service by the reception concierge and housekeeping is a plus.",Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieN_Global_Sole
Le Meridien N'Fis,deMerclesden wrote a review May 2014,40,Comfortable with Good Attention to Detail,Le Meridien N'Fis is a low rise resort hotel set in well tended gardens with a large pool tennis courts and terrace dining. The rooms can be a little remote from reception but are nicely furnished and comfortable. Service is excellent with friendly and helpful staff. Located a 10-15 minute walk from the main square in Marrakech the hotel provides both easy access and a luxury retreat from the hurly-burly of the city. The inclusive breakfast was more continental French than authentic local but flat bread was prepared by hand and enough variety was available for a good start to the day. Charging for wifi in the rooms (it is free in the lobby) is never welcomed in hotels where the room rate is already sufficient to cover the marginal cost of this provision - but this is a common gripe that I have on this issue....,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deMerclesden

You could even hire a camel ride at the nearby corner which was strange to see with all the vechiles zooming by. Great view of the Atlas mountains as you walk through this area and within walking distance of the Medina and plaza. The wifi was spotty in the rooms but worked well in the lobby area which was nicely appointed and had lots of seatting comfty seating areas. You had to pay for the wifi in the room but free in lobby. They had a nice gift shop beautiful gardens and pool area with 3 resturants. Our room was quite large and sunny with sliding windows overlooking the gardens. My friend got sick and had to stay in one day and she said that housekeeping was so helpful and felt bad for her and brought her a flower from the garden as well as the much needed toilet paper without asking. The food from Room service was excellent - I had the pastillie - excellent while my friend had a basic america type sandwich and fries. In room safe hair dryer mini bar and amentiies.

Youssef the head concierge was an incredible help leading up to the trip helping arrange a great local guide and referred a terrific guide company. He was helpful throughout the trip and repeatedly spent time with us to insure everything was to our satisfaction. The presidential suite (420) is superb with a wonderful private balcony pool view comfortable master bedroom with spacious en suite bathroom.  Breakfast was the star meal - you have to try the handmade Moroccan pancakes beaten into shape followed by the omelette bar and the variety of fruit. You can inside or in the outside terrace overlooking the beautiful gardens. Our attendant Ghyslaine was superb remembering us from day to day bringing our favorites to us before we asked.  The hammam and spa were also a real treat - we had body scrubs and deep tissue massages with argon oil great ways to relax and cleanse the body.

The property is a good one but the block in which our room was allocated was so drab and ordinary that by no stretch of imagination can it be termed as a 5 star Hotel. There were no basic amenities in the room. They provided 1 soap in the washroom. We had to alternate the same between hand wash and the shower. They didn't even provide a note pad and a pencil or pen. The floors were brefet of any carpets as a result when the occupants above our room ran or jumped around in the night resulting in our sleep being disturbed. The buffet breakfast had a good variety.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Charlotte H wrote a review May 2014,40,A luxurious alternative to a riad,After travelling around Morocco I was ready for a bit of luxury and Le Meridien was ideal. Our suite was spacious and clean with a view of the pool. The grounds are immaculate and the pool is a great size and again spotlessly clean. Unfortunately some people do go to the pool very early (around 8am) to reserve the best sun loungers and then don't come out until the afternoon! Excellent food at the restaurant by the pool. Slightly underwhelmed by breakfast but I think they were very busy that day. The staff on reception were all wonderful and the concierge was an enormous help giving us spot-on recommendations. The only downside was service in the outside bar part which was hit and miss.  Just a 15 minute walk to the Jemaa el Fna so ideal in terms of location (if you don't want to stay in a more central riad-style place).,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlotteh221

Le Meridien N'Fis,qrctraveller wrote a review May 2014,40,Friendly staff,I must also confess that it doesn't live up to Le Meridien standards in other places such as Munich and Hong Kong but the friendliness of the staff makes up for the need for a refurbishment of the rooms. The bustling environment of the souk in Marrakech souk is great to visit but I'm very happy not to remain there. After a twenty minute walk I welcome an environment where the gardens are well-maintained and a clean hotel room. For SPG platinum members you will receive an upgrade to your room and I also agree that the breakfast has an excellent selection of freshly made pancakes and made to order omelettes. There are also beef sausages which were delicious grilled vegetables assortment of croissants and pastries freshly squeezed orange juice and teas.    However why this property is at Le Meridien (Moroccan) standards is the staff. In fact if you need to plan all of your tours you should email Youssef the concierge. He exceeded all expectations by contacting my tour person on his day off to ensure that my tour was taking place and everything exceeded expectations. This is the reason why you pay to stay here for such exceptional service.    From the airport to the hotel should not cost more than 100 Dirhams for a petit (small) taxi and 150 dirhams for a grand (big) taxi. Negotiate the price prior to getting into the cab. If there are any issues speak with the hotel staff.    Any fellow Canadians reading this review please note that the rate of exchange was much better a tthe hotel so I would strongly recommend that EVERYONE including non-Canucks ask the foreign exchange rate from their respective banks and then email the hotel to ask their rate. If it is better at Le Meridien exchange the currency upon your arrival in Marrakech.    One recommendation to the hotel management which I believe would greatly improve this hotel's rating on Trip Advisor is to have an Executive Lounge where you can have evening hor d'oeuvres and beverages. This hotel is definitely not as substandard as indicated by this rating.    If I returned to the Marrakech area I will not hesitate by staying here again. Also in the future there will be a new shopping mall located opposite to this establishment where there will be many stores and restaurants.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Ottawa, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qrctraveller

Le Meridien N'Fis,X1432GLmikeg wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Lush gardens w/resort-style feel - a decent walk to the Medina,"Le Mer review.    Brief summary: full-service hotel with a luscious interior garden inviting pool area and large lobby. Inconsistent levels of service ( nothing terrible) and a bit of a walk to the Medina / nightlife of town.    Room: upgraded to Exec room with pool view and complimentary fruit basket. Late check out for gold member was no issue at all. Spacious but otherwise standard with respect to furnishings and amenities. No coffee but a card offering complimentary Illy Coffee in the ""tea lounge"" proved fruitless endeavor and was told twice to use the breakfast buffet for coffee ( tea room opens at 9am I was told).    One of a handful of hotels where I've spent time enjoying the interior gardens. Wonderfully decorated and well-kept grounds. Pool area also kept tidy with adjacent restaurant. Tip: drop your towel and personal belongings early at the sun chairs they go quick!    Fitness center was somewhat small but perfectly acceptable for a brief keep-toned type workout.    The Medina is about a 10-15 minute walk. The 19 airport drops half a block from the hotel. Cost is 30MAD and driver can usually give  Change. No problem bringing suitcases on board. If you miss the stop ( it's early) you will do a loop and end up on Mohammed VI in front of the hotel about 20 minutes later. In my opinion a fun - quick glimpse of the city by bus.    I left Le Mer after two days in search of something with a more local vibe. I checked into one of the MANY Riad's in the Medina ( and for a fraction of the price and with breakfast) providing easy access to shopping the nightlife tour pickups and public transit.    Le Mer is a good hotel but it's a different scene all together from being inside the walls of the Medina.",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Johannesburg, South Africa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X1432GLmikeg

Although it does have beautiful gardens and pool and the location is quite good for the Medina the interiors and some elements of the service let it down. The reception staff are helpful and friendly. The chambermaids do a thorough job of keeping the room clean. However the breakfast buffet service is chaotic and poorly stocked throughout with plates and replacements foods. Also by the end of the breakfast service the dining room is dirty and messy. More staff are required to keep on top of the service. Similarly the pool bar drinks service can be quite slow. Lunch is expensive. We were originally put into a room that was near the road and was quite busy and loud throughout the night. However the reception kindly moved us to a garden facing room with its own terrace and I am grateful for that.

My daughter has stayed there since then. I like this hotel I like the concept of a small ""resort type"" hotel and the gardens are very nice. Even in the winter. The pool is decent as well.    The rooms are resort style with tiled floors with a couple of rugs. The rooms have a minibar but much of the stuff listed in it was not there. There is not kettle in the room which is a pain but breakfast is available fairly late for those that have the time. The lady that checked me in and out was very nice and the barstaff were very friendly but some other staff seemed somewhat cold. Maybe that is just the Moroccan way. The hotel was also very busy and the front desk was sparsely manned much of the time.    What had changed from last stay at least in my room was maintenance. The bath plumbing had problems (I couldn't open the plug). Housekeeping opened it but I didn't are close it again (and nor did they). The hairdryer definitely needed to be looked at as it smelt and seemed to have an electrical problem. The power points in my room seemed ok but two out of three in my friends room did not work. My safe also was dead. So I used my friend's. The aircon in my room blew but did not do cold. It may have been turned offbut as the temperature was up to about 27C by the time I left it would have been nice. The windows did open though.    It has four places to eat (I think) but only the pool bar is open at lunchtime (the bar is open but doesn't do food at lunchtime). We needed lunch but there was a corporate function on at the pool. The barman told us to try the places next to the hotel which we did. Go out and turn right there are three places about 400m away. If you want alcohol you have to sit inside.    The hotel is not bad value and if you use starpoints is very good value. It is about a 30 min walk from the tourist stuff or a short taxi ride. You don't visit Morroco for the food but the food in the hotel is okay the ""Club Sandwich"" which certainly wasn't a Club Sandwich in the traditional sence was well worth a try. Another thing I had never seen anywhere else was ""Halal Ham"" on the breakfast buffet menu.......it tasted like ham and looked like ham......but surely......    Anyway if the management get their act together on maintenance it could get up to four stars. If not it will get even more tired and die.

A big thanks as well to Mr Mathieu de Tonnac and his friendly staff for being so attentive and welcoming and making sure any need was solved.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Hannah M wrote a review Mar 2014,30,"Nice hotel, lacks attention to detail and a quiet night's sleep",Stayed with my partner in March 2014. Well received welcome and Moroccan tea upon arrival.    Gardens are beautiful with a range of different trees surrounding the pathways. It was a shame that the fountains especially the long centrepiece leading to the restaurant were half working and resembled a trickle of a tap as opposed to that pictured on their website. A small heated pool wouldn't go a miss in the colder months either as it was too cold to swim during our stay.    Aside from that breakfast is full and well presented with a range of meat cheese bread omelettes (with a good range of requested fillings) and pancakes made fresh.    We also ate at the Moroccan Restaurant twice and I would recommend trying the chicken tajine. The live music every night adds to a great atmosphere and is ideal for getting used to a little taste of Morocco before venturing out into the city.    The location of this hotel is ideal for escaping the busy swell of the square however the music was very loud and rang into the night making it very difficult to sleep. If you like to explore the city properly like us I would advise that you prepare for a lot of walking a taxi back is not a bad idea but agree a price before you get in and have a map before you go (we bought one from the airport in London).    **** One of our taxi drivers tried to drop us off somewhere completely different when we asked for The Souks. TOP TIP: do not get out you agreed a price and location stick to your guns and be confident. This I am sure is not common - but be aware. ****    Nice hotel but no more than average which is a shame as it has great potential.

I have not written a review before since always had mixed feelings about the hotel. However I recently read some negative reviews and following a superb stay last week thought it time I logged a post.    I imagine I am one of the most frequent visitors to the hotel. I always receive a very warm welcome from the superb team of Doormen particularly Said and Mohamed. They are a brilliant introduction to the hotel always keen to help and give advice. Their enthusiasm is matched by the superb restaurant staff and housekeeping.    The hotel has been poor at rewarding loyalty other than free wi-fi. The first time I stayed at the end of 2010 I got a bottle of wine in my room. I remember it well since there was no corkscrew and the restaurants didn't want to lend me one. It kind of took the point of the gift away! Since then I have had no recognition of any kind at all until this stay whenI had a small note in my room welcoming me back. A really small touch but it is just nice to be recognised. The front desk was also much more welcoming than usual. I suspect there may have been a change of management since my last visit in August and an emphasis is being made on welcoming repeat guests.    It is true that compared to Le Meridien rooms globally the rooms in this hotel are basic. The mini bars (for instance) are not really cold and rooms do bang and make a lot of noise at peak times. However this is South Morocco and it is unfair to judge Marrakech hotels by a global standard. I know the luxury hotel in the city well and they would not fare well either when judged against international comparison.    The Restaurant menus have had a refresh and the Moroccan restaurant moved demonstrating a fresh approach. Breakfast is basic (and there is a silly new fridge for salad and fruit which means that it is hard for more than one person to help themselves at the same time).    On the positives service is excellent and the gardens are superb. The location is perfect. A quiet balance between the noise of the Medina and the soulless hotels in the new town (Gueliz). Both are in walking distance. The gardens are superb as is the large pool. In an ideal world the pool would be heated. However heated pools are very rare in Morocco - particularly at this price point. Marrakech is one of the few destinations where much of the year is characterised by hot days and bitterly cold tights meaning pools are cold outside summer.    Since I know Marrakech well I have rarely had to use the concierge. However on this occasion I needed some help and Yousef was fantastic. He was eager to please and genuinely concerned that his advice was useful.    In summary I believe this to be one of the best locations of a Marrakech hotel brilliant staff and superb gardens. For those wishing to spend more there are better hotels in Marrakech - but I choose not to stay in them. This strikes the right balance between good value for money a range of facilities and a superb welcome.    Le Meridien N'Fis is an asset to Starwood and I look forward to my visit next month!,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexFulham_London
Le Meridien N'Fis,FroggyPete wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Great family break,Had a family break with wife and two teenage boys for 4 nights here. Adult son joined us for 2 days as well. All paid for by SPG points. I spend my life travelling and am an SPG Platinum member but I have never been so well treated as I was here. Used suite nights to upgrade to a newly-refurbished suite which was excellent clean and comfortable. As the 3 rooms were booked from a Platinum account breakfast was complimentary for all. Breakfast was good and I really don't understand some of the comments on this site about lack of variety. It included eggs any way you wantedt them beef sausages local specialities pancakes (including the local ones made fresh) omelletes to order cheeses fresh fruit sliced meats breads cereals fruit-juices etc. After our first morning there the waitress Ghizlaine knew exactly what we wanted to drink and it suddenly appeared. Staff at the front desk remembered our names and were very courteous and friendly. Outdoor pool is big but a bit cold in March but not too cold to stop us Brits. The poolman just suddenly apeared with towels and arranged furniture etc.  The staff are led by Matheu the General Manager who was on hand when we arrived and spent quite a while chatting to us and our lads in both English and French. Very close to both the airport(10 minutes) and the Medina and Souks. We ate in the Morrocoan restaurant in the hotel a couple of nights and it was very good. I've seen some comments here about prices but I have paid a lot more for a lot less in other parts of the world. Thanks to the Executive Chef Ahmed.  Highlight was a day-trip up and over the Atlas mountains in a 4WD with Ali a Touareg camelman originally breathtaking scenery and some of the most capable and safe driving I have ever come across. All in all an excellent break we have already decided to go back again soon.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boulogne-sur-Mer, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FroggyPete
Le Meridien N'Fis,shellbellmay wrote a review Mar 2014,30,"Decent hotel, beautiful grounds, great staff!",Don't come here expecting Le Meridien you get elsewhere in the world. This is a nice hotel located not far from the action but it is very dated. The staff is very helpful and kind most speak perfect English. The staff was by far my favorite part of this hotel including the General Manager Mathieu who didn't hesitate to help with anything including recommending our favorite meal of the entire trip! (Maison MK)    The room was dated but very clean and large. Our room air conditioner/heater did not work at all so we opened the huge sliding glass doors for fresh air only to be disappointed with cigarette smoke billowing in from below. My other complaints are; the charge for wifi when every other hotel or restaurant offers it freely and the ever present smoke smell. Also the bathtubs are old and very slippery use caution when getting in and out. The spa was a disaster with ZERO effort made to encourage a peaceful quiet visit. I went in for a 60 min massage and I did not enjoy it at all. Although my therapist was good it was not relaxing at all. The noise from the other staff in the hallway was louder than the music in my room. It was distracting and made for a unenjoyable visit.    Breakfast is great so many choices I recommend you pay for it with your room as it is less money that way. The pool and surrounding grounds are beautiful.

We received a complimentary upgrade to an executive room. We were also given a complimentary late check out. Very friendly staff.    We knew the rooms here would be slightly dated going by the pictures on their website however our room was ok actually and very clean. Also nice toiletries in the bathroom and plenty of natural light. Wifi isn't free at this hotel however we had a room rate that included it.    The hotel grounds are stunning in particular the pool area. The internal communal areas are well kept. There are lots of dining options. We weren't too hungry so decided to have snacks in the bar - a tad expensive but pretty good.    Overall an excellent hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Dvorjanka1 wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Great resort,Very nice and friendly hotel. Service is highly professional specially in restaurants and at front desk. Even when some Western guests are taking to much freedom in behaviour and ignore dress code hotel staff is not upset and show absolutely no disagreement.  The outdoor pool is very big we were in June and there was no crowd at all. Amenities around the pool are clean and there were always enough chairs towels and sun umbrellas.  Food in all bars and restaurant is delicious not expensive the choice of different culinary is incredible the dishes are fantastic.  What is indeed disturbing is that smoking is allowed in tent for breakfast. We were at the same time with group where everyone was smoking and I had to leave my table as I could not stand it. BTW I worked for big tobacco corporation in the past and I have no per se negative attitude but this was to much.  Highly recommend for vacation also with kids. They love children and staff is very friendly with kids.  Location is slightly remoted from the centre or Kasbah it is almost must to take the taxi.

Le Meridien N'Fis,rko21 wrote a review Feb 2014,20,Massive deterioration,As you can see and read I previously stayed at this hotel in 2010 and I complimented it accordingly.    Four years on in February 2014 I stayed at this hotel again for one night as I had to prolong my stay in Marrakech and my preferred choice of hotel was full too full to extend my stay so I relocated to le Meridien N'Fis.    I had quite good memories of this hotel from 2010. Breakfast used to be vast with attentive service the reception staff used to be kind and curious the internet used to be complimentary... Fast forward four years to the present day February 2014 and this has all changed.    Staying with my fiancée we were treated coldly by the doorman wearing a tarbouch hat. No drinks or snacks were offered at check-in unlike what I experienced in 2010.    The rooms have become dated in desperate need of a major refurbishment. Unlike in 2010 the internet is now chargeable and extortionate. This is poor and unacceptable as 3G and phone signal is also poor throughout the resort.    However housekeeping is a positive. Lovely roses and a small fruit selection was left along with small bottles of water during turndown service. A nice touch.    The only minor improvement that I noticed and can praise is the introduction of 3 new public computers with internet access located just past the reception and next to the gym and spa.    The pool is not heated in winter making it impossible to swim in freezing water.    I was incredibly disappointed at the breakfast. The choice of food is limited and dishes are cold. I tried to pour self-service mint tea from the traditional berrad (Moroccan mint tea pot) and it was cold despite being on a heater. Nobody tended to us at breakfast and this is unacceptable.    The staff looked unhappy. They looked bored and uninterested. Why is the management not engaging them?    The lady and check-out didn't even say one word to us.    Future guests please make up your own mind.    Mr Benjelloun General Manager I understand your frustrations if Head Office and senior management are hesitant to refurbish the hotel. However the rudeness and coldness of your staff is unacceptable.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rko21

Everyone from the cheerful doorman to the bartender looked us in the eye and treated us well. The location is great for walking to many activities when you stay here take time to walk the grounds-beautiful! Unbeknownst to us the time we spent there encompassed the 25th International Marathon and that weekend the hotel was full of runners and families but the service didn't skip a beat. The manager was out and about interacting with his guests including kids and his interaction with employees seemed positive too. I was very impressed how the staff treated the children that kept frequenting the lobby.  As others said the breakfast had many choices -you must try their wonderful eye opening mango chili lime juice.

Le Meridien N'Fis,DPJ2016 wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Not impressed.,"We stayed here for one night in Jan 2013 after spending the previous 3 nights with friends in a riad in the souk (the hotel is 10mins from the airport and we had an early flight the following morning). How to sum up our experience? Not impressed. We had booked a standard room using SPG points and were ""upgraded"" based on our SPG Gold status at check-in though the room was probably the same as a standard room. The bed was very comfortable but this was offset by terrible noise-proofing in the room. We could hear everything from the hallway (footsteps rooms opening/closing the elevator...) and barely slept.    In terms of the grounds the pool area looked nice but the rest of the property was pretty ""tired"" and in need of renovation. We were also disappointed to find out the on-site hammam has space for only one person at a time (crazy for such a large hotel to only be able to accomodate one person at a time!!!) so while we had been hoping for a nice steam/sauna after using the basic on-site gym we ended up being out of luck as the hammam was booked for the entire day. We didn't eat in the restaurant but did go to the Shisha bar for a cocktail and found the service to be very good and attentive.    For future trips to Marrakech we'll stick with staying in a nice souk instead.

Le Meridien N'Fis,JackR46 wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Poor timing for us,"Upon arrival initial impression was very poor. Although not really the fault of the hotel. It was raining outside and when we pulled in there were two buses parked out front. When entering the lobby it was packed with people and no place to sit or even stand. The front desk was extremely busy processing all the reservations of the group(s). When we finally got to our room the room itself was nice. But as we sat on the bed with the door closedwe could hear every detail of conversation of people walking through the hallway and due to the tile floors every footstep reverberated down the hallway and into our room. I thought - oh no earplugs all night - and we're staying here for three nights! I checked out the fitness center and two of the machines that I usually use were out of order - recumbent bike and stair stepper - with no other equivalent options - so there were two out of seven machines out of use. We ate a lunch late in the afternoon so we skipped dinner. Later in the evening we just wanted a bite to eat. Even though the restaurant was supposed to be open until 11:00 PM it had closed by 10:40 PM. So we went to the bar where we could order some limited food items but it was too smokey for us. We went back to the room and called room service at 10:45. It supposedly allowed a full selection from the room-service menu until 11:00. Pizza sounded good to me but when I tried to order it I was told ""No Pizza"" - just the limited menu after 11:00. The staff member confirmed that it was only 10:45 - but still no pizza. After all that had happened I was ready to leave and check in elsewhere. However after this first day there was minimal noise in the hallway and adjacent rooms. There was a cocktail reception for SPG members that was nice to attend. Other than the room service issue the staff members were friendly and courteous. On the last day the sun finally came out and the hotel truly does have some fantastic gardens and landscaping that we could finally appreciate. I could see where a stay here could be a pleasant one - just not the right timing for us.",Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fullerton, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackR46

This hotel offers everything what I wanted: friendly very helpful staff; comfy room; delicious food and beautiful garden. What really surprised me was the quality of service. Really high.    A very pleasant surprise - General manager was almost everywhere: in the morning during breakfast afternoon welcoming the guests in the evening at the bar. This hotel is really well managed.    Some useful information:  1. the hotel is located only 3 km from the airport you do not need to take a taxi from the airport just taka bus 19 (the bus stop is on the left outside the main building) it costs only 30 dinars ($4) and stops right at the hotel.  2. historical center (Medina) is just two kilometers away from the hotel it is worth to walk because it passes through the lovely garden. Of course you can also go by taxi it costs around 30 dinars but you must set the price before driving.  3. Eat your breakfast at the hotel. Delicious omelettes and a large selection of local cuisine.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Paul R wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Winter exotic sun.,My wife and I stayed at this hotel as part of a weeks break in Marrakech. We found the hotel to be everything that we wanted. I had been in touch with the hotel a number of times prior to our arrival to ask for and arrange for a kettle to be put in our room so we could make our own tea & coffee in the morning and evening and as requested it was there. We also asked them to arrange for us to be collected at the airport and that we needed a car big enough to take our luggage and a wheelchair and this was also done with a price being agreed and added to our bill.    On our arrival nothing was to much trouble our luggage was taken to our room while we checked in. Our room was a good size with sliding patio doors opening up a view of the gardens and Atlas mountains in the distance. We spent the afternoon and others around the pool which was very good however the water was not heated up so I could not enjoy a swim as I would have liked to. As soon as we arrived the pool guard arrived with towels for us. We also ate at the pool restaurant a couple of times and found the choice to be good and good value and although a little slow at times it was not a problem.    We ate in the Moroccan restaurant on a couple of occasions and found the quality and quantity to be very good and enjoyable with the staff being very attentive to our needs. Breakfast was a help yourself and the selection although the same everyday was very good. On 2 occasions I had an omelette made for me while I waited and on both occasions it was just perfect. Also the square pancakes again made while you waited were just delicious with honey and lemon juice.    The overall experience at the hotel was very good and we would come back again. However on a couple of negative points:  We were very disappointed with the lack of free Wifi in the hotel. If you wanted it in your room you had to pay for it but we did find out after making enquires that it was free in the lobby area and would just reach the pool area. for a hotel of this supposed quality we would expect it to be free and available throughout the hotel. Also I would be a bit reluctant in staying at this hotel at this time of year again if the pool is not heated. A hotel we stayed in later in the week in Marrakech had a heated outside pool and I was able to swim everyday!

Le Meridien N'Fis,Terps37 wrote a review Jan 2014,20,A low end motel quality rooms and services disguised amidst exquisite gardens – beware!,As a platinum SPG member I am incredibly curious how this property is even eligible for the Le Meridien or SPG brand – it’s a Four Points at best. With exception for the well-manicured gardens pretty much everything else was several notches below even the lowest of SPG standards I’ve personally stayed. To carry the SPG banner at this property is a bad business decision and is really diluting the brand and the image it possesses particularly to most customers in this area who may be unfamiliar with the SPG standards I am accustomed to.  - Rooms: The attached photos say it all. Furniture (TV Stand Desk) were all fraying. Tiles and the grout look terribly worn down and dirty. Bed sheets were coarse and towels were of low quality – you know when you try to dry yourself and the towel seems to repel the water? Wifi was incredibly spotty and unreliable. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to realize that the hotel is charging exorbitant fares for rooms that have lived past their useful life and is in dire need of capital improvements.  - Spa: Per my wife this was a one of a kind experience. 600 MAD for 45 mins which is even high for US standards – local comparisons ran at 1/5 of the price. Nevertheless it was a Christmas gift and turns out was a strange experience. The masseuse hardly applied any pressure and nearly pulsed versus a typical massage. The strangest procedure was that after my wife rolled over on her back the masseuse pulled her towel down (exposing her chest) and proceeded to massage her stomach (!?!?!?)  - Restaurants: We tried the one by the pool which made a decent pizza. The Moroccan restaurant was very mediocre but charged an exorbitant prices (~25 USD) for tagine or 5x comparable sit down restaurants. The biggest ripoff was the 450 MAD pp New Years buffet which offered a few mains that were overcooked. The strangest thing was the buffet at $60 USD pp did not include drink and was comp’d after I complained about paying for bottled water at a buffet. We also had tea in the lounge one afternoon and as to the nickel and diming of the hotel I asked for two additional tea cups for our 5 and 2 year old to try and share the same pot of tea and was charged 35 MAD pp which I of course found out after I received the bill.  - Concierge: Youssef was the only bright spot in this hotel and is the heart and soul of the property after being there for 25 years. He is proactive observant and a good listener. Our issue at the restaurant was quickly resolved with Youssef’s intervention.

I thought the grounds were really very nice especially the gardens next to the pool.    The rooms themselves are quite dated and in need of a re-do. Literally door knobs were falling off and furniture was stained. The hammam was included in my stay as a SPG member which was a nice perk but it was rather impractical since only one guest could be there at a time.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,United States,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global_Voyager1000
Le Meridien N'Fis,shikhaDelhi wrote a review Dec 2013,40,Lovely hotel,This hotel was a perfect start to our recent Moroccan holiday. the Lovely big rooms and they upgraded us to a suite on both occasions !!! Great location. Less than 10 minute ride from the airport a 15 minute walk to the medina which we preferred to taking a cab as sunshine was the main reason to get away from London. Large grounds beautiful pool and garden. Nice service. Thanks to the previous review we breakfasted at the cafe next block every morning ! Internet access unfortunately in the rooms was very poor and we often came to the lobby for better connectivity. Hassan at the bell desk was sooper great to come down to his wide genuine smile every morning ! Very helpful staff !

Le Meridien N'Fis,AugustWolf wrote a review Dec 2013,40,Will keep returning,Third time at this property over the last two years and it keeps improving albeit in small steps rather than leaps and bounds. A new GM's took over about 6 months ago and he seems quite proactive in getting customer feedback so I'd expect it to get even better (I'll be back twice more over the coming year)    Rooms are fine nothing overly spectacular but nicely appointed with Moroccan touches. Breakfast buffet is pretty good dinner wasn't that great as has been noted in other reviews. Drinks at the bar are reasonably priced and you get 20% off if you're an SPG member which makes it even more worthwhile. Had a remarkable mixed grill at the poolside restaurant which is the only outlet open during the day.    Staff are very friendly and helpful particularly Hassan the bellhop Yusef the concierge and all the ladies at reception whose names sadly escape me now.    Location's not too much of a walk from either the medina or Gueliz (maybe 15 minutes) but I quite like walking - otherwise taxis are very cheap.    The one grating issue was that internet speed and reliability was rather poor. I'd just spent a few days in a rather downmarket hotel in Tafraoute which had blazing fast internet (remote access of my office PC was about as quick as if I were at my flat in London) so I would have expected an LM in Marrakech to be as good. Instead it was rather laggy and regularly cut out (once every couple hours) - still usable overall but quite annoying as it nearly doubled the amount of time it took me to get work done. The GM did mention that the system was being upgraded in early 2014 so I hope this is more usable when I return.    That aside this is a great base in Marrakech and the perfect place to relax after adventures in the desert or the coast.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AugustWolf
Le Meridien N'Fis,Stephen M wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Treated like royalty,I stayed at this beautiful property in late November and returned to it on December 8th.    First let me say that the service is top notch. The staff greet you remember your name ask you how you are how the room is how your stay is and most of all how can they improve your stay!    From Farid our bartender who spoiled us silly to Youssef in the lobby who tended to every need  to an excellent housekeeping staff who cannot do enough for you informs you of how wonderful Moroccans are as a people.    The exceptional management team led by Mathieu (the General Manager) and Esdi the Assistant General Manager cater to every guest's need and desire.    I have never been asked by a hotel General Manager for my impressions of not only the property but also every experience encountered in Morocco which I assure you were 99.9% positive. It's too bad that Mathieu and his team don't operate Royal Air Maroc but that is a different story.    The food is fresh delicious and excellent the rooms are beautiful and well kept the grounds are spectacular and immaculate and the staff are exceptional. You will make the best decision by staying at this hotel.    Finally I wish to thank Mathieu and his team for making our stay the most memorable part of our trip. On our return for our second stay at the hotel (the last 4 days of our trip to Morocco) fresh roses filled the room and a handmade fresh pastry tray were waiting for us.    I cannot wait to return but in the meantime have told all of my friends about this wonderful experience.

It was our first visit to this city and we were keen to have a relaxing time as well as do some sightseeing . The hotel was wonderfully close to the airport and set outside the city . This didn't bother us as Taxis were pleantifull and cheap. we were made to feel welcome by the check in staff . Special mention must go to Youseff the concierge who organised a great day trip to the Atlas mountains (well worth doing if you have time ) and Said on the door who helped us tirelessly with taxis and helped us avoid the pitfalls of this rather chaotic city . He was almost like a personal guide for us . Thanks Said! The hotel is set in fantastic well kept gardens with a wonderful large pool . The one major problem with this hotel however are the rooms . They definitely require upgrading and are not what one would expect in a 4 star hotel .

Le Meridien N'Fis,PAlmeida55 wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Good setting in a relaxing environment,Stayed for 2 nights on a business trip and appreciated this hotel in general. The gardens are nice and relaxing the pverall setting is well thought. there is a permanent sensation of space and the room was well decorated and comfortable. the breakfast was good even if for this category of hotel more choice of breads and e.g. jams (other than the classic unidoses) would be expected. I appreciated the well equipped fitness room opening at 6 a.m. and available earlier on request at the reception. A negative point was a non functioning lamp in the room (not acceptable in a 5-star hotel) which could only be repaired the following day. Also some areas that may need being used at darke (e.g. between buildings) are not well illuminated at all times.

The grounds are extensive and beautiful the lobby large and well appointed. The rooms are good but not outstanding and overall the hotel lacked the authenticity we would have liked. Everything from the restaurant to the rooms were designed for Europeans/Americans with a limited desire for cultural immersion. The staff was uniformly friendly except for the business center. The hookah room and outdoor area were an enjoyable change from the usual smoking bar. It was our honeymoon and the manager gave us a nice room on the ground floor with a patio onto a large park area.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Casperaldo wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Great Stay - Highly Recommended,I visited Marrakech for a 2-week conference last June and took my family along. We chose this hotel because it is quite a mini-resort a place were a family would chill out most of the day yet in the heart of the Hivernage area close to the Palais des Congres (the conference centre).    The staff was exceptionally nice and the management team professional and attentive. Ms. Sana Boukali in particular went out of her way to assist us in reservation changes for us and other colleagues who decided to leave their hotel and move in to this one (actually after the visited us in the evening and saw how beautiful the venue was and how helpful the staff).    The swimming pool was great. I tried the tennis court twice and it was not bad. My wife loved the spa which I didn't get the chance to hit. But we both agreed that the breakfast was superb.    The lobby is spacious and a nice place to chill out in the afternoon and have an authentic moroccon tea. Back then they had a nice shisha tent in addition to a piano bar both of which showed the Confederation Cup football games that were being played at the time and it was quite a plus for the football fan I am.    They organize a weekly reception for SPG members with free drinks and canapes.    I find nothing not to praise in this hotel except maybe the wifi connection which was on and off during the stay however they were on it as they said.    I had gotten to visit many colleagues participating in the same conference at several nearby Hivernage hotels they were staying in and was happy to realize that I had actually chosen the best among those within the similar rate-range.    If I return to Marrakech (and having had the nice Riad experience once which is in turn nice and different) I will stay nowhere else.    Highly recommend it.    Sana.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jasobar007 wrote a review Nov 2013,40,"Ideally Located, Exceptional Staff",Dear all    I have just completed a six day stay at le Meridien N'Fis in Marrakech. It was my fourth stay in three years. I visit as a business tourist but also revel in the energy and vibrancy of such a wonderful city.    You may wonder why someone who works in the luxury hospitality sector choses to stay in a four star superior brand rather than competitive products such as Sofitel or El Saadi or Mogador which are a little more polished than Le Meridien. You may also ask the same question when you read some of the recent reviews criticising the room standards.    The reason why I do is quite simple: The staff and the service.    The Le Meridien team is exceptional. Their devotion to providing solutions assisting guests from all over the world whether on business or pleasure and their constant ability to follow through on requests is more important to me than the occasional bit of flaky paint.    The issues of the hotel looking 'a little dated and tired' are in some cases correct but these minor faults lie at the foot of the Group Head Office and not with the team at the hotel. Reviews that comment on those faults without mentioning the service and delivery given by the Meridien team are not telling the full story. There are far more important things to consider when you come to Marrakech.    Here are some examples of the problem solving that may resonate with readers who travel a lot. Please note the the solutions:    *Wake up calls - always on time - never missed. This is a bug-bear of mine.  *Room Cleaning - Exceptional. I was almost embarrassed how tidy my room was when I returned each night because I knew that I had left it so messed up. Everything was folded put away or hung up. All my money I left out was neatly placed on my side board with fresh towels and fresh bed linen everyday. The chambermaid was so very helpful and did an amazing job.  *Beds - Best nights sleep in months!  *Bathrooms - I missed having a shower cubicle but having a bath/shower was fine. Hot water always on demand. Amenities were excellent and so was lighting.  *Internet was weak in my room - Front office met with me and the IT manager and helped me move to a room where the internet was fast so I could work.  *Taxis - arranged on request efficiently and effectively and advised on those all important fares....  *Airport transfers - bang on!  * Warm Greetings - by the front office management and porters and doormen.  *Recommendations - Always gave good advice on restaurants where to go and what to see.    This dedication to customer care is what I look for in a hotel and this is what Le Meridien N'fis delivers at a reasonable rate and in a prime location. I therefore can forgive the rest.    I am an SPG member something I recommend to anyone travelling to the Starwood family of hotels. Not only do I benefit from my Star points from staying here - points which I can use anywhere in the world to reduce my costs on hotels and flights - I benefit from the kind and generous attention given to me on my return. Youssef - Head Concierge - and his front office team are the embodiment of hospitality and for that I thank them.    Anyone therefore considering coming to Marrakech for a weekend break or perhaps on business - SPG memeber or not - rest assured that the N'fis team will be there to do all they can to help. That's my experience on the hotel and I have no reason to doubt that they offer that service to all comers.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jasobar007

Le Meridien N'Fis,Nicholas T wrote a review Nov 2013,20,"The Good, the bad and the ugly.",This is NOT a 5-star hotel any more and I can't see how it can continue marketing itself as one in its current state. We've stayed and many Starwood owned hotels in the past and never been disappointed so how could they let standards slip so badly in this one. Having said that though this was advertised by Starwood as a Category: 2 5-star hotel but nowhere on their website do they mention what one can expect from a Cat 2 establishment. If we had had access to this information it might have set our expectations at a different level or we may not have chosen to stay at the hotel.    Anyway the good first. The location of the hotel was excellent being in the up market area of the new town of Marrakesh yet within walking distance of the medina souks and various attractions that tourists like to frequent. The gardens are also fabulous and in our view much better than the gardens at the famous La Mamounia hotel. We found the DSM to be charming and he took time to listen to some of our complaints.    The bad. It was the hotel buildings and amenities themselves. They were worn out and in desperate need of renovation. The buildings and furnishings were utilitarian lacking warmth and any feeling of luxury whatsoever. The bars restaurants and inside common areas were uninviting and had a 1970's look about them. The pool was so cold and the grills around the edge of it broken in some places with pieces of plastic sticking up that in my view could easily injure a child or adult if they should slip or fall there.    The ugly. It was food on offer apart from one evening meal we had in the Moroccan restaurant there which was average. The breakfast buffet and evening international buffet were the worst I've ever experience with the selection and quality of food being served extremely poor. The staff in the restaurants didn't appear to be trained well with three staff one day serving us in one instance each of whom didn't seem to know what we'd said to the others. In the bar we had to return food twice as what was served up did not fit the description in the menu. Room service was a little better but even there one night the waiter had to come back with items he'd forgotten from our order. OK the cocktails in the bar despite a limited selection were good.    There is a message in the above for both Starwood and the manager of this hotel. The competing hotels in the same area knock spots off this hotel and the competition is only going to get stronger as the new hotels under construction close by open for business soon. With the right investment in refurbishing the hotel and amenities plus a vastly improved F&B offering you still have the chance of winning through as your location and gardens can't be beaten.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickJThompson

It was still hot at this time of year with daytime temperatures of 36 degrees + and I was not convinced the clanking noisy A/C was actually working properly. Hence did not really sleep too well the whole time.  The restaurant had more of canteen feel about it and food distinctly average but I liked the outside bar particularly the olive salad nibbles.

Although we upgraded our rooms it was not worth it. basic rooms (no coffee maker) good hot breakfast but the menu doesn't change. There are two restaurants in the hotel but they are expensive and the quality of the food was below average. The night club was empty all the time; no new year event.. plan your new year's eve early because places get booked early.  The pool is nice and the lunch bar by the pool is good too.

Le Meridien N'Fis,chantelles wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Mixed feelings,I stayed in Le Meridien in vienna and it was simply fabulous. This one not so much.    I stayed three nights. There is a nice and big garden that feels like oasis. But the rooms are old. Clean but old. My room key didn't work upon arrival. Some staff had to literally make a hole on the door and use a long wire to catch the handle from inside to get it to open. Actually look carefully you can see sign of the hole on many doors. On the plus side there are complementary fruits water and roses in the room. Nice touch.    And 5 minutes after I settled in the phone rang. And it was a wake up call ?!    Wifi never worked. The staff just say it's on and off like it's normal and nothing wrong. Although the big touch screen computers in the lobby were very good and available always.    I left my adapter in the room and it was missing when I checked back in one day later. Front desk loaned me one for the night but never replaced the one I lost.    TV signal is very bad. Not sure if that's a Moroccan thing.    There is no clock in the room. I almost missed my trip as my iPhone was one hour late.    One final warning: if you like to wear slippers in your room there is a small step between bathroom and living room. There is no sign for it. I stumbled twice second time hurt my toe so badly that I limped for the next few days.    I think I will try a different hotel next time around.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,Canada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantelles
Le Meridien N'Fis,FiveStar Review wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Needs to improve,Attention Starwood clients- this meridian will not measure up to your expectations if your are a Starwood member. It's does have a lot of potential but needs work.  The lobby is very attractive and the facilities are good. The rooms need to be renovated. The beds need to be replaced they are old and lopsided. The sheets are not always changed even though the bed is made. Please check yours from top to bottom before you check in for the first time. It seems that sheets are recycled between customers so be aware. The mornings are noisy with doors shutting hard in and out from cleaning service there are no door stoppers so they just flip the door lock when cleaning so that the door does not shut all the way but it slams.  All around service is lacking and it's feels more like a 3.5 star but it has potential to improve and the location is great.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Florida City, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FiveStarR_12

Le Meridien N'Fis,VMDVMD wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Wish I Didn't Have to Leave,I enjoyed this hotel so much that I might consider visiting Marrakesh just to stay at this hotel again. It’s only a Starwood Category 2 hotel but I felt like I was staying at a Category 5 hotel.    Where do I begin? There’s a spa-like pool complete with 2 bridges and a mini island. There’s a fragrant garden of roses and orange trees which is really quite romantic in the evening since the walkways are lined with lanterns. There’s a buffet breakfast complete with passion fruit juice omelets and a woman making traditional Moroccan pancakes. There’s a hookah bar and in a country where a liquor license cost 20000 dirhams you’ll appreciate that there’s also a liquid bar. And on your bed you’ll find a pass for 2 free coffees in the tea room and 2 passes for free entry to the city’s Majorelle Gardens.    If you have Starwood Platinum status you’ll be treated better than you’ve been treated at any other Starwood property. Both times we stayed there we were delighted when the housekeeping staff left chocolates on our beds brought a vase of roses and brought some fruit for the evening. They vary the perks too. The first time we received free passes to the spa’s hamman (sauna/bathhouse) and the second time we were invited to enjoy free drinks in the bar.    If you’ve got money to spare this could be a great place to splurge on the huge suite (room 420). It comes equipped with 3 bathrooms 2 bedrooms 2 living rooms a dining room and 2 decks. The suite was so delightful that I wished I could spend our entire stay there.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VMDVMD

Le Meridien N'Fis,GillH007_12 wrote a review Oct 2013,30,First experience of Morocco,We were on a tour with Voyage Jules Verne and this was our first hotel that we stayed at for 2 days on arrival and 2 days before departure. First of all the good things Room was a good size and everything worked. The gardens that we walked through to get to our building were a delight lovely flowering plants and water features as you might expect in Morocco. No where to sit there and enjoy it a shame really. We ate in the restaurant by the pool first day I had a lovely pizza very thin and crispy base and plenty of topping my husband's meal was o.k. Grounds and pool great but at weekends it gets extremely busy and you will have trouble finding a sun bed or even a seat in this area. However there are lovely extensive grounds with seating all around they have a complete block with roads surrounding the hotel grounds. The childrens play area seemed to be defunct no trampolines inside the guard for same. They really should make more of the grounds and let people know about them. We like the shade and there were plenty of shady places to sit. Now the downside; I would think this would have difficulty in getting a 4 star rating elsewhere. The food in the main restaurant is very samey and because it is a buffet never seemed to be hot. There was a wide choice but it all tasted the same and was difficult to tell what you were eating. The rooms were very dated and the heavy chairs make an awful sound when you move them so pity the poor people below you. Beds exceptionally hard not a comfortable sleep at all. Towels poor quality in bathroom and around the pool. Many of the sun shades had broken but the man was quite ingenious in getting them to stay up. Really needs new furniture both in hotel and around pool. No free wifi in room you have to pay for it. There were a few computers to the side of the reception area but they were always busy so never took advantage of them. As said before it would be good idea if the hotel told you what was available but no information was available. One of the two lifts was out of commission on our second stay there so this caused a lot of hold ups getting to and from room. Never did find the stairs perhaps they could be signed? One night there was clearly a travelling band going around and as our room overlooked the area between the tennis courts and the vegetable garden we heard it. Perhaps a room overlooking the swimming pool or gardens would have been quieter. It was full both times we stayed.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leominster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GillH007_12
Le Meridien N'Fis,SPAGIRLWestSussex wrote a review Oct 2013,30,You get what you pay for.,Stayed for 2 separate nights. Hotel given 5 * rating but this does not compare with other 5* hotels in somewhere like Dubai. We had a few niggles with the room which were dealt with quickly.    The hotel is undergoing a schedule of refurbishment some rooms have been done but although clean lack the glamour and high end touches of other 5* hotels. Having said that you are paying a LOT less for your room hence getting what you pay for.    Staff were excellent especially Said who ensured we paid the correct amount for Taxis.    Breakfast was disappointing. Only ate once a pizza at the restaurant beside the pool very poor.    Swimming pool was great but was unheated and so was really too cold for all but the bravest even in the 31 degree heat. Took ages to get towels.    The grounds are beautiful and we took long walks around them. It is nice to have some of the plants labelled so you know what they are.    There are tennis courts and a childrens playground but nothing listed about these facilities in your room. Free WiFi in our room but no instructions on how to get access. Little things but could be solved by a 'brochure' in the room.    Bedlinen and towels appeared off colour but it was explained to us that they use environmentally friendly washing products which contain no beach or optical whiteners. A great idea but should be explained by a leaflet left on the bed.    Beds are VERY hard too hard for us. TV picture quality very poor.    All in all a reasonably priced hotel in wonderful grounds. Lacks the character that you get in the many Riads around the Medina.

Le Meridien N'Fis,eblis3 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Marrakesh was a great adventure,This is the only Starwood property in Marrakesh and being a loyal customer (platinum with ambassador) I chose this hotel as our base for the city visit. We used the hotel for transfers to/from the airport and we are glad we did. The price of service was reasonable and the transfers were made easy for me and my companion even with all of our luggage (plan on shopping a lot).    The hotel is not close to the medina but we had no problem getting around by cab with one exception. We flagged a cab at the hotel where the door man did not talk to the driver to handle the pricing before we departed. This happened only once as we didn't get to the desired destination and argued over the fare price which was kind of scary. Remember to take a picture of the cab number (on the passenger door) every time you get in a cab so you can follow up if needed. Every other time the doorman flagged us and cab and handled the details for us which was extremely helpful. Hailing a cab on the street is not too tough but remember that even a ride across the city should not be more than 25 MAD no matter what you are told.    The check in was very easy and we were upgraded to a suite. The property is not new but it had good amenities for Marrakesh. We never made it to the pool area because they closed at 7pm which was unfortunate as it seemed like a good idea. The room was large and well appointed although dated. The shower was odd though and my companion and I argued over whether it had mold on the tile or whether it was the finish. Either way the shower was an issue but there was a nice big tub.    The concierge team was a great resource and helped us book activities before our arrival and during our stay. They were very knowledgeable and helped me find what I was looking for and not just vendors they used regularly. The entire staff was very welcoming and for all of the noise and chaos when you go outside the staff at this property makes the vibe very mellow and warm (always with a smile) which was welcomed. They even let us check out very late (8pm) due to an airline schedule change.    There is a free breakfast for platinum members. It’s a full breakfast with an omelet and crepe bar. There are alot of options and was a great start to the day. We ate at the bar too during our stay and the food there was just ok but we did not try much other than nibbles. There is a night club at the hotel but it was not open during our stay (only on the weekend).    The hotel was good value for the city and met all of our needs. It is not the fanciest hotel in the city but it is well situated and the staff makes it a good choice for a pleasant stay in Marrakesh. If you are looking for something outside the medina B&BS that won't break the bank this should be your first choice.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Coachella, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eblis3

While the property is nice and the rooms comfortable as others note needs a major facelift. But the main reason for the poor review is the horrible quality of the food. The breakfast buffet is below average and expensive. The dinner buffet is inedible - the food was both overcooked and cold - and expensive. Frustrated wih bad food (we ate great in/near the medina) our last night we ate at the bar. How bad could bar food be? Try a pizza listed with: fresh mushrooms olives artichokes and sundried tomatos. Instead you get the left over vegetables from the breakfast omlet station. When i complained to the manager the only reaponse was ""this is the first time I hear that.""

Lots of the room card keys seem to be broken. It took three rooms to find one for me that worked. And most of the time getting into the room I have to go back to the lobby.

The free wifi worked great but was a little slow. Shower water pressure was great and hot water all the time. Nice pool area. Friendly staff. Easy to get a taxi but it's awful to have to negotiate and fight with the drivers all the time as they keep demanding more money... so a hotel closer in where you can walk might make sense for some.    It was a good value but I suspect it won't remain a L'Meredian too much longer unless they do a major renovation/modernization all over.    Nothing really close by like a convenience store. Water is very expensive in the minibar. I wasn't too happy being on the first (second) floor as it looked like someone could jump up from outside.

The food particularly breakfast was varied and plentiful. The staff are always polite and friendly. Fatima at the reception was extremely helpful as was the manageress (unfortunately I forgot her name). Staff could communicate in English pretty well. Having stayed in many hotels in Marrakech and in Spain we felt Le Meridien was an excellent place to stay and very much value for money.

The location is great although you wouldn't want to walk to the main center it's easy to get a cab (just don't take it from in front of the hotel as the drivers will immediately overcharge knowing you are staying in a 5 star property!)    Also loved the pool and the staff at the pool side is extremely friendly and attentive! Even though they look like they are relaxed they are sure focused. While all the chairs were filled with guests a small child was struggling in the water already had her head underwater. Pool staff responded immediately whereas noone else even noticed it yet.    The staff in other areas of the hotel however are far from friendly. It is clear that they do not speak english at all but even their attitudes are rude.    When calling the reception or guest service the phone is answered with ""hello"". Had to call 3 times for the minibar to be emptied (which was not even filled properly when we arrived).  Ordered room service where they promised it would be there after half an hour. 30 min. later I didn't receive anything and called again. They said it just finished and they will bring it asap. Another half an hour later; nothing arrived! I had to call again and from that time it took another 15 minutes before my food was delivered. ((Count it took 1 hour and 15 minutes!!)). Eventually gave my feedback to the F&B manager but did not receive any sincere apology or gesture.    The breakfast is simply awefull and I would definately recommend going to one of the 3 restaurants located just next to the hotel. Service there is amazing and the prices are way better!    At check-out they only asked how I wanted to pay (after I explained I wanted to pay cash) and did not ask me about my stay and did not wish me a good travels or even a good day.    I believe that even though the property itself is beautiful and you can definitely stay the whole day by the pool and go out at night it is not worthy of being a Starwood hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jessica E wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Quiet hotel close to the city!,Le Meridien N'Fis is the perfect place to stay if you want an escape from the madness of Marrakech. The hotel is set in very peaceful surroundings with an amazing pool area. Although only about a 20 minute walk into the centre my partner and I who went in July thought it was just too hot to walk so we used taxis which only cost around £3-4 each way.  We had a ground floor room which was extremely spacious with fee wifi. The breakfasts were lovely especially the fresh omelettes and pancakes.  The highlight of the hotel for us has got to be the pool area which was always empty. We never struggled to obtain a sun bed even if arriving later in the day and the outside areas were all exceptionally clean and well kept.  The only issue we had was that we found eating in the hotel was quite expensive especially the pool bar even for simple things like sandwiches.  Would definitely stay in the hotel again.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ponty_lass11
Le Meridien N'Fis,Alex F wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Great Hotel in the Beautiful City,What a lovely hotel! I wanted to choose a hotel within working distance to Medina and Menara 2 sites I was planning to visit the next day. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of services facilities and the room itself. It is not cheap but usually you get what you paid for and it was worth it. A great French restaurant was just 5 minutes away and on my return I had a chance to relax by the pool before retiring for the night.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Avvy678 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,"Helpful staff, great pool",I have recently come back from a 5 night break at this hotel in Marrakesh. The hotel is spacious with a lovely reception area. We had a 3 person room and were upgraded on check-in for free! It's in a great location with cheap taxis taking you right to the Medina (apparently it's a 20min walk but the heat made this impossible to do!). We went during Ramadan so the hotel was fairly quiet with plenty of sunbeds free and the pool is just great. The grounds are also large and very pretty.  I have to say it's the staff that make this hotel great - the concierge was extremely helpful and helped us check restaurants recommend tours sort out transfers etc. The reception staff were also all very friendly.  The food at breakfast was amazing with a wide choice available. The spa seemed quite expensive so we did not use it.  Would definitely recommend this hotel if you're looking for a decent relaxing break - the Riads closer to the Medina may be very loud compared to this one which is still in a good location.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avvy678

Le Meridien N'Fis,Aaron P wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Simply fine,"When I was looking for hotels in Marrakech I wanted a chain hotel in a decent area that also provided airport transportation to avoid messing around playing the ""lets get ripped off by the taxi driver game"". So this hotel was chosen.    The hotel is fine. It is nothing special compared to mainland European hotels of the same star rating but the rooms where clean and comfortable. A refresh of the rooms is needed as it is starting to show some age.    I stayed in a twin room. The room is large and certainly had enough space. 3 bottles of water where provided in the room as well a fruit bowel complimentary. The water was a very welcome touch due to the heat! The fruit seemed like it had been out for a long time and had seen better days so we left that.  Rooms do have air conditioning although not very powerful. Rooms open up onto a very small balcony with just enough room to stand on but its better then nothing. The door did not lock which was very odd and it seemed the lock had not only been broken but removed some time ago.  A table and two chairs are also in the room which is ideal for relaxing away from the heat.  The TV had limited English speaking channels with a very fuzzy picture which did not concern us too much as we where not there to use the TV. It seemed this was an issue throughout the hotel as the TVs in reception had an equally poor display.    The bathroom seemed quite dated with a few stained floor tiles. Complimentary toiletries are provided however we seemed to have 3 half used shower gels and 1 full shampoo which is not very good of the cleaning staff. There is a small sign in the bathroom informing guests that the water from the taps is drinkable.    WI-FI is chargeable in the hotel. Reception staff where not the friendliest however where not rude. Check-in was straightforward and quick.  As mentioned at the start the hotel provides a shuttle ""bus"" which turned out to be a large people carrier. Although more then a taxi its a set price and avoids the need to barter with taxi drivers. The car driver was in the arrivals hall at the airport with a sign with our names on. This service can be arranged by e-mailing the hotel direct. We also arranged return transport using the hotels transport. The journey is just under 10 minutes.    Breakfast is served as a large buffet and was quite impressive with a good selection on offer including made to order omelettes.    The hotel is a 15 minute walk along 1 road to the train station and a 25-30 minute walk to the old city. The area is safe both during the day and night. Both walks are easy and the hotel can provide maps and information.    The hotel has quite an impressive garden area between the hotel lobby and the guest rooms in a large outdoor open area which also leads to the nice setting for the swimming pool.  A selection of bars and restaurants are in the hotel although I did not use apart from breakfast and a drink on our last hour which was a good price for a hotel.    A few flaws here but overall is fine. Don't expect a 5 star hotel and you will not be disappointed.",Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metromuppet
Le Meridien N'Fis,Scott H wrote a review Jul 2013,50,"Very comfortable stay, and great concierge!",My room was very nice - the basics were well-covered. Clean larger room bed and pillows were good the bathroom was good (look for the electric socket on the back of hair dryer assembly) air conditioner worked well good lighting good room-darkening curtains pretty quiet. My room faced southeast toward the street so I heard some traffic noise (music motorcycles etc) but not bad. Ask for a NE or NW facing room to minimize. No iron but they deliver no problem. Safe worked but you REALLY have to push and hold the buttons. I don't know why.    There is only one formal restaurant (buffet only) but there is a bar (we did not use it due to cigarette smoke) and you can order off the bar menu for dinner. Breakfasts and dinners were very good - lots of variety on the buffet. Lunch is available pool-side. I didn't try room service.    The grounds are beautiful. Really nice gardens nice pool comfortable feel. Large footprint (you can see for yourself on Google Earth) which gives a nice feeling of open space and buffering from other nearby properties.    Talk to Youssef the concierge for any of your needs. He is super-helpful. He recommended off-site restaurants (within walking distance) that were excellent and he set up a tour of the Atlas Mountains that ended up being the highlight of the trip. He set us up with Mohammed and I would recommend Mohammed without question. He was very engaging spoke very good English and gave us a very thorough informative and enjoyable tour.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Jill H wrote a review Jul 2013,50,"Fantastic, and I am a senior contributor",I was terrified of staying here after reading the OLDER reviews on Trip Advisor but trust me this hotel will be going from 3000 SPG points to 12000 in a short period of time. They have renovated it and the grounds are equivalent to any 5* US property.  We were on the Gold SPG Floor and our room was very nice clean and modern. We ordered off the menu and I had a mushroom omelet for the equivalent of $4 US dollars that came with toast as we used points and those did not include the $25 US dollar per person breakfast. Wi-fi was free and excellent throughout the hotel. The bar is great and serves snacks the pool area amazingly huge the store in the hotel had some great clothes and pocketbooks. While we were waiting for our ride to the airport the manager was very accommodating and offered to let us order room service in the bar while watching Wimbledon and was helpful when I made a costly phone call adjusted the bill for me.    The location is a 2 minute cab ride from the main square or you can walk in 15 minutes to a lot of places. This is in the up and coming area of town where they are building a Hard Rock and huge shopping mall.    I would still recommend the experience of staying in a Riad in the Medina at least one night going into the desert and then staying here to relax or do more day trips from here especially before they raise their rates.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z8731YBjh
Le Meridien N'Fis,Trixta wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Appearances can be deceiving,We were really impressed by the appearance of this property. Beautiful gardens incredible foyer great pool area nice cafe by the pool cool haven away from the heat of the street.  Then we stayed!  Our room was swelteringly hot. Aircon not working. Spoke to Fatima at reception and asked for  it to be fixed before we returned from our evening out. Arrived back at 10pm and nothing had been done. Called at reception Fatima assured us she had called the service man (not). Asked for another room. Was assured that the room would be fixed in 15 minutes. Serviceman arrived promptly and removed a filter from the aircon intake that had completely blocked up with dirt. impossible to operate. a 5 min clean and we were OK but the room took more than 24 hours to cool as everything was hot - tiles drapes bedding. OK thereafter.  Next issue was the door magnetic card key. We had to return to reception 7 times to get the card replaced or recharged. It was not stored by us in any place that could affect it but we were treated with skepticism until finally a porter went with us to prove that it would not work and immediately called a service man who reprogrammed the door mechanism and it worked fine from then on. Again poor attention to issues was a bit disheartening.  Another issue was the towels - removed while we were at breakfast and never replaced until we requested them late afternoon. The room was serviced during the day but still no towels. Most annoying when you want to wash before going out or returning during the day.  Another of the guests had the door key problem - he tried to call reception from the phone by the lift and the phone dropped to the floor.  Our hair dryer disintegrated in the hand during use. and one foot fell off the lounge chair while moving it  Good things -breakfast most of the junior staff very helpful and cafe meals were great.

Cabs cost about 50dh (grande cab) or 30dh (petite cab) which is ridiculous for the 2 mins ride  but it seems to be the standard price.  Concierge is very helpful and we rented a car and driver for a day to head up to Imili Valley.

Le Meridien N'Fis,SG wrote a review Jul 2013,10,Avoid! Theft problem! Ladies - lock away your clothes!,"I stayed here for two weeks on business. The hotel is reasonably pleasant and I wasn't paying I didn't feel I had too much to complain about but might have been disappointed if I'd booked a holiday there.    The gardens are pretty the pool is nice and the bar and food is quite good. I thought the breakfast was good. The mint tea is fantastic.    HOWEVER the air conditioning in my room was useless. Huge ants kepted popping into my room to say hello. My sheets had a distinctive orange stain on the edge which I noticed after a couple of days and which demonstrated that my sheets were not changed for 10 DAYS (I checked but didn't complain since once a week at home is acceptable and I just slept on the other side of the bed on week two!) and I don't think this is normal for a hotel. The towels were changed daily but they looked pretty old and dirty. The wifi isn't great.    I can put up with a lot if I get a good night's sleep but unfortunately trolleys from the restaurant buffet (I think) were rattling through the guest corridors (shortcut to the kitchen?!) late at night EVERY night and housekeeping make a right noise from early in the morning so there's no chance of a lie in!    The one thing that would stop me from returning to Le Meridien and from recommending to anyone would be the fact that several items clothing were stolen from my room. I hoped I was mistaken until I got home and checked my case again. THREE of my tops (I left my unworn tops in my suitcase and draped my worn clothes over the back of a chair. Presumably the maid thought I wouldn't notice because I wouldn't wear them again but she chose the wrong girl. And the wrong tops!!!!! I feel awful about it since she seemed sweet and I left her a tip. I also noticed that a pair of expensive sandals had been pushed well under the bed (not by me!) and if I hadn't checked under the bed just as I was leaving she would've got her grubby little mitts on those too!    I will never stay here again and I would warn you against booking here unless you can lock away all of your possessions when you leave your room. I'm always careful not to leave anything valuable lying around but I could never have imagined that my clothes would be stolen! It's simply appalling. I Googled ""clothes theft le meridien marrakech"" and it seems like this is not an isolated incident. This hotel has a problem with housekeeping theft. I have travelled a lot and stayed in many many hotels and this has never happened to me before. I've never even heard of anyone having clothes stolen from a hotel room!    I fell in love with Marrakech during my time there but this has really left a bad taste in my mouth and quite frankly ruined my impression of the place.    I have reported to Le Meridien and to the hotel itself. Let's see what they come up with. I will update with the outcome.

Le Meridien N'Fis,KishanShapriya wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Great stay,We loved this hotel and the service from the staff for our 6 day stay in Marrakech. Overall this hotel is a high 4* rather than 5*. We have stayed in 5* and 6* hotels as well as 4 3 and even 2* in our travels around the world. So we strongly would recommend anyone coming as a couple young family retired or on business to stay here. If you out as a group on an adventure it's a perfect place to launch your excursions from. If you are a group out to party best to avoid it.    We can clearly say that the service of the staff was very accommodating and extremely friendly and helpful. Youssef from the concierge was very helpful and kind spoke very good English and advised us on the best places to visit with precise directions. Moona the cashier was also very helpful and understanding always with a smile and well spoken we utterly enjoyed interacting with her. Not forgetting Jihad at the bar she was very welcoming and the most help we got as well a a cheerful character was from the porters Said and Hassan. However we must say that after 10:30pm the night staff were very unhelpful and so we avoided using their help. On more than one occasion the large gentleman inch age of the shisha tent was pretty grumpy and off putting when you are having a splendid time. He also overcharged us on some items I should have confronted him there and then but I was not going to let him get the better of me on my holiday. Management should look into his overpricing in the shisha tent even if its water. A bottle of water near the pool cost 35dhr. Same bottle in the shisha tent was charged at 50dhr even though the bottle was coming from the bar.    The value for money of the room and basics is good but all the extras including a can of coke is extremely high and overly priced. Avoid ordering alcohol as its very expensive. Only go to the resteraunt near the pool for drinks as its cheaper there than the pool bar or shisha tent.    Sleep quality was amazing. Big king bed miss it. Hating my double at home now. Only problem with the room was that when we had 45deg c outside the a/c in the room struggled to cool the room at night so we had to wait until we fell asleep from tiredness rather than comfort of the room temperature.    The hotel was very clean and well looked after only nit picking comment is that the common hallway carpet was loose and exposing the grippers - a bit dangerous for bare feet. The other observation was that there was sometimes bits fallen in the bottom of the pool and only cleaned once or twice a week. But the gardens was luscious and well maintained a must see for anyone visiting marrakech.    The location was fantastic. If you go to the town and see the hustle bustle and want to escape it then this hotel is 20 min walk away from the main medina square. Easily done in the evenings. The area is very new and upcoming with most of the best places to eat and see on the same road just a 10 min walk away.    The rooms were nice pleasant and clean. Not top quality but good enough to be comfortable.    There was a spa but we did not use it.    Breakfast was continental but more French. It was really good.    Although everyone is entitled to their own opinions on tripadvisor I think it's a bit harsh to say food in general in marrakech is not good. I probably had the best holiday food ever here and would say to anyone visiting that its all cleanly prepared with mineral water/ reverse osmosis water and fresh ingredients. Don't want to be a spoiler for the taste but be rest assured the food is good.    In conclusions would highly recommend this hotel and would be happy to answer more specific questions from anyone.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KishanShapriya

Le Meridien N'Fis,travelkonijn wrote a review Jun 2013,30,No 5-star experience,We were quite disappointed in Le Meridien N'Fis it was an ok hotel but definitely not a 5 star experience. When our taxi from the airport pulled up nobody bothered with opening the door and welcoming us. None of the the several employees that were hanging out there chatting even took our luggage inside. Once inside the foyer someone came and took our bags. We checked in and the porter took us to our room. The room was ok but it reminded me of a motel room that had seen better days especially the bathroom. But everything worked which is what mattered. We had told them before arrival that we'd need an extra bed for our daughter and the porter asked us if he should bring one. We said yes and waited but he never came back. It was late at night so we all ended up sleeping in one bed. We got the extra bed the next day after another call to the font desk. The buffet breakfast was good and it was nice that they have a tent set up with beautiful sofas where you can sit and enjoy your breakfast if you like. I wanted to get some mint tea which is in a metal tea pot on a hot plate. The handle is also metal but it had a paper napkin flimsily wrapped around it supposedly so you don't burn yourself. The napkin was too thin so I burned myself. One of the staff watched this scene but simply walked away. We wanted to explore the city and had a few questions for the larger than life concierge but he could hardly be bothered with us and just walked off after answering one question. He clearly had more important things to do. Outside none of the staff ever offered to hail a cab. On our last day we were so happy when someone actually approached us and asked if we needed a taxi but he turned out to be a tour guide trying to sell his services. The hotel grounds are nice with lots of interesting plants and blue Moroccan lanterns in between. The pool in spring was not heated and therefore too cold for me but I expect it to be quite refreshing in the summer heat. Location wise we would probably choose a hotel closer to the medina next time or even better a riad. Definitely somewhere where the staff actually cares.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,Suzhou,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelkonijn

From the moment you arrive the staff in the lobby are polite and smartly dressed. We had an issue with the view from our room which was rectified without question. The pool is beautiful & with the exception of one particularly surly female member of bar staff the rest are lovely and so helpful. The evening meal options are a little disappointing. We were under the impression that the hotel had 3 restaurants but in fact there is just one option; a buffet by the pool priced at around £20 per person. Aside from this the breakfast was delicious & again the staff were very accommodating. The room was clean and there were some lovely personal touches throughout the week.

Le Meridien N'Fis,271blah wrote a review Jun 2013,30,"Poor for a 5* Hotel, not Meridien standard & pool freezing",Overall we found the Moroccan nature to be somewhat surly; they are perfectly friendly if you initiate any courtesy or banter but are not forthcoming or spontaneously cheerful themselves. Odd for the service industry especially at a 5* Hotel. As always there are exceptions to this rule and our chambermaid as well as one of the older waiters and Fred the omelette chef were lovely.  We were on the 1st floor and suffered the “tick tick” sound of the automated water sprinklers all through the night. Ask for higher floor to avoid this & you should also get a view of the pool/gardens.  The French sign in the bathroom “this water is potable” means the water is drinkable!  Ask for a kettle & it will be provided – otherwise there isn’t one in the room!  Use the “green choice” door hangar; you will receive complimentary coffee vouchers 5 Euros or SPG points or you can donate to a charity. Beware; read the terms on the reverse of the coffee voucher as you will have to explain them to the staff who will deny their usage! They are valid in multiples they can be used at the pool bar or in the restaurant but not at the Bar. A Bar coffee is £3.50/35 MAD.  We had to return to reception 3 times because the card key didn’t work; other guests had the same problem. The shower leaks onto the floor so the bath mat becomes a sodden mess every time you have a shower – a partial fixed screen would solve this. The pool temperature is oddly VERY cold even after a full day of sun - hence it is usually empty!  Free Wi-Fi in the lobby area – the chairs could not be more unsuitable; too low for the table and not computer chairs. There are only two pc’s and both have very slow signals and dodgy keyboards. Beware as they are not in the QWERTY layout which was confusing?! I tried to do this review but it lost all my input!  If you sign for things against your room number; keep tabs on your hotel receipts; they do not give you a copy for you to check against the final bill. The bill is written in an undecipherable code so identifying each item is very difficult.  The grounds were generally well kept except by the tennis courts where it looks like a building has been partially dismantled & there is some debris?!  The pool beds and umbrellas had seen better days and though there are plenty staff no-one seemed bothered about making repairs. The sunbed fabric is stained; they could be removed and washed or replaced there were several umbrellas with hanging struts that were duly raised anyway by the pool attendant who brought you 2 towels. These could just use a few screws!  The staff are also rigid about the service examples include;  we were seated right beside the poolside restaurant but had to make a circuit to the pool bar to order food to have at our sunbeds. We saw and asked for a Club sandwich that came out of the restaurant and were brought a baguette by the pool bar staff!  Having sat out on the open terrace after breakfast with another guest who smoked; I wanted to go to the toilet which is by the entrance to the breakfast area. I was firmly told that the doors were locked and I had to make a circuit via reception to get back to the other side of the door for the loo!  Meals  Breakfast; no dates! OJ was watery especially considering the lovely flavour of fresh squeezed OJ in the medina (40p/4 MAD!) – so it is readily available & should be better quality in a 5* Hotel. It was the first time I had seen “diet” cheese & yoghurt offered. A fair selection on the buffet fresh fruit pastries & freshly cooked egg station; not spectacular for a 5* hotel though.  Pizza by the pool starts at £7.50/75 MAD  The only evening dining option was at the poolside restaurant who had a buffet at 250 MAD (c£25) per head every night! If you don’t want to go far walk to the right of the Hotel there are a few places to eat about 200 yards down.  If you walk to the medina/souk; it is about 3 miles & will take about 40 minutes at a slow pace not the 15/20 they quote but a taxi will only cost £3/30 MAD if you barter properly from their original price of 100 MAD,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Croydon, Surrey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271blah

It is a stunning hotel in beautifully landscaped grounds with all the facilities one could desire. Our room was beautiful and left nothing to be desired in any way. Breakfast was a colourful feast of Moroccan delights and certainly a location in which one might want to linger over a longer breakfast. The shots of morning booster juices were a flavoursome delight with which to start the morning and sipping on the delightfully refreshing mint tea was an equally good way to conclude your first meal of the day. The service provided by staff was impeccable and in our view our overall experience was without doubt 5 star in quality.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lake Macquarie, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JANDK2265

Before our arrival the concierge Youssef Momouni had been very helpful and arranged transportation from the airport to the hotel flowers in the room and even an upgrade. During our stay Youssef was also helpful finding several good restaurants in Marrakech - just to our liking.  We missed a nice restaurant in the hotel as there was only the pool BBQ available for dinner or sandwich / pizza in the bar.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Sue M wrote a review Jun 2013,50,lovely ambience and very amenable staff. One of my fave hotels,Lovely hotel with beautiful gardens and great swimming pool area. The staff were very professional. They were so amenable and yet unobtrusive but there to give any assistance. The hotel itself has character too despite being outside the medina. I loved the perfumed air of the reception area. It was a lovely calm introduction to Morrocco before the experience of the Medina and Souks. I had a really enjoyable time here and I would say that staying at this hotel instead of a Riad made my visit all the more enjoyable because there was a lovely swimming pool to sunbathe around and cool down in and the lush green gardens gave it an air of tranquility even though we were a stones throw away from the hustle and bustle of the medina. Great place to stay. I'll definitely recommend it for value for money too.

Facilities very good and staff were amazing - as a female travelling by myself to attend a conference they made me feel very comfortable. Their help with getting around sorting conference arrangements and even finding a doctor for me on a sunday was invaluable. Great food lots of lovely gathering places to meet up with friends and appealing pool area for post conference relaxing. A nice mix of people from families to singles. It really is as lovely as the pictures on their website! Good access point to many of Marrakech features. Don't miss breakfast in the sumptuous Moroccan style tent.

Le Meridien N'Fis,chrissybabes1969 wrote a review Jun 2013,50,"Fabulous, fabulous hotel with wonderful, friendly staff",What can I say? Le Meridien N'Fis is an absolutely fabulous hotel. From the moment we arrived at the Reception we were greeted by friendly courteous staff who couldn't do enough for us. The service was brilliant whether it was a request for information Reception booking a restaurant the bar area or the breakfast area (tasty omlettes every day); the staff were amazing. Youssef and Hassan the Porter (who was always smiling) made our holiday so much more special.  The rooms are a good size with comfortable beds and all the toileteries you would need in the bathrooms. There is also a good bar in the hotel which we used regularly on an evening before going out and for a nightcap on our return.  When we arrived we were given a room upgrade as we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary. The rooms were beautiful with a superb view overlooking the pool and garden area. Incidently the gardens were also amazing very well tended. After our 1st day by the pool we arrived back to our room where some gorgeous fresh flowers and fruit had been delivered.  The hotel is located on Avenue Mohammed VI in the Hivernage area of Marrakech so not far to walk to Gueliz. When visiting Jamaa el Fna square we just got a taxi there. The staff outside arranged for the taxi to come and pick you up at the entrance to the hotel.  We wanted to renew our wedding vows whilst we were on holiday and after contacting the hotel's Concierge before hand Youssef Mamouni contacted me directly and arranged to put me in touch the priest Fr Yosi Solivar from the local church. Not only did Youssef arrange everything and give us the use of the hotel's car and driver to take us to and from the church on our special day he also came down to the church when the priest requested an English-speaking witness to do two readings. Youssef had finished work for the day and came to the church in his own time to help us out at very short notice. He was wonderful and we were ever so grateful for his help.  The hotel also provided us with complimentary tickets to The Majorelle Gardens with all their blue painted walls as well as a special cake when we celebrated our wedding anniversary.

The Meridien N´Fis belongs to the group of ""normal"" five stars not distinguishable from the outside but elegant and comfortable inside.  Rooms are finein buildings distributed in the a large garden area rooms that are not the latest in modernity but anyway are complete and with everything functioning well including free wi-fi. One of the highmarks of the hotel is its large garden area in fact many hectares of beautiful gardens and orchards where there is an excellent overflowing swimming pool.  Other positive findings were the buffet dinner at the restaurant - really delicious with choices of moroccan italian and chinese cuisines - the nice breakfast and the good location. We took a taxi on the street for the Djema el Fna square but did not need to do so walked back easily.

Le Meridien N'Fis,chriswagenaar wrote a review Jun 2013,40,Wonder place to stay in Morocco.,We stayed here for a few nights in the summer of 2012 and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. You can change money in the hotel lobby so that was a plus and the hotel staff was incredibly nice. After checking out we had some time to kill and they let us use our room later to take a shower after swimming in the pool before heading to the airport. On site hookah lounge and bar was a nice thing to have. Location wasn't spectacular but it was just a quick taxi ride away from the main square. You can walk there if you're feeling adventures (we did). There's a market down the street where you can pick up bottles of water for cheap and bring them back to the hotel.

Special mention for Jouseff the concierge who recommended a guide for the souks and booked us a restaurant overlooking the square. He also arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains. The pool was perfect with good bar service and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Breakfast was excellent - omelettes cooked to order plus everything else you could wish for. Cleaning staff were accommodating and friendly. Just a short walk or cheap taxi ride to centre of town (20 dirhams - about £2). recommend a drink in Hotel Mamouia - expensive but worth it.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caroley79

Le Meridien N'Fis,katrina1961 wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A perfect city break,We are a group of 8 women celebrating a birthday and we chose this hotel because of it's vicinity to the souk and medina. It feels the best of both worlds: close enough to all the sights and yet an oasis of calm sitting by the pool and the hotel gardens. The hotel and location tick all the boxes.  Prior to leaving home I emailed the hotel with various queries and they answered promptly which great.  Check in was easy and smooth. We had lovely rooms looking out over the lush gardens and the rooms themselves are spacious and clean. Even the toiletries were lovely. The shower was brilliant too.  The pool is clean and there's no problem getting a sun bed at any time of day. Beach towels are provided by the hotel. The poolside restaurant is perfect for bar snacks lunch and drinks.  The breakfast was actually one of the best I've had and can compare to five star hotels. Freshly squeezed juices fresh omelettes cooked in front of you. Actually they're the best omelettes I've eaten. Loads of fresh fruit pastries and delicious coffee.  I really want to sing the praises of all the staff who greet you as soon as they see you and a huge thank you to the concierge Yousseff who went out of his way to help us. His knowledge and the service he provided made us enjoy Marrakech even more and he couldn't do enough to help. Nothing was too much trouble for him. He booked a guide to take us to the souks and medina he booked a trip for us to the Atlas Mountains on an air conditioned mini bus for an absolute bargain price and he arranged for our transfer back to the airport for our return flight home. Thank you Yousseff.  Limia on reception was a star and allowed us a free late check out.  The checking out was smooth and efficient and the settling of room bills was honest which means we didn't have any bill queries thank you again.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ramez L wrote a review May 2013,50,"Delightful gardens, good location",This hotel is very delightful. It is located in the newer part of marrakech just a mile away (in a straight line from Jamaa al F'na and the old town). It is also on the same junction that goes the other way to Manara gardens. both can be long walks esp when it is hot but it is not that far either. it is close enough to walk or take a cab/car but not too close to the noise and traffic. Te hotel has ample fee parking a boon as we had our own car.    The rooms are quite spacious we had a triple room and the extra bad hardly got in the way. the décore js rather plain but not annoyingly so. Despite the negative reviews I read about the service we found he service to be very nice and the staff to be friendly especially the housekeeping ladies who were very helpful and nice. I suppose it is how you ask that gets people to be nice. Being a chain hotel it does not have the charm of a riad but it has what one normally expects to find in terms of amenities and service.    The hotel has a very beautiful pool area. It has a lovely immaculate garden with fruiting citrus pomegranate apricot and plum trees in addition lovely flowers. It is like an oasis. The garden was especially more beautiful on those early rainy spring mornings when the scents and the freshness of the air were very pleasant.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Magdeburg, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RamezL
Le Meridien N'Fis,Marijke S wrote a review May 2013,20,Avoid choosing this as a SPG & NEVER take a cab arranged by the hotel,We (young well travelled couple) stayed at Le Meridian N'Fis for three days & two nights (May 2013). As a SPG we looked forward to being warmly welcomed and helped throughout our stay. The following points sum up our experience with Le Meridian N'Fis:    - Rooms are dated: With so much roomspace and beautiful Moroccan architecture to be inspired by I would have expected much better.    - Wifi is patchy: The WIFI is slow patchy and the reach is limited to the lobby area contrary to what you will be told at the reception.    - Breakfast: the area where it is served is quite depressing best to grab a place in the tent bit for at least some exotic feel. The quality of breakfast is average-poor. With such a delicious cuisine and fresh produce why limit yourself to fake orange juice and stale bread?    - Lunch: we were very disappointed to find NO moroccan bites/lunch on the menucard. Instead American burgers french fries & Thai sandwiches were on offer.    - Taxis: If you do decide to stay here ... then best piece of advice is to NEVER take a cab arranged by the hotel. It's a total scam. They have fixed prices arranged with the cab drivers across the street. These prices are at least TRIPLE of what you would pay normally. You will note that the meters of these cabs are turned off - spare your energy & arguing skills in asking why as you will get the widest range of excuses imaginable.    And don't expect friendliness from the staff once you make it clear to them you're on to their game. They will not help you in any way to get another cab or let you ask for the cab to use the meter. The will simply look offended tell you to go to the street and get one yourself. Fortunately we speak French! A quick price indication: From the hotel to the Pacha (15min) it's 18 derham. From the hotel to the Jardin Majorelle it's 17 derham. From the hotel to Jemma el Fna it's about 12 - 19 derham depending on the traffic. The Jewish quarter is also around 18 derham. Most cabs do have fixed prices for the airport don't let them fool you in going above 50 derham!    Our perception is that the hotel receives a share of the earnings of the cab drivers - they note each driver + destination + price. So ... save yourself a lot of money and just grab one on the corner of the street ;)    Concluding we were quite disappointed by the level and quality of service regarding this hotel. Normally we trust SPG hotels blindly but in the future we will be sure to check tripadvisor prior to booking. We will not be returning to Le Meridian in Marrakech. From what I read in the reviews it does not seem they do much with the comments ... what a pity as the estate is gorgeous.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarijkeS626
Le Meridien N'Fis,Lynne M wrote a review May 2013,40,"Nice hotel, spotty service",The hotel was perfectly nice as one would expect at a Meridien. Large gardens nice pool tennis courts. It's a modern hotel and lacks Moroccan charm but that's what I expect at a large chain hotel. The breakfast buffet is outstanding -- lots of variety and very good. Only complaint with this hotel was that the service was a bit strange and inconsistent. The concierge and front desk staff were always helpful and friendly. On arrival day we went to the pool to relax a bit. It was around 5:00 and there were few staff around. The staff person who was walking around spoke almost no English which was surprising at a hotel like this. We'd ask questions and he'd respond in Arabic. Eventually he went and got us some extra towels but I felt like I was inconveniencing him. Housekeeping was also inconsistent. They were stingy with towels (just one large and one small per person. We had a suite and they didn't put a hand towel in the second bathroom). Bottled water was in the room when we arrived. On the second day we didn't get any - either from daily housekeeping or the evening service -- and on the third day we got water again. I'd stay here again but it could use some small service improvements.    The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the Medina or a very short taxi ride (~20-40 dh depending on time of day). Location is fine if you have a guide but might be inconvenient if traveling independently.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynneJSM

We booked online through Tripadvisor which gave us a great deal including breakfast everyday.  We arrived at this grand beautiful hotel with a friendly welcome they greeted us with the most divine moroccon tea whilst they got our paperwork ready. The reception staff spoke many languages including english which was very helpful.  Then we were taken to our room and our holiday truely began whilst walking through the exotic gardens beautiful water fountains and the most amazing smell of flowers and oranges we had a very good first impression.  We ate in all the 4 restaurants within the hotel and was very impressed with the service and quality of food.  The wines are fantastic also.  The service around the pool was above and beyond.  Although it was out of peek time i wouldn't like to imagine the peak season as it could get very busy the staff are very helpful but would need a few more staff around the pool area/bar to speed up service during peek times.  The pool was'nt heated so it was'nt possible to swim that was a shame however i think they do that for a reason in the hight of summer it would be great to jump into that great icey pool.  They provide you with clean soft towels which is a lovely touch.  Beautiful surroundings and feels like paradise while the hustle and bustle goes on outside the hotel grounds.  The spa was lovely sweet staff.  The breakfast buffet restaurant was superb the choices are incredible.  Fresh Fresh Fresh foods!  The bar was a little pricey and smelt like an old mans pub.  But it was nice to just have a little night cap now and then.  The moroccan restaurant was divine. The food is out of this world and the staff are really professional.  The bedroom was a good size great view and the bed was a giant king size we could have slept forever in that bed.  The maids work very hard and cleaned our room daily fresh linen clean towels fresh fruit and water daily fresh flowers and little chocolate treats on the pillow they even make a design on the bed with the extra blankets. It was a real delight.  Bathroom was lovely with a moroccan tiling feel.  I would definately come again to this beautiful hotel and would highly recommend.  Thank you Le Meridien N'Fis..

Sometimes it would work and then it won't! We had a nice private courtyard but it was never swept and the chairs were dirty. Now this was offset by daily turn-down service that included bottled water!    Meals: Breakfast was a feast with lots of choices of western and Moroccan dishes. Service was good with 3-4 mangers always hovering around. The brochures said that there were lots of restaurants but we discovered that only the pool and the bar restaurants were working.    Service: Spotty. One night we asked the Concierge for a suggestion for desserts. He sent us to the buffet restaurant near the pool. The desserts were nearly all gone and we could not figure out how to pay for just dessert so we left. Next day we discovered that we could have had dessert in the Bar!

We would book again without hesitation having enjoyed the trip thoroughly. The hotel is well positioned in Hivernage a 15 minute walk to the centre of town. Lots of people stay in small riads in the Medina but with the level of heat in Marrakech it is a real benefit to be in a full service hotel with air conditioning and a large swimming pool. The hotel has large and beautiful gardens with the clean and well-attended swimming pool. Other plus points for us included the warm and friendly service from the majority of staff and the standard of food at the buffet evening meal taken on the terrace by the pool  Through email to the hotel in advance we were able to reserve inter-connecting rooms which is really good for families.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ruby_F239 wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Very Pleasant Stay,I stayed at the hotel for one week and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The gardens and communal areas are beautiful as well as the large pool area. The pool is not heated but I found this refreshing when it is 35 degrees outside!! The poolside worker is very helpful and although the service at the poolside bar can be slow at times it isn't because they are sitting around doing nothing. The menu at poolside bar is limited however there is a much wider selection at the restaurant just by the side of the pool and I found this quite nice to base myself at in the shade for an hour after a morning in the sun.  The rooms are clean spacious if not a little basic however I am not one to sit around in my hotel room all day. Was given complimentary water on a daily basis which was great as I know from my travels not all hotels do do this and its much appreciated when walking around in such high temperatures.  Breakfast personally for me was fulfilling. No the choice of buffet doesn't look as grand as you ma have seen in other 5 star hotels however they do have fresh orange and fruit juice available small selection of fresh fruit bread/pastry egg and pancakes corner cereal and selection of other hot items.  The staff at reception were lovely and very helpful and didn't fail to assist in helping me with many of my questions. There is an ATM machine across the road from the hotel and if you need smaller change you can get this changed at reception.  The hotel is about a 20 minute walk into souks/square area and a 7 minute taxi ride away from some of the museums majorelle gardens palaces etc which will cost you approx. 20-30 dirham one way in a taxi.  I paid the hotel 150 dirham one way for my airport transfer which although I knew would be over the odds I was travelling on my own arriving late evening so didnt mind (and still doesn't work out to be much money). On the way back to the airport I got a taxi at the hotel and it cost me 75 dirham.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruby_F239

I was there for a conference. Breakfast was basic lunch provided rather tough overcooked lamb.    On the plus side I thought the communal areas looked beautiful and the staff were certainly extremely attentive. However given the short distance to the airport the 150 Dirham charged was excessive (although I acknowledge this is a standard hotel fee). The return taxi cost me less than half and I suspect that was over the odds too.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,Berkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoBruno
Le Meridien N'Fis,data2u wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Feel welcome and special!,We arrived in Marrakech after 7 days in Spain and were welcomed with smiling faces and a delicious cup of tea.  The reception staff and bell captains made us feel as though we we special guests not weary travelers.  The hotel has a very beautiful garden that provides a tranquil place for early morning relaxation or an evening stroll.  The staff will gladly assist in either finding a taxi or helping plan your excursion.  Outstanding friendly and competent staff at every turn.  The hotel is a short taxi ride to most locations  The restaurants serve an aboundense of food and very delicious mostly traditional Moroccan dishes but it would be a mistake not to experience them.

Le Meridien N'Fis,HKMatt81 wrote a review Apr 2013,10,Awful,We have never submitted a review before and are not generally complainers (we are very frequent travelers in the developing world) but while we don't expect perfection (and certainly not at this price) our experience at Le Meridien was so poor that we are compelled to draw your attention to the serious deficiencies at this hotel.    Honestly this is the worst Le Meridien we have ever stayed at and the worst hotel we have stayed at in Marrakech (we have stayed at many other and cheaper hotels in Marrakech that were vastly superior). A rip off for the prices/points they are charging.    No wifi in the rooms - although we were told it was just down for the day it was never repaired during our trip and our suspicions were confirmed when we saw a Tripadvisor comment from earlier in the month that noted the same problem. We had to make constant trips to the lobby to use the wifi.    Dirty room.    Empty minibar.    Half water bottles by the side of the bed for which we were charged but which were not marked as a minibar item in any way.    Deplorable breakfast. No excuse for stale pastries in Marrakech where any sidewalk cafe has delicious pastries. Also no excuse for the chemical fake orange juice when real orange juice is available everywhere. The kicker was that both of our coffee cups were dirty and we had to wash them in the sink. We ended up walking down the street for breakfast at a cafe.    We understand that Le Meridien used to be a very good hotel in Marrakech on par with the Sofitel but now clearly there is no comparison. In sum way below what one would expect to find in Marrakech for the money and way below what one expects from Le Meridien.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKMatt81

Sure the hotel is not newly built or a Riad. But the rooms we stayed in were great. We were treated fantastically. Special thanks to the amazing Youssef (head concierge) and front office staff all of you.  The pool area is great. It could though do with an upgrade of the sun chairs. Despite that compared to the pool areas in the riads this is just heaven. Large pool you feel the out doors and great service with drinks etc.  As my head line states. If content is what counts.

(a) They didn't respond sensibly to my request for reservation changes. They said that they couldn't shorten (i.e. to reduce the no. of nights) because the hotel was full... I was not asking for extra night!!!!  (b) The reservation didn't respond to my email.  (c) They lost my reservation records... Fortunately I got my ipad to show what I had in my account.  (d) I complained to the front desk about my bad experience and asked for written explanation. The front desk said she would refer to the manager. But no feedback at all. Absolutely they don't take complaint seriously.  (e) They overcharged my starpoints for my redemption. It should only have cost me for 8000 starpoints for 2 nights redemption. But now I lost 20000 starpoints. An absolute scam.    My sincere advice is to avoid this hotel if you don't want to ruin the holiday. My greatest regret as a SPG member is my stay with this hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,h1st0ry wrote a review Mar 2013,30,A little chaotic,If this hotel could sort out the problems with its reception staff it would qualify for a good ranking.  The facilities in the hotel are fine. The rooms are ok although they could do with an update. There is music playing in the club at night so ask for a quiet room if this is likely to bother you. The breakfast was good with the usual buffet selection. The fresh warm bread was however excellent. There is a nice pool area - a good size pool (not heated) and an efficient restaurant service. The evening food in the restaurant was mixed in terms of quality. The same applied to room service: the same order produced two very different meals on two separate days. The hotel is well located and not that far from the airport. There are also some shops close by where you can purchase alcohol and food - far cheaper than in the hotel.  The reception however is chaotic. There seems to be a sharp division of labour between the 'receptionist' the 'concierge' and the 'cashier'. The receptionist does the checking in and out but will not help with other queries. My luggage was mislaid by the airline but the receptionists refused to enquire at the airport if it had arrived. This was the concierge's job even though the concierge was not on duty when I arrived and took most of the following day off. When he did turn up he was not that helpful and I had to take a taxi to the airport to collect my luggage. Other hotels arranged for the bags to be delivered.  The staff in other parts of the hotel were friendly and helpful. They are being let down by their colleagues on reception.  My suggestion to the management is to send all the reception staff on a training course on how to provide good service in a hotel In the meantime be prepared for the chaos at reception.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h1st0ry

Le Meridien N'Fis,MsAisha wrote a review Mar 2013,30,Customer Service is a total Disservice,The grounds are beautiful. The rooms are nice with clean comfortable bedding. But the service at this hotel is the worst I've ever experienced at a hotel calling itself 5 star.    My husband and I stayed at this hotel during a tour of Morocco. It was supposed to be the highlight of our hotel stops. It has lovely gardens a beautiful pool pretty good restaurants and a convenient location close to the huge market in Marrakech. Everything needed to support a high star rating. The problem is that nobody told the staff that excellent service is what sets a 5 star hotel apart from the rest.    The reception desk staff if aloof bordering on rude with no apparent interest in interacting with (or even smiling at) quests checking in. The two women stationed at the desk stand there looking at and shuffling paper constantly and when someone comes to the desk to check in they act like it is an annoyance (rather than their job). The cashier is the slowest I've ever dealt with stoping to answer the phone talk to other staff walk away from the desk - all while he keeps you waiting to cash out. He didn't seem to care as the line got longer and longer. The duty manager could not speak or understand English so you had to communicate with him through the concierge (who all the rest of the staff seemed to rely upon to communicate with English speaking guests). The concierge seemed to know nothing about the spas or hamams in Marrakech so I ended up having to do internet research to find one close by (hint to the concierge - you may want to inform yourself about this for future guests).    The magnetic door card seemed to work only once and after using it you may have to have it reprogrammed the next time you wanted to use it. This would be forgivable if you didn't have to walk from your room through the gardens to get back to the front desk every time. Certainly not senior friendly.    Internet service worked 2 out of my 3 day stay and getting a refund of the 80 dirhams (about $10) I paid in advance took a 20 minute wait on the cashiers line a diversion to the concierge desk a wait for the non english speaking manager and a revisit to the cashier. I'm glad it was only $10!    It is a shame that a hotel with such a nice physical plant is marred by terrible service.

Youseff the legendary concierge was perfect in every respect and they have a real gem with this long serving gent. Breakfasts are good with plenty of choice for every taste. Pool is very well kept and loungers are comfortable. Poolside restaurant is very good as well. Very well kept gardens with a great array of plants. The key aspect which we liked is that the hotel is situated outside the mad hustle and bustle of the medina but still close enough to enjoy without feeling remote from the activities plus we liked the space afforded by the hotel grounds where we could relax after our sightseeing trips.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KUMALO_10

Le Meridien N'Fis,bluegum T wrote a review Feb 2013,40,A Good Choice,A most pleasant stay. Courteous and attentive staff with the resplendent consierge Youseff and his front-of-house colleagues smoothing our way. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of taxis picking up from the Hotel. Whilst some local cabbies are honest many others are scurrilous and cynical rogues. Given the chance they will over-charge hugely and those that do have meters don't use them. So do seek the advice of Meridien's staff as to amounts and agree the fare before boarding. Some taxi drivers either didn't know or didn't care about our destinations. Twice we were dropped by the souk and fed to young male 'guides'. Wary of web tales of robbery by these types on the first occasion we were reluctant to follow the adolescant through the souk's dark and narrow passages. But our fears were ill-founded. Another time the taxi dropped us at a souk entrance far from where we wanted to be and a youth realising we weren't going to be suckered told us 'Just turn first left and it's down there.' As luck would have it before we started off a passing chirpie chap recognised us. He was one of The Meridien's gardeners and eagerly insisted on taking us all the way to our destination near the far side of the souk. His helpful attitude was typical of the Hotel's staff and we were most grateful to him for his intervention.    Whilst it's great to experience the hustle and bustle of Marrakech to have comfort and sanity in the Meridien a little away from the constant hubbub of the centre was also a pleasure. Lunches by the hotel pool were of a high standard and very reasonably priced. We particularly liked the pizzas with their thin light light bases.    We enjoyed the evening entertainment in the bar. We saw no evidence of bird mess described by a previous reviewer. In fact the small birds about the well cared for hotel gardens were a delight.

Le Meridien N'Fis,herzog_fan wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Comfortable stay with helpful staff,I recently stayed for 6 days at this hotel and had a very positive experience overall. Upon my initial arrival I was not very impressed with my room because as mentioned in other reviews the rooms and furnishings appear somewhat careworn around the edges and could use some maintenance. During the course of our stay however my wife and I came to appreciate the hotel as a lovely place to relax after full days of exploring the hectic busy city of Marrakech. The courtyard and gardens are beautiful and well-maintained and the staff in particular the head porter Said are helpful and welcoming.    Two other caveats to mention -- first as other reviews have indicated the hotel is approximately a 15-20 minute walk from both Gueliz/Ville Nouvelle and the medina/Djemaa al-Fna. While we personally had no issues with walking to either of these locations the walking routes are alongside some very busy stretches of road and could be too noisy or long for some visitors to enjoy. Second I would recommend that visitors avoid eating the snack food served in the hotel bar which was poorly prepared and extremely overpriced. (But then again if you order steak sandwiches or pizzas in Marrakech you probably shouldn't expect much.) Visitors are far better off eating elsewhere in the city although again that would generally entail a long walk or a taxi ride from the hotel.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington, DC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herzog_fan

It is not by any means the newest hotel on the block literally. However what you get here is a well established Moroccan hotel. The staff are friendly from the greeting at the door to the final wave off. Yes people smoke in the lobby and it does look a little worn in places but this is not Las Vegas. This is Morocco and smoking is allowed. When you go to the Souk (a short walk) they cook and feed you in the open and it looks to the Westerner awful. I strongly recommend you to step over the initial feeling of ""i will get disentry eating there."" and try it. They have cooked this way for a thousand years and it tastes good. The mint tea brewed in a drum on a hand cart is good. Back to the hotel. Rooms are lacking of a good air conditioning unit but I have never been bitten by mozzies there.

I had a large room that was thoughtfully laid out but rather tired furniture and design. The red and black furniture may have been trendy in the 1970s but it left much to be desired in a hotel claiming as many stars as this. Desk space was good but was negated by the poor internet connection (although to be fair I suspect this is a problem with the telephone company/ISP and not the hotel; I have stayed in half a dozen places in Marrakech and none had decent internet). The bed was comfortable and both the bedroom and the bathroom were both good. The room was clean. I have noticed complaints from other reviewers about the breakfast. Possibly it has improved since they wrote their reviews possibly they are just carping (or possibly I have lower standards) but I didn't find anything wrong with the breakfast at all. There was good variety you could get a Moroccan flat bread fresh off the griddle (lovely in a slightly chewy sort of way). The balance between Moroccan food and Western food was reasonable. The fruit juice was on the weak side but there was fresh fruit including oranges available. So from me no complaints about breakfast. I didn't eat any other meals there so can't comment on the other restaurants.    Overall: OK but for the price could do better.    And a warning: the walls between rooms are paper thin.

Le Meridien N'Fis,kristtov wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Good value but a bit old,My girlfriend and I are both SPG platinum and decided to stay at the Meridien for our two days in Marrakech. As was mentioned in other reviews the hotel is definitely a bit tired. What disturbed us the most was the fact that so many people were smoking in the main lobby. When you have been driving for a while and are looking for a relaxing experience in the hotel this first impression can be very disturbing. We got upgraded to a suite which was nicely appointed even though we did not have any view. The restaurants in the hotel were nice and the breakfast buffet had a lot of great options. Lunch by the pool is a bit overpriced for the quality of the food though. The concierge desk tried to be helpful but they definitely tailor to a richer clientele. When we asked for cheaper options we saw that we lost some of the concierge's interest. The location is pretty good and you can get to the medina in 20 minutes (walking). Overall a good stay but not up to the best SPG standards.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"San Mateo, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristtov
Le Meridien N'Fis,ptripsussex wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Reasonable value - bit tired,Starting with the good - the staff are great and welcoming with special mention for Said who could not have done more. The concierge provided really useful advice. Breakfast is good with differences on some days. The rooms are just ok. We were there in January so the air con was switched off and only blew hot air regardless of setting - this caused all sorts of problems with the desk and engineer but in the end was sorted when explained + mobile unit provided (which in the end wasn't needed) However if you are on the ground floor and can't leave your window wide open you would have problems. Restaurants are not so good - the italian is ok but pricey - the flagship Moroccan was very poor indeed and the staff and checkout staff did not respond to our complaints about how poor it was - unfortunate and expensive mistake. The gardens and pool area are lovely and provide a great respite from the old town. All that being said the price was good and overall value for money and we would use again.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sussex UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptripsussex
Le Meridien N'Fis,Bharath_Raman wrote a review Jan 2013,40,"Dated 5-star, but worth the money",First the bad things: you can see worn carpets breakfast is decent but not 5-start material.  Now for the good things:  If you snag a good deal it is well worth it. The rooms were nice the service was excellent. the head porter Said is indeed an amazing person. Always acknowledges everybody around has a discussion with you to tell you about the hotel and the surroundings. I thought the check in people folks were competent and the Mediterranean restaurant suggestion we got from the Concierge was amazing (can't remember the name but a 5 minute walk from the hotel). We had to ask the concierge if we needed to make the reservations (something he should typically ask in a good 5-star). We also had someone come over to get the two single beds together to form a double bed. The person showed up promptly and did a good job but again a really good 5-start would have had this done head of time.Think of it as a really good 4-star hotel.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bharath_Raman

It is a fantastic spot to relax in the fabulous pool and sunbath like on a tropical island. On the other hand it is not very far away to Medina where you can find wonderful spirite of Marrakech. We had a club room and it was great. Everyday we had rose petals all over the room which was so romantic. Bed was heavenly comfortable like in all Starwood hotels. The best was of course Youssef the concierge!

First occassion when hubby was working locally he stayed for a couple of months and I visited and was absolutely delighted with how everyone treated the guests from the doorman to the chamber maids people could not have been more helpful. I returned to spend a birthday visit there with some girlfriends and again we were treated extremely well......all 4 of us loved it. The rooms are nice and spacious the communal areas lovely the pool side restaurant and double beds for lounging r are great.......I cannot fault it. Marrakesh is great for eating out but if you are not in the mood for venturing to the old town the hotel restaurant is also great as is room service......the location of this hotel is very convenient its in the new town but walkable to the Medina/Djma el Fna........if I dont stay in a Riad then this is the hotel I will always choose to return to and I have visited many hotels in Marakesh.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anniesreviews

Le Meridien N'Fis,scubadvr2001 wrote a review Dec 2012,10,Extremely Disappointing!!!!,I am a very experienced traveller having flown more than 4 million miles while visiting more than 60 countries. This hotel was recommended by a travel agent who we will never use again. This hotel is a disgrace to the Starwood hotel Group. It needs a complete makeover. This place looks like it has not been updated since the 60's. We tried 4 of the restaurants in the hotel and they were all well below par. The service was terrible and in two of the restaurants the meals were so over cooked you could have used them to sole your shoes. The pool area has a large sign prohibiting glass objects on the deck however anyone ordering water receives it in 1.5 litre glass bottles. We had to wait 20 minutes to get change for 100 Dh from the cashier because she said the hotel had no change! We visited several other hotels in Marrakech and found the level of service and attention to detail far superior to what we experienced at the Meridien. If we had not paid for our stay in advance we would have relocated to another hotel a much more enjoyable holiday in Marrakech.    Do yourself a favour and stay elsewhere.

Everything was good for us. Especially we were so happy with the bed and warm room on this cold nights in this season. We also stayed another Riad. It was beautiful but we were very cold in the nights  too noisy to sleep and difficult to come back to Riad by walk. So we recommend to sleep outside of Medina like Le Meridien and take a taxi for Medina for day and come back to calm and warm environment by taxi is best idea to explore Marrakesh we believe.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Stuart A wrote a review Dec 2012,10,Well below par for a Starwood property. AVOID!,"As a Starwood Preferred Guest I was looking forward to coming to this hotel after staying at Accor hotels in three other Moroccan cities. What a let down. This tired old workhorse of a hotel is in need of a total makeover and the staff and management need to be re-trained or replaced.    ROOMS: tired broken bits and pieces ugly 90s furniture. Bathroom not bad though and beds are comfy. Only 3 English channels on TV.    LOCATION: it's true what other reviewers have said the medina and the new town are both a good 20 minute walk away but we didn't mind this.    COMMON AREAS: free wifi in reception does not work but we managed to convince the surly piece of work to give us another free code that did work. Otherwise we would have had to pay $40 to use wifi in the hotel for the week.    Carpet in hallways is all torn and stained.    Bird poo in all the light fittings and on chairs in breakfast room from all the sparrows flying around.    Guest computers simply do not work. Foyer can smell really badly of smoke.    Pool area very tired broken tiles sun lounges.    BREAKFAST: Pretty good nice freshly made omlettes. Surly service (see service below).    BAR: a joke. You have to pay 10dh to play pool. They play the same cd of 5 songs on repeat and seem confused when we ask if they have any other music. Colored lit up bars that look like they belong at a Vegas pool bar. Rude staff. Overpriced drinks.    STAFF: Generally rude uninterested sometimes they even ignore you.    Example 1: I passed a staff member I assume was a manager near the pool and said 'bonjour' to him and he actually grunted at me.    Example 2: I went to use the toilet near the pool terrace restaurant and one of the waiters is standing up using the toilet with the door open. When he sees me he closes the door. I go in to use the toilet after him and there is pee all over the seat and it's not flushed.    Example 3: There seems to be an overkill of managers in suits in the breakfast room and i hate to say this but they basically ignore non-Moroccan guests and fawn over Moroccan guests. I told one of them that there was a bug in the juice and they just fished it out there and then. At least take it to the kitchen and give guests the impression you are replacing it.    Example 4: i asked the cashier for some small change (ie 1 dh coins). His response: ""no i don't have"". But I could see heaps in his drawer.    Example 5: We start a game of pool 5 mins later the bar staff are shutting blinds turn off music and stand around glaring at us.    I should point out that the housekeeping staff and doormen were always friendly. The problem seems to be the food and beverage reception and management.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Stuart A wrote a review Dec 2012,40,Business and pleasure in Marrakeck,I'm not quite sure when the other reviews were written but it's now December 2012 and I think most of the issues raised have now been resolved. When I arrived at the hotel I was booked in for 6 days - 3 for business and 3 for pleasure. I had arranged for my wife to join me at the end of my business meetings for a short weekend break.  From the moment I arrived I was made to feel very welcome and was given a glass of traditional mint tea while I waited to be checked in. The reception staff were very courteous and attentive.  I dined in all of the restaurants and have to say that the food was excellent. The waiting staff were both professional and attentive and the entertainment whether it was belly dancing or the guitar and box duo were first class.  When my wife arrived on the 4th day the head porter Said welcomed her to the hotel with a single red rose freshly brewed mint tea and bathed her hands in rose water - she was amazed at the welcome. When we arrived in our room the chambermaid had spread rose petal on the bed - yet another special touch.  I could go on and on about how how wonderful my stay has been at this hotel but I may be in danger of making the previous reviewers vomit. Things must have changed in a very big way at this hotel because despite being a bit old and tired the experience was more than I expected and the service was brilliant.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Lucy_CA wrote a review Dec 2012,20,"Rundown, old property",As an SPG Platinum guest I travel a lot for work and pleasure and this property would fall at the bottom of the list of hotels I have stayed. Before you even walk into reception you see the fountain in front that is not functioning there is not even water in the fountain's chipped basin. Rooms are old towels are so old they are grey color A/C didn't work no screens on the windows/balcony doors the moment you open window you have tons of flies in the room. Breakfast was of average quality (omelette station saves it from being below average) orange juice was so diluted with water you could never tell it is freshly squeezed (which is what the sign tells you); birds are flying in the breakfast room sitting on tables very unsanitary. Spa was a joke and it was so rundown (locker rooms dirty sinks wet sauna with chipped tiles and ceiling) that I am surprised they can even charge for it! With the exception of Said the porter everybody else didn't exude the attitude they were happy to have you; hotel has a van but the amount they charge to take you to the airport that is very close is way above even the rate of the taxis at the airport. If you choose to walk to Medina it is about 15 -20 min walk would have been so easy for the hotel to offer a complimentary ride and make many people happy. We didn't try hotel restaurants (didn't find the menu exciting) but if you walk about 10 min towards the Congress Hall there are several new restaurants on the same side of the road as hotel all reasonably priced. Inner courtyard gardens were nice and it is the only good thing about this hotel. We left hotel earlier to stay at a different place and will not recommend this hotel to anybody - they need to at least maintain the property (it is not difficult to buy new towels and linens if you can't do a renovation) and more importantly train stuff to project hospitality to guests.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Pasadena, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucy_CA

Le Meridien N'Fis,EveryCountryBy50 wrote a review Nov 2012,10,Awful,This place was so bad on so many levels. I am an SPG Platinum member. No upgrade during my stay that's understandable but charging for wifi? It's as if they had never herd of the SPG program. The room which I was given had an unbelievably strong odor of mildew. This after spending 20 seconds in an elevator with the doorman who was kind enough to help us with our luggage but seemed not to have taken a shower in days. The wifi in the lobby did not work at all. The location - other reviwers noted how it was quiet and had an oasis-like feel ... this is true however it is quite a distance from all the sights. We were so dissatisfied that we switched to a riad in the walled city after one night.

Le Meridien N'Fis,LBM04 wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Fantastic location and wonderful staff,This is a great hotel in a perfect location. Being only 15-20 minutes walk to the medina we had all the excitement of being in the city but could escape to the oasis of calm that this hotel offers. The staff were all excellent and the facilities were all that would would expect from a Starwood Hotel. Youseff Head Concierge was incredibly helpful and tactfully suggested alternatives to the overpriced and touristy restaurants I had picked from the guidebook instead pointing us to some lovely and inexpensive places with good authentic Morrocan food. He also booked a wonderful day tour in a 4x4 up into the valleys of the Atlas Mountains which was great. Both Yousef and Said (the excellent Head Porter) have been with the hotel for over 20 years and they both take pride in the service the hotel delivers....and it shows! As to the facilities on offer I upgraded to a suite using my Starwoord Suite points and this gave me two large rooms (Bedroom and sitting room) with a enormous bathroom and additional WC. I had a great view with partial views of the mountains and full view of the lovely hotel gardens. The only drawback was the loud noise from the nightclub so I would suggest earplugs which thankfully I always take with me when I travel. Breakfast was a buffet and they had a good selection of hot and cold food on offer. The Morrocan restaurant was very good and a good price for a hotel and the bar does a good cocktail. I had no time to enjoy the Spa but their services seemed very comprehensive so I will definitely try this next time.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Alison W wrote a review Nov 2012,50,"Friendly, comfortable hotel with lovely facilities just a short walk to the Medina",The welcome you receive when you arrive is matched by the helpfulness of the staff and the lovely facilities at this hotel. I had a newly renovated room which was comfortable and had its own patio.    Said brought my bags to the room and showed me useful things like how to open the patio door find the hidden light switch (on the head board) and warned me about the very small step into the bathroom which I haven't tripped over once! I have seen him many times and he is always friendly and remembers my name which is the same with all the staff in reception.    The concierge Youssef deserves a special mention. His reputation on the hotel website for being very helpful and making fabulous suggestions is very much deserved. He organised the minibus collection from the airport before our trip sorted out two restaurants booked us a 3 valley trip into the mountains and got us a guide for the medina/souks on our first day and every thing was excellent. Defnitely make contact with him before your arrival and he will have things ready for you.    The moroccan restaurant onsite was excellent. We did not try the Italian (why would we when we are in Marrakech?) and we also had a pizza in the bar and some food by the pool all of which were perfectly fine.

We were on a tour and had no choice on the hotels. We were hoping that after so many complaints something had been done.    The rooms were large and well appointed but starting to get ratty. They were clean for the most part but there were some areas that could have used a bit more care. Towels were good but a bit used and not completely white. There was a refrigerator in the room and a safe. You had to pay for WI-FI.    The breakfast was good with a wide selection if repetitive; they had exactly the same things every day. There were cats allowed to run around and birds were flying about. The sconces on the walls were very dirty and provided their breakfast.    Lovely pool area and gardens but since the weather was very bad for our entire stay we did not use them. We had dinner in the bar area since they don’t open the restaurant until 7PM and we were hungry. It was expensive and not very good. Avoid the appetizers; the pizza and the stake sandwich were eatable the rest were frozen and came cold and uncooked.    You can walk to the Medina in about 20 minutes. We could not find any food shops around to buy sodas or water so we had to carry them back from the Medina. You are not supposed to drink the water but the hotel does not leave a note in the room and does not provide free drinkable water.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Pete/Fran wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Excellent value in Marrakech,I last reviewed this place 2 years ago and have just been again for a week.The Meridien is a pretty big hotel situated about a 20 min pleasant stroll from the Medina (old walled city). Not only is it a good choice for those who want to enjoy the frenetic life inside the traditional city of Marrakech and yet be able to escape to some calm and European standards in the evening but it represents great value for money. It has large green & beautiful gardens with fountains playing and an enormous swimming pool. Although the Meridien chain used to be French owned its now part of the American 'Starwood' group and there are lots of good deals on their web-site such as the '6 nights for the price of 4' which we got. You'll pay a fraction of the price required at some of the posh riads in the Medina where often the walls are so thin you have to keep your voice at a whisper. And yet you can still go to the riads for great dinners and return to this place for a good solid bedroom with great bath facilities and a really good buffet breakfast. The hotel is a tiny bit tired and in need of investment but not intrusively so. Contrary to previous comments we found the staff unfailingly courteous. The downsides? There could be more UK channels on the TV system.The housekeeping staff are so attentive that they seem to be knocking on the door almost hourly with bed changes towel service mini-bar checks and so on (but the 'do not disturb' sign eventually worked!). The service in the pleasant restaurant is painfully slow with often a 15 min wait even for drinks requests after being seated.......they really MUST deal with this.The airy nicely designed breakfast room with fabulous buffet and omelettes and pancakes made to order in front of you really must do something about the sparrows which fly around and leave droppings on the lamp-shades! But those are minor points. We recommend this place as somewhere to base yourself at a good price whilst enjoying this wonderful city.

MAD24 per night per room. In general it's a ok hotel with basic standards.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Rene K wrote a review Oct 2012,40,A standard 'five-star' in Morocco (four-star in UK) but was good.,We stayed here for 6-nights in September after previously staying at the Kenzi Farah and seeing their reviews had gone down. We got a good deal on the MasterCard stay-6-pay4 which meant this hotel worked out as £400 for 6 nights including breakfast (very good value.)    Breakfast was great a buffet with lots to chose from. Food in general was very good in the hotel we ate there every lunch time. Some things were decent some things were not. We were disappointed in the salads as they were very stingy with the chicken and very generous with the lettuce! Everything else was good. We didn't eat in the Moroccan restaurant as for about £15 less per person you can eat like a king at the night markets (these are safe to eat at despite peoples fears!)    The room was lovely and spacious. We did pay for a standard room but actually looked like the updated version when we arrived (going by the photos on the website) so not sure if they upgraded us or not? Was very nice anyway. Bathroom nice and large although as standard with Morocco no ventilation which meant each time you shower you either need to leave the door open or create a home-sauna! Beds were to-die-for comfortable. And (as bad as it sounds being in Morocco) we did watch television a couple of nights after a tiring day sunbathing and market trekking and they have a very good movie channel in English :)    Lobby of the hotel is beautiful and they give you the Moroccan welcome of mint tea which is always nice. The pool area is really lovely and quiet. I'm not sure if that is because we were there out of school holidays but there was always a sun lounger with our name on it. I would return here and also recommend to friends and family.    TIP: If you get a little tired of cous-cous there is a fab little Indian opposite in the Albatros. Hotel (You have to walk through this other hotel to get to it. It is on the other side of the pool on the left handside.) There was no-one in this restaurant when we went. It is massive and newly refurbished. The food was delicious and a really Moroccan/Indian blend. The Biriyani was amazing.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rene_555
Le Meridien N'Fis,SarahB B wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Very nice pool and garden but human resource issue,I would like to say that we enjoyed to stay at N'Fis It has a very nice pool and an incredible garden. It is just a shame how the personnel is unqualified.  Here is a couple of what we noticed:  - We asked for our complementary drink and some litlle staff at least 4 times and when they decided to bring us what we asked for on the morning at 22h00. We were in bed... and they knocked and enter the room??? really ?  - you can ask for anything but you have to wait and keep asking  - The room was not very well cleaned sometimes after the cleaning it's smells like a weit dog because they probably use a not well dried floorcloth but it happened to us just once sometimes they forgot to peak the garbage on the balcony.  - if you stay at this hotel avoid to dine there it was very average for the price the service was very long (I suspect that it was because of some soccer play..).  But we enjoyed to stay at the pool and we took some club sandwiches and simple things we were happy. But dont take their salad.  The staff was in general nice but still have some strange attitude like trying to proove omethin I don't know what it is. I mean when you are at le Meridien in Paris or Munich or so... The staff are professional it is their job to give the best service and that's all but at Meridien Marrakesh it is as if they have to show you that you are not better then them some attitude that may be the French tourism has manage to bring there.  - We had the breakfast at this hotel it was also good for the value but you can see that it is just not good managed. There is so much staff looking at the roof or taking your plats even if your not done yet. But no one take initiative to bring your cafe or help with bringing you a chair for a baby if you needed and instead of having one person to collect the room numbers they give the bill and all the signing to everybody. SOthe customer have to do the verification for them  - The lobby of the hotel is really nice  We enjoyed our stay because it is a very nice hotel it was pleasant if you make apart the staff.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahBB581

There was an issue with my being booked into a smoking room I was told by Splendia ""I would have to contact the hotel as all the non smoking rooms Splendia had reserved were booked."" The reservationist quickly resolved the issue. Our room over looked the garden that looked like an oasis probably a 2-3 minute walk to reception. The beds were quite comfortable the rooms were spotless(although they could meet the same high design standards of the rest of the hotel) towels and linen cleaned on daily basis the maids and staff friendly and polite. The Concierge helped plan our day arranging guides and giving us helpful direction on how to navigate the Souks on our own and what was appropriate cab fare. Swimming pools lovely and always plenty of shade and beds. The buffet breakfast tasty. Drinks and food are a little expensive but service and quality excellent. The mint tea that we enjoyed in the lobby after an excursion excellent. Location - approx 15 min walk to main square with pavements and generally well lit plenty of taxis but walk down street for a few 100 m's generally cheaper. The ""Big Red Bus"" has a stop outside hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Bayareavenus wrote a review Oct 2012,40,"Great location, friendly/helpful staff, great breakfast",My stay was very pleasent. I found the staff to be very helpful and many spoke English. The hotel is situated just close enough to the Medina that you can cheaply take a taxi or a 15 minute walk in but when you're ready to leave you can rest without the chaos and smog of the Medina. It is situated on a strip of hotels with chic cafe's and new restaraunts which is great because the hotel restaraunt is way overpriced and fairly average in taste and you're taking your chances eating the medina.    The garden is beautiful and lovely to relax in and the breakfast buffet is great even if you have a wheat allergy.  I only give 4 stars because the rooms are fairly standard. No decór or anything fancy but they kept it very very clean. Literally wiped the floors down with bleach every day. Overall I would recommend N'Fis to anyone travelling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brooklyn, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bayareavenus

This miserable place however does not do justice to Starwood nor Meridien at all in fact we fear it will destroy the name on it's own and if nothing is done. They should very quickly check this out because clients who choose the N'fis on their brand's name will not be encouraged to do so again anywhere else.    The whole hotel is an ugly worn down depressing affair the staff is not even pleasant (rarely seen in gentle Morocco) the reception staff is the worst unwelcomming sometimes outright unpolitet.    The breakfast served in an ugly barrack style room is not only miserable it's bad. What a way to start the Day !    This is the sort of place that makes you want to move out as quickly as possible. Which we did. Marrakesh a city of good taste and refined style has excellent hotels and Riads. Avoid this one. Don't be tempted by the low price it only reflects low quality.

Le Meridien N'Fis,GPeto wrote a review Oct 2012,30,"a ""revised"" review",I must admit this is the first time after nearly 120 reviews that I have re-called a review and I am re-writing it again.    The reason for this is the unprecedented customer care that I have witnessed today. You may say (and you would be correct to do so) that the hotel hates a bad review on tripadvisor and they would do anything to remove it..... but its very rare to see a hotel management to pro-actively seek the customer and discuss the issues.    In my fist review I was truly upset about the following:  -quality of the standard rooms  -poor quality of the breakfast for a 5 star hotel  -slow internet    There are some positive items as well:  -nice pool area  -pretty garden  -very good dinning options (the moroccan dinner was excellent)  -good concierge service    Most of the times you will find hotel managers writing some really lame response to a review where they hardly acknowledge any of the shortcomings. Today the rooms division manager Mr. Jamal and the chief concierge Mr. Mamouni asked to meet with me to discuss and talk about my feedback. They were very open indeed and I feel positive that my complaints where not only heard but im sure they will try and resolve the issues I found.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Budapest, Hungary",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GPeto
Le Meridien N'Fis,redwinefinedine wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Do it!,When we arrived we were escorted to our room. The cleanliness of this room was incredible. The room was spotless and the housekeeper for our section which we saw daily was a delight and ALWAYS smiling and waving. Such a friendly person. My only regret is that I do not know her name. She worked between the dates 28th September – 1st October in the section of the hotel where room 046 is. We were recommended some fabulous restaurants and places to explore by the fabulous head concierge Youseff who was extremely hospitable and helpful attended to our every need and exceeded our expectation in the service of concierge.  Our terrace by our room was a welcome haven with grounds which were so well maintained and fresh looking. This was a real treat.  All in all our stay was fantastic. Not to mention that Marrakech is a city of wonder and our recommendations took us from an ally of clay houses into a riad style restaurant with the most magnificent water features and roof top terrace overlooking the Medina. (food was brill! See La Foundouk) If you are wondering where to go and are still considering different destinations. DONT! The blow dry that I had on day two was incredible by a male and cost around 15GBP so reasonable and you could really see just how skilled the gentleman was with hair. Well done.  I would recommend a shisha at the end of the day. Grape and mint are tasty! In the fabulous cloth covered tent. Live music every night to boot.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Françoise R wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Morocan Style,"Well it al starts with your arrival at the airport. The hotel is asking for outrageaous rates for transfer... Negociate with local taxis outside the airport you will get much better rates maybe not a limousine but if transport is all that matter then you are better off taking the local taxi ... Once at the hotel let the doorman argue with the taxi driver about the trip fare ... you pay what you agreed for. The rooms are OK... don't look too close though since some things in the rooms have experienced some quick repairs or painting... but fair enough clean and after all well maintained.  Do not leave any coints (whatever currency it is) anywhere in the room ... you might not find it when you return from breakfast... this hotel does magic ! Breakfast ... well on the country side with birds flying in the breakfast room. A little dissapointed since we were expecting more ""morocan"" style dishes. It is more continental oriented but all in all very good and a lot to eat.  The hotel is a not quite located in the heart of Marakech however a minute walk will bring you right in the middle of Marakech Do not try to go to the tourist office in the weekend IT IS CLOSED !!! at least during low season.  Little discussion at check out however quickly solved. We did enjoy our stay however expected more out of the hotel ... sitll a little disapointment.

Le Meridien N'Fis,andreasummers wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Beautiful respite from the hustle and bustle of the medina,My experience was excellent at Le Meridien. The arrival experience was like nothing I had ever encountered before - I was warmly and genuinely welcomed by the doorman/bellman had my luggage swept away as soon as I entered and was encouraged to relax in the lobby. I was brought a cup of the traditional Moroccan mint tea and my room check-in was done entirely from my comfy spot on the sofa! It was such a relief to me as I had been travelling on nearly no-sleep for about 20 hours. The room was comfortable if a bit bare but the view of the grounds was fantastic and area we were located in was very peaceful. This hotel is a true oasis and such a joy to return to every day after sensory overload in the medina! We dined at the Moroccan restaurant which was great. The outdoor tent lounge and the indoor bar were also amazing and frequented on more than one occasion during our 4 night stay. The spa was incredible but we predictably found it a bit challenging to communicate with the spa attendants (a lot of elementary French and gesturing was needed!). I would gladly return to this hotel again and I would recommend it to any nervous first-timer to Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lakeland, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreasummers
Le Meridien N'Fis,HappyDazeScotland wrote a review Sep 2012,50,An Oasis!,My husband and I are just back from a 7 night stay in the Meridien N'Fis and had a wonderful time. We had emailed the hotel beforehand to request a pickup at the airport and that all went very smoothly I'm sure a taxi would have been cheaper but we just wanted the security of knowing we would get to the hotel ok on our first time in Marrakech.  The check-in staff were efficient but not overly friendly however the porter that took our cases to our room was lovely and while we filled in our checkin details brought us some mint tea.  I had requested a quiet room on a higher floor and our request was met we were at the end of a corridor on the 2nd floor and didn't hear a thing and slept very soundly. Our room was lovely with lots of space and kept very clean.  The pool area was fantastic with lots of sunloungers and a very attentive towel attendant. All the other public areas were very clean and the gardens were nice for a wander about. Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice and fresh omlettes cooked to order and the pastries were to die for!  The location for us was perfect a 20-30 minute stroll right in to the centre of the Medina through a very safe area we walked in and back at various times of the day and night and always felt completely safe.  Check out is 12pm but our airport pick up wasn't till 5.30pm so the hotel let us stay in the room until 1pm so we could get some extra sunbathing in during the morning then there is a room where we were able to leave our cases in the afternoon while we went to the Medina. Upon returning to the hotel to collect our cases and change for the flight we were offered free use of a room to wash/change in which was a nice and unexpected touch.  We will hopefully return to Marrakech one day and will definitely stay in the Meridien if we do.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melton Mowbray, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyDazeScotland

Lovely rooms staff polite and helpful.Pool was perfect to take a dip in after shopping and as soon as you arrived a very nice man brought you a pool towel and laid it out for you. You have to remember that 5* in some countries does not equal 5* in others but for the price you could not complain! The breakfast was ample with lots of choice I'd recommend the Morrocan pancakes with honey - they were delicious. The massage I had was very relaxing my friend had the full works including a scrub and she was glowing after so I'd recommend that if you find the time. The only thing I'd have to say that was not great was one of the resturant staff on our last night we were all a little jaded so decided to stay in the hotel for a bite to eat.

Some problems still exist but their revised (reduced) price & the overall Le Meridien brand makes this a good choice for many travellers. The staff are fantastic - attentive friendly and helpful. The rooms haven't been updated since my last visit and while they are fine this isn't the most luxurious Le Meridien. Our room had a few minor shortcomings - there was a long black hair on the handtowel when we checked in (not ours). The black furniture shows a degree of wear and tear and is unforgiving showing dust/grime. We experienced water pressure issues and temperature variation in the shower. The air conditioning was very weak although the hotel responded quickly and sent an engineer very promptly when we mentioned this problem. All in all - very minor issues not generally expected at a Meridien property but the staff attentiveness makes up for it. The restaurants & bars are excellent and the pool area is superb.

Le Meridien N'Fis,CCC_wanderlust wrote a review Sep 2012,40,An oasis,We stayed three nights at Le Meridien N’fis in August on my friend’s Starwood points at the end of a weeklong trip to Morocco. On the first night she also used her points to pay for a room for our private driver/guide as it had been a long journey from Merzouga that included a stop by Moroccan police 21 km. from Marrakech due to a broken headlight.    Le Meridien N’fis is opulently decorated and the front desk staff were welcoming when we arrived late. Our room was clean and spacious. When the internet code provided stopped working the front desk staff was more than happy to walk me through reconnecting even when it was already past midnight!    On our first day we woke up late and had lunch at the restaurant near the pool. I appreciated that the kitchen staff accommodated my request of grilled salmon vs. the baked one on the menu. It was tasty and just what I wanted.    The breakfast buffet offered a diverse selection of standard breakfast items and Moroccan fare. It was a nice way to start the day.    On our last night we had dinner at Al-Bikra the onsite Moroccan restaurant. The restaurant was beautifully decorated; it was as if you are dining inside a tent but with air conditioning. The only thing that “destroyed” the ambience was that soccer was on both TV screens but since the TVs were on mute I was able to ignore them. There were a couple of people around us using a hookah but I did not find the smoke intrusive and I saw that the attendants were very prompt at replacing the shisha. I enjoyed both the chicken tajine and chicken pastilla.    The Marrakech Bus Touristique stops right in front of Le Meridien and proved to be a convenient hassle-free (as in no persistent vendors and fake guides) way to get an overview of Marrakech.  Marrakech was my least favorite Moroccan city due to a couple of unpleasant experiences at Jemaa el Fna but Le Meridien N’fis was a welcome oasis and proved to be my favorite thing about Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Oxon Hill, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCC_wanderlust

Le Meridien N'Fis,Harish_1973 wrote a review Sep 2012,30,A good hotel but could do better,Overall the hotel is good. Rooms are large and clean. Though I never had dinner at the restaurant here I had breakfast and lunch for 3 days and food was good. Lots to choose from. My only complaint is there should have been some more local stuff for us to sample (breakfast only had Moroccan soup and pancakes). The gym is just ok- no fancy stuff quite small actually. There were no towels / glasses each time I went (total 3 visits). I am surprised that the hotel does not provide even a single bottle of complimentary drinking water in such warm weather only provides tea / coffee maker on request (and they don't make it explicit so unless you pester the front desk you are unlikely to get one). The wifi is good but rates are pretty high! The exchange rate is not very good at the hotel- and they charge are not transparent at the commission they charge. For instance I changed $100 @$1=8.574 MAD and received only 850 MAD- rest was commission I was told (and surprisingly no receipts)! Not that this makes a huge difference for small transactions but will if the sum was large!  Room slippers shoe shine etc are also provided only on request. So in all lots of cost cutting going on! I would give this hotel a 3.5 but since there is no scope to award 0.5 I am only awarding 3 (my commission!).,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harish_1973

The swimming pool area and gardens are nice not beautiful but nice. There are several restaurants in the hotel but the food is not so great (hard to find snacks) and the included breakfast is trying to be good but isn't quite getting it right. I scheduled a pedicure at the salon/spa and they told me a different time than they wrote down. They honored my appointment anyway and it was a weird experience which was uncomfortable but a great pedicure actually! I would recommend the hotel overall mostly because of the comfortable rooms with nice bathrooms but be advised of the numerous extra charges (they compell you to make a donation to UNESCO at checkout and charge for wifi).,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423LisaH423
Le Meridien N'Fis,FoxySwanseaUK wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Comfortable hotel in good location,Just got back from a three night stay at the Le Meridien.  I found the hotel to be a calm oasis away from the madness and heat of the Medina area.  There was a lovely spacious reception area with very efficient front of house staff with a speedy check-in  Our room was very comfortable with the air conditioning working perfectly even though outside temperature was 46 degrees. The room was also serviced to an excellent standard.  There was a good variety of items at breakfast with a nice mix of Moroccan and European cuisine special mention to the “omelette” lady she was fab!  The bar was nicely decorated although prices were a little steep £5 for a small beer!  The pool and surrounding area were well kept although there were the usual towels left on loungers even though there was plainly nobody using them.  It is a fair walk to the main square ok in the evening but not in the day so a taxi would be advisable. Make sure you agree a price first!

Le Meridien N'Fis,MJBK4 wrote a review Aug 2012,30,Disappointing-good location but issues,My husband and I stayed here for two nights and were fairly underwhelmed. The check-in process took close to an hour even though we are SPG's. The room was very average in decor and the air-conditioning barely worked. It was 105 degrees outside so this was disappointing. The pool and grounds were attractive though it was too hot to really enjoy them. The pool bar had basically run out of everything but one type of beer so we didn't spend time there. We had an unfortunate experience in the hotel bar. The bartender never asked me if I wanted another drink - in fact he ignored me while he went on to make sure every man in the bar was well taken care of. I saw this occur with other women both nights we were there. My husband let the management know but they didn't really care. The positives - we felt very safe and secure there and the area itself it quite nice. It's a nice departure from the medina and has a local feeling. I would recommend exploring it.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJBK4
Le Meridien N'Fis,Dimitris E wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Tropical fear,I stayed at this hotel for a conference in June. The neighborhood and the whole landscape are amazing and very quite compared to the central (old) Marrakesh. The rooms are spacious very comfortable and with excellent service. Only wifi is poor in terms of throughput and signal reception. Unfortunately I had the bad lack to have the balcony door lock broken at my arrival and it took them 1 day to fix. This was a stressful experience since I had very sensitive staff in my luggage to leave behind in the room and walk away in the town. Moreover the charge about 5$ for a small bottle of water and when you arrive there you really need it...    However the gardens are very exotic the pool really cool the breakfast delightful and the total experience awesome although bit expensive.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,Athens,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DimitrisE690
Le Meridien N'Fis,Jose S wrote a review Aug 2012,20,Airconditioning System badly needs upgrade!,Our family of 3 stayed in this hotel for two nights August 2 to August 4 2012. Our otherwise pleasant trip was totally dominated by the discomfort we suffered due to the total incapability of the airconditioning system to cope with the outside temperature which reaches 47 degrees at this time of year.We had difficulty sleeping at night due to the weak cooling system definitely not worthy of a 4-star rating! Maybe we wrongly chose to go to Marrakech at the hottest time of the year but we did not see this problem in other 5-star hotels that we visited and dined in during our stay. The other problem is that this hotel seems to make the sale of bottled water a big profit center. Because of its distance from the city center there is no store nearby where one can buy bottled water for drinking. This hotel charges US$2.30 for a small bottle of water from the room fridge while the cost of a liter outside is about US$0.15. Also there is a nice gym with a nice jug of drinking water supposedly free for guests but when I complained that it was empty the gym assistant refilled it with...one small bottle of water - good for half a glass! Then of course as pointed out by other guests there is a nice big garden a nice pool and an adequate breakfast but how do you enjoy that if you can't sleep well at night and have to pay loads to drink potable water??!!!,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manila, Philippines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoseS159
Le Meridien N'Fis,rogier vaduz wrote a review Aug 2012,30,Good but needs upgrade,"The gardens are nice and I had a spacious room (suite 140) but several details show that this hotel is getting old and needs an upgrade. The furniture in the room is not up to date the interiors of the restaurants would benefit from some new inspiration and the overall appearance of the outside reminds of the Disney resorts in Orlando. But on the other hand the gardens are very lovely and I have only encountered very kind staff throughout my entire stay (6 days).    I did not have dinner here as Marrakech has so much to offer so I can't say much about the chef of N'Fis. I would anyways recommend you to eat outside the hotel... Just so much to discover! Both within the Medina as well as in the new part of the city there are plenty of interesting restaurants just browse the reviews. I did have breakfast here once though and it was a little disappointing. It just did not look great and appetizing however perhaps it had to do with the ramadan period?    I did not find an iron and iron board in the room but it was delivered swiftly. The fresh flowers and fruit in the room are very nice and the daily supply of bottled water is much appreciated! The internet works fine although it is at a cost (400 dirhams per week). The bathroom is spacious but a little dated; everything is clean and works fine though.    I personally think that the location of the Le Meridien N'Fis is perfect: in no time you're in the Medina and the airport is very nearby too. The new city is around the corner; there is a large shopping center ""Almazar"" including a big Carrefour hypermarket if that is what you need just ten minutes away.

We had connecting rooms with our teenage children which worked really well.  We stayed here at the end of our two week tour of Morocco (we stayed at the Riad Clementine at the start) so we had already visited the Medina a lot.

We enjoyed our stays at the hotel and if offers a good base to see the sights of Marrakech with just a 30 minute walk into Jemaa el-Fnaa (night market). You might prefer to be based in the maze that is the medina but we found it more relaxing to be that little bit removed from the hustle and bustle.    Rooms were fine but far from luxurious. Hotel facilities were good and buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of choice.

The Hotel is well located away from the Hectic & busy Medina and still close to everything.  There is a swimming pool and a few restaurants and a Bar as well as a night-club. The rooms and service are pretty standard. Some rooms are renovated but others are not so it's much better to stay in one of the newer ones.  Overall I would recommend it for a business traveller but I find the small ryad boutique hotels much more charming and interesting if you are visiting Marrakech and wish to experience the authenticity of this very cultural and historical place.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,Mauritius,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex_Didier

Our only complaint is that one of the two rooms we had didn't have adequate air conditioning. We called the front desk to inform them of this and they quickly responded by sending someone to fix the problem. The person sent to fix it may have helped it some but still didn't solve the problem.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Wanderersmelody wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"Great location for all the sightseeing, and relaxing too!",Le Meridien N'Fis was a perfect choice for my husband and I and having seen other hotels and Riads we would definitely choose this hotel for our next trip. The hotel is approx 5/10 mins from the airport and the same to the Medina. Taxis from the airport are MAD100 but we booked through the hotel concierge as it was our first visit to Marrakech and having read some of the stories we were a bit worried about being hassled on arrival. Our driver met us in arrivals with a name board - well worth paying the fare of MAD200 for the stress - free transfer. You can change your money up in the arrivals hall as you can't change money into Dirhams prior to travel - TIP - make sure you change any Dirhams back into your own currency before you go through the departures gate on your return as you can't spend them once you are through departures. Taxis to/from the medina (entrance by the square) are no more than MAD20 - barter! It starts at MAD50 walk away and you generally pay MAD20.    We booked a deluxe king bedded room and were allocated a garden view on the 3rd floor in the Atlas Wing. It was really big (the bed was super king) and the maids did a great job keeping the room clean and replenished towels and toiletries whenever we needed them (daily anyway but more often if required). We were given two small bottles of water each night too and chocolates. Girls - the rooms had a decent hairdryer! We were also able to access the free wi-fi in our rooms and by some areas of the pool/bars.    The pool area is great - as previously mentioned by TA reviewers - so I won't go into too much detail except to say that we never had a problem getting a sun bed and we generally didn't venture down to the pool area until 11am most days. As it was so hot they also had mist sprays around the bar areas which were refreshing. Yes - there is a busy road next to the hotel but it didn't really bother us at all.    Breakfast was OK too. Its served in two large rooms. Id say that it was a standard type of hotel breakfast - an omellete station/pancake station/fresh fruits/hot food/cereals etc. I'm not really sure what else you'd want?    There is a smoking lounge. This was actually refurbished whilst we were there and was a real improvement. Done out arabic style. I'm an avid non-smoker but can honestly say that the smoking did not affect either of us in any areas of the hotel.    My husband and I both enjoy a drink on holiday and were very worried about the prices in the hotel. In the main hotel bar - open from 4pm you could get 6 local beers for the price of 4 which worked out at MAD120 - approx £8.70 for 6 which we thought was good value considering I'd read somewhere that it was EUR17 for 2 Heineken? They did serve Heineken at the hotel and I'm almost 99% sure it was no where near that price. Food around the pool area was reasonable too - pizzas were about MAD45 and a decent steak sandwich with chips was MAD60 (I think - no more). The staff around the pool and bar areas were great. We weren't too sure about tipping at the hotel so we left it to the last day when we tipped our regular bar man and the towel/pool guy MAD100 each. To see someones face light up like that was lovely as they clearly hadn't expected it.    Yousseff - Master of the Concierge - is an absolute star. His advice to us was faultless from the guide that we hired to show us around the Medina (MAD200 for up to 4 hrs!!)- highly recommended. The guide will tailor make the tour for your own tastes. We got to see all of the back alleys/streets which where the real trades were going on and there is no doubt that if we had done this on our own we would not have walked in these areas. We felt really safe and weren't hassled at all. We spoke to others in our hotel who hadn't done this but just set off on their own and we don't feel that they saw what we did. Yousseff also recommended some restaurants - again - really good recommendations - see my other reviews on these and he also recommended a great spa - Bain des Marrakech (I have also reviewed this inc prices).    We went to La Mamounia Hotel for drinks one evening and went to the Churchill Bar there. Its NOT cheap about £30 for two cocktails however we had a lovely walk around the grounds afterwards and the hotel is amazing. It was like walking into a palace. Well worth a visit.    A special mention to Yousseff Abdessadeq  Dauji and Talel. All made our holiday in Marrakech wonderful.    In summary this a great 4* hotel - I'm already planning a girlie spa weekend away there!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderersmelody

The room was nice and comfy and clean but the view could have been slightly better although we were not in it enough to be bothered. The grounds were nicely maintained and well planted. The pool area was lovely although it seemed smaller than the picture and so got busy quickly so beds and space were in demand. Breakfast was fine and offered a good selection.

We emailed the hotel before to arrange a transfer. They responded the same day. When we arrived at the airport there driver was there waiting. He was very helpful and answered any questions that we had. When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist asked us if we had been to Marrakech before and we hadn't. She then then offered us a free upgrade. Our room was a good size and very clean. The air conditioning was brilliant and kept the room nice and cool. We had a view of the pool and the gardens. The maids work really hard and our room was always kept really clean. We had free water and chocolates each day and had fresh flowers one day as well. The pool was fantastic and there's plenty of sun loungers. All the staff were very helpful in particular the concierge who arranged all our trips for us. We can recommend the quad bikes in the palm groves. It's about £45 each but well worth it. The whole trips about 3 & 1/2 hours. Two hours of that was spend on the quad bikes. You go right out in to the palm groves. There's some lovely photo opportunities as well. It was probably one of the highlights of our trip. The market area isn't to be missed either. We had a guide from the hotel which I would advice getting. He showed us everything that we wanted to see so we got the most out of our visit. We ate in the Italian restaurant by the pool a couple of times. We found the food to be good quality and the service was proffessional and attentive. The hotel has beautiful grounds filled with palm trees and lovely flowers. Everything was clean and well maintained. The breakfast was really good and there's lots of choice. There's a chef that will make omelets up in front of you. There's a vast selection of various hot food fresh fruit breads pastries juice and coffee.

The first impression of the hotel was absolutly great - we had the luck to met the (famous!) portier Said! He gave us immediatly the feeling to be on holiday. Very friendly and always with a warm and honest smile it was every time a pleasure to speak with him. He took care for us asking where we wanted to go and gave a lot of good information about prices and places. Unforgetable are also the arabic lessons - choukran!  I would be unfair not to speak about an second person which stands for the special atmosphere at this hotel - it is the consierge Mr. Youssef. If further guest come to the Meridien don't be shy to ask for help. Okay to get help from the consierge at a hotel is standard - but in our case we had all the time quick and professional results (car rental).  As selforganizer of a our trip to marroc we recognized to late which good and honest help the staff ot the hotel could provide. For example if you arrive by plane inform the hotel that they should sent a taxi driver to airport- you will save a lot of dirhams...  All the other unknown staffmembers have done their jobs really good. The man at the pool who opens all the the time with a smile on the lipps the paraplui for us! Our the roomservice which decorated the bed with a nice arrangements with roses.  The hotel was clean the room new and with good TV and HiFi Equipment. The beds have been really good!!!

Le Meridien N'Fis,adrianhicks wrote a review May 2012,40,"nice hotel, good location...just a bit dated",arrived here end of may...hotel is about 10-15 minutes taxi drive from the airport and is about 5-10 minutes taxi away from the main square of jemmaa el fna. first impressions were good...nice lobby with traditional arabic decor about it....receptionist was friendly as were the guys who help with bags and enquiries in the lobby...said and mohammed!! our room was clean and tidy and the bed was comfortable...but as a few people have said already about this hotel the rooms and hotel corridors do look a bit dated and need a freshen up. the pool and garden areas are lovely and the restaurant by the pool served nice salads and pizzas.....we ate out in the square in the evenings so cant really comment on any other restaurants in the hotel. the hotel has a spa and a small gym area which includes a running machine cross trainer and free weights.all in all we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would ceratinly recommend it for a short break away (we were only there for 3 nights)...breakfast which was included in our package was very good too....good selection of cold or hot foods...omelettes fruit cereal cold meats and cheese etc. thanks to all concerned at this hotel for a very nice break away!,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianhicks
Le Meridien N'Fis,Gill M wrote a review May 2012,40,Excellent service for an international conference organized here,We recently held a week-long international conference at the Meridien N'Fis for 120 participants. The service and responsiveness of the hotel were excellent. Monsieur Habbaj the Duty Manager for the duration of the conference was at our side throughout checking everything was on track and was available to us 24/7 by phone in the case of any unforeseen issue. Any last minute change in organisational detail was accommodated with speed efficiency and even humour - almost as if the challenge was welcomed! I have organised many such conferences in the past and in terms of liaising with the hotel to have everything run seamlessly this one was by far the the least worrisome for me.  Also Monsieur Youssuf the Concierge made a couple of excellent recommendations for our group - the Marrakechi restaurant on the Place Jemaa El Fna and a day trip to Ilmil in the Atlas Mountains.  I leave Marrakesh today with some excellent memories and a general feeling of well-being - what a special place and what a pleasure to work with Monsieur Habbaj and his team to organize this very successful conference.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GillM39

Le Meridien N'Fis,Oxana L wrote a review May 2012,50,Amazing holiday,hi guys  just came back from marrakech what a wonderful city. the food is amazing weather is fantastic and would like to relocate as it is one of the most greatest cities i have ever visted. this was our first visit and my husband and i stayed at le meridien hotel. This was one of the finest and most beautiful hotels. The property grounds were beautiful and green swimming pool area was enormous and the restaurant next to the pool was great.  The service in the hotel was really five star and we were looked after like vvip's. I would like to mention here the chief concierge Mr. Youssef Mamouni he took care of everything from our arrival till our departure. He was very proffesional courteous and a real gentleman. He arranged our airport p/up and drop transfer to another city for four days i.e. Agadir and arranged all sort of fun and kept us entertained all the time.

Le Meridien N'Fis,rm1003 wrote a review May 2012,50,Fantastic Hotel & in a great location,This was my second time at this hotel. It was once again a very enjoyable stay. The hotel has absolutely beautiful gardens and a gorgeous pool. One of the most amazing things about this hotel is that it is a beautiful 5 star hotel that has absolutely tons of Moroccan culture. The Hotel architecture and the rooms are very Moroccan in design and style.    When I arrived I was given a warm welcome by the staff and offered traditional Moroccan mint tea. Fatima at front desk was very helpful and explained that SPG members get free wifi and free use of the Hammam. I was given a room on the top floor of the Atlas block which I fully recommend. The room was large and modern and had a nice view of the pool. The king sized bed was very comfortable. When I arrived I found flowers and fruit in the room as well as a personalised welcome letter. It is often these little things which makes ones stay all the more enjoyable.    All the staff were very helpful but a special thank you to Yasmina for going out of her way to be so helpful.    I arrived at Marrakech-Menara Airport. I changed money in the airport after Arrivals which gives the best foreign exchange rates in the city. To keep my costs down of phone calls I bought a mobile sim card upstairs in ‘Tabac Journal’ next to the staircase next to Arrivals. The best network is ‘Maroc Telecom’. The hotel can pick you up if you arrange this beforehand but much cheaper to use the plentiful airport taxis.    Marrakech is a tourist paradise with lots to do from Camel riding snake charmers shouks the Old City donkey carts Moroccan carpets palace museum and the list goes on. If you require the hotel concierge will organise a tour guide or trip excursions for hotel guests. There is also a red double decker tourist bus which operates every 30 minutes and stops right in front of the hotel. I was tempted but instead I took my own tourist guide which I found was more personalised and enabled me to see so much more of Marrakech.    All in all Le Meridien N’Fis provided me once again with a most enjoyable stay and way to experience the beauty of Moroccan culture.    Looking forward to my next trip.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rm1003

Le Meridien N'Fis,Andrewek wrote a review Apr 2012,50,What an amazing place!,Casablanca can feel like New York City and while this hotel doesn't look like much from the outside it a marvel of architecture inside. There are huge marble columns (p.s. the stupid fiberoptic lights need to be removed from them) which are great reminders of the colonial architecture while other areas are modern and fresh. The rooms were clean and wonderfully appointed. Our room was very high in the hotel and while you could still hear the horns from the cars below it wasn't a nuisance. The restaurant was adequate and the breakfast was pretty good. If ever in Marrakech again I would stay at this property.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Granville, Ohio, United States",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andrewek

Le Meridien N'Fis,Explorer_SHD wrote a review Apr 2012,40,"Good, not great though. Stayed in better starwood properties.",Went to the meridien n'fis in January 2012.  Transport from the airport was easily sorted via email from the UK and the driver etc was fine. You have to pay for the transport however but it’s worth it especially when landing quite late at night.  The hotel property/grounds itself are really nice pool area is lovely and the gardens are beautiful and maintained really well. Wasn't impressed with the rooms at all the bathroom needed updating - and it's not the cheapest of places so would have expected more from a Starwood property with regards to the bed furniture and generally a new lick of paint wouldn't have hurt. To be honest after a night we got used to it and tried to enjoy. The spa is nice and the hammam is free if you are an SPG member so this was good.  Service when we arrived was quite bad it seemed that the hotel was filled with a lot of locals and Middle Eastern tourists and it felt like we didn't get attended to at all at reception. I understand most people are greeted have mint tea at the door and polite reception staff we didn't receive this welcome. Also wouldn't have known about the free hammam and wifi had I not been told by a friend who had stayed here before. The best service came on our last day when the hotel became quite empty and one gentleman at the door was extremely helpful (unfortunately cannot remember his name) but he served as mint tea as we left arranged taxi's and was extremely polite which meant we left on a good note.  The breakfast was just like being in one of the souks to be brutally honest the first few days were just awful you are lucky to get cutlery let alone get served tea and coffee. We literally had to ask for tea/coffee about 5 times before getting up and getting the pot ourselves and we had to seat ourselves and find a clean table. It was a shame as the food is good decent variety and we did see some guests getting treated a lot better by some of the more senior waiters. Again by our last day however we got really good service. So I think to sum up the service really depends on a) how busy the hotel is b) which tourists are at the hotel c) who you get serving you.    For a Starwood hotel the service should have been much better as a business traveler using Starwood for a weekend break was quite disappointed.    Overall the actual hotel itself is a 4 star due to the good location - 25 minute walk into town amazing view of the mountains - good amenities and lovely grounds.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer_SHD
Le Meridien N'Fis,TallGuyTravelling wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Mostly very good but there is a problem here!!!,This is a good place to stay in Marrakesh. It was our first and last visit to this city so it was all brand new to us. However we seem to always stay in Starwood hotels when we go away so have some basis for comparison.    First of all we were collected at the airport by the hotel transport.Easily arranged by email from the UK. This was efficient and courteous. Bags were taken from us and we were delivered to the hotel promptly. Where check in was friendly with cups of mint tea. Albeit it became confused and bags were not delivered to the room until about an hour later when I telephoned down to ask where they were........They were still in the minibus but this was promptly resolved.    We upgraded the room (not a suite) and I believe it had been recently renovated. The room was fine and on the top floor of the Atlas block. It had a patio door and although no actual terrace there was a balustrade type affair so you could look out over the gardens. Which was fine. The rooms are looked after beautifully. Ours was clean and in good order with a large bed. Flowers were put in the room and there was always some fruit there as well. We always thanked the room staff and tipped lightly. The only annoying item was the use of electric toy cars by small children sometimes endlessly trundling around the pathways below your window. Which did rather intrude on the peace and quiet of the hotel. Well maybe that's me showing my age!    The hotel has a number of restaurants and bars. There were business events taking place but these did not interfere with our stay and there was some sort of night club but to be honest I did not hear a thing.    The pool area looked fabulous but we were there in the winter and although the days were sunny and warm the evenings were not and the pool was COLD! However in the summertime it would no doubt be a great place to sunbathe (light traffic noise is present. This hotel is situated on the junction of two main roads) and we ate our lunch here once as well as using the bar. The staff at poolside seemed well motivated and did their jobs well. A pleasure to go there with such professional service.    The main bar is inside and enclosed. A bit gloomy and smokey really. With large TV screens on the walls. Service a bit hit and miss. There is an area fairly nearby and outside in the fresh air where you can sit quietly and take tea or a bottle of wine on a terrace in the gardens. This was ideal for us.    Okay so the room was good the reception was up to standard. Although there was some confusion over if we had to pay for tea or not and we never did get to know what benefits we were entitled to in the spa. This could all do with clarification. The poolside appears to be working well and generally the hotel is there or thereabouts. This brings me to breakfast!!!  I have never witnessed such a chaotic mess in all my experiences at staying in hotels. Firstly the buffet style meal is hardly varied. I am no expert on Moroccan cuisine but it must offer more than this. Pastries salad cereals meats egg bar etc. were all there. Mainly of mediocre quality. If you could find a table that had been cleared you were lucky. Ordering a tea or coffee was trial and error and despite asking members of staff you ended up fending for yourself. When tables were cleared the debris was swept onto the floor and the grubby mats replaced. At least the sparrows would deal with the crumbs! (the restaurant is inside). The experience of watching one of the suited male (presumably manager) staff sweeping up spilled cereals with his hands and then depositing them back into the dispenser will always be a memory of the Le Meridien breakfast experience. I could not note down his name as he was not wearing his name badge.    Enough said about breakfast. As you will see from the above review it was like you were in another hotel. So the advice is to take breakfast down the road and you should be alright.    There are a couple of restaurants a short stroll from the hotel. Out the front turn right and keep going 4-5 mins no more.    Location wise the hotel is a flat 25min walk to all the action the souks and shops. Interesting shopping there. We bought a large carpet after extensive haggling so had some fun. The tourist bus (open top double decker) stops directly outside the hotel every 30 mins or so. You buy tickets on board and get a map and headphones. There are two routes that overlap and should give a good orientation of the city. The recorded audio tour is in many languages including English. Hence the headphones which are brand new and to keep. My advice is take your own as the wires are short and they are the hanger types which some of us have difficulty using. But the tour is interesting and recommended. Also it will naturally drop you right back in front of the hotel where you started!,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,West Country UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TallGuyTravelling
Le Meridien N'Fis,Fabregasuk wrote a review Apr 2012,30,Time for Starwood to make a decision!,It's just not good enough for the price. This was my third visit but you wouldn't have known it on check in. No 'welcome back' either verbally or in writing no nothing. Instead a dark dingy room on the ground floor despite me requesting a higher floor when I bought the room via the Starwood website. Why no welcome back? Why ignore the height request?    Following a complaint to the desk and a reminder that it was my third visit and that I'm a member of the Starwood preferred scheme (which had clearly not made any difference earlier) I was given a slightly better room and free wifi (the password for which lapsed every 60 minutes).    It was only slightly better because the fridge was leaking onto the floor. I mentioned this to a member of the (many) staff who come to the room during the day but nothing was done. I also mentioned it on checkout.    The rooms themselves are OK but having just come from the Sofitel Essaouira Mogador Golf & Spa I now know what I can get for similar money and there is no comparison. The rooms at the Meridian are very dated. Yes they were repainted in the last few years but it's not good enough for the money! Not even any tea or coffee making facilities!    The room service was quick but farcical. Salt and pepper pots which were empty butter but no bread a warm dessert that was cold and one server in particular who did an unintentional comedy routine walking backwards out of the room presumably in search of a tip. Sadly he took a slip by the leaking fridge which I thought would prove my point on its need for repair and for a better job generally before tips were issued. You couldn't have made it up.    Worth saying that the room service food was good and prompt and there seems to have been an improvement in the menu since my last stay a year earlier.    Poolside service did not exist. Nothing. Zero. I got a towel from a gardener in the end. The petit poolside cafe was shut - I guess out of season? The Italian near the pool is good enough and full of friendly staff. Good on them they were working hard. The entrance to the pool is almost blocked by four danger signs telling all the guests off about drinking from glass diving etc before they've even managed to beg a towel from the gardener. One sign had a black bin bag over it - we appear to not be banned from doing something anymore but not quite allowed either. How very Moroccan.    The rooms also were cluttered with notifications. There were 7 leaflets on my desk. I don't want a forest to be cut down in order to find the number for room service. All a bit more Premier Inn than Meridian.    I used the spa which was OK (and for some reason don't know why was free. Tell me why so I can write positively about it!). The ladies there were very friendly if bored stiff. The gym was quite good usual mix of free weights one of those multi-gym machines that no-one ever knows how to use and just stare at and some benches No free water at the gym which for a good hotel in Africa seems outrageous and dangerous. No wonder there was a huge sign pointing out where the CPR machine was located.    Also very friendly were the porters and the cleaners the latter of which kept feeding me chocolates! I was amazed however at the amount of times a day the room was opened. One day when it was raining and I was at my computer writing there must have been 8-10 knocks on the door from staff. This oddly included the minibar person who asked if he could see it only to clear off without restocking it when i said yes. And someone else who used a key card but vanished after realising someone was in the room.    The worse thing about the hotel? Shocking acoustics meant I could hear everything in the corridor. It was so loud in the morning it sounded like a circus was coming past the room The only thing missing was a monkey with symbols riding an elephant.    Best thing? It's a solid middle level hotel where you'll get a decent room and services. It's not fabulous but it is consistent. However for the same price in Morocco you can now buy fabulous...    Had a snack from the Italian after check out which resulted in a huge hoo-ha - I expect a hotel like that to just charge it on my card not ask for cash! Manageress sorted it out efficiently.    Who knows what Starwood will do with this joint? Ideally it should be put out of its misery and go down a brand grade. Either that or a multi million euro make over. Having said that it was packed full for the Easter holidays - so what do I know?!    All I do know is that when the manageress (who is superb) said she hoped I would come back again (as though this was my first visit) I did wonder why I should bother for a fourth time when Starwood clearly couldn't have cared less about me giving my business to them on several previous occasions.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabregasuk

The hotel is built in the morrocan style and the gardens and pool are lovely. The service is fine and the breakfasts are great. But alas the charm stops there. The rooms are decidedly non-morrocan decorated in unsympathetic red white and black. And avoid the Iwan restaurant at all costs: we waited 1 1/2 hours in the most uncomfortable seating for cold dry and tasteless chicken and bad wine. It was the worst meal of our holiday.

Firstly I would agree with most of the positive comments already posted about this hotelIt's cleanwell run and the staff are great throughout special thanks to Youssef the concierge  However I would like to make the following commentsthat did slightly ruin our stay  The first room we were offered was quite shabbyand tiredand also happened to be right next to the lift shaft but to be fair when we asked to be relocated it wasn't a problem our second choice room was much better  Biggest plus was the bed it was massive and very comfortable and the bathroom was fine  Biggest minus for me was that there was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room ? And after a days walking around Marrekech a hot drink in your room would have been great I did order a hot drink from room service but by the time it arrived it was cold ?  NOW the biggest disappointment !!!! The Breakfast Buffet Battle ?  On arrival to the breakfast hall you just grab a table if you can find one that has been cleared from the previous occupant that is ? And if your lucky enough to find one that may have knivesforksspoons and napkins guard it with your life !!! As there is a big shortage of plates and cutlery. The breakfast selection isn't to bad  it could all be a little bit better organised though  Having said all off the abovewe did actually enjoy our stay at the Meridien all three restaurants were good and the pool was fine so thank you to all the staff you are the ones who make it all good it's your employers who need to spend a few dirhams to keep in line with other hotels in Marrekech ps start with trying to brighten up the reception area a bit ???,Date of stay: March 2012,,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodwen1

The room - was comfortable enough  was clean & the air-con was adequate : but it looked as if it had been re-decorated on the cheap painting over the previous service. I'm guessing that that the hotel had been built 20-25 yrs ago  from the creaky safe storage box in the wardrobe - we worried that we'd never be able to re-open it  as the number pads were extremely well-used & un-responsive when touched..  The room maids ... were they deliberately trying to wind us up ? Or was this the usual level of service ?. Day 1 - a maid brings up a flower arrangement & fruit - she knocks on the door doesn't wait for a reply - barges in . When they cleaned  they only left 1 towel . This was mentioned to the concierge - the maid fetches a towel - she knocks on the door doesn't wait for a reply - barges in . Ditto when we had to ask for toilet roll .  The room key : had to be re-set twice in 2 days .  There were 2 lifts in our building : 1 of them seemed to be permanently mal-functioning.  Breakfast was by far and away the best meal .... but then it was a buffet  we served ourselves .The choice was excellent . The coffee was awful - ask for a cappucino to get something that remotely resembles coffee.  The dinner service was hopeless : we ate in 2 of the restaurants :service in both was slow to the point of being tedious . We had the shoddiest "" green salad "" we have ever witnessed.  The dining room serving Moroccan food has to have the most uncomfortable table/chairs combos ever installed in a restaurant .  How this place is rated a 5-star is beyond us : sure it has an elegant reception area & common areas ; the pool is pleasant . But the service is haphazard .

Le Meridien N'Fis,xanadu68 wrote a review Mar 2012,40,"Welcoming, friendly and helpful staff throughout hotel",We have just returned from a 7 night stay at Le Meridien N'Fis in Marrakech (2 couples).These would be my comments about the hotel.  Positives - location is excellent - close to the airport but not intrusive (plane noise very rare) walking distance to the medina about 15 minutes. The hotel was spotlessly clean and reception area was a beautiful serene area of calm after the busy souks. The most impressive thing about this hotel however was the friendliness helpfulness and welcome of the staff. Everyone made us feel like we were at home from the second we arrived nothing was too much trouble and we received excellent advice about trips and restaurants from the concierge staff particularly Youseff.  Negatives - we were staying on a room only basis and felt that breakfast although self service was not really great value for money - we found a cafe only 100 yards up the street where we could get breakfast sat in the fresh air for a quarter of the price - cafe is called Le 6 and the manager was like an uncle by the time we left!  Drinks were very expensive (although we found that beer seemed to be expensive everywhere) however there is an off licence on the opposite side of the road (next to the Oriental restaurant) where we were able to get a good bottle of red wine for 60 dirhams as opposed to 140 for a very average bottle in the hotel.  none of the rooms had a balcony.  Finally transfers from airport to hotel were expensive considering the distance - approximately £30 for 4 one way.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lytham St Anne's, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xanadu68

The pool was fab and we enjoyed many relaxing afternoons there with very good service and a decent menu at the poolside cafe.    Also the concierge was tremendously helpful in suggesting and making dinner bookings for us. Of course they are multilingual and were very sweet to let my friend and me practice our French. (thank you!)    A nice bonus was the Moroccan restaurant on site -- L'Iwan. Very good though a bit expensive but well worth it if you want a relaxing authentic meal without having to venture out.

Staff - nice and polite  The pool was very cold but lots of sun loungers    Overall the location was good if you don’t mind walking 10-20 mins to get around the city.  We paid around 90 pounds sterling for the room per night which was fiar but I think you can get better value for money staying elsewhere in the town.

Le Meridien N'Fis,AnthonyB1965 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Fantastic hotel in great location,Just returned from Marrakech would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of visiting. 10 mins by taxi from centre approx. 15 mins from airport. Taxis are so cheap 20 dirhams almost anywhere (less than £2). Good location in L'Hivernage calm and peaceful away from all the madness of the centre of Marrakech. Hotel has lovely well maintained gardens and pool. Nice clean airy rooms. Good choice at breakfast. But the best thing about this hotel is the staff. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were greated by friendly smiles by everyone. Special mention has to go Said (and his brother) who greeted us on arrival with mint tea rose water and towels to wash our hands and who was there everyday to ask us how we were enjoying our stay. Check-in/out was a breeze quick and efficient. Any questions or needs were met by helpful and friendly staff. Nothing was too much trouble. There are nice restaurants within 5 minutes walk of the hotel turn right out of the main entrance and stay on the same side of the road. 2nd cafe/restaurant you come to does good moroccan and international food at reasonable prices. Overall a fantastic experience.

Le Meridien N'Fis,MeadowStorm wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Overall - a good experience,Le Meridien N’Fis was the second base of the Christmas break with my family in Marrakech having earlier stayed at the Riad El Mansour in the old town.  The Riad and the hotel offer completely different experiences so any comparison would only serve to oversimplify arguments for or against Riads vs hotels in general. The Riad was lovely but we found the old town quite tiring after a few days. So being able to move to the hotel made for a well-balanced break.  Check-in was managed professionally with a personal welcome from the duty Manager. The mint tea was a nice touch but it was all a bit hurried as we were ushered off to our rooms. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and we spent quite some time walking around taking in the orange trees in the well-manicured gardens and the chef’s garden where you see a variety of herbs and vegetables being grown. The rooms themselves were clean and functional but very 1980s.  It was a hugely agreeable experience being able to relax by the pool under clear blue December Moroccan skies. Difficult to remember sometimes that you are only 3 hours from London. Although any attempts to swim were met with involuntary screaming as the water’s icy temperature plunged the body into thermal shock. If swimming is your thing then I’m sure the pool would be absolutely perfect during the warmer seasons. When you need a change of scenery the new town is 30-40minutes away by foot and made an enjoyable walk in the Morrocan winter’s warm air. There are of course plenty of taxis and horse drawn carriages to take you anywhere in town but found it all a bit of a drama discussing the where why’s and how much.  The cost of eating in the hotel’s restaurants was a little too steep for my budget so we would either have a simple dinner at the appealing poolside cafe or eat out. Fortunately my booking was a B&B deal as breakfast in any hotel these days can be astronomical. In the dedicated breakfast buffet restaurant the fare was enjoyed by all my family thanks to the wide variety of food choices available - not least a fantastic selection of fresh oranges figs and other local fruits.  The hotel’s gym is enough to keep the heart pumping in the absence of a proper workout but equipment is limited – so not a good option for fitness freaks on longer term stays.  In conclusion we very much enjoyed our stay at Le Meridien N’Fis: a good place to relax and take in the ambiance of the hotel’s grounds or wonder off into the new town that’s within easy walking distance.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,Berks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeadowStorm

Le Meridien N'Fis,Martin B wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Great hotel and base for touring Marrakech,We had a great week in Marrakech staying in the Meridien N'Fis. The staff in the hotel are very friendly and extremely helpful and made our stay all the more enjoyable - our thanks to them all particularly Said on the door!  The rooms were ideal for us - modern clean and spacious - the cleaning staff are excellent and despite our mess they tidied us wonderfully. When we arrived the hotel reception staff were very good about arranging two rooms opposite each other for us. When we left they kindly arranged both rooms with late checkout until 4pm which made things much easier for our late flight.  The gardens pool area and hotel surroundings were very pleasant to walk through.(The pool was cold but this was not a surprise in February!). Breakfast was buffet style with a good range which pleased everyone in the family - the omelettes were especially delicious! The food in the pool restaurant was also good although the prices are realtively high and so we tended to eat elsewhere.  We would certainly recommend the hotel which provided a great base for exploring Marrakech being about a 20 minute walk to the Souks and to the new town. Taking a guide from outside the hotel also worked out well - we had a very interesting morning and saw much more than we would otherwise have done.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinB935

Le Meridien N'Fis,Kevin M wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Great Hotel.,Spent long weekend here. Check in was a little long however the complimentary tea while sitting in the authentic lobby dispersed the delay. The porter brought us to our room a ground floor room with spacious terace. The bed must be the number one feature of the room an enormous super king size. Amazing sleep. TV had usual international channels mini bar was not crazy expensive as per usual. Room service was quick and a proper roll in table came along with a good quality of food. The restaurant by pool side also had a good lunch selection and friendly staff. Found the bar a little dark inside it is themed as a chill out lounge but the darkness was alot. The waiters were very efficient even providing free escargot and snacks on our third evening. What really makes the hotel I think is the impeccably kept gardens that intertwine the blocks of rooms. All the flowers are labelled and it is really quite nice just to stroll around the gardens and fountains. Old school hotelling at its best. Breakfast was a very large buffet area incorporating all the usual fair. What was impressive was the people making omelettes and crepes to order right in front of you as part of the buffet.    The open top tour bus stops at the front door and its approx a 30minute stroll to the new town. Airport is about 20min in a cab. In the area there are other bars but all are part of hotels and prices are as high as the UK. We ended up clubbing in the Meridiens night club on 2 nights free entrance for hotel guests which saves a good bit. Expect a vodka coke to cost 10euro its a club to be seen in.

Le Meridien N'Fis,catherineh1982 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,"Great location, faultless service makes up for bare rooms","I stayed at the Hotel N'Fis for 4 nights in January 2012 and really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is ideally located only about 15 minutes walk from the Medina (the old town) but if you turn right outside of the hotel instead of left you find yourself in the newer more ""European"" part of Marrakech where there's plenty of restaurants bars and stores. The hotel is very beautiful inside especially the courtyard/pool area although I did think the rooms themselves were a bit of a let down after walking through the lobby etc. — they feel sparsely furnished and the décor in them is a bit bare. However they were perfectly comfortable (the beds are amazing) and spotlessly clean. We dined at the hotel for breakfast every morning (and although it was lovely I do agree with another reviewer re: the coffee—it was terrible! But order a cappuccino or other speciality coffee from a server. I did and it was MUCH better) and ate in the Moroccan restaurant where the food was great. Where this property really excels though for me is the staff. From the moment I arrived in the lobby (my friends had already checked in) I was told to leave my bags where they were and go join my party because I was ""home now"". Sounds a bit corny but after two flights and a full day's traveling I was happy to hear it. We plagued the concierge during our staff for information about a day trip a DVD player bus times etc. and really they all couldn't have been more helpful. We checked out early in the morning on our last day and then came back in the afternoon for the bags and a member of staff set them in a corner of the lobby for us served us lovely mint tea and let us relax while we waiting for our taxi. All in all just a great experience. Marrakech can be a bit of a crazy place especially on your first visit and the Hotel N'Fis was really an oasis in the middle of it all.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Boeing767 wrote a review Jan 2012,40,I really wanted to give 3 1/2 stars ...,"The hotel is nice ... no doubt about it but there were some things I did not care for. Let's take a look at the attributes:  We liked: Staff friendly gracious and knowledgeable. The room was sufficiently large (although as I was traveling with a co-worker and not family I felt like the twin beds were a bit too close together). The garden was pretty the pool area looked inviting the restaurants were of reasonable quality and price (although the buffet breakfast was a tad expensive at 200 Dh each). We also liked that we were able to arrange airport transportation (we arrived late in the evening) for 100 Dh each per direction - but they met us with a sign right inside the terminal.  We didn't like: When dining at any of the restaurants your room number is requested before you even sit down; this felt like they thought a registered guest might dine and dash - a little tacky I opined. This problem was made worse at the breakfast both mornings when we ordered sparkling water (which is not included in the price of the buffet) they actually brought us a bill to sign as they brought the water. I mean really if the breakfast is 200 Dh each (about $23) they should be able to include a bottle of water.  We definitely didn't like how the request for a tour guide was handled although in fairness it is possible that the appointing of guides via the ""tourist bureau"" may be a requirement. Our ""guide"" walked us through all the souks and stopped at the stalls and shops quite clearly owned by his friends - including a rug shop which sat us down on a sofa and gave us a 45 minute sales pitch. After a couple more incidents like that we dismissed him and did the rest on our own.  The location is nice - you can walk to the walled part of the city (The Medina) in 20-30 minutes and take in all the sights and sounds. If you walk the other direction (up Mohammed VI) you will come to the train station and a small mall - but some nice buildings.  There were taxi drivers and shop owners who chased us around without much conviction but by and large we felt safe.  It is unlikely that I would return to Marrakech but if I did I would probably go back to the Le Meridien. The good outweighed the bad.  One thing however: I did not have the good internet experience that other posters have noted as an SPG member it was free - but both mornings I was there the internet failed for two hours or more. We called the desk and were told that it is common for the internet to be out until 8:00 AM or so (I wonder if this is just because we were there on a weekend).",Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ewa Beach, Hawaii",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boeing767

The group loved the hotel and Le Meridien did everything to suit the group's needs!    Location: it is in the area considered the most noble one where all the big and good hotels are. It is a 5 minute drive from the airport (EUR 15 negotiated) and a 20 to 30 minute walk to the Jemma el Fna Square (inside the Medina where all the souks are) or you can take a 5 minute taxe of course (EUR 10 negotiated). The area is nice with some good restaurants nearby and Marrakech is safe to walk around;  Room: they are all very large with lots of space to leave your luggage and walk around. The views to the gardens are lovely and the bed is comfy. Room amenities in general are ok but not great and Le Meridien could do better on the information about hotel and city that they put inside the room. There is paid Wi Fi that works properly. Bathrooms are small and not very recent but the shower is great;  Breakfast: if you want to eat a lot and different things you came to the right place! But service here needs improvement as does the quality of the food good but could be better. The omolets are great;  Service: mixed fealings here. The hotel's event manager went the extra mile to give us whatever we needed and that is something really really to praise! People at reception were good (Fatma was great) and helpful. But as I said at breakfast and room service could be better;  Premises: the gardens are really beautiful huge and with a large pool and also a tennis court and many areas you can use congratulations. There is a SPA (I did not try it) and a few restaurants although they close them during off season as was the case;  General: for a group I would definetly recommend it!

Le Meridien N'Fis,jaywallington wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Good quality at good value; superb pool!,I stayed here on a business trip in February with ten other colleagues. At a country level Morocco is a fascinating place to visit a real east meets west feel to it and that is mirrored in the hotel. We reserved 6 rooms all of which were situated at the back of the hotel. The walk through the gardens to reach the rooms is superb immaculate gardens with cool water features flowing on the floor. The hotel has a very clean very well kept feel to it which isn't always guaranteed in Morocco.  The pool is great plenty of sun beds and the restaurant beside it served decent food at reasonable prices.  In terms of location the hotel is a very short hop from the main attractions in the city and walkable to various clubs bars and restaurants down the road (turn right out of the hotel for them left for the city centre).  There is a very well equipped gym where you can blast out MOroccan MTV which was quite cool!  Breakfast was excellent; plenty of choice and probably best of all is the opportunity to enjoy it all in a Moroccan style conservatory fully equipped with big floor cushions and low tables - it really gets you into the swing of the local culture with all of the amenities and to be frank luxuries you would expect with a Meridien. Dinner was OK but I wouldn't write home about it. Filled the relevant holes after the Atlas Mountains drive which was absolutely superb.  I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel for a short stay in the city - it is near enough to everything you need and good quality for the money - we paid about £100 per night per room. It's a nice mixture of authentic culture meeting western demands and they have hit that mixture perfectly on the head.

We visited in October 2011 and stayed at Le Meridien a well placed hotel in pleasant grounds lovely gardens and having good bedrooms spacious with well equipped bathrooms it is not in the first flush of youth but the pool area was clean and we were well looked after the weather was just rightwarm enough for sunbathing after all the sightseeing.  Personally I thought the main square in the city a dirty noisy overcrowded mess and that was in the daytime. We used the hop on hop off bus from directly outside the hotel to get around visiting the other sights got through the main souk/spice market near the Jewish quarter without too much hassel watched two women have a big fight outside the public loos by the entrance to the souk and managed to visit a museum or two.  Just down from the hotel are some very useful cafe/restaurants where we ate most nights the hotel restaurant being rather below par and expensive. These cafes also made excellent salads and some excellent coffee which the hotel did not. The breakfast coffee from an urn was awful but one day we actually were asked by the waitress if we liked espresso or cappachino and we had fresh coffee - bliss but this had never been offered before! Breakfast was buffet style fairly well replenished but with occasional hiccups. As always in N African countries management was visible but ineffective.  Don't bother going to the 'gardens' further up the main road just a dusty palm plantation with a huge reservoir but it made a good walk. The new town very elegant and good shopping also served by the hop on/off bus which goes on for a tour of the outskirts of the city and a chance for seeing some lovely houses more palms and camels.

I would advise trying the hop on off bus. Ticket valid for a whole day or two and it takes you everywhere. Good deal.  A few restaurantscafes situated 2 mins walk from the hotel if you would like to try some tagines etc at night time...    Only critic I have is not much to see in Marrakech.  Oasira Park is a waste of time.  Jamaa Efna is a good place but being a tourist meaning people running after you to buy stuff...annoying!!!    But Hotel made it worthwhile. Thank you to all staff.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Mishtravelling wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Very happy customers - read to the end!,During June of last year we spent 4 nights/5 days at Le Meridien N Fis Marrakech. Our holiday began disappointingly – there was a hair in one of our dishes on the first night and a fly in our salad the following lunch time. This kind of thing happens on the rare occasion; it was very unfortunate for Le Meridien that two incidents occurred in such close succession and to the same couple.    After the second incident we called over a member of the management team to explain our feelings of unhappiness. It is the way this member of staff on behalf of Le Meridien handled the situation that completely turned our opinion around as well as the general helpfulness of all members of the hotel team we came across during our stay. I can’t think of a single one who didn’t go above and beyond their call of duty. They worked around the clock all seemed to be fountains of useful knowledge and on top of that they all had a wonderful sense of humour/fun.    We didn’t encounter another problem for the remainder of our trip it was pure bliss. We particularly enjoyed eating at the Morrocan restaurant inside the hotel (the ambience was perfect); sipping champagne as a treat at the bar; yummy breakfasts; and walking in the gardens at night (very romantic). The hotel is located an ideal distance from the Medina and the pool saved us from the heat on a daily basis!,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Durham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mishtravelling
Le Meridien N'Fis,Jansait wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Great Hotel. Great Service!,Spent 4 days at this hotel attending a conference that was at the same hotel. 26-29 October 2011.    When we arrived they greeted us with a Moroccan tea was very good. Receptionist was very helpful and nice.    Rooms were clean cozy and quite. The View from my room was stunning! Too bad that internet isn't free! I hate this but good we had free internet from the conference organizers. TV wasn't entertaining but you don't need to watch when you're at that hotel or in Marrakech.    They have a very nice pool in the hotel. Tennis court and playground for kids! Even walking around in the hotel yard was very nice. small fountains here and there. All green gardens.    Service was very good. I needed an adapter for my laptop and found one at the reception. Needed a pharmacy and they wrote down an address for a near pharmacy. One thing that wasn't perfect is that when we exchanged money they didn't give us a receipt. Make sure you get one so when you're leaving Morocco you can exchange it at any exchanger in the airport. Some won't exchange if you don't have a receipt.    Breakfast was ok. Dinner wasn't ok. Not many choices.    Didn't have a chance to go around the town but someone at the hotel told us about Jame'e Fina great in the day and night time. Stores shows etc...    Overall the hotel is very good.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Vancouver Island, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jansait

And of course I loved even this time the hotel. The staff was EXTRA helpful (we sent away the cleaning lady probably 20 times because the kid was sleeping/eating/etc.. and she was really accomodating.... I am thankful to this day) and the garden is stunning.    If you want to look for something wrong with the hotel here it is:  - rooms are not really new but they are still great to me  - forget about skypeing teleconferencing etc... the connection speed of the wifi is only enough to read your email,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lausanne, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piernicola
Le Meridien N'Fis,K Q wrote a review Nov 2011,50,"Great Hotel, Great Meeting Location",Just spent a week in Marrakech. GHreat city for a meeting no jet lag interesting destination and a breath of fresh air from going to Western cities. The hotel's welcome is great seated with Mint tea by the Concierge. Clearly the people who work here are very proud of their country and city. Their warmth of hospitality is typical of everyone who you meet in the city. The rooms in the hotel are very spacious and comfortable. Beds are fantastic the food was great a reflection of Morrocan cuisine. One day we had lunch in the vegetable garden as part of our meeting this was a really different interesting venue/lunch when compared to the hundreds of conference lunches we've all had. The hotel's location is convenient for both the airport and lots of the great venues restaurants and clubs in the new town and is a ten minute taxi ride to the Medina,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KQ555
Le Meridien N'Fis,Ahmed B wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Good Conference arrangement and tourisms activities with pleasent memories,I went for two days conference in the same hotel and spent 3 more days to see the city. I like the location facility and service of the hotel. It is in the middle between Jemaa el Fna and almanara 15 minutes straight line to these two famous heritage places no other hotel have this position. It is also stop number 7 for the Marrakesh tourist and open roof bus which provides you easy access to cover the whole city and 15 minutes distance to the Train Station.  I like the hotel inside the service is great and atmosphere with their local tea serviced for the people staying in the lobby without your request. Rooms and service are good management and Connoisseur are very helpful they advise you for everything with the best options and value for money.  I like the conference rooms they are large with all the required set. Makes you comfortable delivering your speeches or listening to the speeches with side rooms for the refreshments and other rooms for the organizing. There is also a long way with many seats to set during breaks and have a short chat with the audiences.  There are many other facilities that I did not have the chance to experience. For example a number of restaurants one near the pool another opposite with traditional style beside the third with access to the garden which we have our daily breakfast. It is large and serving traditional breads and some traditional and local food.  I think I can cover everything I I experienced but in general it is quite in middle with easy access to many things and with a great friendly team and atmosphere. We enjoyed it and managed to know the city and reach everywhere and keep very pleasent memories.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Muharraq Town, Al Muharraq, Bahrain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AhmedB148
Le Meridien N'Fis,maffaC wrote a review Nov 2011,40,"Pleasant, Quiet & clean",Spent 3 nights (Standard room) at the Merridien N'Fis and generally thought it was a great hotel. The entrance and reception area give the impression of a grand hotel and the grounds gardens and pool complex area are lovely and well kept.    The rooms are adequate albeit a little dated but very clean. Could have done with tea/coffee facilities in the room though and possibly a properly tuned in tv but none the less adequate.    The staff mostly seemed happy and generally helpful but did seem to struggle around breakfast sometimes there were no plates available and long queues for the pancake/omlette options but still a good spread nonethe less.    Plus points - Gardens/pool area location. Easy & quick check in/out.

The Hotel was in keeping with its five star rating - sprawling grounds with beautiful gardens a lovely lobby with air con and complimentary refreshments and the friendliest / most helpfull staff we have ever met. In particular the concierge who went by the name of ""SAID"" was superb - very friendly polite and went out of his way to assist us.    The pool area is lovely and while slightly disappointing that there wasn't more space for adults (over run by noisy children) it was still a relaxing place. the rooms are pretty good but not the 5 star luxury you may be used to. they were clean modern and spacious but lacking in five star touches.

Le Meridien N'Fis,martyngs wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Very good hotel in Marrakech,Stayed here as part of a small (11 people) group tour of Morocco. The hotel is well situated about 10 mins walk from the city walls. In the local modern residential area there are a few small bar/restaurants – although a bit main-road ish. The reception staff were good and the meals we had in the hotel restaurant were pretty good. The rooms are well equipped spacious and well-lit and include all the things you would expect in a hotel of this standard – comfortable bed small fridge hair dryer well equipped bath/shower room (but wi-fi is expensive and the minibar is extortionate!) The hotel pool (unheated) is about 30m long and therefore you can get a good swim. There is also a leisure centre with spa and gym but didn't use it. Beer is expensive - £3 for a small bottle although (as one reviewer noted) the nearby shop sells local “Especiale” for £1.50 for a half-litre can.  martyngs,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martyngs

I shouldn't have worried. This is a really good hotel. The staff is attentive the food is decent and the rooms are clean.    The highlight for me was the garden between the lobby. If my meetings hadn't gone into the evening I could have spent hours with my camera among the flowers and the birds.

I emailed the hotel in advance of us arriving in order to arrange some flowers for my wife and to make a reservation for a restaurant to take my wife on our anniversary. I had a swift reply from the head concierge Youssef who I must say was brilliant. He sent me a list of various restaurants including descriptions. Once I decided on one he organised the rest for me. During our stay every time we saw him he would welcome us and always had a smile on his face. This level of service was the general trend from the majority of the staff throughout our stay. I must say one negative point the lady on reception when we checked was not very welcoming could have done with a smile.    The location is brilliant 10 mins from the airport and 5 mins taxis to main medina and souks. The pool was superb which meant for a city break it had a perfect balance of site seeing but also relaxing by the pool. Pool staff were also very attentive.    The rooms were a little out dated so didn't quite feel like a 5 star but they were a good size comfortable and clean.    Overall my wife and I had a fantastic time and would defiantly recommend the hotel to others.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PunitP_11

We read some of the other reviews and can confimr that this was an overwhelming welcome by the fantastic doorman Saad. From the moment he brought over the scented water to wash your hands followed by the mint tea we knew that this would be a great trip.  We contacted the hotel in advance and the Concierge Youssef and his team made sure that we were well looked after and well prepared.His advice was sound and help with taxi fares and the Marrakech way of doing things was invaluable. We often thought that we were being pests but his welcoming demeanour made us feel that nothing was further from the truth.  The Hotel is nicely located to be far enough out of the Medina to get some peace when required but close enough to walk if you need to. The Pool was lovely and the weather a bit hot for us red-heads at 36 celcius.  The fantastic Concierge and his lobby team made us feel so welcome and that nothing was a problem for this Mr. Fix-it including meeting one of the scorer from the previous nights Africans Cup game. We wondered what would happen next.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Bv370 wrote a review Oct 2011,30,Confused / Slightly Dissappointed,Firstly would like to say that the welcome was fantastic we were asked to take a seat and given mint tea..    My wife and I have stayed in many Meridiens around the world and was quite disappointed throughout the week..    On day one (monday) we went for the breakfast which had a fine selection of bread and fruit - we had to ask three different waiters for tea and coffee and when it did arrive to our table we had almost finished the breakfast and the tea and coffee was just placed on the table in three jugs which we had to open and work out which was which.. fantastic fresh roses were also placed in the middle of the table.. (i will comment on the roses later again) - we sat at the back near childrens high chairs which had crumbs on the seat.    The pool area was great and the pool guy was very nice so hats off to him he placed towels down on chairs and arranged the umbrella. Pool was very cold - many people avoided it.    for lunch we tried the pizza at the Al Bikhra in the afternoon - i wanted a very simple pizza which was not on the menu after describing it for ages he finally got it smiled and walked away - 10mins later he brings a pizza which i had not ordered and when i questioned him he bought me the menu and pointed out a pizza to me - which i didnt even order.. but i ate it as i was hungry and picked the toppings off. Language is bit of an issue especially in the restaurants..    Day two for breakfast same story - tea and coffee to took ages. this time i thought i would try some eggs and the morrocan pancakes.. i wanted a hot fresh pancake but was told to take a previously cooked one which had now gone cold.. we sat on the same table - it was the same roses which were wilting slightly and the crumbs on the high chair was still there..    The beds were fantastic - big and comfortable.. however the AirCon a huge disappointment made alot of noise throughout the night..but we needed it on at all times as it got very hot.    we thought we would try out the bar - understandably the hotel has to keep prices in line with competition but the prices for a bottle of heinekin was phenominal    Day Three breakfast got slightly better.. tea and coffee came on time however the same roses were on that table wilting heavily and the crumbs on the high chair was still there.. I was hoping that freshly cooked food varied..    We ate the morrocon restaurant next to breakfast area for dinner and the chicken brochette i ate was fantastic but not a big vegetarian range for the missus. cous cous was very poor.    Breakfast Day Four.. tea and coffee on time - the roses were completely dead with caterpillars on them and the crumbs still on the high chair..    Overall - the hotel claims to be 4/5 * hotel however i would give it 3 pushing 4 - it has the potential to do much much better - i couldnt help feel that whilst there was alot of effort put in to make the hotel look pretty there was not an equal amount of time and money put in the maintanance and simple training menthods..    the showers are dated A/C doesnt work properly and the waiters need to be consistent especially in the breakfast area..    I want to say the hotel is fantastic great phenominal - but i just cant.. I am sure in the coming years it will improve with growing competition in the area..,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bhav370

The hotel is generally of a 3 star standard with a few 4 star touches here and there. I got a deal on the hotel but still feel I have paid over the top prices.

The gardens are awesome. The food is delicious. The hot tea we had every morning was perfect! Except for the concierge nobody tried to upsell anything to us.

The hotel was very nice not to the five stars we are used to in places like Dubai and Malaysia but nice enough. On arrival we were given an upgrade to a deluxe room with a terrace. The room was very clean but again not to a five star standard.  The breakfast had little choice and the hot choice was quite basic.  Saying this what made the stay a wonderful experience were the staff. What they did do was make us feel at home. They would stop you sometimes to have a chat or point out something funny They would argue with taxi drivers for you to get the price prices they would even remember how you liked your tea in the morning. We would find nice little touches in the room like the cleaner deciding that your toiletries were getting wet so wiping them and placing them on tissues or placing your reading glasses back in your case so you would not lose them. At the pool the attendant would notice that you were approaching a lounger and would be there promptly with towels insisting that he lay the towels out and adjust the sun umbrella to your liking. Finally we would also like to thank Said a member of the front staff for his genuine warmth and humour. He epitomises the true Moroccan nature towards other people. We will certainly be going back regularly from now on.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CosmicTrader

It is only 20 minutes away to Marrakesh and it was a very safe walk going to and back from the main souk in Jemaa el Fnaa main square to the hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Taxi-Tino wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Room a bit tired but overall a great hotel,Stayed three nights at the beginning of my Morocco trip. This hotel is a great choice. Close to airport (paid 80 Dirhams for a cab from airport - 50 to the airport) bus and rail stations and still walking distance to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. We grabbed a cab from outside the hotel once and got a fair price (20 Dirham should be the going rate inside the city). I diasgree with other posts claiming that this is a 3 star hotel - although the room would benefit from some tender loving care (or just a trained building painter) it is perfectly adequate and hotel gardens lobby staff and service is what I expect from a 5 star hotel. Check in was fast porter gave good information about the hotel and area (including fair taxi prices) room was big and had a good bath room with separate wc. Flatscreen tv minibar safe (free) a fruit basket (SPG bonus?) free wifi (join the SPG program to benefit from that) slippers and bath robes. Concierge was helpful and booked us a car for the day in last minute. Receptionists seemed busy but were all professional. No problems with the billing - when SPG membership was mentioned all wifi fees were taken away. Hotel has several restaurants and a great piano bar. Pool area is good and we always found a free chair and umbrellas. Pool towels are provided. Breakfast is good and has pancake and egg stations. There is fruit bread pastries hot soup and other warm dishes plus youghurt and water and juice. Staff is helpful and bring you coffee or tea with little waiting time. We found a good deal on the hotel's website and paid 980 Dirhams a night only including breakfast. For that price this hotel is a true bargain.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Daisy5678 wrote a review Aug 2011,40,Very friendly and relaxing,We stayed here for 8 nights in July. We were looking to relax and enjoy the sunshine in typical Morrorcan surroungings with 21st century mod cons.  Our room was large with patio doors onto a small terrace overlooking the beautiful gardens. It had a modern flat screen tv a safe and a small fridge. The fridge was worth its weight in gold as it was 45 degrees outside and cold water was a must have. The air con in the room was very old and not very efficent but did help a little. The decor and furnishings in the room were rather tired and could do with a make over. The public areas of the hotel however are very nice and have a lovely morrorcan flavour to them.  The pool area is very pretty the gardens are well kept and have water features and fountains which are lit up with morrorcan laterns at night.  The staff are very welcoming and very very helpful particularly Said the doorman who couldn't do enought for his guests. He made a taxi driver return to the hotel to refund money to us as we had been over charged on the journey from the airport he gave us very helpful tips on where to go and how much to pay for taxis he also gave us recommendations for some very nice restaurants. Particularly La Trattoria de Giancarlo which was so lovely we returned a second time.  Breakfast was buffet style with the usual fruit cold meat and cheese yogurt etc. with the addition of morrocan pancakes and flatbreads made to order and an omlette chef. Tea and coffee were served to the table with mineral water and cold juices available to help yourself. Breakfast was a pleasant experience and all the waiting staff were very friendly. The restaurant manager made a big effort to speak with the guests and was very good with the children.  Marrakesh is a facinating place but its not for everyone. Do your research to make sure its the place for you. Le meridien is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the medina and is a relief from the mayhem.  Be aware the hotels here are not up to the standard of other countries and 5 star here is probably only 3 star eleswhere at best.  There are 3 very nice bar/restaurants 200 yards from the front door which are great to walk to for lunch or dinner or just to sit outside and watch the mayhem pass you by.  There is also a small supermarket across the road it looks very old and dirty but is ok once inside and stocks everything from shampoo to biscuits and is the best place to stock up on cold water and soft drinks at a fraction of the price to the hotel.  Overall a nice hotel in lovely surroundings with very friendly staff not 5 star but comfortable and relaxing with a lovely pool.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fife, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daisy5678
Le Meridien N'Fis,travelmonkey07 wrote a review Aug 2011,40,Nice stay in a more than decent hotel,Had a fab week in Marrakech. Wanted a location outside the centre and with a good pool and the Meridien fits the bill perfectly.    Impressed with the staff. Always very helpful and professional. Also liked the fact that they were approachable enough to joke with you and share a laugh.    The rooms are not really 5*. I'd booked an executive room and also qualified for an upgrade as a platinum member but the room was pretty average. That said for this stay I didn't really need anything flash.    The air condition could be improved both in the rooms and in particular in the gym.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Sarah P wrote a review Aug 2011,40,"Good hotel and a great stay, but it's not 5*",Stayed with a group of 6 girlfriends in July. Got a good-priced package deal with BA and first impressions were good the reception area was very nice and staff very welcoming although check-in was a little slow. The rooms were a good size but the furniture was pretty basic and the decorating poorly finished - they were probably more like what you would expect in a 3* hotel. The bathroom was clean and the shower nice and powerful. The safe in the room was very old and it took two visits from someone before we could get ours to work. We also had to ask for bathrobes as although the website says the rooms have these they aren't automatically in your bathroom and you have to call housekeeping. There is a charge for wi-fi but if you are a Starwood Preferred Guest member they will give you this for free (you have to charge it to your room and they then take it off the bill - they did this automatically for both my friend and I - and she only signed up when we were there). The bedroom floors were tiled and it felt you could often hear furniture being scraped around in the room above us there was also quite a lot of noise from the corridoors.    We didn't think our BA package inclued breakfast but they told us breakfast was included when we checked in. The breakfast buffet was ok but notihng amazing and we only bothered to get up for it on our first morning.    The gardens at the hotel were lovely as was the pool although it wasn't always easy to get a sunbed. Unfortunately there was the usual problem of people reserving beds and not using them for hours which the pool staff could do more to crack down on. There was at least a good turnover of people coming and going during the day so beds did free up but always got taken pretty quickly. I didn't try the gym but one of my friends did and said it wasn't air conditioned so very hot.    The hotel felt pretty quiet in the evenings and we only ever stopped for a drink before heading out the main hotel bar was rather dark and had no outdoor space so we preferred to visit the outdoor bars although service could be rather slow (however we discovered that this seemed to be the norm in Marrakech). We only ate at the poolside restaurant which was fine they didn't serve anything too adventurous but it was good.    The hotel was very well located it was probably a 15-20min walk to the Medina and we were really glad to escape the hustle and bustle of there and head back to relax by the pool at the Meridien. Certainly in the summer I wouldn't have wanted to stay in a riad in the centre. Taxis were easy to come by and very cheap although you did feel like you were taking your lives into your hands every time you got into one. Definitely make sure you agree the price in advance and stand firm as the taxi drivers think nothing of changing the price when you arrive.    We dined at Le Comptoir Cafe de la Poste and Bo'Zin and thoroughly enjoyed all of them particularly as each one was so different.    Overall I'd definitely recommend Le Meridien n'Fis as long as you are looking for a reasonably priced functional hotel and not the lap of luxury (try the Mamounia for that it was gorgeous). Finally thanks to Said and all the doormen who were so helpful and friendly and did a great job getting us many a taxi.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parksysp
Le Meridien N'Fis,010101 wrote a review Aug 2011,30,great stay but very dated decor,We stayed for 4 nights at the hotel and had a great time however the hotel is very dated and my first impression from the bedroom was that I was in a 2 star hotel. Very very dated with sparce walls and a noisey weak air conditioning unit. If there was no printed literature in the room with Le Meridien on it there is no way you would remember you actually booked it and get mixed up with something half the price. The main dining area is used for breakfast and again very dated from the table cloths to the nearly blue coloured tiled floor. Like something from the early 80's but lots of variety at breakfast time and the freshly squeezed orange juice is fab. The pool area is kept clean and tidy and the service is good in the hotel also.    If your looking for something modern and chic dont stay here .  Wasn't what we expected associated with the Le Meridien brand.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,inverness,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/010101
Le Meridien N'Fis,RiflemanWellington wrote a review Jul 2011,50,Excellent Hotel,Le Meridien N'Fis is an excellent hotel located close to both the airport and the more importantly the Medina making it perfect when wanting to explore either on foot or by taxi horsedrawan cart or the hop on / hop off bus. The staff were welcoming from the begining to the end of my stay and the gardens surrounding the hotel are fantastic. The rooms are spacious though a little dated but have all amenities required. The breakfast is one of the best I have experienced from all the hotels I have stayed at before and the hotel has 3 other restaurants to choose from plus the bar which also does meals. The hotel is located approximately 25 to 30 minutes walk from the Medina which is a straight line walk up one of the main avenues so no concerns with getting lost as the Koutoubia Mosque stands out as the main main landmark when heading to the Medina which has the souks and the Jma El Fna. The tourist hop on / hop off bus also stops on the road directly in front of the Le Meriden and passes every 20 to 30 minutes or the staff will get a taxi and negotiate the proper price. Overall a great experience at the hotel and fully recommend it to travelers.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Wellington, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiflemanWellington
Le Meridien N'Fis,RonWamberal wrote a review Jul 2011,40,An unexpected luxury,It was our first time in Morocco so wasn't sure what to expect but Le Meridien was not it - it seemed closer to a luxury resort than my perceptions allowed.  The room was spacious and the pool area was wonderful.  We probably found the real Morocco when we walked the 20 minutes into the medina and the market area so we probably had the best of both worlds.  The contrast was quite stark but we did enjoy the relaxing nature of the resort after a hectic few weeks of travelling.  I did enjoy the pool as few of the hotels we had enjoyed in Europe have such facilities and I was really mssing my daily routines.  On the first night we returned to the market area for what was described as the best food in Marrakech but the second night we had dinner in the hotel's dining room and was just as impressed.  We loved the food in Morocco and had no problems with the food inhouse.  I had a couple of challenges with little problems in the hotel (lights etc) and the Duty Manager went out of his way to meet my needs - most impressed by the service.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
Le Meridien N'Fis,KunaalT wrote a review Jul 2011,50,"Marhaba Marrakesh, I loved it and will be back.",Excellent hotel and the staff are what make it the best. They will do anything for you. I wanted Pizza Hut ordered to the hotel and the staff were more than happy to help even though one of the younger inexperienced girls told me I can't order food to the hotel unless it's from the hotel but the senior concierge member soon sorted her out lol.    We booked dinner reservations at Comptoir Dana which is walking distance from the hotel. We also booked taxis the hotel was always efficient and helped us with anything. My only drawback is that they do not serve shisha until the evening or afternoon which is a bit of a shame as I was ready to spend my money there.    I also went for a message at the hotel and it cost about £20 which is quite pricey and the same price as London it only lasted 20 minutes but totally felt a lot shorter! The massage was not that brilliant as you could tell the lady was only in it for the money and not intent on actually giving you a good massage. You can get a cheaper massage from a spice shop in the souk and they only charge you £2 but it is soooooo much better and it's about 10-15 minutes.    Overall this was one of the best places I have stayed in and value for money. They have a few things that they need to work on. Better massages in the spa shisha served all day. But apart from that the front desk team are the most solid members you will encounter in the hotel industry. They know how to serve you and they aim to please. Well done!!!    The rooms were fantastic and the neighborhood (Hivernage) is a very nice area lot's of cash points around do not go for a walk alone at night as there are street kids that tend to look for tourists but I felt completely safe. You can even walk to Gueliz which we did on one occasion but I must warn you that it looks a lot shorter than it is!,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KunaalT
Le Meridien N'Fis,VancouverCDN_travlr wrote a review Jul 2011,40,Aging Property but Good Location and Gracious Service,We booked at Le Meridien N'Fis at the very last minute as our stay in a traditional riad was not working out. There isn't too much that's authentically Morroccan about this hotel - it's a typical (albeit aging) resort. The pool area is large and comfortable but the rooms are spartan and the hallways are unnecessarily dark. Despite that the hotel was a great base from which to see the sights of Marrakech. Because every taxi driver knows the hotel we were easily able to get dropped off at the souks wander around get completely lost hop back into a taxi and head back. It is close to Jemaa al Fnaa and all the trendy lounges and bars. Service was also mostly very friendly.,Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Vancouver,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VancouverCDN_travlr
Le Meridien N'Fis,dinarae wrote a review Jul 2011,50,Pampered with 5 Star Service,My Sister and I visited the Le Meridien N'Fis in June on the front side of our trip for 5 nights and the back side for one more night. Although not the same experience as a Riad in the Medina...this was a perfrect retreat! We kicked off the trip with a pick up at the Airport which I would recommend convenient and 200 DH about $25 USD. Upon entering the hotel we were greeted with a warm welcome by Said with tea and a cold wash cloth that smelled of orange bloosom. We were escorted to a room on the lower level facing the backside of the property. The rooms were fine... nothing special (would recommend a bit of an upgrade) but who spends all of their time in the room? Not me! The property is beautiful fountains and gardens with amazing smells and the pool a perfect way to end a long day touring. To top it off while we visited we got to witness a full lunar eclipse while on property. The buffet breakfast is stellar but a bit spendy $25 per person. Wish they had a price for hot or cold buffet but despite that the food was good and the service was attentive. Speaking of attentive the Pool Restaurant at night is worth having a meal. The Manager My Ahmid Jounainate welcomes you like an old friend the Chef Hicham was great! He was very accomodating and willing to make anything we requested. He did this with a smile as if you were in his own home and family. There was a lovely man also working who always greeted us with a smile another my ahmid. Try the Moroccan wine it is good - liked the white from Meknes Region (crisp nice acidity which cleans the palet well with the flavor of Morocco). I will admit we ate here a few nights because it was relaxing great service and nice ambiance near the pool. The Staff at the front desk was great... need help ask coincierge Youssef. He was amazing and funny too. The men at the money change were also very pleasant (so sorry wrote your names down but can't find it). The staff is great at helping guide you on taxi fares so be sure to partner with them. FYI the hotel is walking distance to the Medina (15 minutes) but Taxis were inexpensive 20-30 DH on average. My sister had a spa treatment a bit pricey but paying for the convenience of the Hotel. Don't expect a western style treatment it is Morocco. My sister was a bit disappointed and the Manager Khalid Jamal was intent in ensuring her experience was improved next time. He extended a complimentary Hamman and Massage. I was impressed with his ownership in ensuring his guests are happy and satisfied. The Hotel also had heightened security with gates closed security on site I felt very safe! My sister and I left for an adventure through South Morocco (highly recommend) and upon our return we were greeted like returning family. All fo the staff remembered us and again we were greeted with a warm welcome back. If you are looking for a quite relaxing hotel with outstanding service I would highly recommend Le Meridien N'Fis.

We did receive an new room for the second night but this didn't come easily. We also tried to get spa reservations but they said there were no openings even though the book was empty.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Tktimes2 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,A weekend to remember!,We went as a group of 4 my wife mother in law my mum and me. This was a very late mothers day present and we wanted to do something special for our Mum's. Prior to getting there we contacted the hotel and were put in touch with Sabah in housekeeping who was attentive and prompt in e-mail response and organized a very special room decoration that made the Mums feel very special.    This level of attention was matched by all the staff at the hotel from the guards who will order a taxi for you the concierge the reception staff pool boys cleaners. All will do anything to make you feel comfortable and do it with a smile. I managed to get by communicating to the non english speaking staff with my very basic GCSE level French which says more about their english than my French. Not a problem at all.    The entrance is grand the décor very good. Once we got the room we were a little underwhelmed compared to what the décor is like in the rest of the hotel.    I’d suggest they need sprucing up a bit. Despite this both rooms were big beds comfortable and everything worked fine in them.    It is a family friendly hotel very quiet not one rowdy guest while we stayed there far away from the hustle and bustle of the square and near enough for it not to be a pain to get around town without burning a hole in your pocket.    Our A/c was a little bit noisy and not as cold as it should have been the Mum’s was fine. As my wife and I were on the brink of a cold the temperate room was ideal and based on the service we received if we did complain I’m sure they would have changed the room without a problem.    The breakfast was great fresh sweet fruit fresh orange juice egg and pancake stations and to top it off a wide selection of fresh breads.    On our first day we ate lunch at the pool bar a good selection of food which we all enjoyed.    We planned to go to a restaurant in town for dinner but after a heavy downpour decided to eat at the hotel. We went to the Moroccan restaurant the tagines brochettes and soup were brilliant but very pricey. We don’t drink alcohol and still paid close to £25 per head without desert.        The ladies were keen on going for a massage. Again very pricey in the hotel even with the offer of buy one get the second half price they paid £38 each for a 45 min massage which was enjoyed nonetheless.        We found the transport to and from the hotel fairly priced. We had to use the big taxis wherever we went. To and from the airport cost 100 MAD a taxi into the main square cost 30 MAD. The hotel staff were accurate in their estimations and gave good guidelines as to what to pay.    Outside the hotel across the road there are a couple of small mini supermarkets that sell water drinks crisps etc and a small walk later a couple of café/ bars that serve good food suitable for lunch at half the cost of the hotel.        My highlight of the holiday was the experience in the Djemaa el Fnaa square. An incredible place. 6 hours just passed so quickly. Everything you read about it is true shops galore people will try and sell you anything just have your wits about you and haggle.        All in all a fantastic holiday one with memories we will cherish for a long while and the main reason for that was the staff and service at the hotel. Marrakech is a wonderful place and when we return we see no reason not to stay at the Meridien N’fis.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tktimes2

In terms of location it is a 20 min or so walk from the main square which is a blessing if you are looking for a place to relax.  The added bonus of the location is that the city tour bus stops right outside.  The hotel itself is very nice. The staff couldnt do enough for you and spoke in English even though the majority if guests were French speaking.  Breakfast was great & the food in the hotel restuarants was top notch. The Monkfish & Prawn ravine in the Moroccan restuarant is highly recommended.  The pool is wonderful & cooling and there is no issues with getting a lounger. The pool attendants are fantastically attentive and will always find space for you.    Overall a fantastic hotel with spacious and well decorated rooms (ours certainly was).

Le Meridien N'Fis,Bislett wrote a review Jun 2011,40,Great hotel in Marrakech,We stayed at the N'Fis for one week in the fall of 2010.    The hotel has a good location in the newer part of the city and only 10-15 minutes drive from the airport. Walking distance to the medina with Djemaa el fna and the souks is about 15-20 minutes. A taxi to the Djemaa el fna is 30 DM according to the hotel staff. The staff are helpful arranging taxi and settle the price. In the medina the taxis will try to ask for more but we stayed firm and got prices at 30-40 DM.    The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.    The hotel grounds with the gardens and pool area is very nice indeed. We enjoyed lunch there when staying at the pool. Breakfast is also very good and a lot to choose from. The freshly made omelets can be recommended and the same goes for the local pancakes :-)    We had a superior room and it was very spacious. We had no minibar but we discovered a grocery and liquor store on the other side of the road. It it a bit hidden in a short backyard so you have to look a bit to find it.    The tourist bus stops in front of the hotel and is quite handy to get around in the town with hop-on and off as you like.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Bridget_Guernsey wrote a review Jun 2011,40,"Not as posh as I expected, but very nice...",Myself and my two young (7 and 9) daughters have just returned from 5 nights at Le Meridien N'Fis. To be quite honest in reality the hotel looked really NOTHING like the pictures in the brochure especially our bedroom which may as well have been in another hotel. Our room was frankly tired and very basic although clean and comfortable enough. However when one has paid a certain amount of money on the basis of the website and brochure it is disappointing to find that what you have got for one's money is not what you expected. However we had a pleasant enough time and importantly we felt safe.    The pool is great and contrary to many others' feelings on this website I found the temperature just right. When the heat is 30 degrees in the shade you don't want a warm bath anyway (well I don't). My children spent hours in the pool and there were plenty of sun beds to go around (although clearly the hotel wasn't even half full so I don't know what happens in busy times).    As everyone else has mentioned the breakfast was great. There is a wide selection of just about everything you can think of. There is also a lovely canopied lounge area where you can sit to eat and my children were delighted by the numerous little sparrows that came begging for crumbs every morning!    The gardens as mentioned frequently are lovely especially in early evening when the birds are returning to roost in the numerous trees and shrubs in their hundreds. The noise of birdsong is quite spectacular although admittedly the most exotic bird I saw was a starling!    Other than breakfast we found the food on offer very limited - either a Moroccan restaurant or a very overpriced 'Italian' beach style bar next to the pool. I would not recommend eating at the hotel unless desperate.    I did detect a slight lack of staff enthusiasm which was generally vaguely irksome. Nobody came to offer drinks snacks or sunbeds around the pool (or if they did it was only after about half an hour or more) - one had to make a very concerted effort to acquire anything and then the attitude was sluggish and somewhat half-hearted. It is a shame because a slightly more enthusiastic approach would probably result in happier guests and more tips for staff.    A lot of people have commented on the chaos of Marrakech which is correct but isn't that what we go for? It IS chaotic but then anyone who goes there expecting anything different can't have much idea of what goes on in the world. Marrakech is a melting-pot of cultural collisions it is baking hot poor polluted riotously noisy very heavily populated and virtually the whole clamouring mayhem revolves around relieving you (the tourist) of your money whether by fair means or foul. That's the top and bottom of it.    TIP FOR SINGLE MOTHERS: Local men will be perplexed by your status. I was questioned several times during my short visit by flummoxed men including a fairly robust interrogation by one of our tour guides as to how I could conceivably be on holiday alone with my two children WITH NO HUSBAND! It really was quite tiresome - I had imagined that the fairly liberal Moroccans would have got past this Victorian attitude even if they are still a male dominated society.    Overall we had an enjoyable trip.

The hotel works very hard to ensure you have a good holiday and seemed always willing to help with anything.

Le Meridien N'Fis,MarjorieS wrote a review May 2011,40,Don't leave the hotel!,This hotel is very nice. We stayed just 2 nights as a romantic break while in Morrocco. The pool is amazing but was a bit disappointed that I had to pay 150 MAD for the nice four poster sunbeds! The Gardens were beautiful and every morning we were woken by beautiful birdsong and heavenly scents!  The restaurants were certainly an experience. We first tried the Italian restuarant which was the wrong thing to do in Morrocco! My other half ordered Risotto and got basmati rice instead. I ordered Crostini and got toast and pate instead! After a disappointing meal we were struck with a pretty pricey bill at the end. The Morroccan restaurant on the other hand was lovely! The food was really nice but we were so full after just one course. The Morroccan wine was yummy too!  The service was ok here - nobody spoke a lot of english which made me feel a bit stressed. I had the Hammam treatment in the spa which I thought was too expensive for what it was.  What's really nice here is that you get passes to Jardin Majorelle - this was a really nice experience! We also went to Djema El Fna where we were covered in Henna and Snakes!! Just make sure you give them about a third of what they ask for!!!  Overall we left this hotel feeling really relaxed and revived but I think if we came back we would just stay in the hotel and not go out - it's too stressful out there!,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieSun

Le Meridien N'Fis,Ifzaal wrote a review May 2011,50,EXCELLENT HOTEL AND EVEN BETTER STAFF,To all the wonderful staff at Le Meridien N’Fis  Our eagerly awaited family holiday to Marrakech was but in jeopardy by the bomb blast in the Market Square only 2 days before our departure.  We reluctantly decided to fly out to Marrakech and make something from the holiday.  We returned full of admiration to the Marrakech people and especially to the Le’Meridien hotel staff.  They were excellent in the hospitality. Just to name a few…  From the helpful security guards Hussein and hastein to the concierge Said who were helpful every single day.  Breakfast was fantastic and aided by Miftah and his team including Ghizlane.  AbdelQader at the pool restaurant was always very welcoming.  Overall we acknowledge the great attitude shown towards us and especially towards our children Eesah & Ibrahim by the hotel staff.  Its not everyday that you can say that we felt at home at a hotel but we can say that for Le Meridien N’Fis hotel.  Overall a wonderful hotel with great staff.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Graz-London wrote a review May 2011,40,"Good hotel, pleased with my stay",I stayed at the Le Meridien for 4 nights and was quite pleased with the hotel in general. Service was very good staff was very helpful with everything I needed.  Breakfast is excellent really good with lots of fresh fruit bread cooked breakfast cereal yoghurt there were many options!  The room and bathroom were spacious and clean but not as moderm as I expected. The gardens are very nicely kept and really pretty and so is the pool area.  My complaint is that there is no free wi-fi. In my opinion nowadays hotels 4 stars and over should offer free wifi. Instead you had to pay for it and it was not cheap.  Hotel is not as close to the old/new city as I expected. It is at least 15 min walk to each as the blocks are quite long but taxi rides were about 30 dirhams for a small cab and 50 for a large one.  One thing is that the hotel doesn't have many options on rainy days such as a games room and it rained a lot while I was in Marrakech.  In general it was a good hotel and I recommend it.,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Graz-London

Excellent breakfast plenty of fresh juices fruit pastries etc. This is classed as a five star hotel and the rating matches the available facilities. However the rooms are a little tired and need updating. Towels were on the small side and toiletries were in stiff plastic bottles which were difficult to squeeze (petty I know but annoying) . Prices shown on pool drinks list were inaccurate so check before you buy. Taxis to the centre are MAD 20 do not pay more during the day - usually double at night.

Le Meridien N'Fis,soniavbuk wrote a review Apr 2011,40,Marrakesh Easter break,I have just returned from one week at Le Meridien N'Fis in Marrakesh.    The holiday was booked through Expedia and I had read previous reviews of the hotel on Trip advisor before confirming the booking so I had a good idea of what to expect.    The hotel was very close to the airport a 10 min taxi ride which should cost 70 - 80 Dhs but you were not disturbed by aircraft landing or taking off during the day or evening.    The hotel is french but everyone speaks very good english. The hotel has 3 accomodation wings which are either accessible from the main reception area or via their lovely gardens. The hotel has a lot of grounds and it feels very spacious. There is a lovely rose garden and water pools to walk around in the courtyard area.    The pool area is large and never seemed crowded. There were always enough sun beds for the guests and the pool attendant kept the place in order. The pool was very cold but used by many guests as it was hot most days we were there. There is also a small childrens pool ajoining the main swimming area for families.    There are 4 restaurtants one used for breakfast or private functions in the evenings one with a Morocan theme with live music played each evening one with a Mediteranean theme and a pool side restautant serving the same menu as the Mediteranean restuarant. Therefore you have a choice of inside or outside dining in the evening depending on the weather.    We ate in all restaurants for either breakfast lunch or dinner. The food was always of a very high standard but it was not cheap. It was very much London prices but always very good. The major concern was the service. All restaurants at all times were very slow to serve and somewhat chaotic. If you are prepared to wait a very long time to be served it is worth the wait but every day we saw complaints from guests from many nationalities about the chaotic service. The poor waiters seem very frustrated it is the front of house management staff that just cant seem to get their act together.    Despite all this I would still recommend the hotel. The gardens are beautiful there is a small gym which my husband used and a clay tennis court which we used every day. You can book an hour tennis slot between 8 am and 7pm and the courts are free of charge. We took our own racquests and balls but I think they have some you can borrow or rent. There were 2 french tennis coaches available if you wanted them and they regularly raked and rollered the tennis court so that it was in very good condition.    There is also a small spa where you can have a Hamman or massage and other beauty treatments. We were able to book a day in advance so the place was not crowded. Again it was not cheap mainly London prices again but very good.    The bedroom was OK nothing special no balcony a little tired as the hotel is very established but it was very functional. There were 2 computers available in their business centre if you wanted to access the internet. There are daily or weekly options to purchase the access.    To get to the city you could walk its about 20 - 30 mins or take a taxi. We ate in the hotel 4 out of 7 nights but on the nights we went out the hotel recommended some very nice restaurants that were in walking distance from the hotel.    If you want to do a city tour the open top tour bus stops right outside the hotel every 30 mins so you can hop on and off using a 24 or 48 hour pass and easily access other parts of the city.    There is also a night club associated with the hotel and as residents you can access this for free. We went one evening but things dont get going until 2am so you need to plan for a late evening!! They also have an active hotel bar with live entertainment early in the evening for pre dinner drinks and some nights of the week they have a DJ entertaining the guests into the small hours.    If you want to stay somewhere a little out of the old town that has lovely gardens so you can chill out during the day catch some sun read a book by the pool and relax then this is a good recommendation.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Walton-On-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soniavbuk
Le Meridien N'Fis,letsgofire wrote a review Apr 2011,50,Oasis away from chaos of Marrakech,I enjoyed my stay at Le Meridien and would recommend it to others.    We arrived early to the hotel on our arrival day but was still permitted to check in right away. They upgraded our room to a suite because I have SPG Platinum status which was great. The suite was nice very spacious with a large bathroom. It wasn't a hip or stylish suite but very comfortable and pleasant nonetheless.    This is a very affordable hotel - not sure why so many have been remarking about how expensive everything is. You can get low priced meals and wine from all but their fanciest restaurant. We paid 10-15 GBP I think at most for each dish. Granted this is a 5-star hotel so you should expect prices to be on the high side. I'm sure there are cheaper alternatives out there but I found things here to be reasonable. Food is okay there - would recommend you go outside for most meals if you can. Breakfast was okay; would have liked the things such as scrambled eggs to taste a bit more Western but that's my preference.    The staff is very friendly and warm and we were impressed by their service. The concierge staff was also helpful.    In terms of location this hotel is largely by itself. It is a short taxi ride (on the hilariously run-down Marrakech taxis) to the main square and other sights. We actually walked almost all the time though because to get to the main square you just take one road straight there. That road is well lit and has other people on it so you feel safe. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the edge of the old city (where the Mamounia hotel is) and then perhaps another 10 to get to the heart of the main square. Other restaurants and shopping in the New City are about 10-15 minutes away on foot.    I found this location to be excellent. Marrakech is a crazy city and very chaotic. It was so nice to return to our hotel to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet. I originally thought I would like an interesting riad right in the middle of the action but once I came to Marrakech I was very thankful I booked Le Meridien instead    Some other random thoughts: the pool is very nice the fitness center is small and the spa is very good but not as great as places like Le Maison Arabe,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/letsgofire

We dined at every one of the resturants and whether it was the complimentary breakfast a quick pool side snack or fine dinner the food service and prices were exceptional.

The rooms were a bit small but we did not spend much time there except to sleep. Service was top notch - check in concierge exchange maid and all other staff were warm polite and welcoming. Definitely the place to stay on our next visit.

Le Meridien N'Fis,aph87 wrote a review Apr 2011,50,"An incredible, memorable stay--especially the people.",I cannot say enough good things about Le Meridien N'Fis! We were three women (between 24 and 34 years old) who visited for 3 days and 2 nights. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful (especially at night when everything is lit up) the on-site restaurants were all excellent and reasonably priced the room was comfortable and included a patio with a view of the gardens the location was great--just a few minutes cab ride from Jma el fna (the main square) and not expensive if you settle on your cab fare with the driver before hand (we always did 20 dhs).    Above all the service at very moment and in every aspect was EXCELLENT. That is what truly made this a memorable stay. Everyone was so so gracious and welcoming from Said waiting at the gate to welcome you in to the porter who helped us with our bags to Fatima at the front desk (and on the phone before hand when I confirmed my room) to Youssef the concierge to the ladies who kept our rooms clean and tidy and finally the waiters at each restaurant. The service was just exceptional I felt welcomed and comfortable at every moment. Everyone was so helpful and truly cared that we enjoyed our stay in Marrakech and at Le Meridien.    Additionally as I mentioned above the restaurants were all very good (and again the best service). We ate at the Italian and at the Moroccan restaurants. My sister took a trip to the spa (the best deal is to get the entire package not only luxurious but also cost-effective!) she said the facial and massage she received were some of the best she's ever had. They also have tennis courts and you can set up a time to practice or play with an on site trainer; there is a pool with plenty of chairs and lounges to sit at. At night there are bars and a hookah lounge with live music and performances. The hotel is quaint during the day and breathtaking in the evening. Don't hesitate to ask the staff for help or recommendations at any time.

We chose this hotel again because of the wonderful Said and there he was again to greet us in his inimitable way. He is such a help to everyone and always smiling. He called us a taxi and told us how much we should pay which is such a help as taxi drivers often say when you ask 'how much' they say now much you want to pay and usually ask for at least double what Said has told us to pay. Last year Said stopped us being fleeced by a taxi when I foollishly gave Euro's instead of Dirhams and the driver turned a bit nasty but Said got me my money back. I do hope that the management at Le Meridien appreciate what an asset he is to their hotel.  The hotel itself is super a great location away from the hustle and bustle but only a short £2 taxi drive away from the Souks. The breakfast is great and sets you up for the day and the pool area is lovely with plenty of sunbeds.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Lanaj47 wrote a review Apr 2011,50,A friendly and hospitable place to stay,We stayed at the N'Fis for six days - partly on starwood points - part paying. I had read some negative reviews prior to our stay and have to admit i am rather bemused at the complaints of bad service and poor rooms. For someone to rate this hotel at no more than a 3 star is bizarre. Five star covers a range of hotels and this hotel is certainly not at the top - nor would it claim to be - but if that's what someone wants they go to the Four Seasons and pay at least five times the rate - and don't even think about the cost of a meal at a Four Seasons restaurants if you think the restaurants here are expensive.    Which brings me to the complaints about the food prices - the prices were comparable with other places catering to European tourists. Even the Moroccan restaurant nearby charged similar prices for very average food and five minutes of a mediocre belly dancer. On the other hand the Moroccan meal we had at the hotel was a much higher quality and we were entertained by proper local musicians. In any case if the food is too expensive for someone there is no shortage of places to eat good food on a budget outside the hotel.    As to rudeness by staff - I can't imagine any staff member we dealt with being rude so if they were I can only conclude that the guests concerned were themselves behaving badly.    We will certainly go back again. We loved Marrakech and the N'Fis easily met all our needs.    Having travelled extensively and stayed in many hotels ranging from very basic to luxury I found the staff at all times friendly and helpful. The housekeeping and door staff were ever helpful and we had no complaints about the restaurant service.    Otherwise the room was large fresh and clean and although a little sparsely furnished it was more than adequate for its main purpose - sleeping. The gardens are lovely particularly enjoyable in the evening after a day in the Medina.    Anyone who has travelled a lot knows that essentially good service is the most important thing after a decent bed in any hotel and this hotel wins on both. All in all this is one of the better hotels I have stayed at - and at a very reasonable price. My partner and I enjoyed our stay and have no hesitation recommending it.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lanaj47
Le Meridien N'Fis,jameseast722 wrote a review Mar 2011,40,"Nice grounds, decent location!",Stayed at Le Meridien N'fis for 4 nights on 22 March 2011. Hotel is located less than 10 minutes from Marrakech Menara airport and you should be paying in the region of 60 dirhams or £4.50 ish (depending on your haggling skills) for a 'petite' taxi (Peugeot 205 equivalent. That's right it seems all the worlds Peugeot 205's have dodged the scrap yard and ended up in Marrakech).    On arrival at the hotel you are greeted in reception with a very warm welcome hot towel and mint tea making the check in experience straight forward and stress free. The garden and hotel grounds are very well maintained and very pleasing on the eye with a variety of exotic fruit trees and plant species.    We were allocated a refurbished room which after seeing the public areas of the hotel left me with high expectations only to be left somewhat disappointed as they look and feel tired baring in mind this was a refurbished room! However the rooms are very clean and were kept that way throughout our stay with house keeping paying us a visit twice a day!!!    Breakfast was plentiful with variety omelettes Moroccan pancakes cereals fresh fruit fresh juices toast tea and coffee to name but a few and we arrived to breakfast at various times throughout our stay and didn't experience any service difficulties.    The hotel is located approx 20 minutes on foot from the Medina or 5 minutes by taxi at a cost of 20 dirham £1.60 ish each way taxi drivers really will try to inflate the costs so agree a price before you get in the taxi and don't cave in to their Moroccan charm 20 dirham from the hotel to Jaama el Fna square is common place during the day time and expect to pay upto 30 dirham to return back to the hotel after dark. The district of Gueliz is known as the new town of Marrakech and you can expect a more westernised shopping experience in this area again 20 to 30 dirham is ample for a one way taxi ride.    The concierge at the hotel is very accommodating and organised us a car to take us to the Ourika Valley in the Atlas mountains and the village of Sidi Fatma. He organised this at a cost of 1000 dirham from 10:30 to 5:30 which works out at about £80 the vehicle was a mercedes vito people carrier and was very comfortable and the driver spoke very good English I would highly recommend travelling this way as opposed to coach travel as we were able to stop wherever we wanted for photo opportunities and arrived at Sidi Fatma as refreshed as when we left the hotel.    Climbing the mountain from the village to see the water falls is an experience and I would recommend a guide from the village to take you up as the route is very challenging and not for the faint hearted but with a good pair of walking shoes a steady nerve the rewards once you reach the first level of 6 cascading water falls are well worth it. You can opt to climb all the way up to the 6th level but as we were pushed for time..... we chose to descend once we climbed just above the first level! Thankfully if you reach the area just above the first level where a man stands with his ladder to help you up a very precarious section of rock the pathway back down is very gentle in comparison to the climb up.    We spent a few hours around the pool on our final day which was very pleasant and relaxing and had lunch at the pool side bar which was satisfactory but a little over priced in my opinion. We failed to eat at the hotel restaurant on an evening because of the plentiful eateries outside of the hotel.

The hotel was lovely and perfect location between the old town and new town both within walking distance. The staff were very helpful as we lost our bags on the first few days and they made sure we had transport to go and collect them and also contacted the airport for us. The larger rooms are worth paying for as they are very comfortable but they are noisey as you can hear the service trolleys up and down as they are all on the ground floor but you dont get a balcony and somewhere to sit outside if you have a standard room. Pool was lovely but shame we couldnt use it as the weather was awful :o( The food is bad for the prices on the menu the drinks price are also very expensive there is a lovely bar 2 mins walk away which sells a LARGE beer (you wont this in the hotel) and the food there is fantastic out of the hotel and walk right you wont miss it.    perfect hotel but the food let it down,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meloney_hyatt

The doorman ""Said"" welcomed us as we got out of the car took us into the lobby sat us on a sofa to check in bringing us Mint Tea and Hot Towels he then became our friend giving much good advice. The room was on the top floor with a lovely view of the gardens the swimming pool and the back drop of the Atlas Mountains  Breakfast was included in our package and there was always a good choice a little crowded at the week end not so much in the week days  We tried all the restaurants in the hotel the service and food was excellent particularly the Italian that had a Moroccan Spanish singing guitar player that played at our table and a super young waiter who spoke good English and looked after us well  The door man gave the advice of telling the taxi drivers 20Dh from centre to the hotel this worked well and made travel around the city cheap. The open top bus ride was very good to get a feel of the city  It was a pleasure to sit in the well tended gardens and the way they were lit a night was very beautiful  Bar costs are what I would expect in a 5 star hotel if you had a G&T the tonic was included in the price of the Gin Food was a little less than expected Wine was expensive but expected in a Muslim country – the Moroccan Sauvignon was very good @ 370Dh a bottle  If staying for a week would recommend at 4*4 trip to the Atlas Mountains and a coach trip to Essaouira (book this yourself at the railway station much cheaper)  We look forward to our next trip and thank all the staff for making this a memorable stay",Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Gnosall, Staffs",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrunoGnosall_Staffs

From the minute we arrived we were made to feel so welcome. All the staff were friendly but special thanks must go to Youssef the chef concierge. He not only helps to arrange any activities/trips etc but takes a genuine and kindly interest in the enjoyment of your stay.  The buffet-breakfast was a superb start to the day especially the fresh fruit-salad and the pancakes made in front of you.  As previously stated on this site unfortunately the pool was freezing cold and not surprisingly few people ventured in. The gardens were stunning both by day and night.  However by far the highlight of our stay was the cookery class. We can highly recommend it. Mr Abdeljalil's enthusiasm and ability to share his knowledge and love of Moroccan cuisine with us was amazing. We learnt so much and have a happy memory of a wonderful morning.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Hons_Travel wrote a review Feb 2011,40,"Good place, but probably better to stay in a Riad in the old town",Our feeling about this place were more positive than negative:    On the one hand spacious well-designed rooms for a fair price of 120 EUR per night. A very nicely maintained garden with large SPA and uncountable restaurants.    On the other hand you are quite remote from the center place Djemaa el fna (almost 10 minutes by cab). Plus their outdoor swimming pool –one of their principal assets- was too cold to be used.    Helpful and polite front desk/ concierge / bell men. However the day-trip to Essaouira and “Berber Tour-Ourika Valley” were a bit overpriced and not worthwile (only car with driver who were not really competent guides).    So I think as a tourist it is really more intersting to stay at a typical Riad if you are not dependent on splurge amenities.    For dinner we recommend the modern “Bo & Zin” and more typical Restaurant “Al Fassia” (Aguedal district).,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hons_Travel

Le Meridien N'Fis,angb77 wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Luxury Hotel - No Stress here!,"We booked this hotel on the advice of my brother-in-law and we were glad that we did. Marrakech can be a stressful place with everyone out to make money off of you the moment you step out the door. This hotel provides an oasis from all of that. I know many people stay in the riads in Marrakech which obviously provides a different and more authentic experience. However I was glad to have a little sanctuary away from the mayhem.    This hotel has a GORGEOUS luxury pool area and is extremely clean and well decorated. Also the food in the hotel was really fantastic. We had breakfast there every day and lunch a few days as well. The staff was very friendly and accomodating.    We could walk to most of the attractions in Marrakech. The hotel staff was also great about getting us taxis and negotating the price down from the ""normal"" tourist price down to one that is closer to what the locals would pay. This was really appreciated.    My only complaints would be that the hotel room was a bit noisy (in the hallways sound really echos) and the safe in our room did not work. Also they allow smoking inside of the hotel and inside of the restaurant in the hotel (even at breakfast - yuck!) and since I am pregnant this was really a bit annoying. I know it is a cultural thing in Marrakech to smoke a lot everywhere all of the time but it is too bad that included the inside of the hotel as well.    We also had someone who claimed to be a staff member of the hotel approach us as we were walking towards the city walls and offer to be our tour guide. Of course we said no and I am not even sure if he was a staff member of the hotel (I did not recognize him but my husband said he was one of the pool attendants) but if he is a staff member of the hotel I think they should not allow the staff members to try to solicit business from you off-hours; that was kind of weird and awkward.

Le Meridien N'Fis,marmo_uk wrote a review Jan 2011,30,Pool's good,We wanted to stay in a riad in the medina but left booking our trip quite late and all those we wanted to stay at were fully booked. A friend who had been to Marrakech recommended that we try a larger hotel with a pool so that we could escape from the hustle and bustle of the souks and I have to say it was good advice. We were only 20 minutes walk from the centre but could escape back to sit by the pool and chill out in the (generously sized) room. Also worth noting that we felt perfectly safe doing the walk at night time.  The hotel didn't massively disappoint but I did expect more from a Le Meridien. The staff were friendly and were very good when we asked to change rooms as ours was noisy because it was right next to the elevator and had a lot of passing traffic - the next room was nowhere near an elevator but we could still hear people in the corridor through the door. The grounds are pretty and the pool is good. We were pretty disappointed by the choices at breakfast buffet but they did have soy milk. We had a superior room and the size was good - the bed was HUGE - and it had good cupboard space but was quite dated. The minibar is dissapointing - the list was quite long but most of the things on it were missing. The porter/bell boy actually suggested that we go to the supermarket down the road to stock up - I wonder if so many people choose to this they don't bother stocking the mini bar properly?  Because we stayed over New Year we had to take the New Year's Eve dinner which was extraordinarily expensive and not that geat - it was somehing like £260 each and there were no drinks included - not even a bottle of water or a glass of bubbles at midnight - thought that was a bit steep and very stingy!  Would I recommend this hotel? Yes but with some caveats - make sure you get a really good deal because if not you'll feel you've been ripped off and really the only reason to pick it is if you're going to use the pool.,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marmo_uk
Le Meridien N'Fis,rko21 wrote a review Jan 2011,50,"Friendly, clean, great stay",I stayed in this superb hotel with my mother in July 2010 for a week travelling from Gatwick Airport and Royal Air Maroc.    We personally love visiting Arabic countries particularly in North Africa. Being able to speak French and a little Arabic I was at a great advantage with the people of Marrakech as they are mainly bilingual in French and Arabic. Don’t go to Marrakech expecting to get by on just English – not many people I spoke to were competent enough to convey themselves in English. So when it came to bartering for taxi prices with drivers and greeting the incredibly warm friendly and welcoming security door and reception staff at Le Meridien N’Fis it would be in your best interest to learn a little French or Arabic. A taxi from the airport should cost no more than 80-100 Dirhams and a trip to the town should cost no more than 15-20 Dirhams. It’s about a half-hour walk otherwise quite pleasant on a warm night. The reception staff and some of the security on the door at Le Meridien N’Fis however speak great English so there’s no need to worry should any problems occur.    Upon arrival we were seated at reception and served delicious mint tea. They like their mint tea (‘thé à la menthe’ in French / ‘nana shy’ in Arabic) sweet in Morocco – it also helps aid digestion for all the scrumptious food you will be eating in Marrakech!    We stayed in a very clean ground floor room equipped with a nice LCD TV with a few English-American channels. Our room was cleaned everyday around 9am as we left for breakfast. New towels were also given every day. The room also comes equipped with a safe to store belongings.    There is a public computer opposite the sauna/gym rooms should you need access to the internet. The rooms pick up the hotel’s good WiFi service. This was given to us for free as we signed up for their newsletter – ask about this at reception.    The gym is basic with some dumb-bells an exercise mat a multi-gym for weights a few exercise bikes and treadmills.    We stayed bed and breakfast so we could eat out at the amazing awe-inspiring Djema El-Fna in the night.    The breakfast options were fresh vast and most importantly delicious! You will be greeted by chefs cooking tailor-made omelettes ‘meloui’ – a type of Moroccan layered bread and pancakes. Croissants fresh and dried fruits nuts yoghurts cereals tea coffee and milk are all available. There will be some hot breakfast options as well as creatively home-made juices and smoothies by the chef. There were 2 options of these smoothies and juices when I stayed including the gorgeously refreshing strawberry and clove smoothie. The waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly and should you need anything please ask as they want to help you.

It was a nice introduction to the city in that you could get a feel for Morocco without having to navigate the medina. It was a clean pleasant hotel staff was helpful and attentive. They had live folk music at dinner which was very good followed by some belly dancing (which while not Moroccan was enjoyable none the less). We didn’t get to use the pool but it looked really nice too.    This hotel is kinda touristy so if you’re looking for authentic Morocco might look elsewhere if you’re looking for a resort atmosphere I think this is a good value for the money.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BostonTexans
Le Meridien N'Fis,voyageur1980 wrote a review Dec 2010,30,N'Fis was N'Miss.,Our trip to Marrakech had been planned for a few months and with our positive track record of Starwood chose their Le Meridien N'Fis (the only Starwood property there).    Arriving late afternoon our transfer service through the modern airport was quick and luggage out before we knew it. The hotel rep greeted us upon arrival and we were then walked to the hotel transfer. Initial thoughts of a 4WD or something befitting the charm of Marrakech came to mind - but were quickly quashed with a while old beat up Le Meridien N'Fis van with broken seats. No matter...it was a quick ride to the hotel and we were greeted warmly by the doormen who assisted us with our luggage and directed to Reception.    Upon entering the lobby we were shocked to see the actual state - it certainly does not look anything like the official website. Being year end a white pyramid with Bonne Annee had replaced the seating in the middle of the lobby (from the website) and this garishly stood out and did not blend with the overall ambience of the lobby. While i can understand wanting to celebrate the new year it could certainly have been done with something less over-the-top. On a positive note the staff at Reception were friendly and the doorman who brought our luggage in returned with a tray offering local mint tea which was a nice thought.    The rooms provided were relatively spacious but very very very dated. It was obvious some soft refurbishment was done (flat screen tv; bed runner; amenities tray) but overall the rooms are old. We were greeted with a strong smell of bleach when we walked in so on one hand i guess the floor was clean...but on the other what had happened beforehand to warrant such a strong use of it!!! We left our shoes on. Going for a drink in the mini-bar presented a beer can with a nice ring of rust around the base. Hmmm. The beds were average but an odd thing was the main light switches were on the headboard in the middle of the king bed so when the pillows would keep turning the lights on / off during the night! Guess this was supposed to have been a twin room...    Noise coming from the hallway was easy through the thin doors...and this also allowed us to hear our neighbours enjoying the night. Bathrooms badly touched up (a new sink had been put in but large gaps had been left between the tiles and sink after installation). Our water pressure and temperature was touchy but friends in another room did not have this issue. Positives are ample counter space; large mirrors and a bidet for convenience.    Breakfast was very very average and the items on the buffet did not change. However the staff were prompt and attentive with a Bonjour and kept the coffee and tea flowing. Requests for various items were also provided with a smile which is always nice to see in the morning. The real saving grace for the N'Fis is the food in the other outlets - both the Moroccan and Italian restaurants had good food (better than some of the recommended restaurants) albeit a rather quiet environment. Musicians played and sang in the Moroccan restaurant and the food was tasty. The Italian restaurant was to be expected and again food was tasty and portions substantial. There is also a shisha tent for enjoying a waterpipe after dinner. This was a popular location for both locals and tourists alike and a great way to unwind before dinner. Very enjoyable.    Unfortunately in this day and age a reliable internet connection in room is a must - more so if you charge for it. Again we were disappointed by the intermittent connection that cut in and out even when the staff insisted it was working normally. We had this taken off the bill upon check-out which the hotel willingly did without arguing.    Another surprising item was in the gym there was no water provided (fountain or bottles) so if you go running bring your own water which we had to BUY from the restaurant. They did place a dispenser the following day after this however i guess the water was still on the way from somewhere...least its a start? Dirty towels were also on the rack so again...BYO.    A guide hired through the hotel to show us around Marrakech was disappointing - we were taken of course to the range of standard 'co-op' carpet; furniture; spice; decoration shops and not much else. When we said we were not buying anything more to the guide he pretty much ran us through the Medina and dropped us off not long after. We actually found this much better as we could then enjoy our time without being hassled and actually learning more about Marrakech from our store bought Top 10 Must Do Marrakech than the hired guide! It was relatively convenient walking around from the N'Fis so location wise it was ok...    Overall it was extremely disappointing to see a Le Meridien of this standard and surprising that it still is maintained as such. Perhaps being the only Starwood property in Marrakech it is being tolerated however with the Accor brands down the road (Sofitel & Novotel) offering a much nicer product at a VERY similar price don't believe the Le Meridien N'Fis website and go down the road.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voyageur1980
Le Meridien N'Fis,theupdegraffs wrote a review Dec 2010,20,The N'Fis was uN'fit,"Wow! Not sure where to begin with the review of the Le Meridien N'Fis. My family (with young children) booked two rooms using our Starwood Points (we only stayed one night) -- got one room free with points and the second was cash ($45 for the night) and points. That we paid $22 per room a night in Marrakech was about the only positive I came away with after my stay at the N'Fis. It's location is all right. Easy to find in a nice part of town. Nice big parking lot. And the weather was excellent.    The moment I walked into the lobby was when I knew this place wasn't going to live up to my expectations. I've stayed at many a Starwood property (Asia Europe the US) and this place sits sadly at the bottom. Decor in the lobby was tired and old. It's glory was sometime between 1995 and 1998. That there was a giant white triangle with garland tinsel (given this was the 21st of December I'm figuring it was a take on a Christmas tree?) smack dab in the middle of the tired old lobby was another give-away that this place was shabby. It sort of reminded me and my wife of what a low-budget high school art class might have come up with in a time crunch and certainly not what a respected international hotel chain with hundred of millions of dollars would put forward for the world to see.    The outdoor garden area again was outdated. They did have little fountains around and there was plenty of green plants and trees with placards. The hotel gift shop looked like it was uprooted straight from the Marrakech medina and plopped into the hotel.    The rooms... Judging by the intensity of the blackness on my children's bare feet after five-minutes in the rooms with their shoes off I'd say it had been weeks if not months since the ceramic tile floors had been thoroughly scrubbed down. There were no carpets in our rooms -- not sure if this is the standard room they put us SPG folks up in or not so I can't speak to carpetting in other rooms. Bottom line: Forget about ""no expense was spared"" in the details of the room. No expense was ever put into our rooms as our two rooms were the dinkiest little DIY caves I've seen this side of 50 bucks a night! Besides the gritty floors one of our door locks was broke. The doors (main door connecting room doors and bathroom doors) were all of such low cheap quality. We could have easily punched through them. The artwork was rinky-dink as well. The paint job on the low-quality walls was poor. The bathroom door in one room had been touched up in two spots -- there was no attempt to blend in the touched up spots with the rest of the door. The decor (light fixtures lamps desk knicked-up home-made wooden vase boxes and tv table/mini-refrig unit) were all fairly low-end. Duvet cover had brown smudges on it. Could have been from dirty little kid feet but I think we had wiped them down before they were on any of the beds. Lack of carpet not only exposed the dirt but made moving the chairs around a real bother for the folks below us. The metal chair legs really ground into the tile floor making some unpleasant noises.    Perhaps the most perturbing event of our stay came at about 10pm when without even knocking a chamber-maid opened our door ostensibly to deliver the complimentary SPG guest mini bottled waters. At 10pm? Mini-bottle waters? Without even a knock? Really? At 10pm? WHO DOES THAT? We were floored. Unbelievably poor decision on the hotel's part to provide such lousy service so late at night. My kids including our infant were all asleep. I'm sure a lot of weary travelers are usually asleep by then. What if she would have walked in on us when we weren't decently dressed? My wife could only surmise that this maid was up to no good at such a late hour.    Anyway Marrakech was pretty neat. The N'Fis was not. It was unfit. Go with lower expectations than we did. If prices are anywhere near what the Sofitel or Novetel are offering I suggest you give them your business.",Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theupdegraffs

From the bell boys to the conceige we had 1st class treatment and attention from the moment we arrived at the airport and were met by the hotel's shuttle bus (extra charge but well worth it). The hotel has a fab pool and the gardens are gorgeous the pool was a bit chilly but beautiful. We ate breakfast each morning in their breakfast huge tented area which was really nice and lots of choice. We did eat in the morrocan restaurant the first night and this was very good too. Nothing was too much trouble for the hotel the conceige booked us a restaurant on the saturday night overlooking the square with all the hussle and bustle the best seats in the house!

Le Meridien N'Fis,WillBernz wrote a review Dec 2010,30,A Touch of South Florida in..... Marrakech?,"Approaching the hotel was reminiscent of pulling up to the Marriott off of Atlantic Ave in Delray Beach or any hotel ""resort"" in South Florida. Pick one. Lol. The decor inside was def ""Moroccan"" but my expectations were exceedingly high for a Le Meridien in Marrakech. Having visited other Le Meridien's across the globe I expected a little more high end and less corporate park retreat. Don't get me wrong. The reception was awesome. The polite greeting at the doors of the property as well as at the check in desk established that this property understood Starwood level customer service. The mint tea offering was a nice touch while I completed the required hotel info (passport no. duration of stay etc.). I was given a quick tour of the property by our bell man who showed us the business center which is comprised of 2 desktops and a printer in a corner of a common space where people congregated. Forget about doing any work there. When I approached I had to lie to a child who had commandeered both pcs (one for facebook and the other for typing practice) in my most broken French that I had to book a plane ticket. Just note however the business center is not free for guests of the hotel. The cost ($2USD/hour) is not prohibitive but come on guys!!! Most Starwood hotels provided internet for free in their business Ctrs. I'm sure it has to do with the high cost of Internet in morocco but it's no longer a luxury. Directly across from the business center and common area is the not so serene spa. The actual room for services is far enough away from the madness of the common area and business Ctr down beneath.    Walking out of the main Bldg you are greeted by a scenic area with fountain and flowers to your left and the pool to the right.    The grounds r indeed lovely but hv a plastic feel almost. Sort of like someone opened resort-in-a-box and inflated here.    The pool was nice enough with a cordoned off portion for kiddies. The deepest end measured 5.2ft. Absolutely no diving. Surrounding the pool in tiers r cabanas (I am unsure of the price) lounge chairs and two small cutesy bridges. All that is missing is a kiddie slide. There is a towel station near the pool bar which is easy to miss if the man manning the station happened to walk away. There r cabanas available for massage as well. Not far from the pool is a restaurant that serves apps. I had a grilled chkn and cheese panini with frites and a glass of cab that was delicious. The server was extremely nice and helpful.    The room  **sigh** where oh where do I begin? C'mon...this is a Le Meridien!!!!!! The long and short of it. The room was small. A deluxe double room was the size of your average courtyard Marriott room. The furniture was dated and beds small. Certainly not heavenly beds. The bathroom was big enough for one person at a time. There was of course a bidet and a tub with shower. One plus was the property wasn't stingy on toiletries. More than enough for two adults. The water pressure was great    I tried the Moroccan restaurant Italian restaurant poolside grill breakfast buffet and snacks in the bar and all were good with the bfast and moroccan standing out. Drinks in the bar were awful (don't order a piña colada outside of the Caribbean).    Housekeeping was aggressive entering the room many times without knocking but still doing a thorough job of cleaning the room.    The bellman are really the true gems of this place. From giving advice to running out into traffic to hail a taxi...they r awesome. Namely Said who was extremely helpful when instructing me on how to handle the taxis here in Marrakech that will try to charge u different prices for a taxi ride (20dhm to and from jemaa el fna...nothing more nothing less).    The gym  Very basic gym. Cardio machines and free weights up to 14kg. Strangely no towel service. I obtained one from the spa downstairs. There is a rickety weight Bench as well as workout mats. Each cardio station is equipped with it's own tv. There is also a water machine.    There is no ATM in the hotel but there is a bank across the street that has a 24hr ATM.

Le Meridien N'Fis,js_gill wrote a review Nov 2010,50,"Excellent location, very friendly, would return",The hotel is located perfectly within a walking distance of the main square (15-20 mins walk to Djemaa el Fna) and a very short taxi ride to the airport. It's also within a few mins of some of the nicest bars/restaurants and the Casino should you wish to visit.    The breakfast in the hotel is superb with something for everyone  this includes :  cereals fruits breads cooked sausages beans potato's omlettes made to order hard boiled eggs scrambled pancakes made to order Mint Tea Coffee.    The service is second to none however I am a SPG Gold member so our rooms were on the SPG floor where your room is made twice a day. The hotel staff are excellent particularly the front of house who tell you exactly how much each taxi costs and also tell the driver how much you'll be paying so there's no confusion.    The pool area is great however the only downside was the temperature of the water. We stayed in november and while it was 23 degrees the pool felt like -10. I honestly think I only saw 4-5 people brave enough to have a swim in the 5 days we were there,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/js_gill

While my husband checked in I sipped my tea and enjoyed the wonderful aroma of the lobby. However I was really not impressed with the room. One of the other members of our party had to change rooms because their non-smoking room had a very heavy odor of smoke. The beds were very comfortable but the rooms were very noisy and unimpressive.    The safe in our room didn't work and even though we requested that it be fixed when we returned at the end of the day it didn't seem like anyone had even been in to look at it. It was difficult to get the code to use the internet and we were actually told one night that the internet was ""not working"" with no explanation to let us know when it would be available.    The breakfast was not spectacular and room service brought me a beef burger when I ordered a chicken burger.    Overall our visit to Marrakesh was spectacular but the hotel is disappointing.

Le Meridien N'Fis,smartinez48 wrote a review Nov 2010,40,a fantastic family holiday,The personnel in Le Meridien was genuinely kind looking after us and always striving to answer our needs. The food was good in all restaurants in the Hotel although a bit pricey compared to what you can get in you go in town in good restaurants. The breakfast was great and there was something that suited all of us. Sweet or savory taste nothing was spared. On demand egg (omelette scrambled boiled sunny side up) hot and cold drinks. A variety of fresh fruits. Great way to start the mornings.  Very calm and relaxing with a fantastic scent of Orange Blassom in all main areas.  The rooms were large and refurbished looking onto mature gardens. The beds were absolutely great big and comfortable.  Worth going in town by petit taxi. As we were 4 we hired a grand taxi 20 to 30 dirhans to go to Jema El Fnaa the main square in Marrakech. Our taxi offered to be a guide to us if we wanted but was not pushy. He was just looking for business if we were looking for these sort of services. We stayed with him untill the end of our stay. He took us to Morroccan restaurants/eateries were morrocans go ate with us adviced us about crafts purchases as he was a carpenter himself.    The Hotel had a great pool with a children's area great loungers and towels provided as required by pool side personnel. The water was cold as the nights were quite cold at the end of October but during the day it was in the 30degres celsius great to lounge and plunge now and again in the refreshing water. Palms trees all around the hotel grounds made it so relaxing.    The Spa in the hotel was great although a bit pricey again. Massage hammam skin srubbing etc... really relaaaaxing we all loved it  even our daughter (7) who went for a Hammam and scrub with dad.    The Boutique in the hotel is pricey but handy if you don't want to go in the hustle and bustle of the old medina. Post cards 9 dirhams where you can find them at 2 dirhams in Jemaa el Fnaa.    My meories go to the breakfast the pool and the personnel.

Check in was not too difficult but had some trouble getting a computer password. Which only worked on one of our computers. That said the internet reception was pretty good in our room. Had the same problem as another reviewer being unable to fit even a notebook computer in the room safe. The room was fairly basic and had very little storage area for clothing etc. The decor was a bit tired but the bed was very comfortable A/C worked great and black out curtains all which provided for a great night of sleep.    The reception area was always crowded with conference attendees and tour groups all of which could not be handled by the front desk. This made it difficult to get assistance from the concierge and cashier. The pool area was beautiful and staff there were attentive. The restaurants were over priced and not terribly impressive. The staff in the breakfast were extremely rude enough so that we just ordered coffee delivered to our room.    The hotel is a bit of a hike to the medina area but is doable. There is always the option of taking the petite taxis which are only 20-30 MAD to the downtown area.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tokyo, Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g8tergirl

Le Meridien N'Fis,JMBINCA wrote a review Oct 2010,40,A very Western experience in a not-so-Western city,My partner and I stayed at Le Meridien N'Fis for two nights on our recent tour or Morroco. Here are our thoughts:    Positives:    1. Good location: the hotel is outside of the medina which in my opinion is a positive. So you certainly aren't in the heart of Marrakech activity (centered in the medina) when you stay here but you can easily walk (about 20 minute walk) or taxi (5 minute taxi ride) to it. Given that the Marrakech medina is an overwhelming array of sites and sounds it was nice to stay just outside of the medina walls to get some peace and quite.    2. Beautiful grounds: this hotel has spectacular gardens and a fantastic pool. You can hang around in the outdoor areas for hours and still not get enough of its beauty.    3. Fantastic breakfast: the breakfast was included in our room rate. It was a self-service buffet and had everything you could want...both Moroccan and Western. I highly recommend the soup that they serve at breakfast which is apparently something that Moroccans use to break fast during Ramadan. Delicious.    4. Clean enough: not the cleanest hotel we stayed at in Morocco but no real complaints either. But don't leave anything you want that might be perceived as trash out in site as the chamber maids will throw it away.    OK so the other things you need to know:    1. Rooms couldn't be more bland: white walls white floors white bedding. Absolutely no personality at all. And I wouldn't say that the fittings were of the highest quality including the sheets.    2. BAD plumbing: the shower didn't work at all so we had to take baths. The toilet leaked. And the sink produced nothing but a trickle. All in all plumbing is generally poor in Morocco but Le Meridien's was the worst we experienced.    3. Expensive internet: you are going to pay $15 a day for very slow internet access.    4. Expensive: more than $300 US per night which I think it too much for this hotel.    All in all a fine place to stay if you are spending around $200 per night. At $300 I think you can probably do better. And check the plumbing before you agree to the room.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Pasadena, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMBINCA

Le Meridien N'Fis,Fabregasuk wrote a review Oct 2010,20,Go to the Sofitel instead,If you are reading this you have probably decided not to stay in a Riad but to go for an international hotel toward the higher end of the market. In Marrakech that's pretty much either this one or the Sofitel. Go for the latter. My room at the Meridian had ants poor security a cigarette smoke filled foyer a bad breakfast and air conditioning so loud I had to wear ear plugs.    First impressions were poor. The foyer stank of stale cigarettes. There were about three people smoking including some sort of holiday rep who was standing by the concierge desk. I don't care that we are in Marrakech - international hotels should move with the times and ban smoking from all public areas wherever they are in the world. The next thing I noticed was some sort of temporary table with posters on it indicting it was a meeting point for guests involved in a motor rally competition. It was the sort of tacky reps' desk you would get in a 2 star hotel in Ibiza not a Meridian. Swarming the lobby were the reps themselves in their bright red reps t-shirts. I expected a hen-party to join in at any moment but thankfully there were none.    Check-in was easy but I was heavily lobbied to get a Starwood Preferred Guest card. I did not get one out of principle because of the pestering by not one but two members of the reception (the second stepped in when it was obvious I was not interested) and also because I did not want to be near the smoker for any longer than possible. Am not sure about the Preferred Guest scheme. As a non-member knowing the hotel 'prefers' other guests is somewhat unwelcoming.    The room was big but my advertised pool view was actually a wall of rubber plants. Key card did not work and had to be checked at reception. The safe in the room was old and too small to fit a small lap-top. The security blurb in the hotel guide said other safes were available at the front desk and that under local law they were the only safes that gave customers legal protections for theft. So I went down with my laptop (journey number 2 after the key card fail) only to be told that the safes were the same size as the ones in the rooms - the recommendation was for me to leave my laptop on a shelf behind the desk in full view of customers and staff for the duration of my stay (2 nights). Like hell I did. And what legal cover would there be for that I wonder.    There were ants in my room and in the bathroom. The room stank of stale cigarette smoke despite being a no smoking corridor. The plug in the bathroom did not work properly and had to be fixed. When I came back to the room it had been taken out altogether and dumped on the side of the bath. The shower curtain smelt damp. The veggie breakfast (I asked for an American Breakfast with no meat) was a large plate of scrambled eggs and toast for about 18 euros. They could have included some tomatoes and mushrooms or potatoes..? Breakfast finished earlier than advertised so had it in the room - imagine the voila moment when the tray was lifted to reveal a plate of scrambled eggs.    The bar was dated dark and full of smoke. The grounds were pretty at night lit up by lanterns but no-way as good as those at the Sofitel.    It is a bit further out - town is walking distance from the Sofitel but a taxi ride from the Meridian. The fountains leading up to the foyer were broken with no hint of imminent repairs. The wi-fi was expensive and people at the front desk were complaining it did not work well. The swimming pool/pool area was unspectacular and a sheet of glass dividing the shallow end from the main pool was on the lean and looked unsafe.    On the plus side the food at the Italian restaurant was pretty good and efficiently served as were the poolside snacks. The bed in my room was massive and very comfortable.    The Sofitel is closer to the action classier and appears to be better maintained. Its lobby and grounds are far better than those at the Meridian. The room at the Sofitel was very slightly smaller but had a balcony. The Meridian also had incredibly annoying 'music' in the lifts which it claimed to be by a renowned French composer. I loathe the idea that wherever we are these days (loud) music has to follow.    The Sofitel (and there is only one in Marrakech even though on here you will see two different names - they are the same hotel) is miles better than the Meridian. I have marked this down to 2 stars because it is a pricey hotel and should be better.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabregasuk

Le Meridien N'Fis,shelleymercer wrote a review Oct 2010,40,Pleasant hotel,My husband and I stayed at the Le Meridien N'Fis in September this year. Lovely hotel and the staff were extremely friendly and couldnt do enough to help. I wouldnt say it was up to the same standards at the Le Meridien in Dubai but I thought that before we went.    Our room was very basic but clean. Tiled floors. No rooms have balconies - just sliding doors with a Juliet balcony (I think that is the name of it!) We had huge trees outside our room which meant we couldnt see anything anyway! And we had tons of noisy birds in the trees all day and night - which we got used to in the end!    Maid service twice a day with nice little touches like chocolates and flowers being left. Towels changed twice a day or more if you wanted!    I dont go on holiday to watch TV but a couple of days were cloudy so we came back to our room and put the TV on or when we were getting ready to go out. No english channels other than BBC World News.    Free internet service in the lobby area. Bars and restaurants (one was closed) were nice. Restaurant very lovely food. Didnt rate the food around the pool as much but still nice. Bar was nice quite pricy for Marrakech standards but to be expected in a 5* hotel.    Lovely pool. Nice cushioned sunloungers and friendly pool/bar attendants that couldnt do enough for you.    Would definitely recommend this hotel to someone going to Marrakech. We walked to the Medina in about 20 minutes (very hot but walkable). Lots of tipping in Marrakech - we tipped the pool attendants for bringing over towels maids the guys getting us taxis every evening to go out (they called them and told them where you were going and agreed a rate with them so they could not con you - so worth it) and of course restaurant/bar staff. We tipped on average 20 Dms each person which works out about £1.50 - so worth it really... and they were all extremely grateful - never expecting it - just grateful when you do.,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Essex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelleymercer

They staff leave bottles of water for you at night and roses on your pillow offering you a peaceful sleep. i know that these things may seem cliche but they were very tastefully done!  The pool area is a little small but very clean and inviting. You are given fresh towels and not constantly harassed for drinks. It is very relaxing!

I am very well travelled and so hyper critical so here goes:  The grounds were absolutely gorgeous and the pool area was nice too. The staff are all incredibly friendly though in Morocco I was always wary of being conned. Watch out or any taxi driver suggesting a trip to anywhere!! PLAN where you want to go and do NOT be dissueded by ""Oh its a religious holiday the Medina is closed!"" or get a guide. A guide should not cost you more than €20 and WILL SAVE YOU AT LEAST THIS AMOUNT AND BE WORTH EVERY PENNY. Trust me I'm super alert but still ended up in a hot STINKING tannery and a random shop where the proprietor tried to bully me into buying stuff I didn't want for WAY more than I'd pay in Europe!  The room was big and clean (apart from a really tiny cockroach which somehow made its way into the bathroom on day 4 and died there of its own accord???) The air-conditioning was barely adequate but adequate. The bathroom was outdated and in need of a refurb. The buffet breakfast was fine good omelette station but really terrible cold meats (like 20c reconstituted meat that we call polony (Bologna or Polonia pink coloured meat typed stuff). The fruit was sometimes warm and the pastries a bit stale.  It seemed to me that the hotel had had better days but really it wasn't bad at all for the money. If you want luxury I am told by a hotelier in Europe that La Mamounia is the place to go despite trip advisor ratings!

Le Meridien N'Fis,nix0306 wrote a review Aug 2010,30,"Not a 5 star hotel, but quite adequate",We went to the Meridien N'Fis for our honeymoon. Our travel agent requested something special for us (bottle of wine room upgrade or something similar) but nothing was given to us; not even a 'Congratulations'! However we arrived at around 2.30am so just wanted to go to bed! Neither of our key cards worked so we had to trapse back down to reception where we were allocated a different room. The rooms are quite large and clean with very large beds and big bathrooms. Nice flatscreen TVs but channel choice for English speakers is poor (BBC World News CNN and a channel showing old films with Arabic subtitles). Air conditioning was rather loud also. During the week we were there our keycards stopped working several more times and had to be replaced twice.  The hotel staff are friendly and helpful although the pool attendants are happy to remove peoples' belongings from sunbeds and give them to others so be careful when going to lunch! We came back from lunch one day to find 2 French men had taken our beds despite the fact that our towels were still there! The breakfast is among the better I've had at similar hotels in North Africa but we avoided the restaurants as they were very expensive compared to others. The bar is nice but also rather expensive (local beer - £3.50). There is also a 'spa' offering massages etc but this is expensive (30 min massage - £40 approx).  The placement of the hotel is quite good - about 6-7 mins from the old town (pay 20 dirhams = £1.50) 5 mins from the new town (about the same price) 10 mins from the airport (70 dirhams = £5 approx). Can recommend Cafe de la Poste in the new town. Good French bistro. 2 course dinner for 2 with wine = £65.  In summary a decent 3 star hotel; definitely not 5 star.

I had really gone through angst about where to stay and had originally booked a riad but then had second thoughts about the temparature so eventually plumped for the Meridien on the basis that it was a five star hotel with a big pool and close to all the sights. I was very disappointed when I walked into the reception area as the website makes it look grander than it is. The receptionists were not terribly friendly at check in either. I think in its time it probably was a luxury hotel but it is tired and dated now. The pool is very nice and wonderful to have when it gets to 50 degrees!!!! Breakfasts are not very exciting and we did not eat in the hotel for dinner. The consierge and door men are very friendly.    I think if you are expecting a luxury 5* hotel then this is not it. If you are happy with reasonably priced rooms and probably a 4* experience in a good location very close to the airport then you will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caty2
Le Meridien N'Fis,Traveller wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Really great Marrakech hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights end of July with my partner. OK we are VERY well travelled I work in the airline business. Was a bit hesitant first but decided to go ahead and book this hotel. We were not dissapointed. We were upgraded to the Starwood Preferred Guests floor (The Atlas rooms facing the pool we had room 234). Rooms were big enough with great sized bathroom. We had a bit of a problem with the minibar not being cold enough but it was fixed quickly. The pool was of good size and clean with separate kids area. One had to ""reserve"" a sun bed by latest 10am or the best spots were taken. Pool towels could have been a bit better/thicker. Breakfast was ok. Do not expect to get great cold cuts or smoked salmon at this Le Meridien. It is the basics but it works. The omelette station does exist here as well.  The location is good. You are away from the hectic medina but still only a 20min walk to get there. We took a cab to medina and back and it was 20dhm everytime and took less than 5minutes. Cab to airport was 100dhm from hotel for a 1300hr departure.  It was my first time to Marrakech and fell in love with place. Next time in Marrakech we will be happy to call Le Meridien our home.!!!!!!!!",Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acflier
Le Meridien N'Fis,ComicalGeeza wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Best Hotel in Marrakech,As good a hotel as you can get in Marrakech - spacious clean rooms full 5* service and facilities including large pool several restaurants excellent breakfast choices hairdresser gym sauna shop tennis court etc. Starwood members even get free in-room Wi-Fi and water bottles as well as unlimited access to spa (you can sign-up to membership in the hotel). Location is in the newer modern part of the city where many of the new hotels are situated and the surrounding hotel grounds and gardens are breathtaking. Not the cheapest hotel for those on a budget but well worth it if you can afford it. Had a good look around the city didn't see a better hotel around.

Le Meridien N'Fis,cathhughes wrote a review Jul 2010,40,Not the real Morocco!,Our flight was cancelled by Easyjet and everyone from our flight was moved to this hotel for a night which was obviously great for us!    It is after all a beautiful hotel with a lovely pool restaurants bars etc. The gardens were exceptionally lovely especially in the evening and the hotel photographs are exactly how it is.    There was free air-con and a safety deposit box in our room.    However saying that we often stay at the Fortina Spa in Sliema Malta as we have a timeshare there and I did not feel the rooms were as pleasant or the views etc. from the room bars and restaurants anyway near as amazing.    Having stayed at a Riad in the centre of Morocco I would beg you to reconsider and stay in a beautiful riad where the real Morocco is and it's people. This will give you a far better experience and will cost you far less: when you see women begging on the streets with babies at 10.30 pm at night. Also it felt wrong for the hotel to have such a large swimming pool in a country that is desperate for water.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,cathathowells@yahoo.com,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathhughes
Le Meridien N'Fis,YayShub wrote a review Jul 2010,40,Very enjoyable stay in a beautiful hotel,My husband & I spent four nights here in July 2010. We thoroughly loved the hotel... a nice moroccan decor with taste in the common areas newly decorated modern bedrooms very green and well kept beautiful gardens and a very nice swimming pool area...    The staff are very friendly and helpful and unlike some of the comments on here about slow service at breakfast we can not complain of any slow service. Breakfast is served buffet style with a selection of hot food and cold meats cheese frest fruits cereals and very nice pastries... a must try pastry is the syrup coated 'pain au raisin'.... yummy!! There is also a selection of 4-5 fresh juices and teas.    We got a newly redecorated bedroom which was beautiful but personally I found the bed mattress too hard to my liking and the pillows way too big and not soft enough. That somehow affected my quality of sleep at the hotel.    The hotel is situated about 30 minutes leisurely walk to Jamaa el Fanaa which in the scorching 45 degrees of July seems much longer. Also walking along Avenue de la Menara there is nothing much along the road from the hotel to the square. We found that taking a petit taxi from the hotel to the centre of the old city was the best way to get around and only costs 20 moroccan dirhams when arranged by the hotel doorman. Make sure the doorman arranges the price with the taxi driver. Our special thanks go to the very friendly and smiling hotel doorman Said who advised us to always insist on 20 MAD when taking a petit taxi back to the hotel as well from the city centre and we managed that most times. He also arranged for a taxi to take us back to the airport and that costs only 50 MAD.... expect to pay double the price when you arrive to Marrakech and take a taxi from the airport to the hotel..    On the whole we would definitely recommend Le Meridien N'fis to everyone. We loved our stay there and hope you will too.    A little caution - Be weary of a petit taxi number 1107 which I believe work with the hotel at times.... He did not end up taking us where we wanted to go but insisted on taking us to some Cooperative Shop to do shopping as I suppose he gets commission there. He was not interested at all to take us where we wanted to go...,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YayShub
Le Meridien N'Fis,rock_30 wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Haven in a manic city!,We stayed here for 4 nights in July 2010. Found a cheap flight with Ryanair and thought why not! Changed money really easy in the airport – there are ATMs and money exchange after baggage claim. Read some bad reviews about getting taxis from the airport but managed to get one for 57 DHMs. It’s only 5-10 minutes from the airport.    The hotel was great. Check in was quick and all the staff were attentive. Room was OK - probably more like a 3-4 star than 5 but better than expected. The room was nice and quiet and didn’t hear any traffic or people except a few scraping chairs upstairs.    The location was fine. You can walk to the main square in about 15 minutes or 20 DHM in a taxi. As it was so hot we wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle. I would recommend getting a lonely planet (encounter) or equivalent as most of the sights are pretty hidden.    The pool in the hotel was nice and large. The attendants were the best I’ve ever seen. There were always sunbeds available which were nice and comfy. And when these were all taken there were plenty more which the attendants would bring out for you along with a towel without asking. This was a really nice touch and meant you didn’t have to worry about getting somewhere to sit.    Breakfast was OK. It was pretty quiet except the last morning (Sat morning). We ate from the pool bar a couple of times during the day for convenience although it was double the price (70 DHM for a margarita pizza) than the restaurant round the corner. We went to the bar on the Wednesday night after getting lost in the medina for a quick beer and realised it was ‘ladies night’ – free drinks all night which continued into their nightclub til 4am!    There is a great shop just opposite (cross the road out of the hotel turn right and it’s down a small street after the bank). They sold everything you could need (drink snacks sun cream and even an off licence) at pretty reasonable prices.    All in all it was a relaxing hotel in a crazy city and we'd stay here again if in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rock_30
Le Meridien N'Fis,onarticus wrote a review Jul 2010,50,"A lovely, comfortable and great stay. Great breakfast too.",My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights on our 4 night holiday (1 night in Essaouira).  Having paid the 100 DHM's from the airport (rip off - 10 min ride - £7) we came to this really stunning 5* hotel Le Meridian. It was 48 degrees that day (yes it really was that hot despite BBC stating it was 38) and cold fresh lemon juice was available at the entrance and we were served mint tea. We checked in promptly. We had a swimming pool view which was just great. Those who get a room on the ground floor have the benefit of a terrace and can walk straight to the pool (amazing pool too). The gardens and surroundings are out of this world. If you are into photography and I am I took loads of great snaps. There are 4 or 5 different cafe's / restaurants however a bit on the pricey side. Its looks very Morrocan too not what I was expecting. Good authentic Morrocan look and feel but with modern luxuries. The important stuff:    Where is it: In the new city  How long to the old city/square: 6 or 7 mins in a taxi. 15dhms in a petite taxi 20 dhms in something a bit swisher (none of the taxis have air con but wasnt too bad).  What is nearby: In walking distance is a bank with cashpoint some bars and food place (cheap burger chips / italian style). Also a mini supermarket opposite.  Wifi: Yes free and hi-speed    My only grumble about the hotel was the aircon. It was rather limp in the rooms.  Plus points we got a fruit bowl on arrival and complimentary small bottles of water each day. Lovely bathroom and spacious room.    The best part was breakfast. Truely fantastic. No matter how tired you are you will wake up for this! Our booking included this.    We paid £85 per night.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onarticus

Le Meridien N'Fis,L0ve-t0_Trip wrote a review Jul 2010,40,"Spoilt for choice in one of the most upcoming world cities, I can vouch for this little bit of heaven that is, Le Meridi",Spoilt for choice in one of the most upcoming world cities I can vouch for this little bit of heaven that is Le Meridien N'fis. Like many other trip-advisors I researched and read many-a-review before deciding to settle on what seemed like a perfectly great hotel surrounded by lovely landscaped views. I can safely say that we were not disappointed! From the moment we arrived and were shown around Le Meriden we were in awe. The Andalusian garden (particularly at night) was breathtakingly beautiful as well as great views provided by the pool-side and numerous restaurants.    The hotel was set in a good location. From the airport it did cost us 100 dirhams to get to the hotel and the taxi drivers did not want to lower this price. As for the main square We did manage to walk the distance on our first day however this did take 30-plus minutes and in the heat it is probably not advisable. Instead we took a taxi for the duration of our stay. This amounted to a reasonable 30 dirhams for anywhere in the old or new parts of town (although rest assured they will try to charge you more!)    Our room was very comfortable clean and spacious and as we found out during the course of our stay a great place to come back and cool down after a long day in the heat. The room service was particularly excellent; we found the maids to be extremely friendly and helpful and they always left the room tidy and bathroom gleaming each day. The only negatives I could mention would be that not all the channels could be picked up clearly on the satellite television and that the floors could have been mopped and swept better.    The hotel offers numerous restaurants and a bar from which you can sample a great array of foods (both tranditional and international) at your comfort although you will find that it is a little costly compared to say the main square (Jemaa el fna). I should also mention that unfortunately I did have one bad experience concerning a burger I consumed in the outside bar that left me a little worse for wear. I would like to assume that this was an isolated incidence as the other food consumed at the restaurants Antipasti and L’Iwan during my nine day stay were absolutely delicious. The complimentary breakfast also offered should definitely not be missed- you won’t be left disappointed!    I should also add that a bureau de exchange is available with good rates (and no fee charged) which is particularly handy as you can only purchase the local currency dirhams in Morocco itself. If you prefer there are banks on the same street where you may check the rates and exchange your cash such as Bank Populaire which offered one of the best rates at our time of stay.    The hotel also offers additional services such as trips outside of Marrakech. We made use of this for a day trip to the Atlas Mountains. This cost us 1000 Dirhams for the hire of a driver and air-conditioned vehicle. The driver was extremely friendly and informative although I am sure you could do this day-trip for a lot less if you looked around. We also embarked on a two-day trip to the Sahara via Zagora which should not be missed! This time however we decided on Sahara Expeditions (a local tour company located near the Jemaa el fna) who charged only 650 Dirhams for the entire trip (which included a one-night stay in tents in the desert camel ride into and out of the desert as well as providing dinner) compared to the hotel who wanted to charge us a hefty 8000 Dirhams for use of the driver and vehicle only.    All in all it was a pleasure to stay at the Le Meridien N’fis. They made us feel truly welcome and at home and in such a great setting it was very hard to leave! I am sure that on my next visit to this amazing city I shall definitely pay the Meridien another visit.,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L0ve-t0_Trip
Le Meridien N'Fis,Joep E wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Great hotel with beautiful gardens and excellent service!,I've stayed in Le Meridien N'Fis Marrakech for 6 days (5 nights). It was an excellent experience.  The hotel is situated only 15 minutes from the airport. A taxi will cost you 50 Dirham.  Into the city of Marrakech it will only take you roundabout 10 minutes by taxi. This will cost you only 20 Dirham.    I traveled together with a friend and we shared a double bedroom. Airco in the room was provided.  From the beginning till the end the service was excellent! The staff makes you feel comfortable and try to give you the best service they can. The rooms are very clean and tidy and you get a good amount of space. Everyday fresh sheets and towels. Friendly staff of the housekeeping as well.  We had breakfast included which was delicious. Lots of fresh fruit cereals diffirent kind of sandwiches (including chocolate croissants!) a lady who makes omelets Marrocan Harira-soup American & Maroccan pancakes etc. It's all good!  The complex is very clean and tidy too. Everyday a bunch of people takes care of all the beautiful gardens in and around the complex.  There is a very nice pool in the complex. Here you can sit back and relax and enjoy the Maroccan heat! Something that has to be mentioned are the 'special beds' around the pool. You can view those beds on the website of the hotel. They ask €15- / 150 Dirham a day for 1 bed. This should be free in my opinion.    In the hotel you will find a concierge too. He's there to help you with whatever the question is. He helped us make some bookings at restaurants.  I would really like to recommend restaurant Le Crystal at the Pacha-club complex. Extraordinary food superb service and great price!!! One of the best restaurants we've ever been to.    A special member of staff has to be mentioned as well; His name is Saïd and he's been working in the Le Meridien N'Fis since 1986. He's a great guy and he works as a porter/guard in front of the hotel. He gives you loads of good tips and helps you enjoying Marrakech even more! He's always very friendly and in a good mood!  The food @ the pool bar is OK but not great. It's just average.  What else do you find in the hotel? Free internet diffirent restaurants bars lounge areas a spa beautiful gardens.  The day we left we had to leave the room before 12.00 o'clock. We had to be at the airport at 16.00 o'clock. So we asked at the reception if it was possible to stay in our room a bit longer. This was no problem at all. Excellent service as mentioned before.    This is an excellent hotel to stay in ecpecially if you're from Europe and not really used to a complete diffirent not-European world. The city of Marrakech is really nice but totally diffirent as well. We really enjoyed being at our hotel after visiting this rough and sometimes dirty city of Marrakech.

Seven hours later and after quite a few arguments we were allocated a different better room. Still not what was paid for. Several times i showed receptionists the voucher but they would not accept it.  The first day during the time trying to change rooms my digital camera was stolen/lost. I reported it twice to the reception desk but no one was interested. I had great difficulty talking to the staff because i did not speak French due to the fact that at all times they would insist in speaking French. The last time i reported my camera missing i believe a very senior manager was behind the desk and all he did was shrug his shoulders and turn away after twice greeting me with Bonjour Monsieur. The desk staff were not very helpful at all the staff waiting at tables for breakfast were very polite helpful and spoke enough English for us to order what we wanted.

Le Meridien N'Fis,germaniris wrote a review May 2010,40,"An oasis, but consider some points",Le Maridien N’Fis hotel is finely decorated. The garden is splendid and the pool an oasis to cool down. The rooms are well-sized clean and new. Our bathroom also had a bidet if you are anal on to that. Hotel staff were helpful friendly and had no problems with English. Fitness room is adequate for sports fanatics: set of weights treadmill and other cardio equipments are modern from Technogym. You'd be able to get back to your rigid regimen without any difficulty once back home. Spa is ok-ish but can't equal to the reputable hammam houses.    Breakfast was comparable to standard western business hotels not awesome but food has varieties to keep your blood sugar level till lunchtime don’t expect grandeur though. We first arrived late in the night thanks to the ever tardy flights from Royal Air Maroc we had room service for dinner. The price was outrageous but the food was mwuaah therefore we never tried the hotel for dinner again.    Make sure to lock your room when you are inside and place ‘don’t disturb’ sign. We had room service actually knocking and opening our door even in the evening – for whatever reason we do not know! Imagine what happens when you are in your indecent self? The poor young lady might get an panic attack. Not worth it so double bolt your room.    Negative Points: (1) mini bar was pricey: a 33cl can of local beer was 45Dh the green import from Holland a whooping 60Dh (about EUR5.50 or USD7). Similar prices at the hotel bar. I discovered later about the off-licence store (see below). (2) In the evening there’s an Arabian live music performance for restaurant guests and for everyone including for those who might want to sleep early. It goes on till midnight! (3) Internet is also pricey the cheapest option was a 48hours access for 120Dh. I did not use it and was annoyed that there was no hourly rate for a quick e-mail check.    The hotel is located outside the walls of the city you can find the entrance of the hotel at 31.619114-8.008758 (enter this at Google map search). In fact we liked the location of the hotel because it’s outside of the Medina chaos.    Nearby: exit the hotel and take a right onto Avenue Mohammed VI and walk one block. There are two restaurants a cheap one serving pizza pasta and local dishes - not worth it not unless you are really tight on the budget and hungry! Right beside it is the ‘Le Dar 6’ more expensive but we enjoyed our Moroccan food beer and wine! Clean and tastefully decorated. Across the hotel is a residential complex where we found a small grocery and an off-licence liquor store. Best way to find it: enter the small road with the ‘no entry’ sign for cars. I bought 50cl Moroccan beer can for 15Dh small snacks and bottled water there. (Actually the Moroccan beer is nice it’s worth the try.)    Getting around: From the airport to the hotel you can take a taxi they may ask you 150Dh which would be overpriced. We negotiated 100Dh. Taxi rides to the medina should be 20 to 30 Dh. We always agreed price before embarking taxis. When you need a taxi from the hotel the doorman of the hotel will call it for you and helps if needed to identify the fair taxi rate. No need to search for a taxi yourself. Alternatively you can also walk from the hotel to the Medina either take a left on Ave Mohammed VI and another left onto the Avenue de la Menara until you pass through the city wall (about 1.2km). Or take a right from the hotel exit onto Ave Mohammed VI and immediately another right (Rue Abou El Abbes Sebti). Follow this road until you pass through the city wall (about 1.2km). On your left will be the Cyber Park. At the end of the Cyber Park take a left on Ave Mohammed V and you will see across the street the Ensemble Artisanal (about 1.8km from the hotel) where you can find better quality products with fair price - whereas you might pay more for the lower quality from the souks. Be careful with some of the other big artisanal centres the ones where they take you to with busses (meaning you are in a group) -some are ridiculously overpriced. You should feel it in your tail that it’s a scam. In this case going to the souks is better where you can of course practice your bargaining skills. One tip: keep your cool and be firm.

Lovely gardens gorgeous pool area good dining options. However I felt the price was rather steep for the room I received (which was pretty basic) even after the SPG Gold upgrade.

Le Meridien N'Fis,LavenderEngland wrote a review Apr 2010,30,No up to the usual Meridien standards but ok,I can only echo what has already been said about this place. It's ok but certainly not 5 star but thinks it is. Staff friendly generally but service at breakfast was poor. We waited ages for our tea and coffee and sometimes it didn't arrive at all or came when we had finished. Waiting staff faffed around clearing odd cups etc instead of laying tables properly (no napkins no saucers no teaspoons) and replenishing the stocks. The pool was pleasant enough but freezing cold. The room we had was billed as de luxe but certainly not up to this standard. Bedrooms need to be decorated and the grey paint consigned to the bin.

Le Meridien N'Fis,2dogsAtlanta wrote a review Apr 2010,40,"OK place to start your stay in Morocco, just don't expect much","We arrived in Morocco and wanted a place to get our feet on the ground. This is a good place for a one night stay but..... The rooms are NOT fancy. The service is adequate but not great. We ate in the restaurant and it was quite good. Gardens and lobby decorations were good. It is a walk of about half a mile to get to the Medina. If you are arriving in Marraakeck beware of the 120 Dirham taxi ride. In other places it costs 20 Dirham but because you are at the airport they think they have you. There is a shuttle bus that takes people into town for a reasonable price. The touts and tricksters are thick around the medina. ""hello I work at your hotel"" and ""let me just put some Henna on you"" were things we ran into. Beware. Most of the rest of Morocco is not like this. Some of our group stayed at a Riad the first night and got much better service and room.",Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jasper, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2dogsAtlanta
Le Meridien N'Fis,Dave's_reviews wrote a review Apr 2010,40,"good, but maybe you can do better","Staying in a Western-managed hotel in Marrakesh has its pluses and minuses. On the plus side the hotel is professionally managed and you get things like an extensive Western-style breakfast buffet that is pretty much unknown in Morocco. The minuses mostly involve the soul-lessness of the place: it's a pretty sterile affair a bit predictable and dull.    We enjoyed the beautiful grounds but as others have noted the pool is cold -- even in April. While days in Marrakesh are warm nights are cool. Hence the water temperature problem. Is there a heated pool in Morocco? I didn't come across one but if it exists it would be a good idea!    The other problem with the hotel is location. One reviewer put the walk to town at 20 minutes but that's optimistic. If you leave the hotel entrance turn right and then another immediate right on the side street next to the hotel you can make it to the main square in less than 30 minutes. With the exception of a few scary street crossings it's a very pleasant walk through a leafy neighborhood and the gardens of a very exclusve residence (seems to be an official gov't building).    Taxis COULD solve this distance problem if only they ran on meters! Most taxi drivers we ran into in town (as a family we needed the so-called ""grand taxis"" which really are just normal sized cars) saw as as walking money bags and demanded 3 times what seemed to be the ""fair price"" Like a mile ride should cost about 30 dirhams but they'd demand 100. We did more walking than we would have had taxi riding been easier. Given the taxi hassle a location closer to the medina would have been useful. They say you can also rent the horse drawn carriages for a modest rate but the drivers we asked all wanted about 200 dirhams for a short ride so that wasn't cost-efficient either (although they look charming!).    Rooms at the hotel were OK but dated (there seem to be some renovated rooms buy we did not get these). Beds were great up to Starwood standards but most hotels in Morocco seem to have good beds.    Bottomline if I were returning to Marrakesh I'd stay here if I got ""a deal"" but would certainly consider my other options.",Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Philadelphia, PA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey802719
Le Meridien N'Fis,travelbug3371 wrote a review Apr 2010,30,o.k but would stay elsewhere,We stayed for 3 nights. On the positive side the grounds were beautiful and the pool looked good but was cold as it was unheated. The meals (buffet) were good. I had a conference at the hotel and the facilities were very good and the treats were very good as well. The bar was quite nice and we enjoyed a few quiet drinks there. On the negative side the staff are slow. You stand at the desk and wait until they deal with all incoming phone calls and pray that the phone does not ring while they are helping you. This hotel is not up to the normal Meridian standards. The one in Casablanca was better. The beds were hard and controlling the room temperature was difficult. The rooms were clean. The hotel is quite far away from everything making a taxi necessary and you always have to barter with the taxi driver. We had the hotel get us a tour guide who took us shopping (for kickbacks) as opposed to taking us to the tourist sites we had requested of him. Don't bother to get a guide unless you wish to pay more and are too scared to navigate the Medina on your own.    Overall I would recommend staying somewhere closer to the medina. I would try a riad as others had a fantastic experience in these smaller venues.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled on business,kamloops canada,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug3371

Le Meridien N'Fis,Toffee80 wrote a review Mar 2010,50,Absolutely wonderful hotel in Marrakech. Has absolutely everything.,Just back from a 5 night stay at Le Meridien N'Fis in Marrakech and it was amazing!    The hotel is about 20mins walk to the Medina but for 20 Dirhams you can get a taxi.    The staff:  Everyone went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. From being served mint tea and hand spray upon our arrival to the friendly porters who gave us great advice and tips for getting around the city. Ask them for the price of a taxi before getting it they make sure you pay it. Also when returning to the hotel they made sure we were not getting overcharged as well.    We got fresh roses in our room every otherday and as SPG members a complimentary steam bath.    The hotel and grounds:  Huge swimming pool. Not heated so a bit too cold in March to swim in but if you are going from April onwards this won't be an issue. The temp got to 25 degrees during our stay and we enjoyed lounging by the pool with drinks instead.    Tennis court on site. £5 for an hour per person. The coach even played with us at the end and gave us some advice.    Restaurants: Breakfast has to be one of the biggest and best ranges i have ever seen. From omelettes and bacon to Moroccan pancakes cooked before you fresh fruit pastries warm bread cheese cold meats. Everything.    We also had room service during our stay and again it was excellent quality and not overly expensive like other hotels might be.    The gardens and lounge areas are spectacular. Fresh fruit trees lanterns at night. Simply spectacular.    There are restaurants just a short walk down the street from the hotel and if you cross the road in the other direction you will find a beautiful olive tree garden and camel rides!    The hotel also organised a day trip to the Atlas mountains for us and we were taken there with an English speaking guide. Simply wonderful.    Some of the reviews on here suggested that the hotel isn't worthy of its 5 star rating. I don't really agree with that. Our room had a private terrace was very clean large flat screen tv and luxurious furnishings. I think it was one of the newly renovated ones.    The only negative thing about room was that the seal around the bath could do with being changed but apart from that everything else was amazing.    So if you are looking for a luxury hotel within walking distance from the Medina that is quiet and beautiful - this is the place to come!    I am already planning our trip back!!!!,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toffee80

Le Meridien N'Fis,rc33 wrote a review Jan 2010,30,Service Was Hot And Cold,Arrived at the hotel at about midday. Bags were quickly taken by porters. Went to check-in and there was only one person ahead of us. There was one lady serving him however another lady supervising her and ignoring us. After about 20 minutes we were served by another man (the lady who was serving the person before us was just done and the lady supervising stil did not offer to serve us). Very inefficient I think. The man was very helpful once we were served and room was available. It was a ground floor garden view room. The room was large but sparsely furnished considering how much room we had. All the furniture seemed to be on one side of the room. The pool was large but not heated. Most people sunbaked rather than swim. Location from the medina is about 15 - 20 minutes walk. It gets very hot between 11am - 2pm so suggest taking a taxi as they are inexpensive. Room service and pool side restaurant food was quite nice and service was good. Booked a tour with the concierge. It was to Essaouira and was very nice. Good service when he was actually there (not there all the time).    All in all I expected a higher standard considering it was a Le Meridien. The room and service let down this property.,Date of stay: November 2009,,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rc33
Le Meridien N'Fis,JetsettingSi wrote a review Jan 2010,30,Great value for some winter sun.,We spent our honeymoon here having splurged the year before on a no expense spared trip to Thailand we decided to tone down the spend on our hotel this time around. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the tea man in the main reception kept us on a sugar high with an abundance of mint tea every time we passed though.    Upon arrival we were given a room upgrade when the check in staff learned we were honeymooning which was nice. Sadly the room was on the top floor and there was some noise at night from either the AC or elevators not enough to keep my wife awake or make me feel the need to switch rooms.    The pools are great its set out like a little oasis and the restaurant which services it serves a tasty buffet of freshly cooked meats. you simply go up and select what you want and tell them how you would like it cooked and they bring it to your pool side table for you when its done. Fabulous! This means you can leave your things in site by the pool ready for you to return to sleep off your meal.    The hotel is outside the city walls but you can get a cab into the main market for 20-30 Moroccan dollars (£2-3). The hotel can also organise trips for you at the concierge desk. We took a private guided luxury 4x4 tour of the atlas mountains (£150 for 1 day) which was probably the highlight of the trip the day was amazing and we climbed to about 4000ft. We also went quad biking thought the desert palm groves worth a go if you like a bit of adventure.    The last couple of days of our trip were spent sunbathing by the pool being served cold champagne and eating great food. You could happily do this your entire stay if you didn't feel the need to experience the culture on offer which if you have never been before I wouldn't miss out on if I were you.

Le Meridien N'Fis,LondonCHassan wrote a review Nov 2009,10,"Stunning grounds, good rooms, WORST service I have ever experienced!",Whilst we did not originally book into the Meridien - we were placed here due to an overbooking at our original hotel in the Old Town I was happy to be going to the Meridien....that is until I arrived. Upon check-in we were met with a Receptionist who clearly did not want to be there. She took 2 (seemingly) personal calls during her interaction with us. She could not find the book out initially and after 10 mins of playing with phones going into the back and making us feel a HUGE nuisance she did find our room. Whilst we filled out our details she proceeded to tap her false fingernails on the counter (how rude!). I should point out the hotel itself is beautiful the grounds are well maintained and so pretty and the pool a delight so if you're looking for a relaxing retreat away from the madness of old town I would recommend their facilities - just don't count on the staff! We had dinner on the evening we arrived and because the service was particularly slow we went to ask for our bill and shoved back to our seats like little school children. We thought we would treat ourselves to a massage the next morning... when we eventually found a staff member! Next morning we arrived in the spa and waited and waited and waited until it seemed like the staff had perhaps gone awol. We then advised Concierge to cancel the booking some 20 minutes later. When we then walked past the Spa to go to the pool area one member of staff came out running & shouting behind us. We explained that because we had not seen any staff after waiting for some time we did not want to continue as this was testament to the service we thought we would receive with them. Breakfast on Saturday morning was the most disorganised chaos I have EVER seen! Imagine a stampede of bulls..then we're close. Staff had no customer service skills nor organisational skills to manage the situation an it was a hugely unpleasant experience. On check-out we were behind a small queue of around 4 people however interestingly we were told that the free receptionist on the same desk could not check us out as she only dealt with check-ins!!  In total we were made to feel an inconvenience a nuisance and almost ruined our last day in Marrakech if it were not for the surroundings and huge patience.

Le Meridien N'Fis,happysept09 wrote a review Sep 2009,40,Meridien safe & clean,Le meridien n’fis Marrakech    Safe & Clean  As mother & daughter travellers I would like to comment how totally satisfied we were with this hotel. Yes it is sited out in the featureless international belt but a central riad would not have been for us. We loved Marrakech but how nice to return at the end of the day to such a peaceful sanctuary.  Arriving after dark during Ramadam we opted for ease & booked by email the hotel transfer.. I knew it was extortionate but the driver whizzed us through luggage currency exchange etc & got things off to a haggle free start.  The hotel is just beautiful by night & after a quick check in were allocated a newly renovated 2nd floor room in the main block. Sadly a poor view but there aren’t a lot of twin rooms.The room was spotless & quite frankly put to shame many places I have stayed in UK. The room maids were lovely courteous attentative girls.  Wary of wandering into darkness on our first night we opted for the hotel Ramadam buffet under the tented area listening to the musicians. An adequate but not wonderful meal pretty much what you would expect in any international hotel.  Nearby there is a fairly popular pizza/pasta/ bistro which is a safe bet but to me nothing can compare with a night out in the square.  Breakfast was served on an attractive terrace & again the staff were falling over themselves to serve us. There were a few cats around obviously as in many places kept as pest control. I am cat allergic but they never came close up enough to cause me any problems( rather foolishly some people were feeding them titbits which in my opinion purely defeats the purpose of their presence & encourages them to hover at tables).Having experienced rats scuttling around in Greece pest control cats don’t bother me!  The door staff were very caring advising us on the appropriate taxi rates. 20 mad to square or majorelle gardens & insistent we did not get ripped off.  We both speak French which although not essential always seemed to get things off to a better start.  I admit we did get some hassle in the city but 99.9% of it good humoured banter & easily dealt with. To be honest we live in a city & on a night out in UK I probably feel more scared of swathes of drunken youths back here.  Marrakech is lovely & I hope to go back before the massive tourist developments turn the city into yet another “chain store zone”  Remember you have chosen to come to Marrakech to experience something different so don’t moan when its not like UK.,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Carlisle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happysept09

Le Meridien N'Fis,Pink_Hula wrote a review Sep 2009,40,Lovely short break for only a week,When arriving there are two taxi lots try and go with whoever will take you to the N'fis for around a fiver because thats how much it should be (actually less). Unfortunately we paid slightly more and despite haggling and when returning found the error of our ways. So negotiate before sitting in the taxi. Once we arrived at the hotel the staff were great being a member of the spg group was fab as they offered free daily Hammams in their spa to members.    Food was lovely and fresh and grilled in front of you. The breakfast was great and outside there is a chef who cooks eggs with anything you like in there. We eat a lot and found the food was so fresh you could keep on eating!! The pool was clean although the trashy 80's music of ''theres a brown girl in the ring'' was slightly off putting.    There is a great gem of a place called Les Bains De Marrakesh not far from the hotel and its great for a spa day we spent a good half a day there getting pampered. There is an option for couples to have their own private hammam and we opted for this the scrub was great and just before a couples rose bath and massage was given a lovely cup of mint tea. This place is phenomenal and is quite literally a little gem. Far better than any massage place in London.    We arranged through the hotel a trip up to the Atlas Mountains although the trip was great and we made a couple of small stops along the way its best to make sure health wise you are fit. We had a lady who nearly burst into tears as she struggled to climb. Having said that I was able to do the climb in my pumps but I would recommend the appropriate foot gear.

Le Meridien N'Fis,LittleMissCritical41 wrote a review Sep 2009,40,Dont believe all the negative reviews.,"I have just returned from a long weekend in marrakech and was very apprehensive after reading some negative reviews of the hotel. I read that the hotel was tired and in need of updating. Firstly the reception was amazing reminding me of a small palace. The reception staff were very friendly and booking in was straight forward. We were given mint tea while they did all the formalities.We were in a room in the new building and it was immaculate and exactly like the picture in the brochure. The maids came twice a day to change the towels and cleaned the room every day. They even arranged my nightie in a pretty fan shape! The breakfast was varied and the staff attentive. There was chef on hand to make you an omlette of your choice if you wanted. The hotel grounds and pool area was really attractive Gardeners worked continuously and the pool was spotless not a dead fly in sight. There were plenty of sunbeds to go round and an attendant came and laid a fresh towel on your bed for you upon your arrival at the pool each day. waiters also came round taking drink orders at no extra charge. The hotel offered a vast room service menu and the room had a mini bar. Yes the prices in the mini bar were high but you tell me a hotel where the mini bar isnt a rip off. I cant say enough good things about the hotel it had a lovely spa. My partner had a steam bath massage and pedicure for about £50. The concierges were so helpful and bent over backwards to help. Syed was especially good!!  The only critisim of this hotel was that our room was next to a lift that played loud music and drove us a bit nuts everytime it was standing open but we mentioned it to reception and they turned it off at night time.  Marrakech itself is an experience that I will not forget. It is not for the weak willed though and I found to my cost on my first night when I was acosted by a snake charmer who had it round my neck before I could escape and a henna tatooist who grabbed my hand and started decorating my arm not letting me go till I had paid her! The Main square is hectic and full of people trying to lure you into their shops but its all part of the experience and you have to learn very early on to say ""NON""!!! Many of the restaurants had french menus with no english translations so it was a bit pot luck what you ordered. We found a lovely restaurant down one of the back streets called Villa Flore. It was owned by a french lady and decorated like a chic parisian bistro. The food was amazing. You will never find it on your own as its ticked behind the souks but if you get a chance ask someone for directions!  A word of warning  if you are planning on going clubbing do not go during ramadan as all night clubs are closed for the whole month during ramadan. This is also not really the place to bring kids. I have 2 and didnt have them with me thankfully as there isnt really anything to entertain them apart from their own section of the pool. I didnt see any children in the hotel during my stay.    if you havent been to Marerakech before bring an open mind !",Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleMissCritical41

Le Meridien N'Fis,hantsspur wrote a review Aug 2009,20,Poor. But nice pool & gardens.,"We visited Morocco for a fortnight in July/August and stayed in Rabat and Fez (two stunning Riads) before making our way to Marakech for our final week of relaxation with abit of site seeing in between.    You know when you get to a hotel and there are so many things that seem to conspire to get on your nerves that you start to question whether the heat is getting to you or whether you're tired and irritable from travelling or is the hotel really that poor? Well that's how I felt after a few hours at this hotel so I made the effort to get an early night to clear my head and hopefully in the morning I'll realise that I was just being an old grump but sadly the place was no better in the morning and continued to disappoint throughout our stay.    We arrived having made (and paid up front for I might add!!) the booking via the internet many months in advance so they certainly had notice that we were coming. Check in was fairly straight forward and once we had received our swipe cards the reception lady pointed us in the direction of our room ""Go straight ahead and it's on the right."" these were our instructions but we were then met by the luggage guy who offered to take our bags and proceeded to go in the opposite direction. We queried ""the lady said it was straight ahead and on the right."". Well it wasn't in fact it was in a completley different building across the gardens.    Arriving at our room we could see that we had two single beds for three weiry travellers so we asked for the extra bed that had been bought & paid for so many months ago the reply that we became familiar with was ""Sorry Sir there has been a mistake."" This was around 4pm. Anyway it was too hot to worry about such trivialities so we made our way to the lovely pool area and spent a few hours poolside. Upon returning to the room at 6.30 we again saw no extra bed a call to reception resulted in another ""Sorry Sir there has been a mistake a bed will be sent immediately."" Well it wasn't it wasn't sent immediately nor was it sent anytime between 7pm - 10pm while we were out of the hotel having dinner in the pizzeria down the road either. So at 10pm after a hot and tiring day we still didn't have the bed just another excuse of there being a mistake with a lame apology thrown in for good measure 6 and a half hours after we arrived!    So it was time for bed and my single bed had a clearly visable blood stain on the bottom sheet. I'm sure the sheets were freshly laundered and not freshly made dirty but even so it is very off putting sleeping on top of someone elses body fluid stain.    There were light bulbs out in the room that hadn't been replaced and the air conditioning was having trouble keeping on top of the heat. When we had walked out down the road in the evening there are plenty of hotels with brightly lit signs above them the sign on Le Meridien was not lit again giving a poor appearance.    Trust me I'm not a complainer and the chances are that had two or three of these things come to me attention then I wouldn't have thought anything about it but so many things were wrong that I came away with the impression of a poorly run 3 star hotel I certainly didn't feel like I'd had a week at a five star.    Breakfast was adequate and served between 6.30-10.30 but try not to arrive later than 10 as on the one day that we did we found that none of the food was being replenished which meant a number of people hanging around waiting for staff to bring more food and drinks which could lead to chaotic scenes and staff giving the impression and just wanting to get to the end of their breakfast shift.    Also be warned the hotel tries to charge hugeky inflated prices for literally everything which means seemingly the majority of guests leave the hotel to purchase any food or drinks. This sadly gives the hotel a very dead atmosphere each evening. Even during the day people tread the well worn path to the supermarket over the road to stock up with drinks and snacks rather than pay rip off mini bar or restuarant prices. I know that hotels need to make a profit but how can they justify trying to charge 35 dhms for small multi pack cans of drink that are printed with 3.5 dhms on?! That's some mark up do the percentages. The crazy thing is that if hotels like this priced the food and drink abit more reasonably then I'd have no problems paying the mark-up but not to that extent.    It's the same with the Wi-Fi which I was told would cost 150dhms I did my calculations and that didn't seem too bad for a one week stay but I was told that this fee was per 24 hours!! I would say that most hotels certainly the two riads we stayed in for the week prior (even McDonalds!) have free Wi-Fi.    The spa facilities and the tennis court was the same over priced consequently even on the cool days and evenings no body used the tennis court. Such a shame.    If you want to use this hotel as a simple place to plonk yourself poolside each day then it will serve it's purpose. The pool area is lovely and the childens and main pools always seemed clean and well looked after as was the areas around them. The pool staff were always courteous helpful and friendly. The gardens are well looked after too and you can enjoy a pleasant stroll through them if you like.    Sadly we just felt that the hotel needed to try abit harder. The rooms are very basic but comfortable enough over all.    Having checked out of the hotel we needed to visit the nearby ATM before acquiring a taxi to the airport. In the blistering heat we walked down the road and got a few hundred yards away carrying our heavy bags before my Son noticed that a secuiry guard and hotel employee were running down the road after us. ""Reception problem come to reception"" was the demand. We turned around and made our way back to reception only to be told yet again ""Sir I am sorry there has been a mistake we don't need you you may leave.

So peacful compared to the madness in the old town. The mint tea in the lobby is so tasty and refreshing. Free interent in the lobby for Starwood members. Our room was very luxuroius compared to all the crappy B&B style hotels we had been in in Spain- flew down here for four nights of something different. It was the highlight of our trip.  Our room was large. Flatscreen TV on wall. Nice tub although becareful of the angle you can really slip. Bed was sooooo comfy and luxurious with lots of layers. A rose was on the bed when we arrived. The pool was very nice- pool attentant actually seeks out lounge chairs for you. About a 15-20 minute walk to the Medina. We walked once in each direction- then just took cabs.  TIP-across and up the street 300 feet there is a little store for beer and water- it's behind a store on the main drag. Also not too many resturants that we liked within walking distance. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Ate first night at the fancy resturant outside- very nice.

Le Meridien N'Fis,LancashireLazydaisy wrote a review Aug 2009,20,Three Star Standard if That,Just returned from trip to the Pink city. The hotel didin't live up to the Meridien standard and fell dissappointingly short of the 5 star rating it's been given. The telephone in the room did not work. When we notified reception personally we were told that they were busy with other guests. There were no other guests there. My brother as a Meridien member was entitled to unlimited internet access but this was not automatically given. He had to request it. It took 2 hours and 3 calls before someone replenished the shower gel. When we booked on the internet we requested 2 guests per room. No problem when we checked in but on checking out we were accused of booking for one only and to add insult to injury they tried to charge for breakfast on the date of departure. The rooms were dated the furniture old and the staff inconsistent. In stark contrast one of our group booked the Ryad Mogador up the road. Upon checking in they upgraded him (complimentary) from a single to a triple threw in breakfast when he had booked room only and for his next stay gave him a discount of £15.00. The room was bigger the staff friendly and helpful and the hotel was not dated. I know where I wil be staying on my next visit. My brother as a member of the Meridien expressed that the standards at this hotel fell well below the standards he had experienced of the hotel in other cities.,Date of stay: August 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,lancashire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LancashireLazydaisy
Le Meridien N'Fis,matt303939 wrote a review Jun 2009,30,"Great location, although some basics missing!",N'fis is in a very good location in the Hivernage area of Marrakech to walk to the Medina will take a 15min stroll a taxi is 3 mins max.  The rooms are clean and large although the website is misleading the rooms are not as plush as you expect but are comfortable. There is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room and no complimetary water things that I would expect from Le Meridien.  The restaurants are of good quality especially the morroccan restaurant there is no atmosphere in the hotel though at night you will find you will want to go out instead.  Drinks are really expensive £25 for bottle of house wine and £12 for a cocktail.  The swimming pool is lush and the andalusian gardens are very pleasing on the eye it is only spoilt by the noise from the nearby road.  You won't be disappointed by the hotel but I wouldnt stay here again you just get the feeling there are better hotels out there.,Date of stay: June 2009,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matt303939
Le Meridien N'Fis,wwwales wrote a review Jun 2009,50,Welcome oasis from the busy city centre!,I stayed in N'Fis in Nov while on a short break to Marrakech. The hotel is outside the city walls about a 20min walk into the city centre and main market. I arrived before the checkin time expecting to have to wait but found to my happy surprise not only was my room ready but I had been upgraded from a single to a suite! The room was top class - very clean new furniture spotless bathroom\shower\bath and spotless on-suite in the living room. Private balcony with views onto the gardens and another balcony with table and chairs for evening dining. All the staff were polite and very helpful - the restaurant by the swimming pool was wonderful - good food and again very helpful staff. The swimming pool was good and a welcome break from the heat of the day and the early evening is a good time to walk the well tended gardens. I did find the city centre a bit to busy for me with too many stall holders chasing you around and hassling you to view their stock so the N'Fis was a great way to relax after that.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled solo,Cardiff,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wwwales

Concierge was helpful for making dinner reservations around town. They have internet in the lobby and also Wi-fi ( free in the lobby and also in some rooms). I didnt eat at the restaurant so I cant comment on the quality of the food but it has an outdoor seating area that overlooks the pool.

Still the grounds were pretty and we enjoyed the swimming pool. The staff at the concierge desk were very helpful and accomodating. The hotel has a lot of modern comforts and the gym was the best of any we used on the entire trip.

I would recommend having your evening meal out as there are numerous very good eateries nearby and they are just half the price of the hotel restuarant.

We were lucky to have a newly-renovated room which was very pleasant modern and quiet at the back of the building on the top floor. I missed a little balcony though. The gardens and swimming-pool are very attractive but when there are a lot of clients there are not enough sunbeds. It´s possible to walk to the famous square but it´s preferrable to take a taxi which costs about 1.5 euros.

I am really happy I used some of my points because I would of been upset paying so much money for a bland boring looking room. I am surprised they consider this a 5 star ! The rest of the hotel is gorgeous the gardens the pool.. basically everything is wow except the bedrooms. Also every morning we were woken up by the sound of the pumbling from our upstair neighbour every time he showered or bathed. not good. They should consider a make over. The location is ok. About a 20 minute walk to the medina. Its in a quite area of the city making it relaxing after a full day in the busy medina. We were rather dissapointed with Marrakech. After seeing Fes I don't understand why more people go to Marrakech. Fes is much more authentic and interesting. Marrekech is more commercial and touristy.

Le Meridien N'Fis,D77London wrote a review Mar 2009,50,A decent hotel,Myself and my parents had decided to go on a break but could'nt agree on where to go so as a second choice for all we chose Marrakech. Choosing a hotel was not easy as looking at the reviews online there was good and bad said about most hotels/raids. In the end we chose Le Meridien.    Le Meridien is set in a more quiet calm part of Marrakech called Hivernage. This could be described as a poor mans Beverley Hills - a lot of 5 star hotels and villas are in the area and a few bars/restaurants that attract a young crowd. The north and south Medinas and the new town Gueliz are about a half hour walk away of few minutes by taxi. With that in mind it was important that all aspects of the hotel were of a decent standard.    Le Meridien is a decent hotel. When you arrive you are greeting with a serving of mint tea something that I was to have a lot more of in the stay there! The reception lobby is nice and the staff there are very friendly. Our room was good nothing too spectacular but good beds a decent bathroom and overall clean and well maintained by the staff. The gardens that surround the hotels are very scenic and very much add the pleasant experience of staying in this hotel.    The hotel has a snack bar (next to the pool) a bar an italian restaurant and a mediteranian restaurant as well a seperate breakfast dining area. Now we are 3 vegetarians and the catering area is something that all hotels and restaurants in Marrakech as a whole could be better and this is one area for improvement if it really is aiming to be a top tourist destination.    Pizza and pasta were the main options for us (inside and outside the hotel) which we ok but got a bit repetative. It was only on the last day we actually bothered to look at the room service menu and pleaseantly suprised to find a few more veggie options including veg samosas and veg resotto which were very nice. Its a shame that these veggie options were'nt available at the snack bar or main bar - something that the hotel will hopefully make a note of as a room for improvement. The breakfasts were good though another suggestion for improvement would be to add a few more brown/ wholemeal bread options instead of so many white bread options    The hotel offers the chance to go on some excursions around Marrakech through the concierge who was helpfull. We did a half day excursion of the Atlas mountains where we had a guide to drive us there meet with the berber people and have a spot of lunch. That was a good excursion and one that I would recommend. We just spent 4 full days in Marrakech but with more time we may have done 1 or more excursions to other places further away. That said just to sit out n the sun by the pool was nice itself.    Overall we enjoyed our time in Marrakech. We were happy with the choice of hotel and Marrakech as a destination. Its less than 4 hours from London and still away from Europe and Le Meridien is a decent hotel at a reasoable price.,Date of stay: March 2009,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D77London

The staff is highly attentive from Said at the door to Youseff at the Concierge desk. They go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of. True its not close to the Medina - but that makes this a quiet and relaxing hotel - which you could never get in the Medina. Our room was large clean everything worked and the flat screen TV was a nice distraction. Breakfast buffet and all other food is more expensive than you will get in the city but also more expansive and convenient. Grounds are lovely - family friendly with a children's play area. Service is very strong. Security is visible. Spa is so-so. Food is fine. Bar service is perfectly acceptable and rare in Marrakech. Go with your friends family or special someone.

Le Meridien N'Fis,idler70 wrote a review Jan 2009,40,Many excellent features.,"Booking a hotel in Marrakech can feel like a gamble  which is maybe why I went for the ""safe"" LeMeridien option rather than a zeitgeisty Riad.    And its not a 5 star hotel  but nor is the accommodation at 5 star prices. It is  however  VERY pleasant. Welcoming staff  beautiful aromas  stunning gardens. The bedrooms are very spacious with views of the pool area  or of the Atlas mountains.    Full marks for having a currency exchange with no hidden charges.    The omelette man at breakfast sets up any day perfectly.We also enjoyed the free supply of mint teas in the lobby.    The medina is a cheap 5-10 minute taxi ride away. This was never a problem. The hotel is also one of the designated stops for the open top tour bus.    So all in all very good. It is however a bit ""corporatey""  reflected in astronomical bar prices and the generally staid/empty atmosphere of the restaurants. But if you want an aesthetically stunning base from which to explore Marrakech  its perfect.    One last thing. This is a well known hotel  only about 10 minutes drive from the airport. Get a taxi.

The cons of this hotel would be its location. It is close to the Menera Gardens a 10 minute taxi ride away from the Jemaa El Fna Square. To get a taxi to and from you have to deal with haggling with the taxi drivers who are always trying to pull a fast one. But its distance also provides a peaceful retreat from the chaos and madness that is the Square.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Weildy wrote a review Nov 2008,30,Excellent breakfast/poor lunch. Where to buy wine etc.near hotel.,Not a good start but things did get better.    We had paid for an upgrade to our room having requested a quiet a twin bedded room nowhere near air conditioning units . On arrival we were shown to a room on the 4th floor overlooking the open air Moroccan restaurant . The room we were shown to was a double bed room immediately opposite the ventilation unit from the kitchens. There was music emanating from a loudspeaker at the open air restaurant. All VERY noisy.    We requested a change of room and were given twin bedded room on the same floor at the back of the hotel overlooking the tennis courts. This was a quiet room and we had no complaints. However there was certainly nothing 'superior' about it. We visited the 1st floor room of another couple who were on the same tour as ours and who had not paid the extra for the upgrade. Their room which overlooked the swimming pool was identical to ours. SO DON'T BE CONNED INTO PAYING FOR AN UPGRADE.    The general ambiance of the hotel was excellent and the gardens beautiful and well tended.    The swimming pool was good but would have benefited from a few more chairs or sun loungers.    Breakfast was particularly good with a wide selection of cereals fruit cold meats & cheeses. There were two chefs preparing omlettes fried breakfasts & pancakes.    On our first day we made the mistake of lunching at the restaurant by the pool. They were offering bar-b-Q type meals. The food was mediocre and very expensive for what you got..    On one occasion we ate at the hotels Moroccan restaurant in the evening. The food was excellent - but once again - expensive. We tended to eat out at local restaurants there are several reasonably priced restaurants situated on the same road as the hotel if you turn right out of the hotel front door.    Drinks at the hotel are expensive. There is a less expensive bar just down the road from the hotel in one of the restaurants that I have mentioned. Alcohol is only served indoors and you cannot sit outside to drink.    Alternatively you can purchase wine/beer/spirits& bottled water at about ¼ of the hotel prices at an establishment across the road from the hotel . Cross the road and turn right. The shop is down an alleyway about 100 yards up in the left. There is also a mini market selling all sorts of snacks & fruit at very reasonable prices. A bottle of red of Moroccan wine (surprisingly good) the same label as sold at the hotel for 250 dirhams will cost you 45 dirhams here. A litre of water will cost you 12 dirhams.Your purchases will be placed in a black plastic bag as it is illegal to have it in view on the street. If your having difficulty locating the shop just look out for all the cyclists/motorcyclists with their black bags.    The hotel is situated approximately 20 mins from the souks and main square.    Hotel staff varied in efficiency politeness and attitude. The dining hall staff were generally speaking surly and I'm sure their faces would have cracked had they attempted a smile. Maids & security staff were fine reception were a mixed bunch some friendly and helpful while a couple(female) were the opposite. The stars were the porters who were always jovial and helpful and were worthy of their tips.    We had a very enjoyable ten days in Marrakesh.

When I requested to change my room they instead sprayed the room. 2 days later the ants were back. The walls were extremely thin the fridge leaked all over the floor and housekeeping was hit or miss. The rooms were not up to the Le Meridien standard.,Date of stay: September 2008,Trip type: Traveled on business,Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KristiMD
Le Meridien N'Fis,CultureVulture88 wrote a review Sep 2008,50,Safety in a trusted name…,I have just got back from spending a week in Marrakech with my two sisters (three girls in total all late to early thirties).    After a lot of research that at times bordered on the ridiculous we decided a major hotel would be better for us than a Riad so we could have both the culture and relaxation beside a lovely looking pool. I have never felt so relieved in all my life when after our first trip to the Souks we could escape and hide back in our very friendly hotel.    The hotel was perfect. Just to give you an idea of my comparative familiarity I have had the very fortunate experience of staying in superb hotels from a suite at The Ritz in Paris to the Bellagio in Las Vegas with many in between. I don’t mean to show-off I just want to indicate a level of rating to my review so it’s as helpful to you as all the reviews were to me before I booked. We had a room on the ground level next to the pool it was clean the maids were friendly and thorough and we are three girls there were shoes and bikinis everywhere! The breakfast staff were fantastic as was the breakfast choice and the pool was a divine break from the intense heat – if not a little cold but this is very good for your circulation is it not?!!    As three sisters we wanted to stay in a room together and they wheeled in a bed for us which there was plenty of room for and perfectly comfortable. I absolutely can’t fault our stay at the hotel. We had a complimentary plate of fruit and water delivered on our first night and dried fruit half way through our stay. It’s the little things!!    However please be advised for any girls travelling alone that towards the end of our stay we didn’t leave the hotel. During Ramadam clubs such as Pacha are closed and for the remaining open ones we were charged extortionate amounts because and according to them ‘it’s Ramadam’. Alcohol is expensive in Marrakech anyway when compared to the cost of living (due the Muslim religion) but no more than you would pay in the UK but at times we felt like we were given a ‘special’ price!    We are not three virginal missionaries by any stretch of the imagination but we were grabbed at sworn at ‘kerb-crawled’ many times and felt immensely uneasy all the time. We bartered in the Souks following advice from the Lonely Planet guide but this resulted in things being thrown at us and comments being hissed at us regarding their religious beliefs and followings. We are not your typical ‘Brits-Abroad’ Ibiza crowd and we were respectful at all times covered from head to toe whilst in the Medina and never retaliated. It was such a shame as I have always wanted to experience Morocco and always travel to new countries to learn their cultures and way of live but in Marrakech we were definitely not welcome!    On the flip side any British couples that were there had little or no hassle at all. It’s just something to bear in mind for single women travelling there. I think my next trip will be to Bhutan and I am very sad to say that Marrakech has tainted my eagerness to travel to another Muslim country anytime soon.,Date of stay: September 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CultureVulture88
Le Meridien N'Fis,SMackinnon wrote a review Sep 2008,40,Lovely Hotel -Quiet and Relaxing,A beautiful hotel greeted in reception lobby with tea and hot towels to wash our hands which was a lovely touch. Also allowed to check in early which was great.    Agreed with other reviews that rooms were fairly basic but still very nice.    The grounds of the hotel were stunning with lime trees everywhere. The pool was also amazing very quite and relaxing a very chilled out vibe throughout the hotel which made it really enjoyable.    About 10 mins walk into Marrakesh medina walls so away from the hustle and bustle.    Breakfast was really lovely and varried. Served in a really nice relaxed area of the hotel.    Staff very attentive and remembered our names as we were leaving and said good bye and wished us well    Over all - lovely hotel very relaxing and quiet great pool and very attentive staff.,Date of stay: August 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,S-Rafferty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMackinnon
Le Meridien N'Fis,Resh30 wrote a review Sep 2008,30,Could have been better... being Le Meridien!,After reading mixed reviews I was open minded when I arrived at the Le Meridien N'Fis...  1) Nice decor including lovely garden areas which one usually expects from the Le Meridien group.    2) Reasonable size pool which is clean and kept well. We didnt have a problem getting a sun lounger... however when people had finished using them the staff never cleaned up after or took the used towels away - so it was difficult to tell if they were being occupied or not! They give clean towels at the pool area. In terms of refreshments by the pool side - I was alittle surprised that the pool bar only served beer and soft drinks...no spirits or cocktails!!!    3) We checked in early and had no problems and were given a tour of the hotel before being shown to our room.  When checking in might be worth checking to see if you have a pool facing room as the view is better. Also for couples wanting a double bed - try and request this before your arrive or at check in. As most of the beds in the hotel are seperate twin beds and they only have a few rooms which have a double bed.    5) Service - was below expectation. Staff generally lacked initiative and were a little laid back - which I did not expect from the Le Meridien group. My husband does not eat beef and requested one the dishes to be changed to fish which the waiter said was fine. However when the dish came and my husband bit into the pastry.. yes you guessed it was beef... I did not hear one apology from the waiter or manager.. which one would expect.    6) Food at the hotel - I would recommend you venture out of the hotel to eat as the food in the hotel restaurants was not impressive and not worth the money. We paid 300DH (£21 for 2 people) in the poolside restuarant which mainly served pizza pasta and salads which was not very tasty and rather bland. We also went to the Menzeh morrocan restaurant and paid 800DH (£57) which had a nice menu but again the service could have been better. Hivernage is a nice and safe area which has lots of cafes and restaurants and is only a short walk away from the hotel.. in the evening the place really lights up and is busy!    7) We found this hotel quiet and more families were occupying the hotel. It was not really suited for the younger crowd.. unless you are looking for a quiet relaxing holiday.    8) We had a great time in Le Comptoir and Amenties (they were right next to each other) which was a 10 minute walk from the hotel - very upmarket bar with a great DJ and lovely cocktails!,Date of stay: August 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Resh30
Le Meridien N'Fis,RovingBrit wrote a review Aug 2008,40,"Great Poolside Sunbathing and Breakfast, But Rooms Somewhat Basic","I stayed at this resort back in late February as I needed a shorthaul trip from London somewhere warm for a three day break.    I decided on this hotel rather than a more intimate Riad as I wanted somewhere with a great poolside for sunbathing and felt a Riad was a little too intimate for what I was after.    Weather was warm and sunny two days overcast the third but took that day to sightsee picking up a private guide via the helpful concierge to take us on a walking tour round the souk and though pricey (200 Dirhams) I felt we got value for money.    Though you have to sit through being sold a (surprisingly expensive =£500+) carpet do not feel put off being firm after ten minutes and walking away to continue your tour. You MUST visit the Square at night for the atmosphere quite chilly thyen so bring a jumper but best NOT to eat anything there however tempting.    Meridien located ten minute drive from the Airport the terminal was being modernised and should be super once finished in late 2008. Meridien is opposite the former Sheraton (now the Royal Mirage) which was dire and full of coach tourists when I walked around the pool.    Agree a price in advance of setting off with the driver (mine charged me 100 dirhams and pay no more than this); journey was exciting/scary with oncoming traffic in middle of road but not worth having a hotel car meet you.    Tip 1: if coming over on BA bring headphones as a movie was shown but you were charged £3 for headphones to listen to it.    Tip 2: Keep a pen handy on board to fill out the Arrivals Card and again on departure before check in.    Tip 3: Moroccan Dirhams are hard to come by in bureaux de change but use the cashpoints in the airports to get the cash you need - handy for tips taxis and souk shopping; the amount you can take out per day may be limited so if staying a long time bear this in mind. I found most restaurants took credit cards though.    Tip 4: Alcohol seemed pricey to me local wine was passable and less expensive French wine was a rip off so do stock up on Duty Free on your way over.    I found rates at Le Meridien cheapest if booking via spg.com and there are often ""stay longer play longer"" promotions giving four nights for the price of three so google for that deal.    On arrival was given delicious complimentary sweet tea in the lobby and as a Starwood Gold was given free internet access coupons (three PCs in the lobby but often busy) and a free hammam token. Spa wasn't all that great would suggest having a massage elsewhere.    I was in a poolside room with a view of the pool the only drawback being noise from the busy road outside from 6am onwards. As the air conditioning (even in Feb) was useless I slept with the terrace door open so noise was an issue. Decide whether a view or a lie in is important to you as the other garden facing rooms were quieter or bring earplugs.    There was no clock in the room or face flannels so plan ahead for that! Bed wasn't that comfy; quite hard actually. Tiled flooors old TV and quite a ""rustic"" feel but it worked for the location. A renovation cannot be far off.    Breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the ornamental garden was top notch especially delicious orange juice and strong coffee and lovely to sit outside in the warm air that time of year. At night it is all lit up with candles in the gurgling fountains and a very romantic place for a stroll before bedtime.    Visited a great restaurant called Darzellij on first night; adventurous as it's down a dark alley (a guide takes you from your cab all very James Bond) so highly recommend that and also the Hivernage which had a nice minimalist outdoor restaurant. The more formal Jardins de la Katoubia restaurant was also good.    VERDICT: This hotel was perfect for a cost effective weekend break for those looking for excellent poolside sunbathing opportunities a delicious breakfast and a base for taking the odd walk into town. If I was to return I would probably seek out the better located and more luxurious recently renovated Sofitel or for a very special weekend the deluxe Aman resort.",Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RovingTraveller1900
Le Meridien N'Fis,kxa wrote a review Aug 2008,30,Very Average,We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and it was more then enough. To be honest my first impression of the hotel was very bad since the reception girl and almost rude to us when we first checked-in but the rest of the staff was either nice or just average. So I cant really recommand this hotel since it was so expensive and not worthit. The Jemâa el Fna is at least 30 minutes away (walking) is your in shape! So I think you better go with a Riad or the Sofitel thats alaways a safe one!

Le Meridien N'Fis,Timothy P wrote a review Aug 2008,40,Great facilities and location,My family stayed for 4 days at the beginning and end of a tour of Morocco. It is a typical Meridien with good interior facilities and an excellent pool. It is also convenient from the Airport and close to (but outside) the city walls. Rooms were fine though the a/c needs to run all the time to be most effective. There is only an 'Italian' restaurant in the evening apart from the expensive Moroocan-themed one. The breakfast restaurant which does a good morning buffet is closed for the rest of the day but this may be because it is low season (very hot in the sun by the pool!).,Date of stay: July 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tim0thyp00le
Le Meridien N'Fis,WomblesofWimbledon wrote a review Aug 2008,40,Great hotel but terrible service,I stayed at this hotel on a girlfriend long weekend. The surroundings and gardens of this hotel are very beautiful and calming especially at night. We arrived late there was some kind of mix up with our rooms – we had asked for 2 inter-connecting rooms or rooms next door to each other. What we got were 2 rooms on different floors – we complained but they told us the hotel was full after kicking up a fuss the hotel staff seemed to have found 2 inter-connecting room sounded a bit strange when the hotel was apparently full! And there was no help to move our bags when changing rooms. Also we asked for one double and one triple room and the triple rooms turned out to have a pull out bed only fit for a child there weren’t enough towels in the room – we called for some more towels and it took 3 hours to arrive! Same goes for the ice it took 2 hours for the ice to arrive. Soon we worked out it took 2-3 hours to get any kind of service so the next day we ordered the ice at 6 pm and it arrived 8:30 just when we wanted it! The hotel itself was great pool was beautiful but don’t order the mint tea at the poolside at £6 per shot it’s not worth it. The breakfast was great and plentiful fresh omelettes made to order. Bear in mind you need to pay some kind of tourist tax when leaving the hotel which may not be part of the deal you are on. Exchange rates at the hotel are the same as banks – you don’t get charged a premium as you would in other hotels. All in all fantastic hotel but service was diabolical.,Date of stay: June 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WomblesofWimbledon

Air conditioning worked but couldn't always keep up with the temperature (was 44 degrees) room service was good but obviously you're being ripped off somewhat.

Excellent Hotel clean beautiful setting - surrounded by Audalucian style gardens almost all staff were very helpful and friendly during our stay.    Large Swimming pool with small childrens pool immediately adjacent so easy to keep an eye on younger children and poolside bar and day restaurant serving salads pannini's and pizzas.    Good choice of restaurants including an A la carte restaurant and an Italian restaurant - serving good food. Breakfast choices were excellent.    Well located a short taxi ride away from the Jama al'fna square and souks and also close to Gueliz if you like a more european shopping experience (with a good choice of the fast food outlets such as McDonalds KFC and Pizza Hut)    The only negative things I would say is that the hotel room & restaurant prices are not that different to a comparable hotel prices in Europe so its definitely not a cheap or budget option and that service in the hotel restaurants in the evening was a little slow side but the food was of a good quality when it did arrive.    Our kids (8 and 5) loved the visit.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Super Jumbo wrote a review Jul 2008,40,Sensational daily breakfast buffet,This is quite a good hotel overall with prompt room service and friendly efficient service at the front desk. The rooms are bright and comfortable but not lavish by any means. The balcony was unusual not really a balcony at all (enough space to squeeze between the door and the balcony rail...it still confuses me as to why they bothered!) The pool was really nice if a little too warm for midsummer. The lack of trees for shade was the only concern here although umbrellas were provided. The poolside snack bar was expensive by moroccan standards (270 dirhams I think for their buffet). The breakfast however was sensational. A huge range of choice with an egg station outside (for freshly cooked omelettes). The hotel is in a reasonable location for a short cab ride to the medina (or about a 20 minute walk). The Electiricty went out twice during our stay however so they need to do something about this (other hotels around were still lit). Once at about 10pm (but only for a couple of minutes) and then the next morning about 10am.... and the electricity was still off when we checked out at midday....

I would say this is the only downside and I found this hotel to be one of the friendliest and most pleasant hotels I have stayed in  with nothing being to much trouble . I would hunt out the international restuarant which is underused probably due to somewhat hidden location within the grounds. The pool is great and the hotel security are more than happy to aquire an honest taxi for you  so you dont get ripped off.

Altough the location is excellent and the overal atmosphere good we found the standard less then we are used from Meridien hotels which we visit regularly. The hotel interior is a bit outdated and not really impressive. The room was very basic and not 5 star standard. Four star would be appropriate.

I have to say that we stayed at a wonderful Riad for the first five days of our stay but after a trip to the Southern Oasis returned to Marrakech with a hire car + couldn't quite face the craziness of the Medina again. The Riad was wonderful but it's a full on experience as soon as you leave the front door. If you like to be a little more secure in your base - cab's by the front door no hassle and a ""western"" set of facilities (bar restaurants) then the hotels just outside the Medina are a good choice. You can walk if you want but it's a short cab or horsecarriage ride if you prefer. The Meridian..... It was so very nice to be greated so warmly on arrival and all of the staff had the same calm & friendly manner. They were really trying to provide the very best service. The hotel could do with a refurb to be honest - rooms are older but they're what you would expect from a US hotel chain - large aircon'd clean TV etc. The pool was lovely and restaurants were excellant - food service and atmopsphere.

We like to tour and site see in the morning and be chilling by the pool by 14.00. We wanted a comfortable hotel with a nice pool. Meridien did fine for us. We liked the idea of a Riad but they are too small for us and non had a large pool.    Located between the airport and the Medina 5 min by cab. 15 min walk to the Medina or a 20D mini cab.    Check in - fast and efficient. We arrived early but they checked us in after a short wait and a free cold lemon drink. Plush reception and very helpfull bell staff. Expensive but with La Mammounia closed it is one of the top hotels in the city.    Room - basic for a 5* but clean and with everything you need. TV had both Sky and BBC News. Mini bar fridge. Very expensive. £3.50 for a Bounty (though we just had to eat it). Best to ask for a ground floor room. They have a large patio which is nice for a glass and cigar later on. Good bathrooms with bidet twin robes and hairdryer. All you'd expect really. No iron or board. Maid came in twice a day.    Food - we did not try the pool side lunch snack bar. The food looked good but it was expensive. We did though have a pool service burger and chips each. Nice quality though £8 each. Beer £3 per small glass. One evening we tried the a la carte. Very nice quality and impecible service but huge portions. The fillet steak would have fed a family of 4. Moroccan dishes were very good. £70 for 2 for 2 courses with a nice bottle of Moroccan wine and a pot of mint tea. Lovely seating area outside the restaurant.    Gardens - well tended with lovely smells of lavender and rosemary. Plenty of fountains trickling away. Nice epsecially at night with floating candles.    Pool - very good. Helpful pool staff. Plenty of padded loungers and sunshades. Good for kids. On our last day it was 36C in April - so a pool is a must for us.    Staff - very helpfull. They arranged a hire car for us. Check out fast and efficient. No complaints at all. No requests for tips.    We always like a hotel with a nice pool. This was perfect for us. After a morning doing the sites and the madness of the Medina it's nice to return to a quiet quality hotel for a dip in the pool.    5*?

My final point is the most worrying we were treated coldly by the front desk staff who were quite rude when we settled our billwe left in a taxi for the airport as we became near to the aiport the taxi did a u turn in the middle of the road and began to head back in the oppisite direction we became very afraid and asked what was happening he spoke very little English he was speaking on his mobile phone he was saying big problem at hotel we arrived back at the hotel in a state to be told there was £3.50 outstanding on our bill for a sprite from the mini bar we produced our bill and proved it had been paid and it was hardly worth bringing us back from the airport in such an aggressive manor there was no apology made we were just told it was a mistake. we were extremley upset but could not follow this up as we needed to be at the airport.

Le Meridien N'Fis,CraftyTraveller08 wrote a review Apr 2008,20,A hotel of inconsistencies -be careful!,"Before I start on the hotel Meridien let's just say a word about Marrakech if you are a ""first time"" traveller there. For those who've never visited the Arab world or been in a ""souk"" (market) it can be an interesting experience but really Marrakech has very little to offer other than that. It is a max 3-day city and as such presents a great weekend break from London in just three hours. There really is not much to do or see. As a Muslim city virtually no bars serve alcohol so you have no ""pavement society. Bear this in mind - we went for a week and it was three days too much.    Now onto the Meridien. We stayed there for 7 days in April 2008 and I really want to try to give you a fair feeling of the hotel as I always find the TripAdvisor reports so useful.    We always travel 4 or 5 star so a big Meridien hotel does not impress us. It has to conform to the standards we expect and in some respects this fell short to a moderate degree.    With the Mamounia closed for restoration this is now one of the best hotels in Marrakech. Whilst there we visited Hotels Saadi Sofitel and Atlas and still prefer Meridien but it does have it's problems.    FOOD: It advertises three restaurants but the management only open the Buffet when they consider they have enough ""group bookings"" to justify it. Thus in 7 days there in April after Easter (highish season) it was closed for 5. When it was open the food was very good but one of the (numerous) management mistakes is to charge a set price of 320dh a head (£20) for the three course selection. Most people on holiday do not want 3 courses - especially if with kids - but there was no lesser deal.  We spoke to the hotel as to why the restaurant was not open all the time. They said there was not enough demand. Not surprising at £20 a head !!!  The only other option - always open not surprisingly - is the A la carte restaurant serving expensive food from a fancy ""French"" menu that the kitchen is totally incapable of cooking with any degree of skill.  The lunch option is restricted to a poolside ""salad / bbq"". The skewered meats were dried to a frazzle ( twice..) and the salad selection is poor. Price of 250dh including dessert (who wants big desserts at luch?) is £18 a head. After three days we saw someone eating pizza and discovered they had a snack menu which is not usually given out unless asked for. (Another Management con). The snack menu was excellent for a lunch and much cheaper.    POOL (see pic) is terrific only spoilt by the incessant rap and pop music played all day over the speakers. We complained heavily of this up the managerial chain and eventually on the last day it subsided. We do not want our holiday ruined by being in the bar staff's private disco. If it happens whilst you are there scream at the Manager.  There are lovely four-poster day beds by the pool but they charge these extra at £10 a day. (No signs to tell you that) so no-one uses them - more stupid out-of-touch management.    BEDROOMS: Very good spacious and decent beds ( but crap pillows as in most hotels outside the US. (Why??...) I always travel with my own in the case now.    GARDENS: Really lovely water gardens a magical setting at night when the staff float hundreds of candles on the waters at dusk. This really is the great feature of the hotel.    STAFF: Generally absolutely first class in every department . Although a French hotel in old French Africa everyone that matters speaks excellent English    WHAT COULD BE BETTER? The hotel has no coffee lounge or somewhere to get a snack outside eating times. Basic tea/coffee is served in the bar all day but this is a poor substitute.  There are hardly any restaurants / cafes within walking distance.  The town is 30 minutes walk away but taxis are very cheap - just 20dh ( £1.20) from hotel to town    CONCLUSION: If you are off to Marrakech and want a good hotel you do do far worse than the Meridien. I suspect this is a local francise and not very well run but I didn't find any in town that were much better. All the City is a bit down-at-heel by UK / USA standards so go stay and enjoy. I am hypercritical but I believe you get should get what you pay for. This hotels sets itself at 5 stars and honestly is an OK 4 so don't judge this five - starrer by the Plaza NY or Dorchester London or the George V in Paris. Star standards in North Africa are very different !!.  This hotel's management really need to get out there ""on the ground"" and connect with their guests. It has the potential to be the best hotel in Marrakech (well...after the new Mamounia but that will be 6 star world-class..) so please sort out the details in your hotel Meridien N'Fis !    Finally just a word about taxis from the airport- to clear up much confusion by other Trip Advisors. However good a barterer you are ( and I speak both French and Arabic) the hard facts are that you will be unlikely to get a taxi from the airport to anywhere for under 100dh which is £7 ( Heck – not much but it’s only a ten minute ride) The airport taxi guys have got together and set the price. I tried to get it down to 70dh in three languages (just for fun) but no go. They know there are plenty more behind you so pay up and don’t feel bad about it. The trip to the airport from town is 50/60dh.

The service is atrocious and it's pricey for what it offers.    We asked the concierge on several occasions to make reservations for us at restaurants etc. None of these were taken care of. When we finally asked to use the desk phone ourselves to place the call our room was charged for the call.    Somewhat inexplicably they lost the third night of our reservation. Instead of simply asking us about it (since we'd already been staying there two nights) they locked us out of our room and then took roughly half an hour to sort out the administrativa (even though we had the confirmation with us). They never apologized for their mix-up or our time wasted.    Also the location is somewhat far from the center of the city (roughly a 30 minute walk) and isolated from restaurants etc. (not to mention the sites). In nice weather it's not a problem.

Le Meridien N'Fis,AR&KB wrote a review Feb 2008,40,Peace and quiet,We stayed in a superior double room on the fifth floor for four nights during early February 2008 on a B&B basis.    Location: The hotel is located about 25 minutes walk from the centre of the Medina and a short taxi ride from the airport. There are a couple of restaurants cafes and (unusually for Morocco) a bar nearby if you do not want to eat in the hotel or trek into the city centre.    Rooms: The room was large and cleanly decorated with a few Moroccan accents. There are large floor-to-ceiling sliding doors on the south facing end of the room. There is plenty of storage space and an in-room safe. There is a mini bar and TV. The bathroom is a good size although the bath could prove a bit of a squeeze for many. Rooms are serviced twice daily.    Food: The breakfast buffet is excellent. There is a great choice of pastries fruit hot dishes freshly cooked eggs and crepes juice etc. We didn't eat in the restaurant or snack bar - there are just too many other options to stick to the hotel.    Facilities: The hotel has lovely gardens and a nice pool area equippd with sun loungers and outdoor four poster beds. There is also a small gym and spa.    Overall we would say this is an excellent hotel and a great place to unwind after a day of pounding the streets and lanes of Marrakech.

The pool are is beautiful UNTIL you try to go into the pool! It is unbearably cold. Literally freezing- there is no excuse for this.    Being a starwood gold got us an upgraded room (which didn't seem better than the regular rooms) and a really nice fruit platter & bottle of wine in our room upon arrival. The hotel is a good choice if you don't want to brave staying in a Riad....the medina can hardly be called a relaxing place. You can walk to the Medina & Koutibia Mosque in 15-20 minutes though the walk can be scary as no normal traffic rules apply.    Breakfast was very good traditional breakfast with a few moroccan specialties. Staff was ok and helped us when an insane cab driver tried to charge us 100 dh for a 20 dh ride. Prepare to feel like a walking dollar sign in Morocco. The locals want money if they give you directions. We also felt ripped off by the hotel concierge as we were there for a 3 night stay and said upon checkin that we wanted to go to the Atlas Mountains and were not told that the hotel tour (maybe 350 dh a person) only went on Tuesdays. Instead he called his friend and ripped us off at a 2000dh private tour.

Le Meridien N'Fis,karl786 wrote a review Jan 2008,50,Greeeaattt Moroccan Hotel,We stayed in this hotel in December 2007 for 3 nights.    I really can't understand some of the bad reviews about this hotel.    The comparison to a 5 star hotel in dubai is unrealistic; simply because Duabi has raised the bar on hotel standards per say.    This is a Fantastic hotel with great decor and great service.    There is definitely a moroccan feel to this hotel; it is not your typical hotel.    The location is excellent; (just 15mins walk to the square) and 10 mins drive to the airport.    The food was excellent with great breakfast buffet variety.    Service was also fantastic; they could not do enough for us.    Our room was overlooking the pool area with a small balcony (majority of rooms have this). We also had a great view of the Atlas mountains in the distance.    The standard of the room and bathroom was excellent with mosaic stone tiling that gave the bathroom that moroccan feel.    At no time will you feel like you are sitting in a 3 star hotel in the UK; i assure you !    If you are used to staying in 5 star hotels in dubai then perhaps this is not quote up there; but then which hotels are ??!!    This is a great hotel.

Le Meridien N'Fis,pjack68 wrote a review Jan 2008,30,OK choice in Marrakech,We booked the Meridien months in advance and got a fairly good rate including a deluxe Room breakfast and one ‘diner’ per day for about £130 per night.    When we checked in first impression was quite good our cases were swiftly taken care of and the check in staff friendly and helpful. I wasn’t sure what difference there was between the Superior Room and the Deluxe one I booked and I’m still not sure. I thought about requesting a room with a terrace before our stay but then I read that the Deluxe Rooms were on High floors so assumed the ground floor rooms would be less well equipped in some way. We had a view over the hotel pool which was pleasant with birds chirping outside our window although the wing of a decomposing bird just outside our patio doors less pleasant! The room had most things you needed pleasantly decorated if not luxuriously. Later on in the week we returned for a one-night stay before our flight home and I arranged for a terrace room which was a nice change and I wished we had had one for our initial three-night stay. The rooms apart from this were exactly the same and I suspect the only difference between a Superior and a Deluxe Room is that one has Single beds and the other King Sized. On our first stay we inherited a fruit bowl meant for another guest and I was excited to see what goodies we might get because we were members of the Preferred Guest program. Unfortunately it wasn’t until our last night that they seemed to realise we belonged to the scheme and we got a bottle of water – no sign of the appealing sounding dates and nuts another reviewer was given – sob! However when we stayed for a single night later on in the week we did get a fruit bowl and some water in our own right.    One of the main criticisms we have was of the pool. We chose this property partly because we thought our 3-year-old daughter would appreciate having a swimming pool but it was freezing. It was high 20’s outside so nice and hot for lounging but far too cold in the pool which was supposed to be heated but clearly was not.    On our first evening we were told that the only restaurant open for dinner was Le Menzeh and we all were exhausted after getting up at 3am that morning. The restaurant didn’t open until 7.30 so our plans for an early dinner with our daughter was impossible. Faced with a flagging toddler and the prospect of her falling asleep in what was quite a formal restaurant we decided to get some room service instead. After two phone calls to ask for a room service menu we gave up and went to collect one from reception. Our pizza and hamburger took half an hour to arrive by which time our hungry toddler was in the land of nod. We had no idea if we could offset our room service bill against our dinner inclusive package. On our second night we dined at Le Menzeh. Despite being the only restaurant open it was very quiet smelling slightly of horse dung (don’t ask me why). The meal was fine we both had tagine and a very nice dessert and some good and inexpensive wine. Again we didn’t know what was included in our package or if we’d have to pay full price for our daughters £10 ravioli (I asked for a small portion but got the full dish). On our third day we were going into Marrakech for the evening so decided to have lunch at the hotel instead. We were hoping to go to Al Sequoia as we thought a buffet would be just right for lunch. However the only restaurant open for lunch was the poolside BBQ buffet. This was poor. A pitiful selection of salads to fight over with nowhere to put your plate while you struggled to catch tiny pieces of food with one spoon. There was a limited selection of barbecue food burgers chicken kebabs and some sad looking sausages all cooked in minute portions. We did see people ordering pizzas but this was not well publicised. The deserts were more appealing but if I certainly would not have paid for the buffet if it hadn’t been included. This was our second main criticism despite the website stating three different restaurants only one was open for lunch or dinner. The tearoom was lovely to have a drink in the evening and the local beer a reasonable 45dh (less than £3). It would have been perfect it they had served some kind of bar type food here or light snacks. It was obvious from the lack of custom in the a la carte restaurant one evening that most people dine elsewhere. We went into the city on our last night and my husband had a comparable tagine at a restaurant overlooking Place Djemma el Fna (The Terraces of the Alhambra) at a fraction of the cost of Le Menzeh.    The location of the hotel is OK not far from the airport and the train station and a short taxi ride into the medina. We got charged 100dh to the airport 40dh to the train station and between 30 and 50dh to the medina. All of which I know are more than they should be but are still reasonable by UK taxi standards and I didn’t feel inclined to object.    The gardens are nice if not huge as some reviews suggest. There is an OK playground for little ones and if it weren’t for the incessant traffic noise the hotel would be quite peaceful!    All in all for the price we were more than satisfied. If we had known precisely what our dinner inclusive package included it would have made for a more relaxed stay as were never sure if we would get a big bill at the end of it or have to fight about the charges. As it happens we didn’t. If the hotel sorted out the freezing swimming pool and gave guests more choices for eating even if it was just a bar serving snacks the hotel would be pretty good. As it was it just fell short and seemed in need of some direction. We enjoyed our stay and although I don’t envisage going back this is probably more due to Marrakech being somewhat limited in its attractions!,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,east midlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pjack68
Le Meridien N'Fis,a_freq_traveller wrote a review Dec 2007,30,Not a great choice in most respects,Stayed for 6 days at the Meridien Marrakech.    The good news: there is a large reasonably nice garden and pool area if you get back from exploring town and want a late lunch or to sit in the sun. So for people with kids it's good from that standpoint. The concierges are also quite knowledgeable and helpful.    The bad news: the hotel is reasonably modern but everything is on the cheap side from the lobby to the decor in the rooms to the bar to the breakfast room. Upon checking-in we were given rooms of a category below the ones we had booked and they mentioned nothing until we complained having noticed the rooms on the same floor across the hallways were much nicer. And they're still not very comfortable.    The breakfast room is a disaster---food is average at best; service slow and uncoordinated so for example even multiple requests for coffee produce no results and no one seems to pay attention when the milk runs out. The bar is OK although a little on the cheesy side and the food at the hotel's fancy restaurant was pretty close to appalling for the price. The hamman is way below average--small needs renovation-- and the staff at the salon desk change around reservations for massages etc when it suits them not when it suits you.    All in all a big disppointment and a place to be avoided given the number of attractive riads and other hotels on offer in Marrakech unless the opportunity to be next to the pool is truly paramount.,Date of stay: December 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a_freq_traveller

Unfortunately the N'Fis could have been a Moroccan themed hotel in Disney land. It was dull old and a shell of what a cool Marrakech hotel should be. Our room was very plain...with such inexpensive fabrics and home decor in the medina you'd think they'd spice up the rooms a bit.

Le Meridien N'Fis,mini70 wrote a review Nov 2007,40,Top hotel to relax in,I've just come back from a really relaxing week in the Marrakech Meridien & can thoroughly recommend it to others. We chose the hotel partly because it had a lovely looking pool & was a little away from the centre of town (the taxi ride should only cost 20 dirhams but you'll often be asked for a lot more... the doormen at the hotel are very helpful with this).    Having read another review which said that nobody spoke decent English in this hotel we were pleasantly surprised to find that everyone (including the doormen) had fabulous English were really friendly & helpful & definitely helped make our stay very pleasant indeed.    The room was big light & airy and the double bed was vast. It's true that there aren't balconies on the upper rooms but they do still have sliding doors with a wooden rail outside so it doesn't feel stuffy or closed in (ground floor rooms have nice little terraces).    The pool is lovely & has a small bar which sells a decent but limited selection of food & drinks. There's a buffet near the pool which is fantastic the pudding selection is a treat in itself... it's worth treating yourself to it just the once but it is very pricey! The hotel also has a sauna & hammam which did look quite inviting but we didn't get around to using.    There's a dark & atmospheric bar which is great to come back to after a mad night in the square having dinner. The only draw-back being that when we were there they had a double act performing cover versions of songs who were dire! When they aren't playing it's great.    Breakfast is great there's a huge array of food to choose from & all of it is fantastic quality. The nicest place to eat is outside on a little shaded terrace. I can recommend having the mint tea with your breakfast. It's a local delicacy & we found the best example of it here in the hotel. Also the little fluffy pancakes drizzled with orange blossom honey are a must!    This is a really well appointed comfortable hotel which is perfect for relaxing in. I would happily recommend staying there to anyone in the confidence that they wouldn't be disappointed.,Date of stay: November 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini70

There was only one set of salt and pepper shakers in the restaurant.  The grounds were lovely but the pool which was advertised on their website as heated was freezing which was a shame as the weather was hot and sunny and it looked so inviting.  Hot water in the early evening was a huge problem after a day out in the medina square etc you looked forward to a hot bath or shower before dinner for some reason every evening the water was luke warm we did discover that if you could shower about 4pm the water was hot.  One of the concierge's was very helpful and gave us a couple of suggestions for restaurants where the food was delicious.

Le Meridien N'Fis,SimonHitchin wrote a review Oct 2007,40,hotel Review,Very nice hotel but I think they all are in the hotel strip (Mohamned IV). Pools and gardens were very impressive. On site restaurant was trying a bit too hard - we didn't have the greatest meal - menu was a little uninspiring. The Bar area was nice and relaxing with pianist present. We had booked room only and decided to pay for breakfast (worked out to be about £14) and was not worth the money. On our last day we found a little place over the road about 200 metres down which did a breakfast for about £3 each. The international hotels are a rip off and Marrakech is no exception even though the diram to the pound is very strong in our favour.  I could go on and on about our experience outside the hotel because you could be anywhere in the world when you are inside but boy what a difference when you step outside!  In a nutshell you get hassle everywhere you go we have taxi drivers fighting to take us and our fare was probably only £2.50.  We braved it into the Place D'Jeema El fna which is breaktaking but I would recommend you look at it from the sanctuary of the Cafe Argana. They do lovely fresh orange juice and a basic kebab and chips for a fiver or so but the views of the busy sqaure are great.  In fairness this was our first trip outside Europe so we were a little wary having heard some horror stories.  We went in May and the weather was great.  We had a quick look in the souks (markets) and they are everything they are supposed to be - busy in your face and quite harrowing to a untravelled boy from Herts. My wife did get some nice leather shoes though extremely cheap and regretted not buying more.  Menara Gardens are pretty naf. The red tour bus is a great way to see the city if you are a bit of a wimp like me.  The airport at Menara is very small and very basic - remember to take some euros with you as you have to ditch all your dirams and they don't take pounds (on return that is)  Would I go back to Le Meridien - yes - would I go back to Marakech - yes when I'm older and a little more well travelled.,Date of stay: May 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Hitchin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonHitchin
Le Meridien N'Fis,Tabbie Kat wrote a review Oct 2007,30,Boring hotel in a boring city,"The triple room we had was spacious enough although the third bed was of the fold out variety and not particularly comfortable. We were given a basket of fruit and a plate of nuts dates and sultana's as well as a large bottle of water each day. That may have been due to being Starwood Preferred Guests. There is a reasonably stocked minibar. The bathroom was good with excellent shower gel / shampoo / conditioner supplied. The towels were of a good quality as were the supplied bathrobes and slippers. The main problem with the room was the noisy aircon. It didn't seem to be working to full efficiency so we had to run it throughout the night and it was very noisy sort of like sleeping next to an operating washing machine. Breakfast was adequate although there is a severe shortage of cutlery. Most days we had to wait for a spoon as the tables are set without them. They simply don't have enough to go round. The same applies to teaspoons. Breakfast officially ends at 10.30 but nearly everything is gone by 10.15 so make sure you don't miss it. The pool area is nice and there is a snack bar one side barbequeue the other. The one restaurant available received our custom on the first night only. The menu is very limited. We were the first to arrive but still had to wait 40 minutes for our food which was very ordinary when it did finally make its way to our table. Every other evening we walked 5 minutes up the road where there is a variety of places to eat and drink. There is absolutely nothing in the way of entertainment at this hotel. The bar was spoiled by some horrific ""local"" entertainment that was akin to a group of children bashing metal coconut shells together while accompanied by an out of tune guitary type instrument. The hotel showed the Rugby World Cup final in the bar which was very well attended that night. But as soon as the match finished it was turned off and the ""band"" made their way in. The bar then emptied completely. In my opinion the hotel is comfortable enough but very boring and certainly not worthy of five stars. And definitely not the place to take children.

Le Meridien N'Fis,livery wrote a review Oct 2007,30,Not bad,We stayed for one night at the Meridien N'Fis.  This is a perfectly nice hotel with good sized rooms clean and functional bathrooms a lovely pool area and beautiful gardens.  The location is outside the Medina which means you must get a taxi to the centre of town or the souks.  There is a lot of building work taking place near by but this is not intrusive in any way and you are very much in a 'resort' once you step in the entrance.  The breakfast was excellent lots of choice and well worth stocking up on. The dinner buffet we saw (we did not eat) looked dull and unappetising and very expensive there are two cafe/bar/restaurants down the road to the right which are far better value.  The pool area is nice if not the constant music plenty of beds and wonderful 'cabanas' blowing cool mist onto you on a hot day.    Whilst the hotel was perfectly fine I would not stay again as having stayed inside the Medina for 3 nights following I would question why you wouldn't want to be in the thick of things.

Room was fine - certainly big enough; only (small) ""complaint"" was that there are no electrics near to mirrors in the bedroom so not easy for wife using hairdrier/doing make-up. And the ""air con"" was just about good enough - more ""cool air blowing"" than ""air con"" if I'm honest.

Le Meridien N'Fis,DTHopper wrote a review Oct 2007,40,Nice hotel,"This hotel is very convenient to the center of Marrakech (about 20 dirhams away). The rooms are clean the reception is very responsive to complaints. The breakfast is fantastic - a great buffet with lots of variety. The waiters can be unattentiv. Apart from the breakfast the food otherwise is ""hotel food"". Would not recommend booking guides through them apart from the hotel premium you pay; we had a lousy guide provided. The restaurant recommendations are iffy but had them book our choice of restaurant and we ended up having great locations in the restaurants! Also if you forgot toiletries do not buy them at their kiosk - the prices are outrageous but there is a small shop nearby. We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel; pool and gardens are very relaxing.",Date of stay: September 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DTHopper
Le Meridien N'Fis,Guider1 wrote a review Aug 2007,40,Fantastic stay,I stayed at this hotel for five days. Great swimming pool a lot of space. Very clean and good when you have a lot of sun and can stay in a nice and quiet place to catch some tan.  Great experience at the Menzeh restaurant! They have fantastic chef preparing top quality dishes. Every day great food and great wines!  Breakfast outside in the beautiful garden with loads of everything you may want to eat for breakfast. Friendly staff welcoming you in the morning.  Rooms clean and comfortable. Wireless internet so you can easily take your laptop to the pool if you want.  There is no problem witha arranging a guide or tour outside of the city.  At the bar - every evening live music local Moroccan musicians. Very nice.  Overall: I recommend this hotel. You have to be always open to acdcept mentality of local people (reception staff is not really open for contacts they seem to be focused more on their paper work than guests but I think this can be fixed; and anyway whatever you want they will do it for you).

Le Meridien N'Fis,MazzWootten wrote a review Aug 2007,50,"Lovely staff, beautiful hotel",We were a bit concerned having read some dodgy reviews about the hotel but honestly we had an absolutely amazing time!    The pool was beautifully well kept the staff were amazing and the food in both the cafe and the a la carte restaurant was wonderful! On my birthday they organised a cake for me with no trouble and cooked a beautiful lamb dish that completely melted in the mouth!    Our only complaint would be the distance from the main town took about half hour to walk there but we did get lost and out and about round the hotel felt quite scary at night in the dark but we did not encounter any problems.    The free watermelon in the afternoon by the pool went down a treat and the cooling mist sprayers by the restaurant were great. Breakfast was brilliant with a number of selections there was sure to be something for everyone!    We got upgraded by becoming a starwood preferred guest which we did on the internet and we had a lovely ground floor room with a terrace patio table and chairs which was lovely.

Le Meridien N'Fis,H R wrote a review Aug 2007,50,Great Value for Money,We stayed for 4 nights and found it great value for money. Rooms are fine with efficient and super quiet air-con. House keeping check the rooms 3 times per day. The staff are highly professional and speak good English. I asked about booking a meal at the The Maison Arabe they did it all for us got the cab and told the driver how much to expect for the fair. They also organized a tour to the Sahara for us.  The breakfasts were excellent as you would expect but we never ate in at night. The bar staff all in white Tuxedos were great but the local band playing Moroccan music in the bar were an acquired taste. A vodka and coke and a bottle of beer are about £7. A bit stiff but only hotels and some restaurants sell alcohol so its fairly standard.  No regrets and would stay again. Two tiny moans the rooms have no balconies to speak of and you can hear the call to pray not that it bothered us.  One tip. Always agree the taxi fare first. I did it every time apart from the last morning on the way to the airport and the driver charged us 100 Dirhams (about £6.25) instead of 40 including the tip.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobHope
Le Meridien N'Fis,petrol1967 wrote a review Jul 2007,30,Good Hotel would stay again,Stayed at the Le Meridian Hotel from 12 to the 16th July and enjoyed our stay at the Hotel. When we arrived we were given a nice room on the ground floor overlooking the beautiful gardens with Orange trees growing just a few feet away. Had asked for a Double Bed but were given 2 singles. A quick call to the front desk and the maid came over and pushed them together and changed all linen to make it work pretty well. Pool are is very nice but the staff working the area (towels and drinks) were very very slow. The Towel guy had no system and you had to go over to him to get a towel even though hes staring at you doing nothing. when people left their sunbeds the towels were never collected until late in the day so everyone arriving by the pool thought they were being used. Twice out of the 4 days the towel guy was nowhere to be seen until after 10.30 am so if you wanted a towel you had to wait which was terrible for a hotel of this alleged standard. Breakfast was a pleasure as again you could eat inside or outside among the gardens. Ecellent selection for breakfast with egg station offering anything you wished. Ate in the Hotel Al la Carte resturant the last night and it was very nice in a beAutiful setting overlooking the well manicured gardens. ALL IN ALL A NICE hOTEL WITH STAFF THAT NEED MORE TRAINING. As a footnote I found the moroccons were always looking to get as much money out of you as they could. The Taxi drivers never dropped you off where you wanted they dropped you off outside their brother/Cousins shop where no doubt they earned a commission from. Went to the Kozy Bar in Badi Palace and had a pretty good meal.

Le Meridien N'Fis,sonia_london wrote a review Jul 2007,40,Luxury Stay,We stayed at the Meridien for 5 nights and had a most pleasing stay. The lush gardens of the hotel beat the Menara Gardens and Majorelle Jardins too! Woken up everyday by the sweet singing of the range of birds which inhabit within this oasis.    Hotel breakfast has the entire range and can eaten al fresco near the gorgeous gardens. They even arranged a 4am breakfast for us on our last day- as we had a very early flight to catch. Much appreciated.    The hotel restaurant is handy as the medina is a short taxi ride away. We enjoyed an evening meal of morrocan cusine- very nice with lovely service at hand.    Rooms are spacious and beautifully kept.    Hotel Hamman is also worth a trip. We went everyday!! Massage is around £20.    Only downfall i would point out is the hotel concierge. Quite disappointing but fortunately we had carried out enough research about Morocco to know where to go and which places to visit. Concierge man appeared to be grumpy and unfriendly- speak to reception instead they are more welcoming!!,Date of stay: June 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonia_london
Le Meridien N'Fis,ukiain75 wrote a review Jul 2007,40,Nice Hotel good staff but 5 star prices,An excellent hotel not too big or too small.    Was nice when we checked in and were told as we were starwood members (I presume because I ticked a box on the hotel website when booking) we had been upgraded!  Along with a poolside room came free water a newspaper every day and a fruit basket on arrival - very nice touch! - and I got the best rate I could find by booking direct - about £74 per room per night for a double  Room was a comfortable size bathroom very nice bed huge and v comfy. No real balcony as such just patio doors to a railing - too narrow to sit out on  Facilities wise one restaurant was closed (guess its quiet season due to the heat) the other restauant was V expensive as was the whole hotel (and on check out still not convinced our bill for drinks etc was correct but wasn't far out and we didnt let that ruin the holiday)  Typical prices arer£3.50 for a 33cl local beer £2.50 for a coke (compared to about 50p in the medina or cafe up the road!!) and a main course (steak) was about £13. Buffet breakfast was also about £12 which is a disgusting rip off even by UK Standards - the local places and even the cafe's / restaurants on the square in the medina - with reputations for being expensive - were significantly cheaper  Prices aside an excellent hotel though pool very nice smaller than it looks in photos but still big enough this time of year but could imagine it gets busy if hotel is full. Gardens and surroundings are lovely and the bar is nice and cool. Staff were first class very friendly and helpful.  Location wise is a 20 minute walk or £2 taxi ride to the medina and the new town there are a bank and a couple of cafe's / pizza type places 5 mins up road (one serves alcohol) all are cheaper than the hotel so good options and the open top tourist tour bus stops right outside the hotel every 1/2 hour (no busstop sign just wave it down) which is a good way to get in and out of the medina for 24 hours (- buy ticket on the bus)  I would recommend this hotel but next time would prefer to stay in a riad in the medina for the more morocan experience (wanted somewhere to laze by a pool this time though because of the heat!),Date of stay: July 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ukiain75
Le Meridien N'Fis,RobandJay wrote a review Jul 2007,50,"Great,Great,Great!",Firstlywe were a little worried when we booked this hotel after some of the reviews that have been written about itwe couldn't have been more wrong.  We stayed for 4 nights at the beginning of July-it was hot v.hot on average 102 degrees but usually with light winds which took the edge off.  le Meridien n Fis is a beautiful hotel with v.polite staffgorgeous gardensstunning Pool and a lovely haven like feel to it.  We booked a delux room and got room 042 it was on the ground floor it was spotless and contained the biggest bed we have ever slept in! The bathroom was lovely and the shower always hot and powerful. We even had our own terrace with table and chairs which looked out onto the gardens-NOTE unless you are on the ground floor you don't get a balcony.  The only meals we ate at the hotel were breakfast and it was suberb all the usual plus egg and pancake stations-we never needed lunch! Breakfast is served between 6.30am and 10.30 am so was handy for our early flight home.  In the evening you can sit in the gardens and have drinks which is lovely. Everything gets charged to the room and you pay on check out. the drinks are more expensive than you would hope around £3 for a beer but as it is a 'dry' country and a capital city this is pretty much what we expected to pay.  The pool bar is v.convienient. The pool was really clean and the loungers were very luxurious-NOTE the hotel provide pool towels.  There is no cashpoint in the hotel but if you go out of the main entrance and turn right there is one about 200meters down the road.  Cabs are cheap and plentiful a trip into the main square shouldn't cost more than 30Drs (£2ish) although they will try to charge you more stand your ground(the large mercedes taxis charge more go for a petit taxi) Driving in Marrakech is crazy and we found it more comfortable not to look when we were in the taxis! It takes about 7mins to get to the medina from the hotel and from the airport the hotel is a 10min ride.  When in the medina it's mad there are people everywhere! along with various animals etc! Just go with it and enjoy an unforgetable experience! We ate at the stalls in the market twice and the food and atmosphere is great we both had two courses plus water for £6! I would definatly reccomend trying it.  I was worried about covering up when we went out but never experienced any problems and even dared to wear a vest top without any adverse affects! (flat shoes are a must in the souks)  Once inside the souks prepare to get lost they are a complete warren and you probably won't walk down the same street twice! But they are good fun and half the stalls display prices so if you are not up to the haggling then you will be to shop at ease.  A visit to the Marjorelle Gardens is a must it's so peaceful and stunning and hard to imagine the bustling life that is going on less than a mile away(the garden is not that big and only takes about an hour to walk round)    To round it up Marrakech is an unforgettable unique city and Le Meridien N Fis is a lovely hotel We would reccomend it to anyone.,Date of stay: July 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Kent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobandJay

Le Meridien N'Fis,LeTomTom wrote a review May 2007,20,Stay away from,We made one stay for 6 days.  At arrival room seemed ok and clean with simple marocan modern style decoration.    But the bathroom was different story :  - Mastic sealing quality arround the bath seemed to be made by couple of children playing with plasticine.  ( They put everywhere and in huge quantity offcourse ... )    After first night we discovered that acoustic isolation between the room and corridor was inexistant  After second night we discovered that we was not the only occupants of the room ( cockroach ... YES !!! )  We asked immediately to change the room. The proposed room was just the one next to the wall ... inaceptable.  After some discussion we get one room in different building ... in this third room we was alone and everything semed ok .    We decided to stay on site because did not found other hotel disponible fast and then move for only two days was difficult.  Anyway we had some psychological difficulties to eat in the hotel.    To be fair other points :  - Garden is very nice and managed very well.  - The swiming pool is nice and cleaned every day. (not heated)  - The room is done a litle bit late ( Allways after 1PM )  - The breakfast we took first day was ok and everything was availlable in huge quantity.    We visited Sofitel and seemed quite better unfortunately the standard room was not disponible and the availlable ones too expensive.

Le Meridien N'Fis,qsqmqa wrote a review May 2007,20,Not Worth the Money,I stayed at N'Fis Le Meridien Marrakech for 4 nights in May 2007. If you are as I am a sucker for the Meridien brand and have stayed in some of the better Meridien properties around the world then this hotel is not for you. It is a very nicely laid-out resort and about a 15-minute walk to Medina however the room gives one the feeling that one is staying in a cheap 3-star hotel. Whilst rooms are spacious the fixtures and furniture are very basic. The TV has only a few news and sport channels and half of them are in French anyway. If you are confined to your room for whatever reason and you do not speak French your entertainment choices are largely CNN and Sky News!!! The service level is generally inefficient. The sound insulation is terrible. If a guest living 5 rooms down the corridor or on the floor above decides to walk talk laugh cough fart leave or enter their room take a shower or flush their toilet you will surely know about it. In short it is not worth the money (US$ 300+).,Date of stay: May 2007,,Doha,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qsqmqa
Le Meridien N'Fis,alanreynolds wrote a review May 2007,40,Splendidly landscaped hotel but less than 5 star,"I stayed 2 nights at this hotel on Saturday 12 and Sunday 13 May 2007. It is situated on Avenue Mohammed VI about 10 minutes by taxi (MAD 80 was the best I could negotiate) from the airport This is a modern area away from the main historical sights bars etc. You need  a 20 minutes walk (or another taxi or one of the horse drawn carriages ""caleches"") to reach the Main Square or the medina.    The hotel is set in extensive well-maintained grounds and the 35 metre large open-air pool (unheated but just ok for me) tennis children's play area bandstand etc make it a good recreational hotel. One company was just starting a week's sales-reward visit for 50 salespeople. But the conference room I saw seats no more than 50 lectern style and the hotel could not stage big conferences in my opinion.    The several hundred bedrooms were in 3 blocks at angles to each other. These were 3 or 4 storeys. I had room 344. It was spacious with large double bed. But hanging space for clothes was severely restricted and it was impossible to hang trousers from the hem without touching bottom of cupboard. I imagine women would have problems with long dresses. Drawer space was very limited too. All in all rather poor clothes facility. Bathroom was tiled with a slight step up into bedroom. Seemed to be a design fault with a cemented slope ""workaround"". The shower was over the bath. There was a WC and bidet. I glanced in another room (355) and saw it had similar lack of clothes space and a restricted bathroom where WC was close to touching the bidet! Not very comfortable to use either equipment I would guess. The bed was ok but I have slept on better. A bowl of fruit and a vase of flowers were brought to each room at the start of the stay. There was no kettle in the room but one bottle  of mineral water was provided free of charge.    The hotel had a small room with just 3 Internet terminals for customer use. I was not charged for this. The room was hidden away and seemed little used as a consequence.    Breakfast was served in large area (both inside or outside) at the end of the corridor facing Reception. It cost MAD 195 (EUR 19). It had fruit and cheeses (so was better than bread style breakfast mentioned by another reporter and available at restaurant further along the avenue. But the juices were limited to orange and grapefruit. The cut fruit was melon and citrus fruit. the breads were rather limited. All in all the buffet LOOKED grand but really was not on closer examination. I did not eat any main meals there.    The staff at Reception the cash desk which exchanged Euro for Moroccan dinars and the concierge who suggested a good local restaurant (""The Villa"") and a 4x4 tour into the mountains at Toubkal  were excellent. All spoke English to a much higher standard than I had expected and I need not have spoken French.    All in all a restful hotel in nice grounds but the standards of the bedrooms did not meet European norms for a luxury hotel. I might stay  again because of the pool but the Sofitel slightly closer into town  might be worth a look instead.",Date of stay: May 2007,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Croydon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanreynolds

I understand it may not be full of children so maybe it is more suited to adults but the staff were very friendly - and goodness knows there are enough of them.  We only ate breakfast and the choice could not be faulted everything from fresh fruit and cereal to bacon sausages pastries pancakes and omelettes. We rarely had the need for lunch and we did not overeat at breakfast. The only thing that would have made the rooms that much more enjoyable would have been coffee and/or tea making facilities. There are a couple of restaurants and bars just down the road Caruso being a non alcoholic street cafe type restaurant with very good choice of food and really well priced. (So good we ate there 4 out of 7 evenings)We had 3 pizzas a spaghetti bol. 2 bottles of water and a bowl of frites for £12 !! I hasten to add they do serve tagines etc which we ate other evenings and these are equally well priced.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Zak wrote a review Apr 2007,50,Great Hotel and Great Location,We stayed at this hotel over the Easter (UK) school holidays for two weeks. I thought two weeks might be too long and that we wouldn't like the hotel particularly after reading some of the reviews on this website. However the hotel was great check-in was easy and the room was large but functional.    There are three different wings of rooms but the hotel doesn't feel too large or crowded. The gardens are huge and full of orange trees flowers and lots of grassy areas which are ideal for the younger kids. There is even a sandy play area with climbing frames swings etc. Both the main and children's pool were lovely but definitely NOT heated and the water was very cold although this didn't bother the children.    This hotel is very popular for Events and Conferences and although the lobby was very busy on some days the advantage was that the pool area was quiet during the day. Some previous reviewers commented that the staff were rude and aggressive but throughout our holiday the staff were very approachable and friendly and service was very good.    Some tips:  1) Breakfast is 170MAD (about £11) per person and you get a great buffet but 3 minutes walk outside the hotel (turn right outside reception) there are two great restaurants that also serve breakfast (Moroccan European or American) for around 35MAD (about £2.25) per person.  2) A taxi (petite taxi) costs only 20MAD (about £1.25) to the main square.  3) A 1 hour ride on a horse and carriage (safe and comfortable) costs around 100MAD (about £6) and is a good way of seeing a few sights at a slower pace.  4) There is a very good open top bus ride around the city which takes about 1:30 hours to complete the circuit and the kids love it. It is expensive (for Morocco) at 130MAD per adult and 65MAD per child but provides a different view of the sights. There is a stop right outside the hotel so you can't get lost. Buy tickets from the Concierge or on the bus.  5) We hired a car for two days and the driving was no different to many other places I have driven ie drive as the locals do but don't take risks. A trip to Essouria on the coast is definitely worth the 2:30 hours drive as is the drive up the Atlas mountains and takes about 2 hours. The road outside the hotel goes all the way to the highest point in the mountains where you can get a ski lift to the very top. A fantastic trip that takes you from 90 degrees upto the snow level on a very winding but beautiful road through Berber villages. If you do go there are plenty of places selling rugs pottery sculptures etc and lots of places to buy food and drink. Please take some pens pencils writing pads etc as the people in the mountains are very poor and giving the children some basic items for schooling is really appreciated.    Hope all this information is useful and enjoy your trip.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZakHan32

Le Meridien N'Fis,virtuesoft wrote a review Apr 2007,30,Not a 5 star and very over priced,We stayed in this hotel over the Easter weekend and had a fairly good experience however I did leave feeling like I had been ripped off at times and I wouldn't stay here again.    My biggest gripe was with a lunch buffet that was available by the pool we decided to go for the buffet which we were told was 160 dirham (about £10) per person however once we sat down with our food the waiter told us that the price of 160 dirham was for the cold buffet only and because we also had hot food it would cost 280 dirham (about £17.50) all of the food was laid out next to each over and it was certainly not clear that we would be charged even more just for having some hot food in my eyes a buffet is a buffet and you should be able to help yourself to whatever is laid out. There were probably about another 8 tables that fell for the exact same trick and the waiter had to go round to each table explaining this which some people were not happy with. Drinks are also excessively expensive we had two cokes with the buffet and were charged 60 dirhams (£3.75) each meaning that two plates of average buffet food and two cokes cost me about £42.50.    In terms of service I got the impression that the staff couldn't really be bothered with you unless they thought they could get a tip out of you. When we got to the room our safe was locked because the previous occupants hadn't left it unlocked I phoned the front desk on 3 seperate occassions for someone to come and unlock it but nobody ever did I gave up on this after a while. I also phoned the front desk twice to get an extra pillow again they said they would sort it out but they never did I eventually managed to get a spare pillow from approaching the maids directly.    Enough of the moaning though there were some good points to this hotel mainly being...    1.The location is good it is outside of the hustle and bustle of the Medina and is quite a nice place to retreat after a hectic day out.  2. The rooms are fairly good however they are more 4 star than 5 star standard.  3. The maids were very good and very friendly.  4. The gardens and grounds are very good.  5. The pool is nice although it is very cold and doesn't have enough sunbeds.    Overall it is not a bad hotel but if you do stay here don't expect 5 star service like the Le Meridien website suggests it is and also be careful that you don't get ripped off like I did.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/virtuesoft

But since the riads were full we went with some trepidation having read some fearsome reviews of this hotel.    Being part of a group OF COURSE it is not like being in any particular country or town. An atmosphere prevails that could make it absolutely anywhere and some of the clients evidently prefer that hardly leaving the hotel. Beats me why they go there.    Having said all that this hotel has elegance. It is NOT dirty (one review) the pool is lovely (not small) and doesn't need heating if you are not a natural moaner.    It is a 20-minute walk to the main square and taxis are a reasonable $3 (with the usual barter). The lunchtime food was really poor - tasteless and badly presented - but the main restaurant is good if overpriced.    Breakfast is a generous choice even for fat Westerners.    None of our misgivings were born out. If you're going for corporate-type hotels out of choice or not don't pretend that you're sampling the country. Just accept it for what it is: a good hotel. Not as horrific as the Sofitel which breathes of nothing but  bathroom freebies and musac and does little to make you feel there is any interest in Morocco at all.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ventris_Arden
Le Meridien N'Fis,stanton0406 wrote a review Mar 2007,40,Peaceful and calm and away from the bartering,Read the reviews before I went and pretty much got what I expected.    The Meredien N'Fis is ranked 5* on the basis of it's facilities. It's bog standard corporate hotel but is peaceful the gardens are beautiful and the pool area is nicely laid out too (although the temperature was a bit too cool for me). I went with a girlfriend and we had a nice twin room on the top floor with a view towards the Medina. It had two arm chairs a table area and a good desk (as I needed to study).    We were on a B&B basis and have to state that we were really impressed by the buffet on offer (if our waistlines weren't!) Having had bet on what it would be (tinned fruit crap-cornflakes florescent yoghurt processed ham) what you get is fresh fruit (ok a couple of bits were tinned but there was a vast choice) 10 different cooked options (including some traditional morrocan) breads cheeses ham pastries - it really was amazing and we never really needed to eat lunch.    Biggest complaint about my holiday are the rip-off taxis. Whatever you do don't take what the guides say to heart. You will never get a taxi for 6DH nor will you be charged 60DH from the airport. They size you up and charge you what they fancy according to where you are staying. We got kicked of a taxi twice because we refused to pay the inflated prices (20DH before 8pm and 30DH after 8pm). What makes it even more annoying is that when you leave the Medina after a nice meal they chase you for your business then quote you these ridiculous prices. I think we managed to get a guy to put his meter on twice in the week we were there. Shame really the taxis aren't expensive but I do object to being treated like I am a fool.,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanton0406
Le Meridien N'Fis,MyExperiences wrote a review Mar 2007,20,Hidden Charges and Extortinate Prices,Gardens Beautiful Rooms were clean and comfortable.  Prices were extortinate when considering the competition and economics of the country. Also it is not a 5 star hotel e.g. Room Air Conditioning doesn't exist it is a fan system (hot air in winter cooler air in summer).    Few English speaking staff in the hotel French language and guests predominate.    Maid actually knocked on our room door one evening to ask for her tip as she was off on the day we would have left.    Hidden charges !! Beware the courtesy bus to the airport there is actually a charge that is double the cost of a taxi fare for the same journey.

Le Meridien N'Fis,mundus wrote a review Mar 2007,40,the very best hotel near the medina,Its ranking (#45) is not entirely fair for this excellent hotel because most higher ranked hotels are riads in the medina which can be difficult to compare. The hotel is located on the corner of the avenue de la Menara and blvd. Mohammed VI. It is about 10 minutes walking to the western gate of Bab El Jdid and another 15 minutes to the place Jemaa El-Fna.  It was renovated a few years ago. Our DLX room had a view of the Atlas mountain there is no building between the avenue de la Menara and the Atlas mountain. It was a spacious room with plenty of lights. The bathroom with one sink tub and foot-bath was spotless. A varied buffet breakfast is offered. Dinner at the EL Menzeh was tastefully prepared certainly the appetizers and desserts. Service at the reception the concierge or in the restaurant is customer friendly. There is plenty of greenery with a garden with a fountain alley to the EL Menzeh palm trees and flowers and a large (unheated) pool.  An airport transfer can be arranged for DH 100.,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"De Haan, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mundus
Le Meridien N'Fis,HNSLondon wrote a review Mar 2007,50,Extremely well looked after at the Meridien,I have just returned from a week in Marrakech (5 nights staying at the Meridien and 2 nights in a Riad) with my Mum.    We were extremely impressed with the Meridien. It is a beautiful hotel and doesn't manage to feel too huge (like the nearby Sofitel). Our room overlooked the lush gardens full of orange and lemon trees which smelt amazing in the evenings. The swimming pool is large and an interesting shape - we were happy to spend lots of time lying by the pool in the sun although the water was rather cold (unheated - 22 degrees - so not for the faint hearted! or children). We also made use of the tennis court. I had a massage in the hotel spa which although good was a bit expensive and was overshadowed by our experience at Les Bains de Marrakech (in the Medina).    The breakfast was vey good you can chose to sit outside on the sunny terrace and there is a large selection of hot and cold food with lots of fresh croissants. We ate in the poolside cafe some lunchtimes which was good - salads etc. We avoided eating in the hotel in the evenings since it seemed a shame to miss out on the many and varied restaurants in the Medina or the Gueliz area.    Our twin room was more than adequate. It was spacious and extremely clean with new towels provided twice daily. An nice touch was the weather forecast for the following day along with a little chocolate that appeared on out pillow in the early evening!    The highlight of our stay however was definitely the staff. Staff at all levels were always cheerful helpful and hospitable. The men on the door advised us how much we should be paying for the taxis and the cafe staff around the pool were very attentive.    Overall we had a very relaxing experience and if we return to Morocco we will not hesitate to stay at the Meridien again.,Date of stay: March 2007,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HNSLondon

Le Meridien N'Fis,Sc819 wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Excellent stay,We stayed at Le Meridien N'Fis for 7 nights in Feb 2007. Having stayed elsewhere in Marrakech in previous years I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Clean and excellent service. The view of the High Atlas is outstanding the gardens are beautiful and the pool is heated - not all in Marrakech are. It makes a huge difference in the winter. 15-20 walk minutes to the Djemma flat and easy. Plenty cafes some licensed further up Avenue Mohammed VI. Again an easy stroll of an evening.    We travel a lot and I just don't understand the occasional negative review of this place. Maybe some people out there think that $10000 a night top-end Paris or New York service should be available at a Meridien. If you judge it for what it is - a middle-of-the-Starwood-range hotel in a developing country - it is outstanding.,Date of stay: February 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sc819

From the minute we arrived every member of staff could not have been any nicer. They all were extremely friendly courteous and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and the food is fantastic! Highly recommend the Lamb Tangine with prunes (yes sounds weird!) and the Chicken Tangine with olives and lemons. Excellent wine list with good recommendations from the staff. Every meal we had was first class even the buffet breakfast which i'm not usually a fan of was excellent. There was a barbecue at the poolside on the Sunday which was fantastic - highly recommended to try. The food was fairly expensive but well worth it for the quality and the service. The Bar was lovely rather quiet at times but possibly because of the time of year. Again the staff in the bar were friendly and courteous. Excellent service and very clean. (We did venture across the road to the Royal Mirage Piano Bar - but quickly returned!). The Spa is wonderful - highly recommend the hammam mud wrap and massage. The bedroom was huge with a massive double bed. The bathroom was a bit tired - tiles around the bath needed replacing. Fantastic power shower and lovely robes. Rooms cleaned each day and night - excellent servicing. The pool is huge and there were plenty beds with no problems getting towels.

Le Meridien N'Fis,Polodriver wrote a review Dec 2006,40,Comfortable Hotel,I didn't know what to expect having read mixed reviews but we thought it was great - clean comfortable and the staff were very attentive and very helpful. 'An oasis of calm' after a visit to the medina and especially the souks. A good 15 minute walk to the main square but only 20 dirham max. by petite taxi. 15 minutes walk the other way and you can see the sun set in the Menara Gardens. We only ate breakfast at the hotel and so cannot comment on the restaurant food. We did enjoy relaxing drinks in the bar each evening though listening to the piano player before setting forth to the town again. I expect staying in a Riad will give you more of a true Moroccan experience but this hotel suited us fine for our first trip to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: December 2006,Trip type: Traveled with family,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Polodriver
Le Meridien N'Fis,FreddyCole wrote a review Dec 2006,40,"Comfortable, Pretty, Standard Hotel Chain but wouldn't eat there...",If you want a standard international chain instead of a riad experience this is a good hotel. The rooms are large but don't really have any character. The gardens are pretty. The pool is cool (literally!) so you can't swim in the winter.    The restaurant is pretty but the food is overpriced and lousy. We ordered the speciality of roast lamb which was fatty bland and disappointing. Pizza at lunch was equally weird.    Overall a good place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of the Jemma El Fna.

Le Meridien N'Fis,bob230 wrote a review Dec 2006,30,Good Hotel.,HOTEL / LOCATION  This is a nice clean hotel with friendly staff. The pool is excellent. The main central courtyard area is a refreshing oasis of scented bushes & flowers with the sound of the trickling fountains makes it a welcome reprieve from the inevitable dry & dusty conditions outside the hotel. The road & pavement directly outside the Hotel was being re-vamped although not a big inconvenience we were disturbed on 2 early mornings. The speed of the work appeared to be very fast and think that most of it should be completed by December (although you may well want to check with your agent first. Location of the hotel is about right and is very conveniently located to the airport and not too far from the old Medina (city).    FOOD  Drinks & food at the Meridien are expensive but the quality good.  When we were there it felt like only 25% of the Hotel was occupied which meant that poolside loungers were readily available and hotel services inside relatively efficient.    Walk out of the hotel turn right and walk approx 5 mins and you will find the very reasonably priced Curusoe Cafe/Ice cream-Bar where they do light snacks and limited range of set meals. Tastefully decorated modern and very clean although I would advise you to brush up on your French as English hardly spoken but nonetheless worth the effort. The Curusoes own speciality salad is very much recommended as indeed is the Salmon pasta dish! Prices are less than half price of the Meridian but choice limited. Later we discovered another much arger cafe about 2 or 3 blocks down past the Curuso about 20 mins walk on the corner but can't remeber the name. We didn't get a chance to discover the culinary delights there but its location and size suggested the possibility of a larger choice food.    SHOPPING  WARNING! Practically all of Marrakech is one big tourist trap and decided to prioritise relaxing rather than wasting our time haggling in the markets for overpriced tat. The main shops and malls did not offer anything great limited in choice and London prices! (for belts Jackets etc).    OVERALL  Overall we enjoyed the hotel experience. The weather was glorious in October (average of 28 degree Celsius).  If you want somewhere to relax and soak up some sun which is only 3 hrs away from London then go - but stay mainly at the hotel !,Date of stay: October 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bob230
Le Meridien N'Fis,GCrackr wrote a review Nov 2006,40,Very Nice,We stayed at Le Meridian N Fis for 3 nights as part of a tour package.    The rooms were clean and had all the expected amenities. Ours was on the ground floor which came with the added feature of a patio overlooking the gardens; a pleasant extra (all other floors do not appear to have balconies). Several have commented about the “basic” look of the rooms. True but we believe this is an intentional style selection by the decorator. The furniture is not cheap just simple in design.    The facility is clean well decorated and very beautiful. The gardens are gorgeous. It is quite a walk to the Medina—we recommend a taxi—much faster and not expensive.    Service was mixed. Maintenance service was very prompt to open the in-room safe that has been left locked by the previous occupant. Front Desk and pool staff did their job but without even a hint of friendliness. Table service was very good.    The breakfast buffet was quite good and had a great variety.

Le Meridien N'Fis,thegables wrote a review Nov 2006,30,COMFORTABLE HOTEL IN GOOD LOCATION,My husband and I chose Marrakech for a holiday as had been to Dubai Oman and Egypt and did not want to go too far so seemed to fit the bill for some winter sun. Le Meridien is good value for money being betwixt the Old Medina (very busy) and the new town. We had a deluxe room which was very clean and spacious but basically furnished. The bathroom was fine. All public areas in the hotel are fine but the amenities and service are not like a normal 5 * hotel so don't be disappointed. Hotel is near a main road so ask for a room away from the road. Taxis (get small ones) are about £1.50 each way into town but always confirm rate first. The souks are a must but will drive you mad and you will apppreciate the quiet gardens of the hotel afterwards. We played golf at the Royal Club and the Palmeraie but was sorry to miss out on the Alkemes (?). Good restaurants nearby the Cafe de la Poste off Mohammed V1 Street Rotisserie de la Paix in Gueliz (lovely peaceful garden) and Narwama (Oriental) in Medina. Hotel should give directions. All very reasonable. Went to Le Tobsil - great and Yacout which would not recommended (overpriced).

Le Meridien N'Fis,Kevin_Tyler wrote a review Oct 2006,20,4 star hotel but 2 star service,I booked the Meridien having read some ok reviews on trip advisor and thought it likely to be one of the best in the Marrakech area. It was a reasonable hotel perhaps in need of a little updating (very 80's) nice pool area and rooms were spacious and clean. Check in was quick and friendly. However like many Marrakech hotels it offers poor service in some areas. The conceirge service was non-existent. I had to catch a taxis to another hotel in order to be advised on restaurants and to have them reserved. Even though the hotel shop sold an excellent restaurant guide the main desk didn't carry one and when I suggested they purchase one to advise guests they simple didn't consider it worthwhile. If you want pool side food and drink service you can also forget it. You have to leave pool side and hunt for a waiter in the restuarant adjacent the pool.

Le Meridien N'Fis,kaquamarine wrote a review Sep 2006,50,Wonderful birthday break,My boyfriend and I stayed at Le Meridien for a week in December which turned out to be a wonderful holiday. On the sunny fresh morning we arrived early we were taken to our room well before usual check in time and settled in effortlessly. We found the staff quite friendly and willing to help.    Our room was pretty much what you would expect of a chain 4/5 star hotel. It was clean with all the usual amenities and very comfortable. Each night when we returned to our room I even found my nightie beautifully arranged with rose petals. Perhaps a bit OTT but cute I thought!    The breakfast buffet was fine not a great deal of choice compared to other places I've stayed in but adequate I felt. Also due to the time of year the hotel wasn't full so our experience of it was quite relaxing. The grounds had a very well kept garden and although on a main road felt quite secluded. The large pool was lovely but unfortunately a bit cold (again winter time) but I managed to brave a couple of laps and had it all to myself. The pool restaurant had a nice little selection of food too.    We walked to the medina once and then the rest of the time got cabs into it. Everything is nearby anyway. One thing to watch out for though and that's the cab fares. The cab fares are pretty low compared to London but we found that the Marrekech cabbies were trying to quadruple the price on us because we were tourists which we got wise to pretty quickly.    Le Meridien is in the new part of Marrekech therefore convenient for some of the clubs such as Teatro and Pacha if you like that kind of thing and restaurants. One restaurant which I loved (5 min cab ride) was La Trattoria which had great food a lovely setting by a pool and tasteful decoration.    During our week we arranged a trip through Le Meridien to the coastal town of Essouria. The funny thing though was that the concierge was behaving a bit odd about the booking telling us to come back later rather than just book it which he eventually did. Seemed like he was trying to get a mate to take us but we couldn't be sure. The trip turned out great in the end. Six of us with our own minibus and driver who dropped us off at the harbour and agreed a meeting point for returning several hours later. A fun seaside trip!    On our last day we tried the hotel's Hammam which was my first experience of one. Situated downstairs in a tranquil part of the building. The facilities were mixed but were reasonably quiet. I'm not sure how authentic the hotel's version of a Hammam was. The women working there couldn't speak English so I didn't know what was coming next! My very basic broken arabic wasn't really understood either.    All in all I would recommend Le Meridien it's like an oasis a midst the nouvelle town but also has the more authentic culturally rich medina close by. A nice place to stay in December too when you want a bit of winter sun.,Date of stay: August 2006,,"London, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaquamarine
Le Meridien N'Fis,Holmes114 wrote a review Sep 2006,20,Could have been alot better,We booked the hotel direct with the hotels website and knew that we would be in a twin room (the majority of rooms all seem to be twins) but got a really good deal so couldn't really complain - when we arrived the reception staff were ok but this soon changed after we found that the non-smoking room we requested when booking had somehow turned into a smoking room. To put it mildly the room stank! It took them a while to sort out the problem but eventually we were moved. I agree with previous comments about the huge chip on the reception staff shoulders - they really couldn't be any less helpful or friendly. The conceirege couldn't even give us information on the bus tour that stopped right outside the hotel - even though they had leaflets on the reception desk! Another big problem we had was with the pool - if you don't get there early the sun beds begin to run out and getting a towel from the pool staff is very difficult. If you leave your sun lounger at any point you run the risk of losing it - the staff are very quick to clear your stuff and the towels away.  The food and drink is very expensive at the hotel and nothing special - we turned right out of the hotel and walked less than 5 mins to a little cafe/restaurant (Caruso) and had breakfast and dinner there each night. The cafe charges about £3 for a delicious breakfast the hotel charges £12.  Overall the hotel staff were particularly snotty and couldn't even arrange for the hotel bus to take us to the airport. We had requested a 7am pick up and at 7.15am the bus hadn't arrived - we eventually had to arrange our own taxi with no apology or explanation.,Date of stay: September 2006,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holmes114

My partner and i are both in our early 20's and therefore we felt we did not receive the same welcome as other older guests!    The bell man took us to our room we were promised a double room by Airlinenetwork but were given a twin we expressed our concerns to which the bell man went off and came back with the receptionist i found her to be rude and unwilling to help us she would not allow us a double room that night & PROMISED us one the next day 10 mins later 2 chamber maids arrived and rearranged the bedding to make a make-shift double for us.  Tthe next day i went to reception at the requested time to be told in a rather 'snotty' manner that we could not have a double i argued until eventually we were given one after this the reception staff appeared to sneer at us each time we saw them & were not very helpful - they all seemed to have attitude problems & 'chips' on their shoulders!    The staff at the bottom of thr ladder i.e. chamber maids bell men & restaurant staff were lovely friendly people who could not do enough for you!    The pool was large spacious and clean and the gardens were out of this world truely magical at night all lit up and smelt and looked gorgeous in the day! Very well maintained!!

Le Meridien N'Fis,HonestNYer wrote a review Jun 2006,40,Attentive Care and desire to make guests comfortable and happy,We spend a week in late May in this comfortable hotel. The service was above all attentive extreme desire to please from chambermaids to waiters. I could not square any of the complaints written on this site in 2005 with our experiences. The pool is large crystal clear with a pair of attendants ready to set up your chaise in shady or sunny spot. The weather was moderately warm but we found the pool's unheated temperture comfortable. The air conditioning in our room was effective the bath tub long enough and marble rimmed a burned out light bulb replaced by an electrician within 10 minutes of a call. Our room looked out at the pool from a distance and was quiet and I could hear no noise from the hall or other rooms. The finest rooms would be the ones overlooking the Andalusian garden allée outside the primary restaurant. The food incidentally was some of the best we ate in Marrakech and we went to a number of recommended restaurants. The breakfast buffet was extensive and you could also make special requests that were supplied at no supplement and always with a smile and with no pressure for gratuities. The gardens are magical at night beautifully lit beds of roses and tropical flowers with heavenly scents. A quiet stroll in the garden a perfect way to unwind from the frenetic activites of the old town. There is a spa that I did not try but looked lovely rose petals in the fountains etc. Also a gym with three pieces of new equipment. For a hotel of this size in a city that straddles multiple cultures I would say this hotel is doing very well. Indeed we had to leave for the airport at 4:15 AM and a full breakfast was delivered to our room at 3:45 in the morning. One cannot forget that the standard of living and understanding of what is called a three four or five star hotel always becomes more wobbly when moving off the European or Western continents. But then those idiosyncracies are to me a bit of a window into the culture of the country itself. We were entirely comfortable able to sleep in a cool clean well maintainted environment with a staff willing to meet any needs we had.,Date of stay: May 2006,,"Yonkers, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HonestNYer
Le Meridien N'Fis,Anilegna wrote a review Jan 2006,30,very average place,stayed here for new year's eve only because I couldn't get a room any place else what is good about this place:    1) close to the airport  2) close to the Medina  3) decent breakfast buffet    why this was the only one place I was not impressed with during the week + holiday in Morocco    1) nothing special blah and ugly rooms  2) motel furniture for 5 star hotel prices  3) staff that didn't speak English very well (I know I know I should speak French or Arabic but this is a Meridien hotel I didn't expect staff in the smaller cities/towns/hotels to speak English) but here I could not even get the staff to understand that I couldn't find a beer bottle opener in my room (finally found one screwed into the wall--- in the bathroom)  4) 18 euros for two bottles of heineken  5) so so service overall,Date of stay: December 2005,,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anilegna
Le Meridien N'Fis,Mobile35865 wrote a review Sep 2005,40,Beautiful Hotel,Stayed in this hotel for four nights as part of a group of 70 people. We were extremely pleased with the hotel and in particular the quality of the public areas and pool. Fantastic gardens and the food was better then we expected.    Hotel is situated near to the airport and the main square so it is easy to get to and visit local attractions.    Bedrooms are big (especially the beds) and there were some nice extra touches. We think that people often compare five star hotels to those in London and you cannot do this. We would say that the rooms were more four star but the rest of the hotel was that of a five star. We would stay here again and found the attention to detail by the hotel staff great.    The only down side is the cost of alcohol in the bar and mini bar - be prepared to spend alot of money if you like a drink. No seriously £7 for a vodka and lemondade and even £2 for a small bottle of water in the mini bar.    We are sure you will enjoy your stay!,Date of stay: August 2005,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mobile35865
Le Meridien N'Fis,Tour32048 wrote a review Aug 2005,40,Pleasant stay at Meridien N'Fis,Have just returned from a very pleasant stay at the Meridien. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Excellent pool area and no problem finding a sun lounger. Good buffet breakfast and high standard of food served at the restaurant in the evening. Several pavement cafes situated 5 minutes walk down the road and plenty of other hotels within walking distance which made it posible to eat out at different locations as and when required.  We stayed in room 34 which is on the ground floor not far from the pool. No road noise but could hear guests talking etc as they walked past the room. Best location is probably down near the tennis courts on the garden side. Would certainly return to this hotel.  Also visited Royal Mirage (formerly Sheraton) and Sofitel. The former resembled the type of hotel you might expect to find in Benidorm but the latter looked impressive. Next time we would either return to Meridien or stay at Sofitel.,Date of stay: August 2005,,"Bedforshire, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour32048
Le Meridien N'Fis,Zara-Leeds wrote a review Jul 2005,10,Beware...An Awful Experience,Beware...An Awful Experience ruined my holiday in Marrakech I enjoy to travel around the world with my friends and do so every few months and are used to staying in 5 Star hotels. This is very far off from being classed as a 5 Star. Very dissapointing. We checked in and upon arriving to the the superior bedroom with the pool view found that the bedding was very old and worn out the room was so basic you would think it was a 3 Star at the very most. The bathroom has also seen better days. Throughout our stay the water from the taps came out a rusty brown colour. There were ants on the bathroom floor as well as in the bedroom which ended up infesting our suitcases. The room was not air conditioned but had a very old air cooler attached to the wall which was extremely noisy. The food was very bland and limited in the hotel. On our seond day our money was stolen from our bedroom when the chamber maid came to clean our room. Nothing was done about this by management when reported as the same chamber maid came to clean our room the next morning. This time two pairs of my french knickers and bra were stolen. No one even bothered to apologise on behalf of the hotel. The service in the bars and restaurants was extremely slow they are very rude and speak only in French. The pool is very small but looks good on the pictures as do the other pictures. But do not be fooled. The night before checking out we paid our room service bill in full with cash which amounted to about 2500 moroccan dirhams and when we were about to leave the management attacked us saying we have not paid. Anyway after a very heated argument they finally confirmed with their cashier that the bill had been paid in full. Please do not stay here if you are wanting a 5 Star hotel. This will ruin Marrakech for sure..... I would never stay in a Le Meridian again nor will I come back to Marrakech!,Date of stay: July 2005,,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zara-Leeds
Le Meridien N'Fis,Foxsin wrote a review Jun 2005,30,Not up to the Meridien standard,My wife and myself have just spent 8 days at the Meridien N'fis in Marrakech during May 2005. This is supposed to be a five star hotel but I would class the rooms as three star. If you are facing the main road you are kept awake by the transport on the road. We move to a room facing the gardens but you didn't need a alarm clock the pigeons were there for that. There was only one restaurant that was open in the evening but I must say it served good food. The pool and the public areas were 5 star and the staff were friendly but again the rooms were a let down they were big enough but are badly needing refurbished.,,,"Stirling, Scotland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foxsin
Le Meridien N'Fis,kimbaysun wrote a review Apr 2005,30,overpriced,Unfortunately we have stayed in Dubai and we tend to compare their 5 star hotels to every other hotel. This hotel was OK overpriced we supposedly got a good rate on their website about £110 a night without breakfast. Not a bargain in my estimation. The reception staff were not helpful and they made a boob on our booking it was sorted but no apologies. I must say the restaurant was excellent but we were disappointed with the rest. Would not stay here again.,Date of stay: April 2005,,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimbaysun
Le Meridien N'Fis,French wrote a review Mar 2005,20,Looks good but...,We stayed there in 2002. The hotel looks very nice. Marble everywhere good design excellent service.    Rooms are bright and large can be a bit noisy when you're located on the main road but the view on the Atlas mountains again is superb in the background when skies are clear.    Good restaurants and bars.    The weak point are the rooms. No sound insulation at all!  You can hear doors slamming all the time enjoy noises from upstairs downstairs and rooms next to you.    and they claim it is a 5 star property...,Date of stay: May 2002,,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/French
