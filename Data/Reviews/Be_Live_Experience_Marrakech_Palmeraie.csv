Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,bubblegirlxx wrote a review Mar 21,50,Amazing ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,This is the 2nd visit to Be Live Palmaraie our first visit was amazing and so was our second!!  We got to know the staff members and management and they remembered us on our return (3years later)    Salah (food and drink management) is just amazing one of the nicest friendliest people you can meet he goes above and beyond always on hand and smiling and very attentive to us and our 3year old son.    Smiley and the animation team!! Smiley you never fail to entertain you do an amazing job day and night never change!!    PR gent in reception is prompt the minute a question/query/complaint is raised he’s on it and resolving straight away outstanding service.    Housekeeping - rooms cleaned daily to a very high standard leaving throws an bathmats in various shapes - lovely touch. Some housekeepers are more happy to help then others we all go to work to earn money but working in hospitality you need to be hospitable not plain rude.    We had to move rooms due to maintenance issues which wasn’t really a bother but the housekeeping department never made things easy no beds were made and there was no linen and loo roll left and when asked was made to feel like we were being a burden or awkward.    Food and drinks amazing service impeccable!    Valentines night was incredible the hotel went above and beyond.    We’re happy to say we have rebooked for 2024 and hope to see the team again.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubblegirlxx

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,hannah_521 wrote a review Mar 20,30,Could be better!,Stayed here for a week from 10th March and feel hotel could be a lot better    Room cleaned spotless everyday  Nice pool area  Issue with shower head and light on arrival phoned reception but wasn’t fixed until the next day  rude reception staff member gave us no information or a leaflet given during our stay might be worth having a information boards around the hotel  check in took nearly a hour  Lack of sun beds around the pool some guest were lying on the grass as no sun beds available  Food was very cold or Luke warm during our stay but lots of variety to choose from and tasted nice but was cold  Although entertainment staff were polite the entertainment could be improved never stayed to watch a full show feel they could host entertainment outside  You have to pay a hotel tax on arrival something tui failed to inform you about and pay a deposit for towels and the room again was not informed    Overall I Feel the hotel would be even better if they made some improvements,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Bedworth uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannah_521

Very well organized free Shuttle to the City couple times a day. Food is Good and is there whenever you feel like it. Staff is very friendly. Always try to find you a bed at the Pool.  Bad Experience with native guests at the Pool.  Edited: the manager Anas did a Great Job After ‘the incident’ and took care of the matter in an explicit way.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,RosieT2503 wrote a review Mar 15,40,Overall a nice stay,We stayed for 8 nights and overall had a really good experience.    Our room was spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed and good views of the mountains.    The food was okay nothing special but there was a good variety each night. The snack bar had good lunch bits the pizzas were very good!    All the staff were very kind and helpful. Qualid in the entertainment team was great fun Zakaria on the front desk was extremely helpful with tips and tricks for exploring Marrakesh centre and Mohssine behind the bar was a good laugh and remembered our orders which added a nice personal touch!    We booked our excursions through the hotel which worked out well Younes was very helpful and was excited to hear all about our trips.    We arrived late in the evening and were a bit rushed checking in (potentially to ensure we made it down for dinner closing at 10pm). Unfortunately this meant we were not told about the shuttle service or the a la cart restaurant. Once we were aware of the shuttle we used it 3 times. It takes you to the centre of Marrakesh near the medina and souks. The drop off point was near a taxi rank as well so it was easy to navigate further.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosieT2503
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,gastroknome wrote a review Mar 13,40,A great base to explore Marraketch,We stayed for 10 days in March which was ample time to explore and have a few chill days at the hotel. Located 30mins from the Medina by shuttle bus it is a smallish new contemporary hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful and together with the food the highlight of our stay. The bartender Mohssine makes a great Margharitta and always had a quip and a smile. Our breakfast waiter Hassan couldn't do enough for us and helped with a couple of useful Moroccan words.  The pool was heated useful in March and Smiley and his team kept us entertained. Oulid was a great archery coach. The pool snack bar is a great place to have lunch . Fatima makes a good cup of English tea to go with the afternoon snacks and cakes.  The rooms are clean and comfortable we asked for a quiet room as the bar and reception were very noisy. There was no kettle and the toiletries were just soap and shampoo. The bed was very comfortable and the shower good. Plenty of hanging space but no drawers.,Date of stay: March 2023,,Hertfordshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gastroknome

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hayley B wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Wanted to love this hotel … but didn’t.,Have visited Morocco a couple of times over the years; once in a Road and again at an All Inclusive Resort.    Chose the Be Live Experience this time due to its lovely clean look traveller reviews and great price. Me hubby and our 13 and 11 year old daughters.    The Pros:    Yes the hotel is clean spacious and very trendy. The room is large the bathroom opulent and all the complimentary products felt very boujie. Plenty of sunbeds around the pool which is kept at a nice and warm temperature and for about £8 per towel you can hire big fluffy orange towels for use during your stay and your deposit will be returned at the end of your stay upon return of the towels.    The staff are wonderfully friendly and super helpful. You absolutely cannot fault the service here.    The Cons:    Our Room…  So we booked a Suite hoping we’d have ample space for a family of four and also to add a little luxury to our stay. Cue our ‘family room’ being placed DIRECTLY above the lobby bar. And the music is LOUD! You can sing along to every track in the comfort of your bathroom as you will hear every song.    The lobby bar runs til midnight so you will hear everything until at least then and probably for an hour or so after when hotel guests sit out by the pool area and carry on chatting and laughing into the small hours.    You will also hear music throughout the day from the pool DJ booth so if you are travelling with ping children these are definitely not the rooms for you. I do question placing anyone travelling with children directly above a bar?    Entertainment…  This is a very international hotel so you will get a mix of English French and Arabic and this reflects in the music and entertainment. There is only one restaurant a lobby bar that sits next to the restaurant lobby area with seating and one pool table (cues and table unfortunately not particularly well maintained). There is very little to keep teenagers entertained but that was never advertised so I can’t really complain. But even for adults the choice is lobby bar or nothing.    Not to say that the staff don’t go above and beyond to meet every need and request. Just that the options are limited.    Pool:  Lovely big pool. Nice and warm. Plenty of shallow space and seating if you don’t want a full on swim. However the children’s splash zone is freezing! Like ice water. Lovely in the sweltering summer months I’m sure but not for the faint-hearted when indulging in a winter break.    Food:  Um … there is no denying this hotel doesn’t try and for the price of our getaway compared to other hotels/destinations there really is little room for complaint but please note the dining options are very international. Not a huge amount of English dishes anva in the restaurant and a bit of a struggle with the kids. Luckily there was always a pasta dish on offer so we got by. However us adults enjoyed trying the local dishes on offer.    The pool bar did a great pizza and fries but the burger was like a rock. Things like ketchup aren’t readily available either so you do need to repeatedly ask.    Though the team put on a lovely mid/late afternoon affair with sandwiches and cakes which was a lovely touch x    So many lovely intentions but everything fell a tiny bit short. I think the noise in our room was just the biggest disappointment and should I ever return to Morocco it will not be at a Be Live Resort.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hertford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/240hayleyb

We were allocated a room (cleaned daily) within the specifications that we had requested (a ground floor room in a quiet area with a terrace).  The service throughout the complex was exemplary but we found that the following 'went the extra mile' with their friendliness and attention to us :-.....Mohssine (Lobby Bar)....Fatima Achrab ? (sorry for the misspelling) and Abdullah (Pool Bar)....and two Dining Room attendants who were only known to us as Mr. Smiley (Hassan ?) and Mr Attentive ( hopefully they will know that we refer to them).  The location was a little remote but not a problem for us and the free shuttlebus to the centre was very useful.

Staff were very friendly and keen to help. A large conference party came during our stay and the staff did really well to manage it.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Misha N wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Amazing ! 🤩 well rested,I'm posting my first review of our hotel stay because I feel there are conflicting opinions and because I was really concerned before we arrived. We came quite early because we had a morning trip yet we still had to wait for our room for nearly three hours after arriving and checking in. They were really kind and let us eat lunch in the main dining room which was wonderful.  We had a few drinks before checking into our room.    I was extremely satisfied with our accommodation when we arrived because it was clean and well-kept and they took a lot of time to make sure we understood everything.    They took great care to ensure that we understood the hotel hours and shuttle bus schedule to the centre of Marrakech which saved us a tonne of time and money. I was extremely impressed when we arrived at our room. It was clean and fresh.    Emma who was extremely lovely and the hotel PR helped us schedule an excursion as well! We reserved a dinner with an experience although the meal left a little to be desired. We also booked a camel and dirt bike ride in the desert.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Tarfat000 wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Great holiday,When I have read some reviews on Tripadvisor in the past I have wondered if it is the hotel staff writing it about themselves. I am a Brit who visited Morocco for the first time and I don’t usually write reviews but I wanted to write one about this hotel as the reviews are so mixed. We just returned from a week’s stay and had a great time.    Room - I recommend staying in the suites if you stay at this hotel. Our room was great spacious and very clean. Bathroom is large and lovely. Room 3104 has a fabulous view.    There are some comments about the food - but if you are fussy then order lunch and an early evening meal from the snack bar by the pool (I did this for my son). And then pop into the buffet later. Special mentions for both Abdllah and Fatima at the snack bar they were so friendly and attentive. I didn’t think the food was cold contrary to other reviews and enjoyed my breakfast and evening meal in the buffet restaurant. I usually ate lunch by the pool. At breakfast there are chefs cooking fresh pancakes eggs omelettes etc so I am not sure why others had cold food. We also booked the a la carte once and the tagine there was delicious. The food selection isn’t as large as other hotels we have stayed in in Turkey/USA but there was a lot of choice especially if you’re only staying for a week.    The animation team work so hard to make it a special experience. Abdel is an amazing entertainer full of charisma - he even sat and played Uno with us multiple times and made me laugh lots. Oualid is probably one of the happiest and most cheerful people I’ve ever met what great energy. Samira was fab with her yoga and aqua Zumba sessions also taking the time to sit with us and give us tips on what to see in Morocco. They work really hard and they make a fuss of the kids which I appreciated. We paid more for our Sensatori holiday in Turkey this July but the entertainment here and the animation team here are far better.    Sunbeds - we left at 9am today and the majority of the beds were free. Once we couldn’t find a bed (we went to the town in the morning and returned at around 2:30pm) but we asked the helpful chap who is responsible for the sunbeds and he helped us out right away and even remembered the spot that we were sitting in the day before and moved some beds to that same spot for us. The staff are really helpful so just ask if you have a problem - they will try to help you. The only downside are the flies they “bugged” me but that isn’t something that the hotel can help.    If you are a couple stay at the Collection hotel - I went there for a hammam and massage and it is more luxurious there in terms of the surroundings. That’s apparently a 5* hotel so it is more high-end from what little I saw. We don’t usually stay in 4* hotels but I would stay here again we had a lovely time. Thank you so much!,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tarfat000
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Caitlin wrote a review Nov 2022,30,IF YOU WANT A FAIR TRUE REVIEW READ THIS.,TRUE REVIEW.  Went to be live on 24/10/2022 for a week and it just enough we enjoyed our stay but I would return to Marrakesh but we could but wouldn't return or recommend this hotel unless you're after Basic.  Rooms cleaned daily. shower is fab. beds are comfy. there is a fridge and a safe. not provided with any drinks i.e. water tea coffee etc. have to get these yourself from the bar. very small complex in the middle of nowhere so you have to get taxis/shuttle bus if you’re wanting to go out.  staff are great will help wherever they can - free shuttle to the old city but need to book day before only allow limited people on. we payed for taxi most times we went as couldn't get on the bus. they did play football which put a smile on my partners face.  HIGHLY recommend booking your excursions via 'getyouguide' online as this is half the price then when you get to the hotel. we booked Quad biking hotel wanted 550dh each and we payed 460dh for 2 people online and it was AMAZING - private just me my partner and the instructor. he took us to several places and took amazing photos for no extra cost.  The only two things we can complain about is the food and entertainment. however these two things are very important for us when we book a holiday. so if you like good food and entertainment this hotel isn’t for you.    * Food was not good but we weren't expecting much seeing the reviews before we come. we are NOT fussy eaters but we still struggled. very repetitive and no flavour in simple dishes like soup etc. we lived on bread and chips. all food was cold so use the microwaves if you stay here. TAKE extra cash to eat out as the food outside of the hotel is really good! recommend - Comptoir Darna for meal out at night (new town) OR L'adresse (roof top restaurant above the markets in the old town.    * Entertainment - had an Amphitheatre which was one of the reasons we booked this hotel. however it wasn't used at all during out stay. the entertainment was underground in a conference room. i wouldn't be happy if i was with children. They are running round the pool area at night making their own entertainment. The daytime is better loads going on round the pool. had a DJ on one day pool games water polo etc. and aqua aerobics etc. however the night-time entertainment wasn't good. started at 21:45 we went on our first night and it was poor it was very quiet not many people was watching. When walking round everyone was sat outside beside the pool making their own Entertainment. we didn't attend the rest of the week either. annoyingly there wasn't any lights outside bar one red light that was turned off at 11:30 so you are sat in the dark outside have to use torch on phone if want to play cards etc. we were in bed early most nights as there were nothing to do which is the opposite of what we normally enjoy doing on our holiday. we could hear the entertainment from other hotels in the background we wish we stayed in the be live adults only.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caitlin123456788

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Zach North wrote a review Oct 2022,30,"Clean, great staff but a sun bed reservation nightmare.",We stayed here (family of 4 two girls 8 and 2.5) for a week in mid October 2022. The hotel itself was clean although could generally do with modernisation throughout. If you can’t be bothered to read it all here are the main highs and lows:    * Hotel is clean  * Food is average kids who are picky eaters will struggle  * Pools are unheated and a little small but great for kids  * Duplex room was fantastic (2 bathrooms one with shower and one with a bath)  * Night time entertainment can be loud ask for a room away from it  * Not enough sun beds unless your up at 6am to get the towels on to reserve or tip every morning  * Staff are friendly attentive and polite    Pool    There are two pools both are unheated which look bigger on the pictures. For avid swimmers it’s not really big enough - you can’t do significant lengths. However the pool does have multiple depths and my 2.5 year old could stand in about 50% of it. For families the kids pool includes some slides and water sprayers.    Sun-beds    Total nightmare.    There are simply not enough after 6am they are all ‘reserved’. There is the usual rule of no reservations allowed but it’s not in-forced by the staff. As usual if you tip the staff will reserve you a sun-bed.    This was undoubtably the worst experience of sun-beds I’ve had and overall just makes the mornings stressful. I ended up setting an alarm and getting up before I would on a normal working day!    Sun beds are also regularly reserved for entire days without even being occupied. Or they are reserved and people appear to use them after a morning out to the markets.    If you come here and want a good spot then don’t expect a lay in.    Food and drink    There are three places to eat: the buffet al la carte and pool snack bar.    The buffet is the one stop for breakfast lunch and tea. Other reviews rave about the food but it’s average at best and often cold. Breakfast was the best meal of the day. Lunch and dinner is just interchanged between days. If your kids are not adventurous they may spend the week eating pasta and chicken nuggets.    The pool snack bar serves breakfast from 10-12 and food from 12-18:00. The food here was better than the buffet. Pizza panini and burgers all cooked fresh. Order at the bar and they will bring it over.    The al la carte restaurant is only open on a Wednesday and Sunday. It was fully booked for both days so we missed out - get your reservation in as soon as you check in!    The drinks were what you would expect in an all inclusive. More alcohol than mixer - I did not complain.    Rooms    We stayed in room 1106 in a duplex. It was spacious clean but needed a little updating. It was a very good size for a family of 4 with a bedroom and bathroom upstairs as well as down. Added bonus: there was a bath for the 2 year old who hates showers.    We were near the road but heard no traffic noise. Ask for a room away from the entertainment locations as they go on with loud music until around 12pm.    Entertainment    Cant really comment on this one but others seemed to enjoy the aqua aerobics and ball games. We did not bother with any shows but there was one every night at 09:45 - a little late if you have younger children. There is also a kids club if your kids like that sort of thing.    Overall    This is a good hotel but needs updating and improvements in the buffet meal variety - especially for kids. Staff are attentive polite and speak very good English.    Would we come back? Probably not we tried Morocco as an alternative to Egypt. But the hotels and experience of Egypt outweighs this particular venue. Plus overall I just found the sun bed situation overly stressful,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Beverley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/z-north1986

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Roxana M wrote a review Oct 2022,10,"Loud music, loads of flies and diarrhoea as a bonus",Arrived here at before noon and were only given rooms at 3pm after a long journey here. You had to pay a deposit for the room and towels which you got back after you left.  If you are looking for a relaxing time this is not the hotel for you. From morning until Midnight music drowns out any conversation during the days and at night you just can’t get an early night in as the music is rattling your windows.  If I knew this beforehand I would have never payed the £2500+ to go there.  The food was repetitive and very few options but I guess is what you’d expect from an all inclusive. The snack bar was not really what I expected as it had times where you couldn’t get anything as both the restaurant and the bar were not serving. There was a few times where they had a snack table with donuts and pancakes but the amount of bees swarming around the food was ridiculous. You could not eat or drink anything outside by the pool without being bombarded by bees and flies. Inside the restaurant pretty much the same loads of flies everywhere. Half of my family got diarrhoea and vomiting as a bonus.  The rooms were large and overall good but not cleaned very well.  The pool looks huge but in reality is not that big the children’s water park was old and poorly maintained.  By the pool you could not get a sun-bed around as there were towels on them since early morning and no people.  I will not be returning nor will I recommend it to anyone.,Date of stay: August 2022,,"Taunton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ioanaroxanam797

Another big shout out to the photography guy abdel amazing photos and we had fun doing them too. The tall guy at the pool bar unfortunately didn’t get his name but he went above and beyond often helping us carry drinks or food over to our sunbeds.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,daviebarnes wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Amazing staff and hotel,Travelled with a 4 year old and the size of hotel is perfect everything was a 1 min walk to your room or kids club bar etc.    The food in the restaurant was brilliant lots of choices the snacks at the pool bar were amazing pizzas paninis chips etc always something to eat.    The main pool was absolutely perfect for our child had lots of different depths where she could stand and swim in. Also seating all the way round the pool for a quick refreshing dip. Always plenty of sun beds no matter what time of the you showed up.    Now onto the best part of the hotel the staff they work absolutely non stop always cleaning tidying and greeting you with a smile.    The animation team were always getting people involved in the games which made for a great atmosphere at the pool even if not taking part. Special mention to Samira Abdul and walid who my daughter took an absolute shine too always happy to sit and speak to you and dancing etc.    Other special mention to Fatima at the pool bar always smiling and keeping you topped up with refreshments. Abdhullah also at the pool bar is the hardest working person in Morocco he literally never stopped helping people the full time we were there. Hassan in the main restaurant also deserves recognition for the work he puts in lovely chatting to him as well.    Sarah the leader of the kids club is also a credit to the hotel again my daughter loved her especially her mini discos.     The hotel shuttle bus to Marrakech city is a must to see the city the bus was bang on time for the pick up time advertised marrakech itself was an amazing place to see no1 hassled us at all and was in some great looking buildings.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Katie S wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Not at all a 4 star like described,After a week at this hotel and deciding against our usual Riu Tikida down the road I’m sad to admit we will not be returning. I wanted to give an honest review so others considering booking can think twice when there are much better quality hotels for the same price literally down the road. Upon check in we were given not one single piece of information about the hotel meal times towels etc and were asked to pay £100 deposit which in 30 years of travelling I have never had to do apparently this was for damage. The next day we were unsure of any of the time restaurants were open etc and asked for information and told they had none and it was on the wall. They also then charged us a deposit for the towels which again was a huge shock for me never in a 4 star hotel has this been the case especially after paying £2000 already to stay here for a week. We quickly learnt that the food was cold on most occasions unless you got it when it was first put out fresh you had no chance of the food being warm and minimal choice which coming from me says a lot as I am not a fussy eater. The flies were on another level every where you went they were on you on the food all over the tables and the bar. The only positive I can say is the rooms were beautiful we upgraded and paid for duplex and if I hadn’t done this I would have requested to move hotels this was the savings grace of our holiday. Fatima and Abdullah were also two members of staff we would like to mention for being fantastic at all times. The children’s pool was dirty filthy in fact and the man who used a net to clean it did so after 10am which is no good when children want to play don’t understand why this couldn’t be done early in the morning. Kids club appeared to pay no attention to the children in their care so we did not bother with this either and again was one of the reasons we originally booked the hotel. Please really consider booking this hotel when you can get a much better service from just down the road for the same price if not less.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smudgersmiths
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Leah K wrote a review Oct 2022,30,"Great for adults, not amazing for kids",We’ve just returned back from our first family holiday to Marrakesh. As a place to visit it’s such a different culture but amazing to see it all. We’ve a 5 year old and 2 year old so October was perfect weather wise and length of flight all great. The hotel on arrival looked beautiful genuinely the decor is so fancy!! The reception assistant were polite and welcoming an issue with our key card for our room was quickly sorted. The room was beautiful honestly 5* room and massive. We only had a large bed and sofa that wasn’t a bed so not enough for four but requested a cot and after having dinner it was placed in our room without an issue. There was a slightly annoying buzzing noise not sure if it was from the whole building with the AC but moving our bed to the other side worked. The people go above and beyond to make sure you’re happy and nothing seems to be an issue. There is little to no entertainment at night. They try their best to have nights on but it’s in the lobby/bar area and genuinely if you don’t like football or drinking there’s nothing to do but go up to your room and play cards or go to bed. The food for kids is very slim FISH is massive. And beef/lamb different ways of cooking it. My partner and I did eat as we like different foods but occasionally we had ice cream for dinner as it was tough to find something. Kids lived of chips/cucumber and peppers. I felt bad for them at night as it was the same routine as it was just very boring and rubbish at night. I felt it misses the holiday entertainment and excitement I felt when going to Spain or Malta the fun entertainment shows or party areas. The snack bar is great but keep an eye on the times pizza/chips end. The music can be loud from the times the hut is open but it calms down. The kids pool is so cold and it was 35/38 and still cold but the main pool gets warm. Very little for the kids to do but play in the pool. There’s no park mini golf entertainment. We found out there was a kids club but it’s like it’s in a zoo enclosure. You’re nowhere near anything 20 mins away from the main square so if you like going out for a walk at night or nipping into town it’s not a place to stay. We went into town twice as we love shopping. We went on the free shuttle which was amazing return too! Please be careful when going to the shop or market and workout the exchange rate as they do try and take the piss alittle! Also they requested a 500 Moroccan dirham on arrival and 100 each for towels you get it back but just so you know to take the money. There’s a ATM in the reception but it costs to take out as normal. But all in all the hotel is absolutely beautiful for kids 100% not young kids it’s boring for them. Adventurous people it’s a hotel in the middle of nowhere. And non drinkers take your cards/uno as only thing you can do at night is that. We’ll hopefully try Marrakesh again but a hotel with a little more life to it for families.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahKinn42

It is the staff that really make this hotel. Everyone works so hard and are very friendly and can’t do enough for you. Abdul and Fatim Zahra at the pool bar in particular were really lovely and friendly. The rooms and other areas of the hotel are kept clean.  The only down side’s are the music can be very very loud. Whilst we were there people complained about it and it did seem to reduce for a couple of days then got louder again. Our first room was very close to where the speaker was but they happily moved us after the second night. Unfortunately the shower in the room they moved us to leaked and the maintenance man came a few times but wasn’t able to fix it. They did offer to move us again but the room they offered us was a double and they did then find a twin room but when I tried the shower it had the same problem so we opted to stay in the original room and asked them to bring us extra towels to mop up the leak.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Alex C wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Very good hotel with some great features,My partner and I arrived to Marrakesh early Tuesday morning and got a taxi to the hotel which cost around £15 for 30 mins ish. I would not recommend hiring a car unless you have been before as the roads are busy and a bit crazy. We arrived at the hotel around midday and the reception informed us our room would be ready in 15 mins which is well before the stated check in time.    When we got into the room we were extremely impressed by the room which was above our expectations.  Throughout the week the entertainment team were very good at keeping activities running smoothly without being too repetitive.    The drinks they were served were also good with a selection of cocktails soft drinks and a beer on tap all of which tasted good.    Food was the one thing I felt could be improved on as we felt it would be difficult to feed picky eaters too get a lunch and dinner consistently. There was however a afternoon snack bar they served chips pizzas nuggets etc. which I am sure I’d seen some kids have at dinner anyway. However there was plenty of selection if you wanted to try different foods or stick to pats like dishes.    Check out was a similar story to check in where the reception staff were more than accommodating taking our bags to a secure place. They also informed us we could use the showers at the gym after using the pool which helped us tidy up before leaving.    There was also a shuttle bus that ran every hour is from 9-12 and 3-7 ish which was shared with the other be live resort next door. The bus was busy at peak times so would be best to pre book a day in advance however a taxi would be around £10 one way into the centre of Marrakesh.    Finally the actual city of Marrakesh was very interesting and had various different activities Andrew things to see/do. The local markets were very entertaining to walk around and see as well as the main mosque. Main tip of the markets is to say no and block hand shakes with your arm. However this did not make either myself or me female partner feel unsafe or stared at.    Overall I would got back to Marrakesh as the weather was great and the hotel was very good too but we went for 5 days and we felt that was about the right time length to go.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling5502

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Dan190729 wrote a review Sep 2022,20,Stay here if you like flies on your food and diarrhoea,Arrived to arguing in reception and rooms not sorted for our party of 10. Not given any information on the hotel ie meal times towels etc. Given a room (2045) with a broken shower broken toilet blocked sink ineffective AC mosquitoes giant ants walking in from under the door and no drinking water (you have to fetch your own). Maid leaves patio door unlocked after cleaning daily which I found suspicious. Had one half decent meal in 4 days and the rest were very poor. Almost guaranteed diarrhoea after eating every meal. Lots of flies on all food and flies irritating you as you dine. The sweet afternoon poolside buffet was a daily mass of flies worse than a week old carcass. Poolside burger/pizza looked ok but taste and texture were shocking. Alcoholic drinks were all very poor so our party had to purchase from local supermarket to drink in the hotel. Unable to get a sun lounger at pool throughout the day every day even though most are empty with others towels on. The entertainment team do try hard and put on very good evening shows. Lots of managers walking around the restaurant looking at the flies on the food but doing nothing about it.  I wouldn’t be paid to stay here again unfortunately.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dan190729

When I arrived with my family I was not received with welcome..Mohammed was the guy who booked us in.and was very rude and unsupportive.    I had younger kids with me.where I booked 2 beds in one room he gave me duplex 2 room separate with my kids.i tried to explain that I will not sleep at night knowing my kids are not in the same room as Me.and I was upset by this cause he was not helpful at all.after having a long conversation still no luck.i than called the night team and got a 2 sofa bed made and one spring bed as they couldn't get a sofa bed in.around 1am the spring bed wheel came off.and my daughter feel and hurt her back I called reception Adel who received my call came to see and said sorry but I can't do anything till morning...    So my daughter sleept on floor with the mattress. No bed.Next morning northing was done .I than went to the guest relations    Lady call Imman who was very very helpful and I would like to thank her for her help and made our 4 nights much much better.    In the room there is no kettle incase you want to have tea coffee night time you have to go to the bar...which I felt not right at list have a kettle iron...    Also iron in a 4star only one iron.i had to call so many times to get one.it was very bad.    All in all I will say we loved the second room .its a lovely hotel part from what i mentioned. Lovely food part from breakfast .was rubbish but 2 other meals are very nice.    I would like to end this by saying please train some of your receptionist staff manners and not to be rude to the hotel guest as we are coming to your hotel for some relaxation and peace.    Not to get stress or upset and make us feel un happy.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Paul H wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Great place for a safe family holiday with friendly staff,The pictures don't do the place justice it's actually smaller when you get there but that's a good thing because the family can run around safe.  The hotel is quite away (30min drive) from any other attraction so everything is geared around the hotel  The animation team are simply superb friendly funny and eager to make it a holiday of a lifetime for guests. They're constantly on hand with events to keep you becoming sloth like on your sunbed.  The restaurant staff are lovely work really hard to keep the covers turning over on a busy restaurant.  Food is good but as a vegetarian the options were very same and sometimes salads looked veggie but had meat in them. The pastries are simply excellent and a delicious delight.  Reception staff are helpful and always have a smile. The shuttle bus to the Markets is great and runs regularly just make sure you book it the day before.  My one and only criticism is we ordered a taxi from Reception back to the Airport we didn't expect a luxury taxi and a 500dhm charge for a 20min journey even though it was 7am which was a shock at 7am especially as we had paid 300dhm from the airport to the hotel.  My final words ... Yallah Habbi (the song of the holiday).,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulhE5813YK
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Gems1988Gem wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Not a single negative - all positives,Honest review    Arrived at Marrakesh airport and the cases were quickly out and we was straight to find our driver as soon as we came out we seen a man holding our names on cards really lovely lovely man who drove us to our hotel.  The hotel is 30 mins from the airport and this went really quickly  On the way to the hotel we passed through the palace for the king and it was a wonderful history/geography lesson  Marrakesh is really really run down and I was quite shocked to be honest at the house and shops it really looked old and a whole different world.  We arrived at the hotel at about 12 midday and as soon as we stepped off the shuttle we were greeted by amazing staff and bellboys who really can’t do enough for you  The only thing I wasn’t happy about is we had to wait until 2pm for our rooms (we was lucky it’s normally 3pm) and the it was 43 degrees heat and we was all very tired. We got our wristbands and was able to go and have lunch etc but it’s stressful when the kids just wanted to play in the pool  My first opinion was it all seemed a bit manic and panic and the hotel was full of Arab families fully covered up and I instantly panicked thinking about all my tiny bikinis I had packed  However…. Every single person every single family were pleasant and respectful and everyone got on well. I was scared of offending someone in my skimpy bikini but actually nobody was offended.  Just a load of different cultures all sharing a pool and it was absolutely wonderful. Not once was I made to feel uncomfortable.  The majority of people here are French or Arab.  The TEAM!!!  Firstly I want to mention Fatima behind the pool bar wow she works hard and is always smiling and happy and honesty she is an asset to this hotel. One of the days she wad off on leave and we could feel the difference! Everyone commented and she was missed. She’s an absolute beautiful diamond of a woman!  ENTERTAINMENT TEAM - ALL AMAZING! Smiley and his boys especially Abdel and the tall guy (sorry I don’t get his name) and girls are incredible work so bloody hard literally don’t stop and I don’t think I ever seen one of them not smiling.  They play games all day making sure guests are happy and enjoying their stay. Playing with children.  Honestly we didn’t leave the hotel once and didn’t get bored once and we had 5 kids with us ageing from 14-6  The kids also went into kids club a few times which I must say is INCREDIBLE! They loved it! It’s clean and cool and so much to do.    Every day there was a class around the pool to learn to make something such we Morrocon tea Taggine all sorts - it’s a really great experience to get involved. There was making of us taking part all different cultures adding the the experience.  The rooms are beautiful and the hotel is spotless every day our rooms were cleaned and fresh towels and bedding. The maids were lovely and worked so hard.  I can’t find a single fault in this hotel! In my stay or in any part of the holiday.  Food - so there is one restaurant and you have buffet style breakfast dinner and tea and there is so much choice. I always get bored of the same food but not here. You can’t get bored. I would just ask they cater a little more for the English at meals it’s very Moroccan and French but still wonderful tbh.  The pool bar also has fries burgers pizza and salad all day long!  Then at 4 the pool bar brings out paninis and cakes and pastries fruit juices. You can’t be hungry at this hotel.  We didn’t go out but I know families who went on Jeep safari rides water park and in the town shopping and said it was great and didn’t feel worried once.  There’s a shop inside the hotel which is expensive he charged me £28 for 2 pairs of swimming goggles!  Take lilos etc with you he will blow them up for you but expensive to buy from him.  Entertainment at night - each night there is a theme mini disco at 9 and then the main event at 10. There’s a bar for drinks I think they should have both bars open at night to make it quicker to be served.  No negative though just recommendations.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Chaneesa C wrote a review Aug 2022,50,One of the best holidays,I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and it has truly been amazing! From the time we checked in to the check out we were truly looked after. Everyone has been so friendly and we will definitely be coming back again sooner rather than later.  The waiters in the restaurant work incredibly hard and they always have a smile on their face Bachir was always there to find us seats and he always went the extra mile to top up our drinks/coffee. He made time to have a little conversation with us before he went to help elsewhere. The food is what you would expect at an all inclusive resort but you definitely get what you paid for.  Fatima at the snack bar was also so amazing served drinks and food with a smile on her face especially with it being so busy all the time. By the time I left she created her own personal drink for me which went over and above her job and my expectations.  The entertainment team were also incredible big shout out to Walid Smiley Saad Abdel and deejay Zag who made our entire trip unforgettable!! They were so kind from the very beginning and made sure that we were involved in all of the activities they were doing. They work so hard from morning until night to make sure everyone is having a good time. The different shows they do in the evening are spectacular and very inclusive. They always showed up every day with a smile on their face!  Mahdi and Zakariya also made sure we were not left without a sun bed or an umbrella… truly amazing people!  We only had one room as it was only 2 of us that stayed but it was very spacious and the beds were very comfy! The cleaners come everyday to make sure the room is nice and clean.  We also met Emma who was their spa representative she made sure we were well looked after at the spa and our treatments (Hammam Hot stone and Californian massage) were soo relaxing and done really well.  Would definitely recommend this hotel to stay at you will not be disappointed at all!!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chaneesac
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Cheris W wrote a review Aug 2022,50,Amazing time,The animation was amazing they were very accommodating to the holiday makers the day time entertainment is so much fun especially the water games there is always something happening from making Moroccan specialty dishes by the pool right to archery. There is always something happening for all age groups. There are party themes happening around the pool. Mojito party was so fun. The evening entertainment is different but enticing if you feel you don’t want to join in on the evening entertainment there is a quite area for you to just wind down after a long day of relaxing in the sun the party will then come and join you with the club dance. Saad was very good and polite in getting us to join in on the activities happening around the pool. The good thing is you are not over forced to join in.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Michael C wrote a review Aug 2022,50,13/08/2022,Just back from a week holiday here with my wife and 12 year old. Abit apprehensive at first as small pool and didn’t seem enough sun beds for the amount of guests but soon get used to it.  The rooms were lovely and very spacious and although our balcony looked on to the road we were happy as it was quiet in the evenings away from everything. Always cleaned and plenty of towels replaced.  The food was excellent especially the variety of tagines and vegetables not always hot but just as any other all inclusive. Bachir in the resteraunt was so helpful always making sure our drinks were topped up and plates cleared.  Abdullah on the bar is a special guy. Always making sure we had drinks by the pool or food from the snack bar and nothing was too much trouble for him always helpful and asking how we are and if we need anything. He went out of his way and organised fixing my wife’s sunglasses little things like that make such a huge difference. He’s a star. As is Fatem Zahara who constantly seems busy but is always smiling.  The entertainment was fantastic always something different at night and plenty of fun activities during the day. Saad is such a loveable funny young man who made everyone feel welcome and happy.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Molly wrote a review Aug 2022,50,What a lovely holiday..,Not long got back from a week at be live experience very family friendly hotel.    Staff were amazing and so friendly bar staff got to know our order by the end of the holiday. In fact we found all Moroccans to be such kind people! Hotel and rooms clean!    Entertainment team really friendly and lots of activities to do throughout the day if that’s what you enjoy.  The fire show was absolutely amazing we thought they had got professionals in but this was actually the animation team!  We also enjoyed the Moroccan night entertainment.    We left the hotel a few times: once got the free shuttle to the medina. Another day we visited Jardin Majorelle YSL garden we booked the hotel driver and it cost 150 mdh each way. The cafe there was amazing!  On our last day my partner and son did a camel ride we booked with the hotel This cost 250 mdh for the both of them as they were on 1 camel together and included transport. The Guide was fab and made my little boy a camel decoration from a palm tree leaf with 1 hand!  We ate out on the last night at Azar which we would recommend food was beautiful!    Food at the hotel was a bit repetitive which is to be expected at an all inclusive I am veggie so the choice is a bit limited. However lots of nice tagines. Breakfast was probably the best meal.  We weren’t fans of the A la Carte restaurant no vegetarian choices for the mains so I had to go to the buffet fill my plate and return which kind of defeated the object.  We ate at the snack bar most lunchtimes as the pizzas were lovely. Although there needs to be a better system in place for serving food maybe giving out numbers or tickets so it was easier to find people. I think one time one of our pizzas was given to someone else and we had to ask lots times what had happened to it as the others had finished by the time the final was served.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Lisa D wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Wonderful Hotel but the staff really make it special,We stayed at the Be Live Marrakesh in August for 1 week. Family of 4 with 2 children aged 7 and 3. The hotel is very well maintained and the staff go above an beyond to keep all areas clean. Holidaymakers could do a better job of clearing up after themselves around the pool which would help keep flies and wasps at bay. The good on offer is very varied Altho it would have been great to see more variety in the dedicated kids area. The snack bar has a good offering to suit everyone tho.  The lobby bar and snack bar staff are wonderful and go above an beyond to ensure you’re well looked after. The animation team are the stand out here tho. Checking in on you throughout the day. Inviting all of us to join in with various activities and making a HUGE effort to speak English with us and the kids. They work so so hard and really do put on a great show.  The pools are great and with the various shallow areas and deep end provided something for all of us to enjoy.  The shuttle bus to Marrakesh was really great and very reliable. We opted for a morning trip with a lunchtime return. Was perfect for us and we know other families used the shuttle in the evenings and praised it.  We really recommend this hotel and thank everyone there for making our stay so memorable.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisad246
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Bhavs wrote a review Aug 2022,40,"Family hotel, family fun",We stayed at the Be love Marrakesh for a week it was a family holiday and this is a family hotel it was lovely and fun with activities throughout the day for everyone to join in. The staff are lovely and really friendly always smiling and happy or help. From the bar staff to the manager nothing is too much.    The hotel was clean and really well looked after and lots of staff around to clean and make sure everything is in place throughout the day.    The only thing that we found was that the breakfast was exactly the same everyday and the being vegan they seemed the make the same few dishes so staying there for a week it got a bit boring eating the same food everyday for lunch and dinner. They had lots of salad but most days salads made even had meat or eggs in there so as vegan we couldn’t eat it.everyday for all 3 Meals they had a lovely selection of bread and bread rolls and always had some sort of potato dish to eat.    They had a lovely selection of different meat dishes everyday and huge selection of salads too. So if you’re a meat eater you would love it there. The snack bar offered a good range of food like pizza panini. Burgers to enjoy as well. Again very few veg choices.  Saying that the staff wen tour of their way to try and make stuff off the menu for us when we asked.    The pool was clean and cooling in the hot weather and the kids enjoyed playing on the slides too.

From the moment we walked in the guest relations team were so welcoming and friendly. The hotel is spotless the cleaning team do a fab job.  The pool was definitely a highlight for the family with the splash park for the little ones. We stayed in a duplex room which was really spacious and comfy.  There is a free shuttle bus that takes you to the city and we used this easy to catch and pick up for our return and tickets available from reception.  The food was very good just maybe could have done with a few variations and maybe some themed evenings. The pool snack bar did lovely pizzas. Our waiter was brilliant with our children and Salah who oversees the restaurant is very particular and very proud of what he does and is not afraid to get stuck in at busy times.  The entertainment team all worked extremely hard and Samera who choreographed the shows was great. Mini disco was at 9pm every night sometimes a bit late as our children had got so tired but when they did join in had lots of fun.    Morocco is a beautiful country and this is a beautiful hotel.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Michelle wrote a review Jul 2022,30,Good but not without complant,I am not in the habit of giving bad reviews without giving places a chance to rectify what may have gone wrong.i have however complained and the hotel will not respond so I will write the review.    I'll start with the issues I had... The hotel advertises free shuttle trips to and from Marrakesh square when booked the night before. My family of two young teenage girls and boy plus myself and my husband booked this and on the day no shuttle came. We waited nearly an hour in the extreme heat with my girls and I being hassled by men in the square with one even becoming quite rude when we refused to sell our hand held fan to him. We asked a complete stranger to call the hotel and for 5 minutes a message replayed in different languages but no one answered. We had no other way of contacting a hotel and were now subject to the taxis in the square trying to charge us £40.00 to get back to the hotel. We eventually found a local stall seller who asked his friend who owned a private taxi and they charged us MAD 200.  This was a massive issue for me and due to the extreme heat I vomitted a lot on our return to the hotel. This was also a very large question of safety. As such my husband raised it with the desk showing the booking slip as proof. The man at the desk advised no one wrote it in the book which is why no shuttle came...this not being our error he advised it would be reviewed by a manager.    The next morning we were flatly told that nothing would be done.. We werent even apologised to and no manager bothered to show their face.    Considering my family and their safety I am hugely angry at what occurred especially at not being apologised to and when I wrote a complaint the hotel refused to acknowledge it. We returned on the 12th July and I complained on the day.... There has been no response.    On our departure date we were also rudely accused of taking a towel however when checked they were all there. We only had hand luggage so what use a towel would be to pay extra for the weight I have no idea. I feel that once we complained the desk staff then chose to be quite rude which was surprising considering our stay.    I would also say if you are booking excursions this place is not necessarily the cheapest. We found a local Riad where the staff were extremely helpful and did not charge over the odds for the trips. We also booked our airport transfer from there which was cheaper so definately shop around.    Now to the rest.    We booked this trip as a family short trip to celebrate one of my daughter's birthdays but unfortunately did not realise it was EID on her actual birthday.    Our reception to the hotel was absolutely fine  and the rooms plus hotel were lovely and clean. We were greeted by a member of staff who brought our luggage and showed us to the room.    The pool area was very busy most of the time and getting a lounger proved difficult however there were seats and tables by the side and the pool area was kept clean.    We asked about excursions on sunday 10th and were introduced to the man that dealt with these. He advised nothing was open due to EID celebrations and so we booked an event for the night before to celebrate. He did not seem very interested in providing us information.. In fact moving on to other people and i had to wait in line to pay him cash for the trip. Needless to say we didnt bother booking anything else via him.    There were some lovely people at the hotel that I must mention as they made my daughter's birthday memorable. The woman who sat on the desk opposite the check in desk who organised a cake for my daughter at no extra cost... This was an amazing surprise and the events team who presented it and sang to her in 3 different languages. Absolutely amazing and very memorable. Moursin and Aamr at the bar who were lovely and polite and made excellent cocktails. Muhammed in the hotel shop who was funny and very friendly. I may have this name wrong as I cant see it very well in the picture... Anas and also the events manager. I cannot fault the kindness and lovely natures of these people and it pains me to even have to complain about anything considering they were so lovely.    The rooms were cleant daily if required and the evening entertainment was great if you want to stay at the hotel rather than go out.    The location is not near the centre and can be costly if not using the free shuttle service. As mentioned however this is dubious and make sure you check they have written it in the book as no one will care about your safety if you get stuck.    Overall our stay was not a bad one however the safety of my family and the refusal of a manager to even speak to us or apologise for the error made me very angry and upset about the stay.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92kaylahg

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Kim wrote a review Jun 2022,40,Wonderful Holiday,We returned a couple of weeks ago from Be live Experience Marrakech. We all absolutely loved it. My twins aged 11 had an amazing time and absolutely blossomed in confidence.  I’m not sure where to start.  We arrived mid morning and couldn’t get into our room immediately but we had a drink at the bar and the girls had their swimming stuff in their hand luggage so they immediately made use of the pool. We found everyone so very helpful.  The bar staff at all times were so polite and friendly whether this be the pool bar during the day or the main hotel bar in the evening. We tried our best to learn and speak Arabic and this was met with enthusiasm and good humour.  The animation team are wonderful. The girls loved the darts aqua aerobics and pool  Games. We had fun in the evening watching the shows and getting involved in the karaoke playing pool etc. Smiley was wonderful with the girls as was Usama. Every member of the team friendly approachable and kind. A special member to the young lady Ferdous who worked with Abdullah on the photo stall. She played pool with the girls and really helped make their time spent in Marrakech a memorable one.  The girls had a photoshoot on the hotel grounds and loved it. We have some very precious memories to keep of our time there.  The room was fabulous with large walk in shower. Very smart and modern. We had a duplex room so the children slept downstairs on the sofa beds while we were upstairs with our own private bathroom. There were no complaints from our two about being uncomfortable on these sofa beds while the bed upstairs was large and very comfortable. The air conditioning both upstairs and downstairs was perfect.  I was slightly jealous of the wonderful large shower being downstairs.  There is a small farm on the site. It was quite smelly depending on which way the wind blew but we were far away enough for it not to remotely bother us and from what I could see; it was staff placed in rooms nearby.  The Peacocks are wonderful. Noisy but wonderful. We embraced the whole experience.  The bus to Marrakech is great. Air conditioned and great time keeping. We went to Marrakech twice. Once in the day and once in the evening.  The Patio restaurant is smart but the girls didn’t like the food there at all. We ended up getting them  Good from  The main restaurant which they brought back to eat with us. To be totally honest my children are and always have been very picky and boring eaters. This is not the fault of the hotel who were providing a beautiful authentic selection of meals. I was sure it was Spanish tapas (not sure where I got that idea from) but it was Moroccan meals. These were really beautifully presented but might not be to everyone’s taste. We enjoyed it as an experience of traditional food and it was a break from  The restaurant next door which can be quite samey if you are a picky/ boring not very diverse eater (I count myself in that group) was clean and there is always something you can eat. The salads are fabulous and there is a different theme every night. Japanese night was wonderful. There is a wide selection of dishes to suit all tastes and the deserts (especially the pastries/tarts) and gorgeous.  It was clean and the restaurant staff are very helpful.  Reception team are great. They helped us a great deal. They helped us to organise camel  Rides and when our bank card got stuck in the machine. We literally could not find anything at the hotel we were displease with. The only aspect we thought could be an issue was the loud music at night from the pool area where the entertainment is taking place. There is no escape. I can imagine this would annoy some people. We got the girls to bed and listened to the music out on the balcony.  We could not fault our stay at the Be live Experience. .,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimReviews2021
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Rachael H wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Lovely family friendly hotel,We visited in mid June out of season and the hotel was fairly quiet. Absolutely everyone from the moment you arrive is incredibly warm and friendly. The animation team go out of their way to make the kids smile and include them in kids activities as our kids are both under 5 the mini disco was their main event of the day and they loved it (though 9pm start is a bit late our kids made it most nights!) Our 4 year old was old enough to attend the kids club in the daytime which was run by Mouna my daughter lit up every time she saw her and was always counting down until the kids club was open! Mouna also danced at the kids disco and so she and my daughter had a really special relationship which mean my daughter had the best holiday ever and never wanted to leave! So many amazing staff to mention but we also wanted to mention Ayoub who worked at the pool bar so warm and friendly to our whole family and we always looked forward to chatting with him and he always made the kids laugh. Even the lovely lifeguards kicked a ball about with my 1 year old and greeted him warmly every day I could also see they always had their eye on him when he was pottering around the pool.    In terms of the hotel itself the family suite was so much bigger than I had imagined perfect for a family of 4! we also noticed how incredibly clean the hotel was at all times someone is cleaning and so it’s spotless! The restaurant has enough choices for us to eat and proximity to central Marrakesh perfect for popping in and seeing the sites. Our suite was above the evening entertainment which was tough when getting kids to bed but we just accepted that to have a hotel witg entertainment there would be noise. Overall we were really impressed and think the hotel was very good value for money.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelw656

The management just laughed in our face and denied nothing had happened. TUE reps were useless. When we got home TUE gave us a holiday voucher worth cost of holiday as taxi also didn’t come.

The hotel gardens and pools are lovely  we usually chose the one with the pool bar even though the water there is freezing it is much quieter than the other and only a short stroll to the other bigger pool for a swim.  As for the restaurant  we loved it the food choice is excellent we are foodies and always found everything good  their tagines are lovely wine is good desserts lovely breakfast really good.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hallie L wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Good stay,Me & my partner stayed here and it was actually pretty good for the most part it was very clean and well taken care of. We bought a package deal where we were picked up from the airport and dropped at the hotel. As soon as you arrive they obviously take a security deposit which is 500 dirhams and then you get your passports photocopied and fill out a little form.    We got the duplex with a view of the swimming pool and it was really nice. Well cleaned.  What I would say is I was not impressed with the little toiletries they gave us just shower gel and shampoo as opposed to the suites that got shaving cream a comb cotton buds shower cap etc. (I know this because we upgraded to a suite for a night) The towels weren’t the best either. They were quite old to me it’s clear that they have been washed and reused countless times.    The hotel though is very nice.    The entertainment team were lovely so shout out to them very welcoming and inclusive.  Food was decent too had all inclusive. It can get monotonous but that’s all inclusive for you.    There is a restaurant that you can book if you’re staying 4 or more nights and it is a must. Lovely service and nice food.    There is a shuttle and you can book via the reception it comes in Handy especially as the hotel is far from the city centre.    All in all it was a nice holiday.

Staff are friendly and helpful especially with a toddler. The pool area were good with lifeguard on duty.  The suite was a clean large room with a lovely balcony overlooking the pool. The downside to this was the disco around the pool which had very loud music on until midnight . Kept our little one awake  we were told bee could move rooms but this was only one night a week. The trouble was that that after 10pm only staff and older people were around about 6 in total.  The food here was good but not much choice or much variety.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Heather wrote a review Feb 2020,40,"3.5 - 4 star rating, for a 3.5 star hotel.",Think by Marrakesh standards the hotel is doing a good job. I wouldn’t call it a 4 star hotel but has potential.    1.) The rooms are a little rough. By that I mean “used” Good for the price. Fairly clean for the most part and you can tell that the staff cares and tries but perhaps don’t understand the standards. They do their best!    2.) Service at front desk is professional and caring. Maybe a little understaffed at times.    3.) kids club was great. Winter hours are not so very late though. Our 3 and 4 year old kids loved it and didn’t want to leave. Toddlers would be happy older kids had some gaming as well. A lot of activities and involved staff who did crafts with the kids. Trains doll house small play kitchen. A big space with indoor (toys) and outdoor play equipment that is only accessible from the club.    4.) The location as many have reviewed is a bit far from things. You couldn’t just go out and get a bite at a restaurant or shop. There isn’t anything nearby aside from a petrol station across the street.    If you truly want a nightlife this place isn’t for you.    We came with family and intention to relax which was fine for us with young children.    Things shut down in winter around 6pm and then dinner and a show. Perhaps after 10-10:30 it is completely quiet.    5.) children’s kiddie pool is great but not heated - which can be freezing 🥶 cold for kids when the sun isn’t out in late February was too cold. They could still use shallow (15cm - 80cm deep ) parts of the adult pool but at this age needed water wings and carefully watched. There is a life guard but he is super busy with the pool maintenance and organising. They could have some shared kids toys/watering cans/boats and floats for sharing instead of us bringing our own. Our daughter ended up playing with a plastic cup most of the time.    6.) Activities ! The staff is really happy and involved. They have water exercises dancing Arabic language learning tea ceremony demonstrations a fashion show a market each day that seems to be different henna tattoos...,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Breda, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hhheather1

I travelled to the Be Live Experience Palmarie Marrakesh from Manchester England with my two children (ages 11 &6) and from the minute we arrived we were greeted by happy smiling faces from the staff here. My first impressions were how modern and well equipped the rooms are I believe there has been a recent refit and it shows. Every day here has been a joy I can not emphasise enough how amazing the staff here have been from the kids animation team down to the bar tenders by the pool they’re always smiling and are constantly trying to help you have the best time while your here. I would like to particularly mention the lifeguard Khalid who took time out each day to give my six year old daughter swimming lessons and she can now swim confidently thank you.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,vicksg wrote a review Feb 2020,30,Wouldn’t come unless you have kids,I am going to be clear that my review is coloured by the fact I was supposed to be staying at the adults only BeLive Collection but due to a Lastminute.com mess up I found myself at a hotel which was the complete opposite. It was impossible to escape screaming kid noise. There’s only one pool area and even though we found some sun beds as far away from the pool as possible it was still very noisy. The dining room could be SO noisy and busy I couldn’t stand it at times.  The good points: we found the food to be lovely and varied. As long as you didn’t go too late in which case the food could be quite cold.  The rooms were nice modern and clean. The WiFi worked perfectly. The free shuttle to central Marrakech is a bonus. We enjoyed the activities like boules badminton ping pong.  The downsides: the drinks are terrible. The mixers taste very strange. The cocktails were truly awful. The pina colada tasted like a vaguely pineapple tinged milk. I stuck to beer and wine (only 1 choice) which at least they couldn’t mess up too badly.  We had a terrace facing the wall behind which is a busy road. The sun didn’t reach it all day until about 7pm when it was about to go down.

I had only planned to stay for two nights then move around to another hotel. I extended for two more nights then eventually stayed for 15 nights. Nisrine made my stay amazing. Her hospitality is impeccable. She made sure I was looked after my stay was comfortable always ensuring that I had what I needed nothing was to much. She went out of her way to show me around town and the sister hotel. To top it off she organized a special birthday surprise for me which touched my heart. She decorated my room with roses and just made everything perfect. Nisrine organized a cake with the chef the detail of making it as close to vegan as possible. Nisrine is so warm and friendly always smiling she is just amazing and made my stay all the more special. Nisrine such a beautiful genuine spirit who obviously loves her job and goes above and beyond definitely an asset to B Live. Nisrine is the reason why I ended up staying at the B Live experience hotel much longer than planned. Thank you to Mounia for accommodating me. Thank you to Molay for making my daily lemon and honey always with a smile. Thank you to Amine also so friendly and made great drinks. Thank you to Mohssin and team for making my delicious birthday cake. Thank you to the amazing chef (forgive me I don't have your name but you know who you are) who made my vegan lunch daily. Thank you to the housekeeping team for keeping my room spotless daily. The staff accommodated my every need. Thank you to the B Live team - I enjoyed every second here and can't wait to return. Important Point The only point I would like to make is that every single dish should be labeled. Customers need to know exactly what they are eating and whether dishes contain meat fish sea food milk cheese etc in case of allergies. I am a vegan I don't eat any form of animals - please label your dishes some dishes may look vegan as did the salad but contain seafood or cheese etc which I'm allergic to ( I did get caught a few times)      Improvements - Please label all food items clearly for all customers so we know what we are consuming - this is very very important. I am a vegan which means I don't eat any animals no milk no cheese no meat no fish no seafood. There were a few occasions where the salad looked like it is just salad but once I ate it  it had either fish sea food or cheese - this could have been very dangerous as I am allergic to seafood.  It can be very difficult when there is a language barrier whilst I ask the chefs ""what is in the dishes"" they do not understand - not all of your customers speak French please be mindful of this and accommodate non-French speakers.  When I come back I hope to see improvements in this department.",Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blackcreative40

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Mick+Hel wrote a review Feb 2020,20,I'd rather have stayed at home,In middle of nowhere the hotel is on the old side of Marrakech so it's grim kids rummaging through bin bags I kid u not. The hotel to be fair is nice clean well presented and modern. Reception asked for a deposit just popped it on credit card no problem. Went to our room 1016 major ant problem and the patio door would not lock. The hotel is 90% Moroccan visiting family and they are covered head to toe even by the pool. We were all inclusive the food and drink was dreadful it's in a big dining hall with birds inside it!!! Defecating all over the window frames...and never cleaned or moved outside they live in the dining hall........ Seriously!!!! The food is repetitive bone filled gristly toughover cooked meat. Salad and veg is bland and flavourless. Drinks are horrific coke is the cheap stuff u can only have a sip ofalthough it says pepsi above it. Beer tastes like the pipes haven't been cleaned in 20 years! Worst of all the staff in the dining hall are racist I was in the cue for omelettes cooked fresh for breakfast each morning and I order mine and wait...... A queue forms and the 'chef' served all the Moroccan people behind me before me. Disgraceful. This happened 10-11 times. It's made me not want to visit Morocco ever again.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Alison.A wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Relaxed stay,Have just returned from a 3 night break as a group of 10 friends (varying ages from 32 to 70). Got a great deal on this mini break which was recommended by one of our party who had visited last year. The hotel is lovely clean and well designed. The rooms were also very clean and spacious with the most comfortable beds ever. There were no tea/ coffee making facilities in the rooms but being a very short walk from the bar and restaurant this wasn't really an issue. The food was fresh and plentiful and with lots of choice as long as you're not expecting traditional English food. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. We got the courtesy bus into Marrakech on two days. When the bus arrived we were met by guides who were waiting for the bus. They insisted on taking us saying it was dangerous and there was no charge as they were paid for by the tourist board. We only got to go where they wanted to take us (where they would receive commission I presume). I would advise reading up on Marrakech scams to avoid this situation. The guide did get cross when we obviously didn't buy enough or tip him enough at the end.  But back to the hotel. It was great value and a peaceful clean safe place to have a relaxing break with friends.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alihalifax2

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Chloe P wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Highly Recommend,We are so glad we ended up booking this hotel. It was very last minute after Thomas Cook went under and our orginal holiday was cancelled but I think this was better then we could have hoped for!  We stayed here in mid October the weather was stunning - perfect for a bit of winter sun.    The hotel seemed to start a little later in the morning which was perfect for us - not one of those hotels that you feel rushed to get to breakfast and out to the pool as soon as possible! Very chilled vibes.    Entertainment is fantastic! The team work very hard to ensure everyone is having a great time - they do activities around the pool that everyone can join in with and they make an effort to speak to everyone. Evening entertainment is pretty good always had a disco at the end of the evening which was a highlight for us.    The food is a let down; we are fussy eaters but found that the food was extremely repetative and options were very limited. Also the flies around the pool bar were excessive - you expect some flies when food is about but something needs to be done about this as it made eating at the pool bar unpleasant.  We also found that the pool bar menu was up and down they seemed to make up the times they were serving and constantly changed what food you could order despite the menu.  Other guests we spoke to also thought the food let this otherwise lovely hotel down.    We were a bit worried about paying for the towels and safe due to other reviews but you can pay via card or cash (they recommend paying with GBP so that you're not refunded MAD before leaving - you can't take MAD out of Morocco). We paid via card and the money came straight back into my account after leaving nothing to worry about.    The pool area is lovely all staff were friendly and welcoming the rooms are ideal - showers are nice.    We would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a nice chilled holiday and Morocco is perfect for some sun in the colder UK months! Very happy we came here.

The standards in the hotel are spot on it’s a ‘happy’ hotel. The entertainment team really do care you are having a good holiday not just whilst they are on duty either. The restaurant staff can be slightly off-ish but then they are still friendly enough in their own way.    The food is very good having gone room only previously in Marrakesh the food is of a better standard than you pay for outside. The sweets are to die for...    The rooms are to a high standard and the beds are extremely comfy. Cleanliness is throughout the hotel.    The hotel is in the middle of nowhere but they provide a free bus to the madness of the Marina so the tranquility is welcome when you get back.

Elements of the hotel were good the bar and general staff were really friendly and the food was good.  The hotel is let down dramatically by front of house and general booking. The pricing changed from when we booked online they didn’t have details of any of discounts and then told us we had to pay an additional £600 despite them knowing our children’s ages at the time of booking. One of the perks of our booking was late checkout they didn’t honour this then charged an additional 500 MAD. It’s such a shame but the overall feeling at checkout is disappointing. The manager didn’t seem to care.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Dom T wrote a review Jan 2020,30,"Nice resort, but service is lacking.",First time at Be Live Palmeraie and this will also be my last. Let's start with the positive: great rooms (duplex is amazing although the next door stairs are very loud!) clean resort great gym kids' pool is good and overall it is a good facility. The negative: Check-in was laborious. I was required to provide my voucher ( bought through Expedia) which NEVER occurred before with similar bookings. This caused a delay because I could not find it. Checking out was as tedious as well. The poor front desk employee was overwhelmed with the rush of customers - no one to help him. Then we were asked to wait 10 mins so they check the room before reversing the security deposit - a first never happened to me before anywhere. The resort is all inclusive but when ordering beer at the restaurant we got it in a small wine glass - really? I had a broken toilet seat in the room and reported it the first day- no one came to fix it. Those are little things but their competition offering superior service I will go to them in the future.

Room had comfy beds and excellent maid service. Peacocks walking past the patio air con decent shower and toiletries provided.    Good pool including kids pool and splash park. At the end of Oct the water was warm enough to enjoy. The life guard taught one 8yr old girl in our party to swim. Amazing guy.    Breakfast had lots of options. A large variety of food by the pool so you could stay there for lunch. At dinner we never struggled to find anything from sushi to roast to tagine. A kids section had fish fingers chips plain pasta etc. We also booked a meal at the other restaurant which had a very nice set menu.    No queues at the bar and extremely helpful Bar and Waiter staff. Very generous with their measures and we had a good laugh with them all. They worked very hard.    Entertainment staff were brilliant friendly and hard working. Kids disco each night followed by a show of some sort. Games throughout the day darts aqua aerobics belly dancing tagine cooking demonstration etc    They couldn’t find the deposit for one of our party upon departure and told us to go to breakfast and then get it on the return. However our transfer arrived and in the rush forgot to go back to reception again. Despite phone calls where they said they would return the £50 numerous emails later we have heard nothing.

So then finally we checked into this hotel and honestly it was the best the staff were amazing ayoub sara and Smiley were just incredible. Room was nice too we had a pool view and food was great! Aubergine tagine was the best I’ve had.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Ryan Holt wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Enjoyable stay but not a four star resort,We have recently returned from the hotel having stayed here a week in November. The weather most days was warm from mid-day and was in low 20’s. Evenings and mornings can be cold so perhaps bring a hoodie or something to keep your warm.    Local tax is payable at the hotel on arrival this cost us approx £20. There is also a room deposit and towel deposit which came to £75 refundable on check-out.    - How were the staff at the hotel?  Upon check-in the staff were really pleasant and helpful. Took our luggage to the room and they all smile and say hello to you.    - How clean was Be Live Marrakech?  The grounds were very clean throughout the day there are staff collecting empty cups and rubbish. The rooms are cleaned each day too.    - How was the entertainment at Be Live Marrakech?  I’ve never found entertainment abroad to be of a high quality and this hotel certainly does not provide that. It’s your bog standard entertainment you would expect nothing special to be honest we didn’t enjoy this.    - How was the food at Be Live Marrakech?  The hotel provides a wide selection of food however you need to remember you are in a Muslim country. I’m not a fussy eater but found it very hard to find anything I liked or would eat. There is always various fish chicken beef and lamb dishes available and sometimes pasta and chips with a wide range of salad and breads etc but none of it appealed to me so most lunchtimes and evenings I found myself eating a cheese and tomato roll! Desserts were nice though. We don’t have children but for a family resort there is no food for children they have to eat the same as the adults! Another thing I was disappointed with was that birds were flying around inside of the food hall with some sitting on the bread and also wild cats inside found that very unhygienic! Also found some food to not always be fully cooked and cold. The best food is to be found at the pool snack bar where they cook fresh stone bake pizzas burgers etc. In the evenings there is no crisps or nuts available so if you fancy a little nibble then think again... you’ll have to go hungry until breakfast! There is an on-site shop in the main lobby but not open in the evenings.    The drinks are your standard all inclusive range of local branded spirits or you could pay extra for branded alcohol (Bombay Gordon’s Heineken etc). Coffee from the bars are fresh bean to cup but it’s not Costa Coffee or Starbucks I brought my own instant with me!    - How was your room at Be Live Marrakech?  Our first room we were allocated had a view of the outback and so we asked if we could change to a pool facing room and they were more than happy to accommodate our request . The rooms are of a modern look with some Moroccan theming but basic no tea or coffee making facilities or mini bar. Rooms have a safe fridge tv desk sofa and wardrobe. The beds are comfortable and had a really good night sleep. The bathrooms are spacious with nice walk in shower.    We did experience a water leak in the bathroom with water dripping from the light in the roof we called reception and they sent a maintenance man over straight away who seemed to fix the issue coming from the room above.    Overall the rooms are nice but lack small maintenance issues that could be fixed easily but haven’t been. Such as the wallpaper damaged near the bedside units from where it has hit the wall.    - Would you return to the hotel?  No. Although it is nicely designed we were bored in the evenings with nothing to do and didn’t enjoy the food (but that’s personal taste). One day it rained and we had nothing to do apart from sit in our room or in the hotel lobby. We stayed for 7 nights which was far too long in this hotel.    - Conclusion  This hotel is defiantly not a four star more like a three star plus. It may look nice on the photos but to stay here is a different experience. We enjoyed it for what we paid for it wouldn’t recommend it for families because of the food situation for children. Perhaps ideal for a short stay 4 nights or so? We stayed 7 nights and was a little bit too long.    We felt overall the hotel was more of a three star plus rather than four star compared to other hotels and resorts we have stayed at around the world.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanholtuk

On arrival we couldn’t check in till 3 so we wanted to get changed and sit by the pool which was fine. We were told to get changed in the gym I wanted to take a shower there so asked for a towel but no towels you need to go to reception. So went to reception to ask for pool towels.. we were told we needed to pay £20 for each towel as deposit!! £60 .. so I paid cash and then was told to get towels from hut but they will be closed till later in afternoon!!! I was very cross and said it was ridiculous when just paid for them .. the lady at reception with glasses was very unhelpful and rude .. the other guys were great all our stay. Lucky they were still open .. was also asked to pay £50 room deposit and room tax.. so be prepared with cash.  Mostly french and other foreign families staying here.  The buffet was very average and repetitive not great. The pool snack food was good ( don’t order anything chicken ) and service was friendly well done lads 👍🏻 We all got upset tummies so had other people we spoke too. However we did have a lovely meal in the hotel a la Carte restaurant but is closed Sunday and Tuesday. We would of happily paid extra to eat there. We opted for the duplex 2 storey bedrooms which was lovely very good idea for families. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to centre Marrakech which was very punctual and excellent.  On the whole most staff were friendly entertainment staff were really nice.  Wouldn’t have wanted to there a whole week short beak fine.  The pool water is freezing cold.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,BigTim7 wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Don’t go please read,This is a copy of the email sent to TUI complaints department of which I am still awaiting a response my self and my partner have just returned from our holiday in Marrakesh having stayed at the Be Live Collection Hotel I am writing to register our total and complete dissatisfaction with the hotel and services provided which started from our check in experience and throughout our stay.    Before we go any further I would like to point out that we have been to Marrakesh on 4 previous occasions staying at the Tikida Palmeriae 4 star hotel and are aware of the standards of food and service provided in these type of countries and as such we don’t expect the world these were also booked with TUI.    On our arrival we were asked to provide a £90 deposit for the towel cards and wrist bands something I’ve never been asked for and something I wouldn’t expect to pay from a 5 star adults only hotel I could perhaps understand if this was a stag or hen party in Magaluf after speaking to your TUI representative I was told that if we didn’t pay we wouldn’t be checked in and reluctantly paid the deposit at this point we were informed the money would be refunded at checkout upon return of the towel cards and wristbands I informed the receptionist that we hadn’t received any towel cards and this developed in to a heated discussion and he refused to give us any until he had reviewed the security video and were told to come back in the morning.    On our first evening we ate in the restaurant which is very small and chaotic and can only be likened to Euston station at rush hour with people bumping into each other and unable to access the food areas having selected our food from a minimal choice of empty trays we sat down only to find that the food was cold after barely eating any of it as did a lot of the other diners around us we left to enjoy a drink on the outside terrace having sat there for a considerable time I decided to get our own drinks from the bar only to be greeted by a long queue at a bar being serviced by 1 person who was quite clearly unable to manage the 80 people or so looking to be served they did have an outside waiter service (one man) but he was so be busy trying to collect glasses as they obviously didn’t have enough to go round he was unable to keep up.    The morning after I returned to reception to resolve the towel issue only to be abruptly told we had been given them it wasn’t until my partner challenged them again that they reluctantly gave the cards it made the whole experience very uncomfortable and made it quite clear that customer service is not a priority for this hotel as the week unfolded it became apparent that this hotel has a massive staff shortage is clearly under resourced and makes no attempt to hide it cost cutting exercises at the cost of customer service.    Around the pool areas the same theme is carried through with a lack of staff at the pool bar lack of glasses ash trays are given in the form of a paper cup with water in as they don’t have enough to go around and simple drinks like a vodka and coke are served in disgusting out worn cocktail glasses that should have been thrown away long ago please see the attached photograph this is certainly not a 5 star experience and probably not even a 3.    On our second evening we attempted to eat in the restaurant only to be greeted by the same chaos lack of food choice as it wasn’t being replenished and the same cold food at this point we were so deflated that we left without eating our only option at this point was to experience the same poor service in the bar area long queue’s poor waiter service and decided after an hour to retire to bed.    The breakfast and lunchtime service is no better with uncleared tables of uneaten food due to the lack of staff no cutlery and not even a simple teaspoon to stir your coffee which I had to ask for on a daily basis no choice of coffee available other than a standard pot surely these are simple basics that are provided in any hotel irrespective of its star status apparently though not at the Be Live Collection 5 star hotel.    On the Thursday we were so deflated with the whole experience and expressed our dissatisfaction with your representative and requested a transfer to another hotel or the option to return home he informed us that this wasn’t possible without communication with Luton and would take up to three days which would take us to the end of our stay and wouldn’t be worth the bother. He informed us that he’d received a number of similar complaints from other people and had taken the issue up with the manager I had asked to speak with to Manager on a number of times but was clearly unwilling to discuss the issues with us in person at this point he assured us that things would get better and to give them a few days nothing changed and nothing improved.    Having hardly eaten at this point we thought we would try the A La Carte Moroccan restaurant that evening whilst this was marginally better than the main restaurant we woke the morning after with food poisoning resulting in us both spending the whole day and night in the bed my partner was taken extremely poorly and was unable to eat and keep the food within him over the next three days due to suffering from extreme diarrhoea ultimately resulting in a 4lb weight loss. To make the whole experience even more frustrating we asked the house keeping for additional toilet paper only to find the day after they had removed the one extra left from the room.    I could go on and on about numerous other aspects of this hotel it is massively under staffed and under resourced and I’m I at a loss at to how to it is promoted as a five star hotel and is definitely not customer service focused I feel that the we have been miss sold and mislead on the holiday experience that you promote and advertise within your business it’s quite clear that there are issues with this hotel but it doesn’t appear that they are being addressed by your onsite representatives or your Company my expectation is for a full refund to the cost of the holiday as we certainly didn’t get what we purchased from the start to the finish I look forward to your response and would appreciate your acknowledgement of receipt of this complaint.    Please read the other reviews and you’ll find the standard response from the CRM team which is the same from a good or bad review copy and paste away Please save yourself the pain and look elsewhere buyer beware.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Preston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigTim7

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,NickyW1985 wrote a review Oct 2019,30,0ne week holiday to be live experience,Arrived quite late reception staff ok you will need your booking confirmation to show you have booked! Better in paper form otherwise your hunting round for a email.  No welcome drinks no offer to help us to the rooms.  Rooms 1028 1036 all on the ground floor easy flat pavements with ramps if your room is upstairs there’s a lift. Nice big bed very comfy  Lots of hanging space no draws.  Bathroom nice and big walk in shower. We found the bathroom was very smelly. Did report to both reception and the tui rep. Nothing was said or done about it.  The back sliding doors don’t lock correctly so you can open from the outside. Big safe easy to use.  Food- buffet restaurant same food most days never hot. You help yourself to drinks breakfast time juices coffee tea. There’s a microwave if you need it. No chips served while we stayed.  Pool bar/snack bar- nuggets burgers panini pizza chips. All ok at least it was hot.  Drinks are all ok all served in plastic cups plastic straws.  Entertainment staff- smiley hanna. Picue all made the most of what there got! Night shows very dated dance routine very hit and miss.  Karaoke night was the best night.  Pool good size pool cold. Was ok once in.  Nice kids splash pad with slides.  Kids club and gym at end of pool area.  Not the biggest hotel  Really nothing to do outside the hotel unless you go to the centre of Marrakech.  Overall a break from the cold of the uk.

We would congratulate the reception household catering and bar staff. Unfortunately the same could not be said of the animation team who seemed to equate noise volume with enjoyment. We appreciate that music enhances some activities but in a small hotel like this there was no refuge from incessant base beat of the dance music played from 10 am onwards. Even traditional after lunch siesta times were interrupted by ‘mojito’ parties. For this reason alone we will not be returning.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wrexham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RolKaz

The food and rooms were exceptional  They whole hotel was so friendly from the staff to the other people on holiday.    The staff are some of the best people I have ever seen on holiday they couldn’t do enough for you.  Little things like the bar staff putting a hole in the top of my daughters bottle of water so she didn’t spill it    The staff all took time out to see if your okay and to make you feel so welcome    The Entertaiment team wow all I can say is they made the holiday so so special there was always something to do if you didn’t want to do something they never made you.    Smiley you made my daughters holiday so special she will remember you for every.  Pitcho was so good at his job always made you welcome to  Hannah always spent time and made you feel welcome    Amazing holiday roll on next year to go back  Thank you be live and the staff 5* holiday,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanes230

First week was great - the room is nice and big very clean lovely bathroom. The food is good and plenty of choice. Loads of sunbeds. But since 3 days ago the animation team have forced the music on everyone until way past midnight. There are lots of young families here and we may as well be on the strip in Laganas as 3am. Fairly calm till 11pm and them boom the volume of the horrendous music gets cranked right up and you just gave to put your hands over your ears until it's run it's course past midnight. It seems the hotel are trying to keep a minority few entertained with no consideration at all for the majority of guests. Such a shame as that completely lets the hotel down. I'd love to return to marrakech again but would never stay in this hotel again or recommend it or the chain.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aval1975

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,The Truly Gadabouts wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Great value for money,Just returned from a week's stay at this hotel with my husband and 23 year old daughter. We had a double room plus sofa bed which was more than adequate. The room was really comfortable modern and extremely clean with a lovely spacious bathroom. We were on the ground floor and had patio doors opening onto a little terrace with table and chairs overlooking the pool.  The bed was so comfortable... I slept better than I do at home.  I thought the food was absolutely fine for an all-inclusive buffet. Plenty of variety and lovely fresh salads.  We weren't informed about the a la carte restaurant by staff at all... We only found out about it by reading reviews on TripAdvisor. We really enjoyed the food and our evening there.  The hotel drink menu was only okay and the bar staff not at all friendly or engaging with one particular member of staff at the inside bar (didn't get his name) who was very rude and ignorant often favouring serving French guests over the English. If the hotel management read this review please do something about it and not just send your standard response especially as it's been mentioned by lots of other reviewers... It's not acceptable; we are paying your staff members wages and if they don't like certain nationalities they should change careers.  The entertainment team were amazing. At first I thought the hotel was not our sort of place with the loud music and animation team asking people to participate but they weren't at all pushy and we soon got into the scene and really enjoyed the daily events. Not sure we'd feel the same if we'd have been there during school holidays but it was okay with the few very young babies and toddlers. The adults only sister hotel just across the way would be a better option then.  The pool area was a really pleasant and comfortable environment... Plenty of sunbeds and parasols and really clean although the tiles around the patio were dangerously slippery when wet.  The shuttle bus was brilliant... We used it most days and it was really reliable... My only gripe would be having to book a return trip when you're not always certain how your day/evening will pan out.  All in all we felt we had a great holiday for the price we paid booked through Fleetway Travel.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southend, Essex",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTrulyGadabouts
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Gemmabrittonuk wrote a review Oct 2019,10,WORST all inclusive I’ve ever been,Im absolutely baffled by these positive reviews! We checked out after 2 days the price they are charging is extortionate compared to the amazing RIU up the road which is by far a superior hotel. Please don’t book this hotel. Im a seasoned traveller I’m not a snob I’ve been to tons of all inclusives and I’ve never had to check out after 2 days.  The only good thing about the hotel was that the rooms were pretty nice but that was it!    Service - absolutely appalling. The staff are lazy and arrogant they all sit around and ignore you. Took forever to get a drink. When we checked out early she just snarled at me and I said do you want to know the reasons why? She just said nothing. I would have expected the manager to come and ask us but it was like they simply didnt care. Even when we arrived to check in we were just asked to pay for towels pay for tax then given our keys and told thanks off you go. Just left to lug cases round in the middle of the night.    Food - by far this was the worst thing about this hotel. Ive never seen such a small dining buffet area! It was cold pasta every single night it never changed. Tables were dirty full of flies and birds walking all over the bread. I refused to eat in there again after the first night. Even through the day the food choice is poor. This hotel should be much much cheaper and bed and breakfast only its not good enough to be a 4star all inclusive. I also got very very ill and had to go get anti biotics absolutely due to poor food hygiene    Entertainment - what entertainment?! 10 plastic chairs outside in the dark with no music its the most depressing place Ive ever been to    Room - as i said it was nice but we overlooked a petrol station the main road and the security hut which wasn’t great    I felt compelled to write this as honestly as I could there is nothing the manager could have done as this hotel is awful for the price. Ive asked On the beach for a partial refund so lets hope the hotel agrees.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,215ursulab wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Enjoying a city break,We have just returned from a short break from Be Live. It is in the middle of nowhere but there is a good shuttle bus into the city on a frequent basis. It is also possible to take a taxi.  Marrakesh is a fantastic city to visit plenty to see and do. As a woman it also feels very safe. We did take guided tour around the market and souks well worth doing.  The hotel itself is small but the staff are all very helpful and friendly. The room we stayed in was huge and kept very clean. The food was OK very samey not too much of a choice. The snack bar was great but loads of flies. The restaurant that you needed to book was alright but not that different to the buffet.  The poor points were that on arrival they take money off your card for the room and towels and it is apparently put it back in as you leave however Three weeks later I am still waiting for the money to be returned so be careful.  The entertainment team were very nice and on point however our room faced the pool and on at least two nights they had a loud disco with garage music playing until well gone midnight. Even with the windows closed our room was literally shaking and vibrating. We had a small boy who was woken up a couple of times. The reception told us they could look at moving us if it continued but that would be because we were holidaying at a quiet time.  I enjoyed the pool but there were many broken tiles and the children’s pool looked scummy around the sides.  On the whole we had a lovely time but there were niggles and for the price paid it needs a few tweaks to make it a fabulous.  Would I return I am not sure I would at least until niggles are sorted.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215ursulab

Hair dryer toiletries TV which has a English movie Chanel comfy bed and nice pillows!! This hotel is very nice we have a 2 year old and the staff are so friendly and so kind! The lifeguards were wonderful my daughter Poppy and she was invited to play in the pool and with the lifeguard and this gave me and my partner a bit of a break which was so nice! Now we are not party people but actually enjoyed the music which by the way is not always loud - there was a mojito party which was great fun they made ice lollies and got all the tables in the pool and served drinks! The entertainment team are not pushy at all they invite you but don’t hassle you and another thing the spa people are lovely too not constantly bothering you which makes a nice change! Photo guys are great about it’s about £3.50 a photo and no pressure to buy them! There are plenty of sun loungers and the lifeguards go out of there way to pull beds round and get you brollys ( could do with some new ones though as a bit tatty) the main swimming pool is amazing with lots of areas for laying around to top up the tan! Water guns are sold in the shop and make for great fun and again the lifeguards got involved with the kids in the pool and were fabulous!!!! The kids pool has lots of water slides which are all in working order and there are not loads of rules to spoil the fun so all can enjoy! The kids pool is in need of a bit of a clean though and I’m sure this will be done in the quieter months! The grass is very wet in areas so be mindful you don’t end up with muddy flip flops like I did ( they gotta keep the grass well watered though so not sure what can be done about this). All the waiters are just lovely going out of there way to get you everything you need and again so kind to us and our daughter! They are run off there feet making sure everyone has what they need! We met some people from Holland which were lovely and the French and morrcan guests were also very polite and made an effort to interact and say hello ( everyone was so nice in this hotel!!!) The food was good overall we found breakfast and the snack bar amazing but struggled at little in the evenings to find something we really liked and we are not fussy at all! ( could be that we went too late as we did not eat until About 9pm). The shuttle bus into the Medina is a great service and the bus driver made sure you knew where you were and reassured guests! reception was great very friendly and they exchange money there too! We paid deposit for the towels and let me tell you it’s worth every penny the towels are massive and good quality!!!

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Fiona P wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Below average,I have just returned this morning from visiting the Be Live hotel and it wasn’t the good experience that the name suggests. I am not someone to write bad reviews but I did come home disappointed about the hotel. Morocco on the other hand is fantastic. We spent a lot of time in Marrakesh and looked the madness there. We also booked a trip to visit the Atlas Mountains and it was incredible. Well worth doing (although book through TA as you’ll see much more and it’s a quarter of the price that Tui offer).    Pros:  • Duplex room was fantastic. Two bathrooms enough room for a family of four and cleaned well daily.  • The free shuttle bus running throughout the day. (Need to book the day before)  • The staff are great if you speak French  • The entertainment staff put in a lot of effort.  • The food is good it’s all fresh everyday and lots to choose from. Lots have said it’s bland but for a buffet catering for a lot of guests it was pretty good.    Cons:  • The staff ignore you if you speak English. (Another review suggests it’s if you are black but I would say it’s just the English speakers white or black)  • The place is nice enough not 4* at all more 2/3*  • There is a great amphitheatre but they don’t use it for anything. All evening entertainment is by the pool and the drag out a few chairs etc.  • The pool bar is massively understaffed and you’re very lucky to get your order after waiting what feels like forever.  • The smell of drains by the pool was rancid.    If you’re happy being by the pool all day in the same sunbeds and just moving to join in aqua aerobics and spending your evening by the same stretch of pool for the evening music then this is the hotel for you. You cannot walk anywhere. If you are more adventurous and want to explore more culture and not have the guilt of not getting your money from the all inclusive then this is not the place for you.    It’s not terrible but it’s certainly not the picture they paint.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionap12345
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Ladybug wrote a review Aug 2019,10,My worst hotel experience ever,Everything was wrong with this hotel - we were allocated the wrong room (less than what we booked) without any apologies whatsoever the AC was barely working the Fridge was like an oven and Wi-fi was very unstable.    The service was poor generally - Once you can’t speak French or Arabic they treat you as a second class citizen and this gets worse when you’re black they expect you to take whatever they give you almost like they are doing you a favour.    There’s a lot of food at the buffet but this gets boring after a couple of days.    The attendance at the snack bar is very poor - takes forever to be attended to and as a black person they deliberately put your order aside to attend to others. Then after several reminders you might get what your ordered or something different and on one day they eventually served us left overs!!!    Some of the waiters were so rude especially the tallest one by the snack bar. The waiter in the picture actually tossed his docket for me to write my order on one day. Maybe it was a burden to him and he couldn’t take an order from me. The food still took forever and again he tried to give me something else but I took a picture of what I wrote (the advantage of writing my order myself....) and showed him the picture.....I eventually got my order after waiting for an extended period.    There’s a fine dining service which you have to book and I must say was quite nice. However they ruined everything with their horrible service. We ordered beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes......Guess what they served us.....Beef tenderloin with French fries (chips) not because we requested for fries......I’m still trying to understand the thought process that went into HASSAN (our waiter that evening) changing our side for the main course unilaterally while they served others mashed potatoes. Maybe like the snack bar it’s a burden serving black people and they couldn’t be bothered to prepare mashed potatoes. It was probably easier for them to get French fries from their buffet service. (Coincidentally HASSAN was the same one that served left over cheese burgers at the snack bar)    Anyway when we asked why we weren’t served mashed potatoes and the response was that they can bring it if we still want it....at this point we told them not to bother........,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247travelladybug

Hair dryer toiletries TV which has a English movie Chanel comfy bed and nice pillows!! This hotel is very nice we have a 2 year old and the staff are so friendly and so kind! The lifeguards were wonderful my daughter Poppy and she was invited to play in the pool and with the lifeguard and this gave me and my partner a bit of a break which was so nice! Now we are not party people but actually enjoyed the music which by the way is not always loud - there was a mojito party which was great fun they made ice lollies and got all the tables in the pool and served drinks! The entertainment team are not pushy at all they invite you but don’t hassle you and another thing the spa people are lovely too not constantly bothering you which makes a nice change! Photo guys are great about it’s about £3.50 a photo and no pressure to buy them! There are plenty of sun loungers and the lifeguards go out of there way to pull beds round and get you brollys ( could do with some new ones though as a bit tatty) the main swimming pool is amazing with lots of areas for laying around to top up the tan! Water guns are sold in the shop and make for great fun and again the lifeguards got involved with the kids in the pool and were fabulous!!!! The kids pool has lots of water slides which are all in working order and there are not loads of rules to spoil the fun so all can enjoy! The kids pool is in need of a bit of a clean though and I’m sure this will be done in the quieter months! The grass is very wet in areas so be mindful you don’t end up with muddy flip flops like I did ( they gotta keep the grass well watered though so not sure what can be done about this). All the waiters are just lovely going out of there way to get you everything you need and again so kind to us and our daughter! They are run off there feet making sure everyone has what they need! We met some people from Holland which were lovely and the French and morrcan guests were also very polite and made an effort to interact and say hello ( everyone was so nice in this hotel!!!) The food was good overall we found breakfast and the snack bar amazing but struggled at little in the evenings to find something we really liked and we are not fussy at all! ( could be that we went too late as we did not eat until About 9pm). The shuttle bus into the Medina is a great service and the bus driver made sure you knew where you were and reassured guests! reception was great very friendly and they exchange money there too! We paid deposit for the towels and let me tell you it’s worth every penny the towels are massive and good quality!!! I don’t really have anything negative to say this hotel it is friendly clean and offers a great service we will be coming back!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirandscott
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,nooniey2203 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Amazing hotel,A friend and I went for a week and it was the best holiday we've had. The staff were friendly and so helpful. It is in the middle of no where and only a garage across the road but the hotel has so much to offer and for people to do it didnt matter. The pool/entertainment staff were friendly and always spoke to you. The food was always hot and was cooked and refilled as you watched. The rooms were lovely we did book a twin room and got a double bed and a sofa but it was fine. Theres always bottles of water as you walk around. Lovely place to stay,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nooniey2203
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,JonEd1 wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Excellent place - loved our holiday,What an amazing base for exploring Marrakesh. The staff were wonderful and made us all very welcome. We will be back in February. We stayed in a Duplex room which was perfect and kept very clean. The choice of food in the restaurant had something for everyone.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonEd1
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Fiona P wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Below average,I have just returned this morning from visiting the Be Live hotel and it wasn’t the good experience that the name suggests. I am not someone to write bad reviews but I did come home disappointed about the hotel. Morocco on the other hand is fantastic. We spent a lot of time in Marrakesh and looked the madness there. We also booked a trip to visit the Atlas Mountains and it was incredible. Well worth doing (although book through TA as you’ll see much more and it’s a quarter of the price that Tui offer).    Pros:  • Duplex room was fantastic. Two bathrooms enough room for a family of four and cleaned well daily.  • The free shuttle bus running throughout the day. (Need to book the day before)  • The staff are great if you speak French  • The entertainment staff put in a lot of effort.  • The food is good it’s all fresh everyday and lots to choose from. Lots have said it’s bland but for a buffet catering for a lot of guests it was pretty good.    Cons:  • The staff ignore you if you speak English. (Another review suggests it’s if you are black but I would say it’s just the English speakers white or black)  • The place is nice enough not 4* at all more 2/3*  • There is a great amphitheatre but they don’t use it for anything. All evening entertainment is by the pool and the drag out a few chairs etc.  • The pool bar is massively understaffed and you’re very lucky to get your order after waiting what feels like forever.  • The smell of drains by the pool was rancid.    If you’re happy being by the pool all day in the same sunbeds and just moving to join in aqua aerobics and spending your evening by the same stretch of pool for the evening music then this is the hotel for you. You cannot walk anywhere. If you are more adventurous and want to explore more culture and not have the guilt of not getting your money from the all inclusive then this is not the place for you.    It’s not terrible but it’s certainly not the picture they paint.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionap12345
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Ladybug wrote a review Aug 2019,10,My worst hotel experience ever,Everything was wrong with this hotel - we were allocated the wrong room (less than what we booked) without any apologies whatsoever the AC was barely working the Fridge was like an oven and Wi-fi was very unstable.    The service was poor generally - Once you can’t speak French or Arabic they treat you as a second class citizen and this gets worse when you’re black they expect you to take whatever they give you almost like they are doing you a favour.    There’s a lot of food at the buffet but this gets boring after a couple of days.    The attendance at the snack bar is very poor - takes forever to be attended to and as a black person they deliberately put your order aside to attend to others. Then after several reminders you might get what your ordered or something different and on one day they eventually served us left overs!!!    Some of the waiters were so rude especially the tallest one by the snack bar. The waiter in the picture actually tossed his docket for me to write my order on one day. Maybe it was a burden to him and he couldn’t take an order from me. The food still took forever and again he tried to give me something else but I took a picture of what I wrote (the advantage of writing my order myself....) and showed him the picture.....I eventually got my order after waiting for an extended period.    There’s a fine dining service which you have to book and I must say was quite nice. However they ruined everything with their horrible service. We ordered beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes......Guess what they served us.....Beef tenderloin with French fries (chips) not because we requested for fries......I’m still trying to understand the thought process that went into HASSAN (our waiter that evening) changing our side for the main course unilaterally while they served others mashed potatoes. Maybe like the snack bar it’s a burden serving black people and they couldn’t be bothered to prepare mashed potatoes. It was probably easier for them to get French fries from their buffet service. (Coincidentally HASSAN was the same one that served left over cheese burgers at the snack bar)    Anyway when we asked why we weren’t served mashed potatoes and the response was that they can bring it if we still want it....at this point we told them not to bother........,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/247travelladybug

Always helpful and attentive. An asset to the hotel. ⭐️⭐️⭐️  Restaurant - variety is good for adults. I would recommend children eat at 5/530 at snack bar- nuggets pizza panini’s burgers fries and fruit. Then Ice cream amd fab deserts while adults eat their evening meal.  👍👍👍  9pm children entertainment -  The entertainment group are really good with the children. Big thumbs up and thanks to them.  🎵🎵🎵  BaySpa : Be live Collection hotel.  A well deserved girlie trip to the spa for Hammam & massage. 600 Dirham each (£48)  Heaven. Worth every penny.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Becka1310 wrote a review May 2019,30,May half term,We visited this hotel during May half term. We were very happy with the weather and the overall cleanliness of the hotel.  The entertainment team work very hard and there are always activities to do. It is however evident that most of the staff favour French guests over English.  You are able to exchange money at reception and all reception staff are friendly.  The shuttle bus running to and from Marrakech regularly is great and always on time!  We found that the food was rather limited and absolutely not suited to fussy eaters as basic food such as chips was not available during evening meals. If you are ok with trying new things that are very different to English food then you will be fine.  Drinks at all bars are very good made as strong or as weak as you like.  You do have to pay to keep your room on if checking out late at the end of your stay however you can shower in the gym rather than paying £50 to keep your room for a few hours.  We have had a good half term break away and would definitely visit Marrakech again but unfortunately not this hotel as we feel it is a bit out of the way and did not overly enjoy the food.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Staffordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becka1310
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Charley K wrote a review May 2019,40,Great Family Holiday,We have got back today after a week stay here. Myself partner and 4 kids.  The hotel is lovely and modern. The swimming pool is fab shallow and deep. Plus a kids activity pool with slides. Lots of activities in the day. Smilie Fazar and Nawel are so lovely and friendly. all of the entertainment team are so genuine and fun and my kids loved them! The chefs and most of the restaurant staff are really polite and always smile. However the bar staff (around the pool mainly) there was about 3/4 of them that were DISGUSTING. They were so rude to people. To the point I felt so intimidated to ask for a drink sometimes. The tall skinny one going slightly bald was very arrogant and rude. The funniest part was when the managers where around they completely changed. The blue eyed young boy was fun and nice. I’d suggest to tip them at the beginning if you don’t want to feel on edge to ask for a drink.  Anyway onto more positive things.... We had a nice connecting room. Great showers fresh towels every day and your room cleaned to a high standard. The beds are so comfy and the air con is very good. It could do with more room to store your clothes. And unfortunately the drains did smell in our room. But we loved it so much and had unpacked we couldn’t be bothered to be moved. They have a safe and fridge. And you can help your self to bottled water large or small which you can put in your fridge.  The food was very good quality for an all inclusive. And not your boring chicken nuggets etc. It’s real food. The fruit was so fresh a tasty. Nice coffee. Great red wine. And around the pool in the day they serve the best pizzas. And more chips burgers etc. Which is great sitting by the pool eating it.  People have moaned on previous reviews about to many kids and the noise. But to be honest there is a mini water park with large frog slides and dolphin water fountains. It’s not really going to be used by adults is it!!  The music is played throughout the day when the “hut” is open. You still have times where they turn it off for chill time. The “hut” is full of games Uno Scrabble Cards connect 4. You name it. You just borrow them and take them back. Which I though was so good. And again smily and the other jumbo team come and play with you.  It was full of French and obviously French is their second language so you can feel left out a little expecting with the French music which gets annoying. They do try and play English/ American or more “well known” music. But then went back to French stuff. Again they do speak in English and say it after French.  You have to pay deposit for hotel room when you get there and pay a deposit per pool Towel so make sure you have that.  We will definitely be coming back. We miss you all already. Thank you for such a lovely holiday. Just please have a word with the scary bar staff (Not all of them ) mainly the older ones xxxx  Xxxx,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87charleyk
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Chloe T wrote a review May 2019,30,Ok hotel at best,We booked this hotel just as a cheap all inclusive in somewhere a bit different other than the typical Spain or Greece as we like to mix it up and see new places the weather here is amazing too if you like it hot when you go away. I didn't have high expectations of this hotel due to the price and I was prepared for it to be pretty basic (top tip - don't go here expecting it to be a 4 star). However I feel this hotel has all the ingredients to make it a really lovely hotel but it just doesn't seem to cut it. The food is mostly tasteless and lacks variety I think its aimed at the French and maybe not to a UK palette? The dessert was the best bit and I found myself having a tiny main and filling up on cakes. We were starving most nights as food stops at 9 I think? But we always eat at around 7. I know this is normal because when we've been to hotels like this there is usually a shop nearby to grab some crisps or something to snack on but there is absolutely nothing the shop closes as soon as you would finish eating in the buffet and also in the middle of the day for hours and I don't want to plan my day around going to a tiny shop and paying an extortionate amount for crisps so I'm not starving. When we arrived late from our flight at around 12am all they could offer us was a bottle of water even the bar was shut. It's usually standard to offer a crappy sandwich at least! To be honest our main issue was the food and the entertainment the staff try their hardest and it's nothing personal but watching 3 people do the same dance routine you learn in school for a play every night is boring. Whether they're dancing to ABBA or Shakira it's the same routine. They have quizzes some nights but its all in French I wasn't that bothered because I understand it was mainly French guests but it would have been nice to know this before I booked. Overall a pretty boring holiday and spent a lot of it hungry or eating bland food. I would recommend looking for another hotel unless you really don't care about the night entertainment or like boring or unusual food you can't even get basic plain food every night like chips or nuggets so maybe don't take picky kids. I would have killed for a chicken nugget on this holiday and that's saying something for me I love to try new foods just not when they taste of nothing.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73chloem
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,SG2103 wrote a review May 2019,20,Don’t book if you don’t want to waste your money.,Probably the worst holiday I’ve been on let me explain why.    I’ll start semi positive the young boy at reception with glasses was the friendliest person/employee that works here I didn’t take his name but I felt comfortable talking to him. However hotel lacks a welcome you’re given a list and expected to know everything. Room was okay can’t fault it too much other than dirt up the wall and the few ants...    Food is repetitive State they do cuisines every night (tells you on the day just outside the door) yet it’s the EXACT same food as every night just chopped differently.. now we didn’t bring children but stayed there is ‘enfant cuisine’ no food was EVER put there except on a morning which was dried fruit.. not child friendly I’ve spent every night absolutely starving and disappointed in the choice of foods available do not pay attention to the other reviews saying ‘amazing selection’ blah blah it’s really not it’s repetative only nice thing I ate was chicken nuggets.. which were only served once in the buffet. Spaghetti/pasta bolagnaise is served EVERY lunch and EVERY dinner time it’s tasteless and disappointing! I could go on and on about the buffet food it’s just appalling. Also a couple of times white meat looked pink so be cautious!! (Eat at the snack bar you’re probably thinking.. well it shuts at 4)    The snack bar/bar by the pool sells snacks and we found the bar staff extremely intimidating and didn’t act as if they were interested in helping us at all like it was a bother to serve us you have to ask for the menu when I asked he stared blankly at me and handed it to me we asked for and these are my partners exact words ‘2 toast 2 eggs for 2 people’ yet only one plate was served so we shared. Second day the buffet again was awful so we opted for the snack menu margarita pizza for me and CHICKEN burger for my partner except it wasn’t chicken it was beef.. to reluctant to say anything so he ate it. I actually absolutely hated ordering drinks and during the day this is the only place you can get drinks (after 12 you can go inside but you can only drink them inside which isn’t fantastic if you’re sat by the pool) I had to convince my partner to get me a drink every time I felt thirsty as it made me so uneasy to ask.. in the end we tried to hold off asking until we were desperate. There was also TWO separate occasions where I asked for ‘non alcoholic Marrakech’ and was served ALCOHOL I am currently pregnant and can not drink alcohol.. massively disappointed so I suggest you watch what they’re making VERY carefully if you do not drink alcohol for religious/medical/pregnancy reasons.    We didn’t go to any of the entertainment nights primarily because we felt so unwelcomed French are definitely favoured here.. you only have to sit at the pool for a few hours to notice that there is also a dress code that we weren’t aware of and didn’t have clothes to suit.    The shop sells a bit of everything however isn’t open for that long shuts early.

Everything about this hotel is fantastic the rooms spacious they are cleaned every day. The pool area is huge and there is also a mini one for small children. The food was fantastic and such a wide variety. I only have one tiny critique which is in the exclusive hotel which you have 2 book is that with the main meal there should be ""extras"" such as rice cous cous vegetables. Lastly we also went 2 celebrate my sisters birthday and we were able to get a cake via the hotel and it was brilliant. Im definitely coming back again.

My wife booked us a stay in the hotel which was a blessing we arrived early to the hotel and Mohammad and Lammya from the reception desk took a good care of us xx Mohammed was really acknowledged with the city history he taught us a lot.  We had been given a room facing the pool and an early check in which made our holiday a blessing.  The room is very clean and I admired the comfortable pillows can anyone tell me where I can find them!  The food is really good there was no long queues which I loved the most.  The pool is nice but if there was a covered one that would be even great.  The staff are all nice we have been served very well at restaurant a special thanks to Yassine who always smiles.  And to the guys at the snack bar who were very up to task.  The animation at night stays late the thing that bothers our early sleeping.  A special thanks to the lady who always takes care of the room.  The excursion guy Yousaf booked us one day travel to Essawira and it was just amazing.  All in all the hotel is nice and all the staff are lovely.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,mkirb wrote a review Apr 2019,20,Disappointed - Not for guests without children,Just returned from a break at the be- live experience. An experience it was we are a couple without children although we have adult children and grandchildren and are not child averse. However this hotel is completely child orientated with no space or facilities for adults without children. We arrived at lunchtime and found our room to be dirty this was resolved but we had no towels until 6pm. We realised very quickly the hotel was not for us. It is small and the noise of so many children in a small place is stressful. There is no escape inside or outside as the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. There is the shuttle into Marrakesh and we went twice mainly to get away from the hotel.  We asked to be moved to the adults only hotel nearby but it was fully booked.  We made friends with another small group of adults without children who also shared our views. The dining room was hell and reminded me of a butlins holiday camp although I have to be fair and say the staff were great.  We saw the rep twice once of arrival and the day of departure although she left messages the day before departure for us to contact her we saw little point as wee were leaving and calling her would cost £1 a minute.  The week was stressful and we could not wait to leave as could the other gusts in the same situation.  We visited the adults only hotel just down the road to use the spa and it was lovely an oasis away form the constant high volume of noise.  On a positive note the hotel is perfect for families. The food and wine are good and the staff were great. The trips are worth doing too.  It should be made clear the hotel is small and very family orientated to enable people to make informed decisions.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Beverley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkirb
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Rox wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Be prepared to beg for the basics in room on a daily basis,I am on day four of my holiday on the day of arrival 9pm we were told no food or snacks service after 9:30 pm. So we spent the first night hungry. Bar service basic drinks only NO SNACKS as advertised.  On entering our room we did not have any water cups tea/ coffee making facilities slippers or robes or toiletries. This was the first time in over 25 years of travelling at 4 and 5 star hotels that I did not bring my own toiletries. We requested the basics twice that night and received some shower gel after about 2 hours. We did not want to complain again so waited until the next day. Again after requesting slipper and robes three times all day we finally received them at night. We have tried to manage without complaining and just lowering our expectations. We do not like complaining and have to constantly go to the poor guys at hotel reception who are polite and try their best. I have requested some basic body lotion since our arrival I was handed one yesterday late at night and today after talking to other guests they stated someone told them that the Hotel does not provide conditioner or Lotion so I was lucky to get it.  We left a do not disturb sign on and staff have entered the room on two days today they removed our robes and towels after being specifically requested not to change the towels by lunchtime (as we like to do our bit for the environment) and after requesting they be provided back twice during the day we returned at 5pm to no towels or robes. After calling reception every 6 minutes for the first half an hour my husband went down to reception as we were due to shower have a rest and go to Marrakesh. He stated that the senior manager Lasima - just said sorry and went home with the rest of the senior management team.  I have never written a compliant in my life as I do my best to lower my expectations. We paid £200 each more to stay in this hotel than the adults only 5 star one at the time we booked as their reviews stated it was more like a 18-30 club holiday so I assumed that was why it was cheaper and booked the more expensive four star mistake. I can not complain about the staff below senior management that work here as they have been nothing but polite. The Tui rep stated this is Morocco you just have to beg for everything no hotels provide the basics so she was very helpful and we have never seen her again.We travel with Tui at least twice a year. I am exhausted from BEGGING when we paid over £2000 for this holiday as a couple. Tui should be ashamed of themselves for not demanding the basics for their customers.I am exhausted and stressed this was supposed to be a quiet relaxing holiday after the death of a close family member. I am just so disappointed in the BE LIVE senior management and will be complaining to GLOBALIA CEO Juan Jose Hildago on my return as they have been entrusted to run the Morocco be live hotels and the company that has invested in the project to begin with H Partners- Abbas Azzouzi who reluctantly invested in these hotels due to pressure from the Minister of tourism. There is no point in contacting anyone at the Be Live.    sadly disappointed,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/factualtraveler
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Chantal H wrote a review Apr 2019,20,Very disappointed,Very disappointed with this hotel. Completely lacking in hospitality or care.  Single female traveller put in ground floor room and had to argue my case when they refused to move me to 1st floor.  1st floor room - balcony doesn’t lock.  No towels - was so desperate for a shower I ended up drying In bedclothes  Shuttle bus - non existent you supposedly have to book 2 days in advance but I have yet to manage to get a place on it day 5/7  Hotel is in the middle of nowhere. Nothing at all to walk to. Nowhere to go. The hotel charges all guests £15 each way for a taxi (because you can’t get a place on the “shuttle bus”!) and clearly takes a large cut. So if you want to go out it’s £30!  WiFi is great when working. When not working - feel like I’m a prisoner to be honest. Pay £30 or stay trapped!  Not enough sunloungers for all guests. I just asked for help in finding one and was essentially told tough luck. So I now have a choice - stay in my room for the day or pay the £30 escape fee!  Food is good but repetitive. Drinks are good. Wine is of a decent quality. There are many flies and birds flying around the restaurant and it is like an over sized canteen.  The whole place lacks signage - nothing tells you where to get pool towels or how much they cost. There is an a la carte restaurant but no menu for it anywhere (and it has been closed most days I have been here). The snack bar does food but again - no menus. The evening entertainment is advertised - but no signs to tell you where to go. Most people didn’t have any sort of hotel information in their rooms.  Reception staff are surly and couldn’t care. I speak French so communication was not the issue here - attitude is! Bar staff are generally much nicer.  It’s an interesting mix of guests at the hotel. Maybe 40% French 20% British and then a mix of Islamic guests from multiple countries. This is not your typical “resort” clientele. Around the pool many women are veiled and many children accompanied by nanny’s and maids. This does not bother me at all but it may some.  Most guests I spoke to appeared to be disappointed with the hotel. Many asked the rep to move. Including myself. She never came back to me. But she did manage to get the balcony door fixed which was great - until I realised that it was left unlocked every day by the cleaning staff and on one occasion the main door was not closed and therefore not locked!  There is only one pool and most of it is ankle deep. I agree with another reviewer - this hotel is ONLY for those with children.  To be honest I feel very unwelcome here which is so out of keeping to the rest of marrakech. I would say take your money elsewhere where happiness matters.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,UK - North West,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/933chantalh

A special special mention to Sara in the Kids Club who showered our two daughters with attention and affection going way beyond what you might expect or hope for. Our daughters quite simply fell in love with her and my husband and I had the most relaxing holiday in the ten years since we had children!

Nothing was ever too much trouble and despite seeming to work from morning til night everyone was cheerful and welcoming all the time. Be Live Experience - your staff deserve medals.

Positives  Clean spacious room although paid for a suite so would have expected this.  Large bathroom  Regularly cleaned.  Free shuttle bus to city.  Negatives  Travelling as a couple my fault entirely I meant to book the Be Live Collection and was not allowed to move even though I offered to pay more. This is NOT a hotel to have a relaxing break in. It is totally centred around kids and families which is fair enough but not made clear at all. The noise around the pool area is simply unbelievable loud booming music morning and afternoon and there is no escaping it at all.  The dining area is like a large canteen full to the brim kids running around everywhere absolutely nuts and not relaxing at all. On several occasions we were sat beside a food clearing station which was disgusting. The food was lukewarm my husband had to heat his food every day in a microwave provided!  In the bar each evening a children's disco which is fine if that's what you want there was literally nowhere to go for a quiet drink unless you sat in your room which we did.  Staff on the whole were OK but the girl on reception lacks any sort of welcoming or warmth and when I was checking out she literally didn't make eye contact and threw a receipt at me refunding my deposit.  I generally try to see the best in any hotel I stay in and whilst it was clean it really was not presented as a kid focused resort and for me this was unacceptable. Leson learned.

And would be for a couple of days. But excursions or visits to the nearby hotel to use there facilities were organised. We were only there for 3 days so decided we would try to deal with it and not let it spoil our time. However the staff at reception were particularly rude. At every visit. For our last day and a half they refused very rudely to allow us to use the nearby pool as theres was nearly full now. With water still filling they assured me that all the correct water checks had been carried out. Impossible. We tried the quiet area after accepting we wont get a pool this holiday. Well its separated by a wall to a main road. Not quiet at all. We gave in and decided to leave and book into the sister hotel for the last day. And had to pay another £250 for the privelidge.  I would strongly recommend the sister hotel. Belive collection.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,San N wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Lovely experience,We recently came back from a wonderful break at Be live Experience. From the moment we got to the hotel we were welcomed by a polite gentleman called Yassine who made sure all our requirements are met. He made checking in quick and efficient. Other reception team like Adil and younes did help us whenever we required. I found the whole hotel staff very polite and courteous.    The entertainment team is brilliant and tries to communicate with all the hotel guests. We had pleasure to spend some fun time with Smiley Zag Sara and Nawal from entertainment team. It was hard job to entertain guests who speak different languages but they did brilliant job. When we got there the pool was under maintenance for two days but the hotel arranged trips to Atlas mountains and to some lake near by (sorry forgot the name think it was called Barragge) for all the hotel guests who wanted to go. They also offered the guest to use the facility into their sister hotel near by called Be live collection.    The food at hotel was good lot of choices but gets repetitive after few days. If you are staying for four nights or more then you can pre book a table at A la carte restaurant. The food there was lovely and very hot made to order. Snack bar had good choice of food from Burgers to pizza fries and paninis. Drinks at the bar was good too but only small selection of cocktails.    Hotel has got shuttle bus which takes you into town and is very handy. It leaves about five time a day and you have to prebook it. The first bus from the hotel leaves about 9.15 pm and the last bus from town leaves about 10.30 pm. The bus driver Abdulaziz is very polite and helpful. Any guest who wanted to know anything about sightseeing he was helping them get the best directions and will always make sure his guests knows where they will be dropped off and get picked up.    In the end i would like to thank the whole hotel team specially Yassine and Abdulaziz to make our holidays memorable. Also special thanks to Sara for teaching me some dance moves on our last night there. It was so much fun.

The staff (at reception the dining area and entertainment crew) were very helpful and friendly and in particular Yassin Ibrahim Salah Mahdi Walid Smily & Hassin and the others nothing was too much trouble for them.  The food was fresh and varied with plenty to choose from and the daily shuttle buses to and from the Madina were an excellent way of getting round. We will definitely be returning to the hotel but please look after the animals/birds and ensure there is always plenty of water and food for them.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Olga wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Fabulous stay! 5 stars to the staff!,I stayed with my family here for 6 days and I had an amazing time. Yassine checked us in and it was a very smooth process. He was always very helpful to us and attended to all of our needs without any delay ensuring out comfort at all times. Lamya at the reception was also lovely and very helpful.    We had a suite and it is a really good size facing the pool. The bathroom is quite big. Although the shower room door should be a proper door rather than a glass one.    The food is delicious and there’s a lot of variety. The head chef Salaha and all the staff were always smiling and greeting us. They made sure there were vegetarian options for us. It felt very warm and welcoming.    Nisrine always stood there to greet us with her lovely smile in the mornings before breakfast and was very helpful.    The Front Office Mgr Ilham is lovely. She personally helped me choose and book a hammam and recommended markets in the area.    The hotel organise interactive events in the evening which are a lot of fun!    They also offer shuttle service few times during the day from the hotel to the city centre and on the way back.    Only downside was that the pool was closed for two days when I was in the hotel. Although they offered excursions in exchange to compensate but we couldn’t avail as we had already done it on our own. I feel Managers could be given some authority/discretion so that they can use it depending upon individual circumstances and look after guests better.    Would I come back here? Yes definitely!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olgarora

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,party310 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Amazing service!,Just returned from sunny Marrakech. The hotel is still pretty new just over a year old. It has 167 rooms which makes it small enough to be able to get to know the other travellers and more importantly all the staff that work there. It has a great vibe and feels like a little family. All the staff are super hard working and very friendly and will always give a warm smile when interacting with guests. A huge special thanks to Yassine in reception though who always goes above and beyond to help the guests. Always smiling and efficient and very knowledgable about the hotel and the surrounding areas. A great part of the family and a huge asset to the hotel!  A huge positive is that the hotel is kept immaculately clean throughout all areas. Rooms are furnished to a high standard. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a duplex room with a pool view on arrival and it was beautiful.  The food quality is good for an all inclusive. Alot of beef fish and turkey. If you prefer chicken or veggie it’s a bit of a struggle. Only negative is that often the food isn’t labelled so not always sure what it is. When asking the staff what the dishes include they aren’t sure and have to check with the kitchen.  As with previous reviews the music around the pool can be very loud at times. Especially while the entertainment team are carrying out the activities but that’s the nature of the job and you can’t really complain. Just move slightly away from the pool as there is enough space on the grassy area and it’s not too far from the bar and the pool.  Overall is was a a brilliant week away with sun and relaxation.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/party310
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,steve k wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Nice Hotel...but some issues,Just got back from a week at the Be Live experience and thought i should review straight away as affirms quite a lot of the previous reviews.  Good Stuff.  Nice modern hotel big rooms clean and spacious great wi-fi check was easy all staff are helpful and polite can not fault service someone on hand to deal with anything we needed shuttle bus ran several times a day to the medina which was good.    Not so good stuff...when we checked in we had to give 90 euros deposit 50 for the room which i could not understand did they think we would steal the bed sheets this is not industry standard practice and i found to be insulting needs to be stopped as most people unhappy about this.  20 euros for each pool towel 10 each would have been sufficient what are the management scared of losing some bright orange towels...really?  Food was poor quality as previous reviews lots of food left out to go cold including chicken and fish chefs cooking to much to quickly and need to regulate the quantity they put out. what is more worrying is that some of the day before's meat and fish is recycled to dishes the next day and could be a major source of bacteria i saw more than one dish of cut up chicken nuggets turned in to a salad dish the next lunch time...not good.  We made sure we waited until we saw something being cooked and then put out before eating it the choice is good but i was concerned about quality this needs to be looked at before someone gets ill.  Loud music around the pool mainly when activities are going on but the music is awful...old french or Arab music played at high volume i think the management should remember that most people are there to relax and could be easily avoided by having a dedicated speaker close to the activities and not blaring out from the top of the pool bar.  Evening entertainment  the staff are lovely and really try their best but for a 4 star hotel i would expect at least 2-3 times a week some professional entertainment as there is nothing else within miles of the hotel so guests are trapped to watching very poor amateur shows.  No food or snacks after 9.30pm this is all inclusive and people Expect to be able to get a late snack.    It struck me that the management are trying to do things on the cheap and save money recycle food amateur entertainment only local drink available on all inclusive no late snack bar but try to make up for it with great service well i am sorry but for a nice 4 star hotel that it is it is being let down by poor management decisions and could be so much better.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bures, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevekoe
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,stg159 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Birthday Surprise Holiday,A 3 night holiday was booked to celebrate my husbands 50th I emailed the hotel prior to arriving as we wanted our room next to our friends and to have our duplex rooms overlooking the pool. We had perfect pool view rooms next to our friends rooms 2114 and 2116 The duplex rooms are large with a fridge and 2 tvs 2 bathrooms one with a bath very clean.  Anyway I must just say Sara and smiley and the rest of the animation team and the housekeeping team made my husbands 50th Birthday very special indeed. They decorated a sun lounger during the day and sang Happy Birthday they produced a cake in the evening in the restaurant which we took to the bar and shared with all and the whole team sang again to him  our room was strewn with rose petals and towel art on the bed and in both bathrooms. Truly lovely of them all.  Yes the music is a little loud around the pool but we just laid the other side of the pool and it was most enjoyable to watch everyone joining in with Aqua fit cocktail making cooking lesson etc. You could join in or simply watch.  We used the free shuttle bus in to the Souk which was easy .  We all had a blast and would happily return to this hotel.  Thank you Sara and team for making my husbands surprise 50th Birthday holiday and absolute blast xx,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leighton Buzzard, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stg159
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Londrina wrote a review Mar 2019,10,AVOID - Wish i had booked another Hotel,I have recently come back from this holiday after waiting 2 years from having major operation. I was looking forward to relaxing by the pool and sunbathing. The weather was great but unfortunately you could not relax because of the animation team and their VERY LOUD BOOM BOOM BOOM music for 9 hrs of the day. The songs were repeated and you couldn’t even hear yourself think or talk to my partner. Shame as I was wound up most of the time. I ended up near the baby pool and even still that was too loud. I am in my late 30s and it was disturbing.    We told entertainment Manager but she said she would speak to them but nothing was done about it. They said the Jumbo Club ran there. We were not told it was like an 18-30’s club. Felt like a raving IBIZA party every hour of the day by the pool. Ridiculous!!! I saved so hard for this holiday and totally hated it. Would definitely not recommend.    As soon as we arrived they wanted £50 for room charge refunded after your stay. City tax and another £20 for hire of towels. Within 5 minutes £100 was paid. The food was good. Rooms average not cleaned behind doors. No hot water day one flickering light and blocked up toilet.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondrinaUK

All the hotel has a beautiful modern and Arabian architecture.    The food was great very traditional and tasty.    The entertainment team was amazing. For our daughter - the Kids Club was really good a huge place for them to play a lot of toys and even the bathroom was kid adapted. Sara the responsible for the club is really great with kids a happy person with a lot of energy!!!  The Mini Disco was really fun. She really had a blast. All the staff were really friendly with us specially with her. The main swimming pool was heated what it was really good. And is amazing for kids.    The kids pool wasn’t heated. Was a shame that the kids couldn’t explore and play there.    The gym had fine equipment my husband went there a few times.    The evening shows were good and different every night. Very entertainment. The team did a really good job to keep everyone busy and happy!    It was a lovely week and we will be back for sure!

Extractor fan in bathroom not working and no mirror in the besroom. The hotel itself was geared up for the French and so the children's mini disco and entertainment was in French so I really missed not having entertainment. The food was very poor chewy over cooked dry chicken with bones left in it. Spaghetti was cold as was the rest of the food doors left open in the dining room with birds frying around the food we stuck to the French bread and warm soup we are not fussy eaters but the food served at be live palmaraie was unexceptable for this reason I would not return Linda and David skinner,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Paignton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaskinner1959

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Lucy Goodwin wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Peaceful & lovely,Overall we had a fantastic visit at this hotel and the area itself but I'm going to begin with some minor negativities we experienced from the begining.  Upon arrival to Marrakech the security was strict and very slow (where they check your passport and stamp it).  The transfer was about 30minutes only stopping at one other hotel! The check in at the hotel was incredibly tedious. I've never seen such apauling organisation there were only 3 rooms checking in including myself and it mustve taken about 20minutes.  You're required to pay a deposit  of 500 morrocan dieriams (approx 45GBP) at reception on arrivial when checking in incase you lose pool towels aren't checked out by 12 or cause damage to your room and so on.  Although the complex is rather small we and fellow guests found difficultly finding our rooms initially as it was dark. No one showed us to our rooms unless we asked.  Rooms are large spacious and clean. The double bed is HUGE could definately fit an extra person in there. The room design is quite strange as there's a see through window in the bathroom which can be viewed from the bed room area which gives no privacy to the shower or toilet even if the doors locked.  The lighting outside the rooms and around the hotel grounds is dimly lit which can make certain areas slightly hazardous.  Everything is relatively easy to find if told where things are but that's the big IF. On arrival no one tells you where the indoor evening entertainment is etc unless asked; its not clearly directed either. On a similar note at the welcome meeting the rep is so knowledgeable on the area of Marrakech with things you can do and so on. But voiced absolutely nothing about the hotel itself.  On a positive note the food at the hotel was INCREDIBLE! Considering being a relatively smaller hotel (160rooms aprox) compared to other hotels ive been too the selection and quality of the food was wonderful. Breakfast offered: salads cold meats and cheese turkey sausages a range of savoury pancake type morroccon dishes a range of vegetables fruit and the standard cereal and so on. It's NOT your typical British cuisine at all it's very much Moroccan orientated which is nice for a change!  As for lunch every day we used the buffet restaurant as opposed to the snack bar. The food was rotated daily and wasn't samey to the following evening meal either! Again they did a range of Moroccan dishes: tagine legumes and all sorts it was delicious! Again all freshly made and prepared infront of you. They offer a range of meats varying on lunch and evening including: turkey chicken lamb beef and a range of different fish (some hot and others cold) sushi was avalible on one of the days too. So overall the food went above and beyond expectations and you really got a feel of Moroccan cuisine with all the vegetables in different sauces and seasonings and so on.  The snack bar from what was seen was usually relatively busy and offered the typical pizza chips burgers etc.  Onto the A La Carte it was all laid out professionally and had a posh feeling but nothing over the top where your average person would feel out of place. The choice was plentiful. However me and my mother both had the same dishes and the starter that is called 'chicken' something was more like a pudding and you couldnt taste any chicken whatsoever and I'm not quite sure what it actually was. But with the description of 'chicken with almond and honey' we definately weren't expecting that! As for main we both had lamb tagine and that was beautiful! The puddings again slightly miss leading we ordered 'a small chocolate pot' or something along those lines and it was alot bigger than anticipated (this wasnt an issue) but it was quite sickly. Nevertheless I would definitely recommend the A La Carte if you're staying for 7nights or more.  Drinks across the hotel were of good quality and consistency. Covering the typical fruit juices (from concentrate) unless you get the freshly squeezed orange at breakfast. The typical fizzy drinks beer and wine- which I must say the Rosé was lovely with an evening meal. Alongside those offering several alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails - Mojito pina colada and their own hotel made one being the alcoholic ones.  Onto the entertainment team. Each and everyone one of them was lovely and friendly when first meeting you and equally throughout your entire stay. If you don't want to enlighten conversation or join in with the day time / evening entertainment then they'll leave you alone and not pester you. Likewise if you want a chat and would like to be involved theyd love that. They offer a range of day time activities including step aerobic aqua gym French bouels to name a few. They also have something different from the norm around 4pm each afternoon; one day they taught you how to make their cocktails and prepare one yourself. Another time shown how to cook tagine in teams. Which I feel keeps things interesting and gives people the chance to interact with others too. Special mention to the entertainment reps Zag and Smiley. Definately contributed to the enjoyment of our holiday!  As much as I liked the entertainment team the evening entertainment (given its not their fault theyre just told what to do) was woeful on 6/7nights stayed here. It was just the same thing every time. They didn't bring any shows or acts in to perform whatsoever apart from some Moroccan people with tamborines and all sorts one evening which was interesting to say the least. Other nights it was just the entertainment team doing a dance in a costume with poor organisation between sets. I didn't want to fault them but it had to be said the evening entertainment was shocking for most of the time. I'm not sure whether it's the same in summer time or 'peak' seasons as you'd be out in their amphitheatre and not in the lower ground of the hotel inside but I can't comment on that.  The entire hotel and its grounds are all kept clean and tidy mopped down regularly etc. The poolside offers plenty of sunbeds and a little water park area for kids; as well as a kids club. The pool is shaped very well catering for everyone. One end it has steps into the deepest part which i believe was 1metre 40cm. They have lowered and higher shaped areas where you can just sit and put your legs in and relax. Also have little sections which are shallower for the smaller children to be able to enjoy too.  The service was good and consistent throughout at the bars. However being a smaller hotel they only have 2 bars from 10am-6pm. Other times they only have the lobby bar in action until midnight which can mean it can sometimes at busier periods take a while to get a drink. Nevertheless they were all friendly and quick.  As for Marrakech itself its so lovely diving deep into all the culture they have to offer. The hotel offers a shuttle bus daily there and back about 4 or 5 times a day aprox 30mins journey time. I would 100% recommend going there for a few hours on a day or two depending what you came on holiday for. The rep gives plenty of information on how to go about Marrakech which was very helpful for when you're there exploring! Everything is very cheap there too. Only thing I would say is to be careful on the traffic and the cars. I've never seen so many types of vehicles and things on the road all at once it really is quite incredible and even when the 'green man' is present so it SHOULD be safe to cross you'll still get people on moped bike type things whizzing through on red lights.  All in all we had a lovely holiday which was much different to our usual type and it was thoroughly enjoyed throughout despite some niggles. It will all be missed. We would definately look into staying in Morocco again and maybe perhaps this hotel again too. It's perfect for going away around March time with temperature for us peaking in the early 30°s but to ensure you take a jacket or something for the evenings as it does get abit chilly at night around 15° I would guess. Considering the hotel is ever so new its doing a wonderful job and just needs to improve on the evening entertainment programme.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucy_goodwin8

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,A6794EVjuliem wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Not my cup of tea,Just returned after a weeks all inclusive Depends what you want out of the holiday disappointed with the location as it is right out in the sticks not able to go for a stroll of an evening or venture out anywhere but then perhaps that’s our fault should’ve done it a bit more research. There is a shuttle bus be advised you have to book in advance but no one actually tells you that.  There is plenty of entertainment at the hotel  but as a large majority of guests are French entertainment is geared around them .  very lively around the pool at most times which is okay if you like that but sometimes it’s just nice to have a bit of peace and relax.  The main canteen has a good selection of food but a lot of people fail to mention that the hot dishes were barely warm A big worry when serving seafood chicken and rice. Was sick on 3 occasionsstuck to chip butties in the end but the majority of the times not even the chips weren’t even warm. The snack bar outside was okay but again it was hit and miss as to whether the food was hot sometimes Panini‘s were hot and the chips were cold or vice a versa.  On the last day we checked out of our room and left the baggage in the left baggage room was very disappointed at the airport to realise that 300 dh was missing from my handbag guess this was my own fault as the room was not locked and all staff and guests were allowed to wander in and out.  Excursions booked were very misleading and had a lot of extra costs that weren’t included or highlighted that you would have to pay extra. Half the things on the list you did not see.  Reception staff and security very helpful but on arrival you do have to pay £50 deposit for your wristband deposit for your towels plus city tax to be paid. all good if you’re expecting it !!  Smiley one of the entertainers saw him kill him self laughing when I guest slipped over by the pool considerably went down in my estimation  didn’t even attempt to assist up or ask if was okay.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Chatham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A6794EVjuliem

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hugh wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Spring Break,My 10th time to Marrakech but my first visit to Be Live hotel in the Palmeraies.    Having been to another hotel chain close by in the Palmaries for the last 8 years as an early week away  I felt it was time to change. As the Be Live experience was close by and a newish hotel it seemed like a good idea.    On arrival I was quite disappointed as there really didn’t seem to be any sort of welcome at reception and check in was quite stressful with only one person on and he had he hands full with a dozen people trying to check in.    However after this first impression. I was pleasantly surprised that from then on the break away went only upwards.    The staff as ever in Marrakech are so helpful and really do make the difference in the enjoyment of the holiday. It was absolutely great to see Yassine on reception the next day as he has to be one of the most helpful people working at the front desk. A credit to the management of this Hotel.    If you manage to get yourself into the Specialty restaurant which I recommend you do. Then the service from Hassan and Abdelghafour is absolutely first class.    The self service restaurant is spotless and the food to a good standard. I would say there is something for everybody whatever your dietary requirements.    Everyone works so hard to be helpful in here. Ismael probably spelt incorrectly was a great waiter and I’d recommend sitting in an area where he is working. Made a big difference to the enjoyment of the restaurant for me.    I didn’t make use of the on site entertainment/animation but the people running it are a good bunch and definitely work tirelessly to try and make your holiday flow. Waled and Ishmael(smiley) were always on hand and extremely helpfu.    Outside the hotel there is very little I walk to Marrakech some days but wouldn’t recommend this unless you feel confident But having stayed in the Palmeraies so many times before I already knew this. You really need to make use of the shuttle bus which will take you in and pick you up from near Jemaa el fna throughout the day.. Morning is best as the temperature shoots up from about midday on.    I’ve done most things here souks Medina Majorelle carriage rides art houses restaurants cafes etc.. and would say that I’ve enjoyed most things. The souks are great fun and with a bit of confidence you can really enjoy them.    Finishing off I have thoroughly enjoyed this hotel very quiet and peaceful break indeed. I would definitely consider coming here again when I return next spring.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bridgend, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoscos1960
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,hostis wrote a review Mar 2019,20,Not an impressive hotel,We went for our 10th wedding anniversary and the hotel managed to mess it all up - a birthday cake? and the fact that our room didnt have a working fridge meant we coudlnt do anything with the cake anyway....    We booked All Inclusive but had to pay a deposit for the room AND pool towels?    Reception staff were pretty ignorant of anyone not speaking arabic or french fluently. (je parle un peu de francais). I may be called paranoid but I'm sure one of the women on receptioon walked off whenever an english couple started to approach....    The room.... well. A double room and the bed was incredible. So good. But the extractor fan didnt work in the bathroom the fridge didnt work and there were no drawers so we lived out of suitcases for the week. Interestingly they showed us 3 other rooms and none of the extractor fans worked in those either. An engineer had allegedly visited our room 3 times to sort the extractor fan out.    The pool was OK as long as you reserved a sunbed before 8.30. What was worth noting is that at least 2 sunbeds that were reserved with towels werent actually used at all all day. seems a little unfair....    Food was fairly good and the a la carte food was good but the service in a la carte was 10 times worse than in the main dining area. We also had to point out that one of the people cooking the food went directly from handling raw meat to carving a cooked join without cleaning hands / changing gloves so we stayed well away from that. The Snacks poolside food was good as well.    Entertainment we never tried in the evening as there was a colour coded dress code for each evening so that put us off as we didn't have anything that matched the dress code requirements (nor we we aware that it would be the case).    The hotel was SPOTLESS. Really clean. Impressed with the waiting staff (Mohammed and Rachid were exemplary) .    Really disappointed with the hotel especially with all inclusive and we had to pay depsoits for a room. Never had that before.

They were all soo brilliant but she really went above and beyond to make our stay memorable! Always polite friendly and if I’m honest they are the reason that we would return!!!    Massive downside RECEPTION unless you are French they don’t care. Our check in was awful we had to argue for 40 minutes that we did have a reservation and after them going through our phones to find the exact confirmation we had shown them originally they finally let us in! During this whilst we were talking to them they decided to pick up the phone and just cut our conversation off (before we even got our keys). The day before departure we were a little concerned as the book that reception give you for the transfers ours was not in there .... it took us a few minutes to realise they had given us the wrong country’s! Once we showed them ... they then gave the wrong one again until finally we got the British book. WORST RECEPTION STAFF IVE EVER MET.    The cleaners were lovely and kept the rooms spotless and around the pool!    Thank you to the entertainment team and I hope you get some appreciation from this! Reception team ... well I hope your not there if I return.,Date of stay: March 2019,,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTKk96

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Farzana.miah wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Wonderful stay at BeLive,Stayed here for a week with family. It was a really nice clean hotel. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. We had an all inclusive package. The food was average and there could be room for improvement. The poolside was nice and bar was very good with a good selection of drinks including non alcoholic mocktails. The rooms were clean and modern. There are shuttle buses into JamaElFena a few tones a day which makes it easy to get into town and then cheaper to take a taxi from there.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farzanamiah
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Kath M wrote a review Feb 2019,30,Very good but room for improvement,Firstly you must book to go to the al la carte restaurant it’s amazing. I’m gonna start with the things we found wrong but it’s only advice rather than a complaint :    Lack of information- we didn’t know we had to pre book the free shuttle bus to the centre  When you arrive you have to put a deposit down and also need to put a deposit down If you want a towel ( thank god we brought our own )  Extremely noisy around the pool ( I don’t think the music needs to be so loud I couldn’t hear my partner talking at the side of me )  All activities are aimed at french nationals so if your English it’s hard to understand what’s going on.  Rooms are cleaned to a basic standard we came back and our bins had not been emptied  Evening entertainment wasn’t good for English we couldn’t understand  Nothing around the hotel you can’t walk around outside because it’s in the middle of no where  Not near a beach    The good things ;    Very good staff they go out of their way to help.  Sit at the bar and get to know them they are entertaining in the evening better than the shows they put on.  Food is ok it took us a while to get use to it but overall it was good  Weather fantastic  Drinks are all ok  Have football on tv we watched Liverpool and Manchester United and wi fi is available all areas  You can change your money at the hotel reception  Beautiful sunset over the pool area    I’ve rated this three because not much around the area and not much entertainment in the evening for the English as well as through the day,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wigan, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathM444

Temperatures were hitting 27/28 most afternoons.    The rooms are very spacious and very nicely decorated. The beds.....so so so comfy!!!!!! Food unlike a lot of all inclusive we have been to is full of flavour and there really is something for everyone.  The staff are very very friendly and always willing to go that extra mile for you.  The hotel I would say is populated by 90% French people but English is very well spoken. In my opinion the French have overtaken the Germans in terms of getting up early to get the towels on the sun beds. Rather annoying really as there isn't enough sun beds for everyone.  Special mention to Yassin on reception and also Khalid the lifeguard. Lovely fellas.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,LeeRex wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Food and people were amazing,I can not praise the Be Live Experience enough for it's people and food.. The staff were incredibly accommodating and very friendly / polite. The rooms and even the site we're also super clean and fresh.    Naturally Tourism is their sector and you protect your industry so you expect good service ( you hope to anyway ). I would be incredibly surprised if anyone had a negative word to say about the staff at Be Live. And indeed the whole of the City was very friendly. An amazing place to be on holiday. Also honestly the food quality and selection every day was truly amazing I must have put on so much weight as I couldn't stop myself from 2nd's and 1 of every pudding...    The only gripe is that the music was a loud at the pool area. With day Excursions and late nights/long days mooching around and seeing the sight's a couple of times I tried to take a nap although the pool speaker was massive and the base a little to strong if your a light sleeper...    But this is a minor gripe as the whole experience was amazing...

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,bevalt52 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,AMAZING BIRTHDAY GETAWAY,Booked this holiday break on a deal and we were not disappointed at all. We had transfers included and also fully inclusive basis.  Wow..this will be a very honest account of our stay.  UPON ARRIVAL  We were greeted very warmly by reception and NASRINE (events co-ordinator) who I have to say made our stay a memorable occasion. I had emailed the hotel about it being a surprise for my husband as a birthday present and let me tell you it will be one that will be hard to beat.  We were given a ground floor room pool facing Room 1004 which was superb and the bathroom was spacious and had a wonderful rain shower which was much appreciated. Birthday cake was delivered to the room on Thursday and our room was decorated with flower petals and towels were made into love swans with rose petals strewn all over and this continued the following day as well... wow the cake was superb SPECIAL THANKS TO SALEH (Restaurant Manager) who together with Nasrine organised everything and even sang Happy Birthday to my husband when he went to thank them. Well done and it was very much appreciated you made our stay very special.  BREAKFAST  A buffet spread from Salads cold meats and cheese breads rolls pastries porridge eggs local specialities... you will not go hungry even if very fussy about what you eat. If you do not want to get up for the breakfast buffet (7 - 10) you can have breakfast at the pool area from 10am. Snacks are all day till 18h00 including paninis fries burgers etc etc... you will not starve  LUNCH  Omg such a choice of food...tagines are amazing and if you are a vegetarian there is plenty of choice and you will not starve. Salads vegetables local and international choices... best tagines we have ever had...spoilt for sure  DINNER  7 - 10  Again the choices of food was varied and amazing As i said earlier all tagines were amazing and the choice of fish meat vegetable so everyone is catered for.  Desserts are amazing lets not forget to mention this....fresh fruit ice cream local delicacies...yum am starving thinking of all this food  Your table is cleared as soon as you have finished on your plate and the dining room and food stations are amazingly spotless nothing to much for staff to make sure you are well looked after and enjoying yourself.  WEATHER  We were blessed with wonderful weather a bit nippy in the morning and evenings but I would say from around 10am it starts warming up and it was around 24 degrees which was very comfortable. We were told we were very lucky with the weather as it usually rains during this time of year.. but the weather has changed all over the world that one has to just take a chance like we did and go for it... it worked for us..  LOCATION  Just outside of the City 15 min shuttle ride which is free and supplied by the hotel 3 trips in a day... this takes you to the old city and souks which is a definite must wear very comfy sandels or trainers as the streets are very narrow and cobbled you share the walking experience with donkeys tuk tuks motor bikes and other pedestrians so you have to be on your wits. Loads of bargains to be had. I would suggest you take a tour guide with you around the souk as you will definitely get lost finding your way as there are passages after passages after passages and you lose your sense of directioncarpets galore which is worth looking at slippers and moccasins which are worth purchasing as these are very comfy and last a long time.  Never felt intimidated at all in fact we were very humbled by the generosity of the folk. I had walking difficulties at the time and was very much in pain after 4 hours of walking around and an elderly man of around 80 offered me his seat to sit on so i could rest my back. so humbled but I did not allow him to stand for me as he was much more in need of the seat but just shows you how humbling an experience this was.  We would in a heart beat go back to this hotel for the hospitality and food....  THANK YOU TO ONE AND ALL WHO MADE THIS THE MOST MEMORABLE BREAK AWAY AND WE WILL ALWAYS BE VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY IN MAKING MY HUSBANDS BIRTHDAY A SPECIAL ONE TO REMEMBER.  WE WILL BE BACK...  SORRY FORGOT TO MENTION THAT THIS HOTEL IS DISABLED FRIENDLY AND HAS RAMPS ALL OVER FOR WHEELCHAIR USERS AND PEOPLE WITH WALKING DIFFICULTIES. IF YOU REQUIRE A WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY ROOM I WOULD SUGGEST EMAILING THE HOTEL AND ASKING IF THIS IS SOMETHING THEY OFFER AS WE ONLY HAD WALKING DIFFICULTIES AND FOUND THE FACILITIES AMAZING.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edgware, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bevalt52
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,BeefaLover wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Impressed!,Just got back and had to leave a review!!    The hotel and rooms are very nicely decorated and furnished with a modern feel mixed with Moroccan.    We arrived Monday evening with not much time for dinner to spare but we were shown to the dinner hall and were overwhelmed with how much food choice there was.. this was mixed up everyday and fortunately we had the opportunity to reserve dinner at their second restaurant (which was not buffet and portions were very good.)    The pool is heated and we took part in some of their daytime activities like aqua aerobics cocktail mailing and salsa lesson. The staff were super friendly and got us involved took the time to chat with us and help with anything we needed.    Shout out to Ricard Albergafour and Ismail as they made out first evening the greatest with their company and cocktail making.    The snack bar by the pool was great. There was always a moment where you could grab some food or a refreshment and never had to wait long at all.    We we made friends with guests from France and the guests are all very multicultural.    I would definitely come back again!!!

First the negative points:  The food got a bit ""samey"" after a few days it wasn't always hot either.  Birds in the buffet restaurant walking over and eating the bread not the most hygienic thing I have seen!  Now the good points  Food was very nice  Hotel was kept clean and tidy.  ALL of the staff are a credit to both Be Live hotels and to Morocco.  The inclusive drinks were more than adequate so no complaints there.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Panayiota K wrote a review Feb 2019,40,"Relaxing, easy stay.",We had 3 DUPLEX rooms. We definitely made the right decision on this type of room. The 51m2 duplex room was very spacious comfortable and clean. The upstairs level had an extra large bed with comfy mattress and pillows and a bathroom with a bathtub. I usually take my pillow from home because I do not like hotel pillows. The pillows were great there. The downstairs level had 2 sofa beds and a bathroom with a shower. We also had a balcony overlooking the pool. The wifi was good which was very important because my husband had to work and my teenagers needed to connect. There was also a fridge with complimentary water.    The staff all around the hotel....front desk especially Youseff  travel agent buffet area bar and cleaning crew.... were very friendly helpful and hard workers. I had read that the employees did not speak English well . This was not the case for us. Most employees we encountered at the hotel spoke English and French.    There is also a bus service into the center free of charge. I think it has 5 different times throughout the day. Reserve you seats at the front desk from the day before. Also beware the the taxis from center to the hotel try to charge you more. The proper rate is 150 Dh. A few taxis charged us 200 Dh but once I figured it out I would tell them from the beginning that we know the rate is 150 Dh.    2 pools and animals on site    A special thanks to JAWAD the tour guide agent that helped us so much with our transportation everywhere and all our excursions such as QUAD & CAMEL RIDE EVENING DESERT DINNER ESSAOUIRA TRIP and ATLAS Mountain. He was a life saver. We had not booked anything before our arrival to Marrakech so we were all a bit anxious. He helped us so much and even tailored made some of the trips to suit our families with a child and teenagers. We did not have to worry about anything which was great since we were on vacation. Jawad is such a sweet helpful hardworking person. He made our trip.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paiania, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panayi0tak

The staff are quite friendly without pretence. They made us really feel at home however the reception staff need to speed up. They took too long. The food is nothing like I expected very authentic Morrocan plus the delightful international cuisine. Our standard room was spacious with state of the art air conditioning and a refreshing powerful shower. The downside was an empty fridge (I would've expected at least a bottle of water) and air conditioning a bit too noisy. The pool is large and inviting though it's position discouraged some because of so many ogling eyes hovering around. Perhaps they could do with a smaller pool a bit further from the main ""centre square"". Special thanks to Ms Nisrine the guest relations executive. She was very helpful and professional.

As I can't sleep with traffic noise we were quickly moved to a quieter room with a massive double bed. Much better.  The rooms are spacious and cleaned to a high standard daily. There is free WiFi throughout the hotel aircon in the room (which we used to heat the room as it was unseasonably cold during our stay) and a free safe.  The all inclusive food was delicious with a huge choice of food and drinks. Freshly squeezed juice for breakfast with a great coffee machine offering various choices plus lots of different teas. Alcoholic choices good too.  The pool is good with nice loungers. We didn't use the gym.  The entertainment team are great. Really friendly and kept us amused on a drizzly cold dayorganising games and encouraging all nationalities to join in.  The free shuttle bus into the Medina was a nice touch. The hotel is isolated so you can't walk anywhere.  I'd definitely recommend this hotel to friends the service was first class.  I'd like to see a few more English speaking channels on the television. An English news channel would be good. And there isn't much to do if the weather is bad.

Comfortable transfer to the hotel and an early check in the room however wasn’t great.    Room had a view of the gas station opposite on the main road however the hotel was empty the room could have been facing the pool given there were many empty rooms.    The room itself had two beds which was great as well as bedside electric outlets which is good as well as WiFi. Shower was very strong also.    Negative on the room 1109: window from bedroom from bathroom this should be smoked/frosted glass. Crack in wardrobe mirror broken hand towel rail flickering mirror light minibar unstocked (not even water) no coffee making facility.    The main dining area was spacious with many salad and hot options no complaints however it would get boring after 1 week we stayed 4 nights. A la carte was unfortunately not used as it was only open certain days.    Pool was heated and clean many chairs available no need to reserve chairs etc. 200dh/£20 reservation for towels 500dh/£50 reservation for the room also.    Staff were the highlight of the stay with the likes of smiley zag & nesrine.    Overall the hotel is good to be used as a B&B however to stay there all day (we didn’t) I think you would die of boredom.    Hotel shuttle was good and on time to the centre however we never took it back to the hotel as the times weren’t great. More mid day options would be good however you can take a taxi for 100dh in the day 150dh at night.    Hotel overall 3/5 staff 5/5.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Steve W wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Really friendly staff,Travelled for 4 days mid november. Arrived about 1.00pm and check in was really easy. We were invited to lunch and went to room after. Food mostly buffet but there was always hot meat available. The waiters were really friendly and replenished drinks every time we were nearly finished. The wine was really good and the local beer more than acceptable. There was a choice of about 6 cocktails and non branded spirits ready available.  The room was nice and had a huge powerful shower. We looked out over the busy road but traffic didn't bother us and we found it fun watching the chaos that is Marrakech! The pool area was nice and the water temperature very pleasant. Weather was 26%C for the first 3 days then cloudy on the last. Due to the time of year the hotel was pretty quiet and you never had to queue for anything which was really nice. The hotel was really well looked after and all of the staff were great. A special mention to Smiley and his entertainment team who really went the extra mile to make the place fun without making guests feel uncomfortable. He does need to up his table tennis and snooker skills though!! We had a meal in the a'la carte restaurent which was a big step up from the buffet. Hassan looked after us impeccably and was a perfect host.  The free bus into the medina was a real bonus. It ran every couple of hours and if you haven't been before its a must. The driver was a really helpful chap and explained well pick up points.  All in all this was a great mini break and we would highly recommend this hotel.  Well done to all,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Glastonbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6295PZstevew

This includes the restaurant and catering staff bar staff cleaners housekeeping gardeners/maintenance and the animation team (Smiley Hannah Hosein and Moad).    The facilities were spotless and a great deal of work goes in to keeping the place looking great all through the day.    Our bedroom was very nice the bed was comfy the cleaners did a very good job every day and we had a very good quality shower.    The pool is heated and staff are continually cleaning the pool area (and the inside of the hotel).    We only used the Buffet restaurant during our stay and the food was excellent with plenty of choice at each sitting.    The hotel is quite a way out of Marrakech. There is a limited free shuttle bus into the city.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnjet
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Angeluk11 wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Not bad for what we paid for... definitely not a 4 star hotel!,OK where do I start with this hotel lol. This hotel is FAR from everywhere and without the free shuttle bus (and my mate Rashid- Love that guy) it’s not worth staying here as you are looking to pay around about £15-£20 taxi to centre and the same amount back! From the airport we arranged an transfer shuttle (which was good as it’s far from the airport too lol) The check in was smooth and you need to pay deposit for any breakage or lost of wrist band (yes you have to wear it at all times..lol)- there were 2 check in people at reception – one is Yossaf (story to tell about him lol) and Ibrahim (LFC supporter- good guy! lol) the rooms are decent size and clean the bathroom was good size too and had a window in bedroom and bathroom which if you were snoopy you can get a glimpse of your mate having a sh*it..lol (TIP 1- maybe change the window to frosted #justsaying!) My friend didn’t like the room as it was facing the road and so called garden we went to speak to Yossaf and he said to come back the next day – but dude we are only here for 3 days!!.. The room was changed and we got the pool view.  Anyway- this is an all –inclusive hotel (rude not to enjoy the food.) The food is good and I did think if I had stayed there for longer than 5 days if I would get bored as some places have repetitive menus but this wasn’t. It was lovely and the servitors and chefs were very friendly. 7pm on the dot we were there (lol)- we needed to finish by 8pm to get the free shuttle bus to the centre to get mopped by the locals to buy their tat. It’s an experience lol. I got talking to some of the visitors at the hotel and guess what? they just stayed in the hotel all day and night. Seriously venture out the Moroccans’ aren’t that bad!  For this time of the year the weather was OK got warmer during the day and at night you needed your coat! But that didn’t bother us we just rolled with it.  I heard about the a la carte restaurant and this is only done by booking at the reception and since we were only there for few days I thought I would book this. Yossaf (remember I said I had a story..) anyway he said he will book it – left it in his capable hands and we headed to the restaurant that evening... OH DEAR.... they didn’t have our name on the booking list and the main guy who was sort of in charge wasn’t that helpful and spoke rudely (wish I took his name!) basically he said your name isn’t on it and you are not coming in!!!... I WAS NOT HAPPY!!!! Yossaf you messed up big time!!!!! Nonetheless we headed to eat from the buffet. The next day I saw Yossaf (I think he really hated me this time round..lol) He rectified his mishap and helped with my boarding passes now he was my bestie..lol Good job! Shame this hotel didn’t have a business centre!    This hotel has an In-house entertainment team and they are ever so friendly.. my fav is zig zag (aka zag) we had a nice chat about life in Morocco and it’s nice to share stories- the others were great too; Smiley Ayo lovely lady (forgot her name..lol). They work extremely hard and always on hand to get you involved with their activities. TBH I’m glad I didn’t go when its peak time. I can imagine this place being BOOKED and full of kids and pasty people lol. Always good to travel when the season is over!    Our check out was very early in the morning and Yasin was great in dealing with all the paper work although he did look half asleep but with our ongoing banter we were cracking jokes in no time.    Ok- let’s talk about why this wasn’t 4 star... the attention to detail from reception needs to be spot on and few occasions I had to repeat myself (many times) The hotel knew what time we were leaving (well I’m hoping they did.. if they didn’t- Tip 2.. you should appoint someone who is in charge of this) and they could of provided us with a small packed breakfast box! #justsaying. We had arranged a transfer to the airport. I think the hotel needs to have all the numbers on hand and arrange this for us instead of me sorting this out. I had to go to reception few times to get this sorted and they said.. ‘come back later’... nahhhh 4 star hotels do not reply in this manner. TIP 3- They could have taken the details and later on messaged me to say this has been sorted. #justsaying. These are some of the pointers you can use for future training and I have plenty more... contact me and I’m sure we can collaborate together!    Tip for everyone reading and thinking of going... make sure you visit the other hotel- be-live collection- adults only hotel. It’s walking distance and you can access all their amenities via your wrist band but double check with reception before your go. (they can change their minds..lol)  Would I return back?... hmmm probably not as it is in the middle of nowhere- there are plenty of other hotels which are closer to the centre and but if I just wanted to stay in the hotel and enjoy the in-house entertainment- they why not!    AIRPORT information--- I’ve never seen so many checks at this airport lol. When you land you go through immigration but you will need to fill out a landing card (paper) handy to have the hotel details- not that they check but good to have this. The immigration officer keeps you waiting looking at your passport (if you look dodgy- you will be there for a while lol) after that there is another passport check before you collect your bags. Once collected you need to go through screening (i mean... really!!) and finally FREE! lol    Returning to go home is even worst! as soon as you arrive you have to go through the screening and show your passport and head towards where your check in area is and get your boarding passes stamped this is even if you take luggage on board once that is done you head towards departure gates but before you go through you need to fill in departure card/paper which is checked with your passport and then you need to queue up for immigration who take the paper and then you go through and then you need to show your passport and boarding passes AGAIN and then you are in the duty free area!! Seriously this is no joke! never seen it like this! lol.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Paul F wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Great stay on first time to Morocco,Stayed here 16th - 23rd for a last minute deal. I'll just list the good then not as good stuff.    The good:    The staff are great all the bar staff and waiters and the animation team (Smiley Hannah Mo and the lad who taught the Arabic lessons who's name I've forgotten (sorry!)). The Arabic lessons were a good touch on a day where the weather wasn't so good and actually useful for going into Marrakech.  The facilities were spotless and alot of work obviously goes in to keeping the place looking great.  We found the food to be good quality with enough variety in lunch and dinner for the 7 nights we stayed. I've had alot worse food in all inclusive before and the range of salads especially was great.  The on tap beer and local white wine we liked and we had enough of it I can tell you that.  Comfy bed clean room and good quality shower everything you need for a good stay.  The free shuttle bus into and out of town 5 times a day was great and saved a ~15 quid taxi each way.  Nice big pool that seemed at least a little bit warm.  The food in the a la carte restaurant was nice.    The not so good:    With the weather being a bit inconsistent there isn't alot to do at the hotel. One pool table table football and some gym facilities the days dragged on a bit.  There's nothing near the hotel so you can't really go out for a walk in the absence of anything else to do  Another review mentioned the food isn't very hot but that's to be expected from a buffet restaurant.    Overall we enjoyed ourselves and the staff in the hotel really do their utmost to make sure you have a good time. Good food decent drink and a comfy bed.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Stais15 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Great last minute week away,Great last minute holiday for a bit of sun. Stayed a week and really for the price it cannot be faulted.  Hotel was immaculate it was constantly being cleaned. Including pool area and loungers etc.  The food was good as you’d expect from an all inclusive buffet style. Always something to suit everybody I would say. The a la carte restaurant was exceptionally good. Need to book but is a must.    Staff across all areas are very good. Very helpful and pleasant. We were very looked after by restaurant and bar staff who made sure they knew our preferred drinks and were very attentive to refill a near empty glass.    We arrived and needed an emergency trip to dentist as soon as landed - again staff very helpful and let us drop bags and head straight back out and checked us in properly when we returned. Only one issue was we were allocated an adjoining room not a huge problem but I felt uneasy with the door (though it was of course locked) Staff member Kamara knew I wasn’t comfortable with it and even though I said it was fine he sent us off for dinner and said he would take care of it and checked if another room was available. By time we had sat down in restaurant he was there to say it was sorted. Must admit I did feel so much happier not having the connecting door.  But I only mention this as to highlight the service we received as it was hardly even an issue worth mentioning.  After the dentist emergency a lot of staff knew I’d had to go and remembered me and asked after my tooth and if I was ok now etc. Nice touch that they even remembered as well as asked about it.    Bar area on an evening is a little small as you cannot really sit out ob an evening as is too cool (was for me anyway) at this time of year but as hotel wasn’t full we only really had a problem once or twice finding a seat.    Though when we visited 5-12th nov the weather was great during the day. Only came over a bit cool once I think when lots of clouds but by lunchtime they’d long cleared and sunshine and heat resumed!    We would definitely go back toward end of season as I imagine the restaurant and bars and pool area would be a little crowded at peak times. And we loved the ease of getting loungers by pool and tables in restaurant and no queues to get a drink at bar etc.    Fabulous holiday!

The food was very good. The a la carte restaurant was a must but has to be booked.    Free shuttle into Marakech (also has to be booked).    We stayed in a Duplex room which was great.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,cherylnicholls wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Could be but not yet a 5 STAR hotel,"just returned 16th September. Hotel is small but kept clean. The rooms are stylish and just as shown in the images. Sadly ours flooded so badly we asked to move. we had pondered over a swim up and hubs joked that we ended up with a swimming ""pool"" in our actual room which was crazy (not a slight flood - im talking an inch deep of water that spread from bathroom to half the bedroom). Reception agreed to change but was quite matter of fact with no sign of an apology for the inconvenience of having to repack and then unpack it all again!!! :(  Food was amazing and there was plenty of choice Most of the staff - especially the waiters are lovely - there was the odd grumpy barman but we took no notice. Swim up bar was great and we enjoyed evening entertainment although never got a seat on the main terrace. The sports bar was also good for a game of pool and a few laughs. Bar staff in there were great and there was no problem getting drinks!!!  I had a massage in the spa which was heavenly and about £30 for half an hour (full body). The spa is independent of the hotel and were reluctant to give the 10% discount advertised in my booking papers.  We are lucky enough to have stayed in many 5 stars. To get this hotel to that standard they need to a) solve the flooding issue b) solve the toilet smell issue as I don't think the hotel system can cope c) offer room service d) offer waiter service for drinks around the pool e) replace the curtains on the cabanas that are mostly torn and really let the pool area down f) get padded sun loungers (as they were basic and quite uncomfortable on your back).  Overall - made the best of the holiday and had a nice stay - met some lovely people (50% English & 50% french split). Loved the food and service at the a la carte - the red wine is lush.  Hotel has some way to go however to reach the 5* level we have experienced in other countries ie Egypt Jamaica Dominican etc and I note that my comments are repeated so management know about the problems but don't seem to be acting on correcting them.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,MC12342014 wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Relaxing Hotel,I stayed at this hotel early to mid-September. The temperature was low 30's so very bearable. By the time of my stay all the families with kids had gone so it was very much quieter than during the school holiday period. The hotel is relatively small so wherever your room is you are not far from the main reception/dining area. During the day there is music and activities around the pool area but if you want you can sunbathe away from the 'noise' in a private area near the gym. I used the running machines in the gym each day. The gym is very well equipped and has changing areas and showers if needed. The food was of a good standard with plenty of choice. The hotel itself and the bedrooms are very clean. A free shuttle bus goes into Marrakesh every couple of hours. The hotel itself is about 20 minutes from the centre no bars or restaurants nearby but you can also jump into a taxi to the centre for about 10-15 euros (make sure the meter is running!) Euros are widely accepted here due to the French influence.  The staff in the restaurant reception bars were all very polite and helpful. They are a credit to the hotel - the management team are very lucky to have such good staff. A special mention though must go to the young entertainments team. They work incredibly hard and with a smile from 10.30 in the morning until late evening. Thank you in particular to Momo and Sara who are exceptional.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,alimaurice wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Fun and lively hotel,My boyfriend and I stayed at Be Live for a week at the beginning of September.    Reception staff:  We found the reception staff to be very unhelpful and did not welcome us to the hotel. E.g. when we asked about the shuttle bus we were told about the times but not told we needed to book.    Room:  The room was lovely and a good size. It would have been nice to have a mirror over the desk and more light in the bedroom is needed. Again a nice size bathroom however there was a window between the bathroom and bedroom this meant that if my boyfriend or I got up in the night light would shine into the bedroom.    Food and drink:  The food was great. There was lots of variety I’m a vegetarian and had no difficulty finding something to eat. In addition there were great bar snacks - more of a meal actually! We felt it may have been better to have food available throughout the day rather than having to order it.    There were plenty of drink options including cocktails.    However the flies at meal times and by the bar did irritate us. We feel the hotel could try to combat this in some way.    We were also disappointed that the hotel stopped the 5pm doughnuts half way through our stay!    Pool and entertainment:  The pool was great and there were always sun beds available. Initially the loud music did annoy us however we began to enjoy the fun the entertainment staff had with the guests - young and old. The entertainment staff were honestly amazing and seemed to work all hours of the day!    Going into Marrakesh:  The hotel is approx 20 mins from the centre of Marrakesh. There is a free shuttle which takes about half an hour. Sometimes we got a taxi back to the hotel for 200 MAD. However the bus dropped us in a place that felt completely random initially. It would be helpful if we were given help to get the main hub. In addition there were often men waiting for guests to get off the bus - they were very convincing that they worked for the hotel and it appeared they wanted you to go to a restaurant they worked for. The hotel NEED to warn guests about this.    Overall a really great stay!!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wembley,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alimaurice

I understand this hotel is only 1 years old and may be still be struggling with teething problems. MY main issue was with the language barrier I’m a Moroccan myself who speaks fluent French and Arabic but my wife and children do not speak French at all! All entertainment was catered for the French and my children felt left out and could not participate or join in with the activities which is a massive shame as I spent £3000 in this hotel my children would ask to go there room or stay in the lobby so they could speak to there friends back in London. Other than that the food was fantastic pool was nice and clean it was immaculate the cleaners were polite and so professional and a overall well built complex.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Jojoshols wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Good value,There are a lot of great things about this hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was our anniversary whilst we were there and they had decorated our room with petals and provided a patisserie plate on arrival. Sarah at Guest Relations went out of her way to ensure that we had a table in the a la carte on the night after arrival which was again covered with flowers and they even produced a lovely cake with iced message on it. Super touch.    The food in the a la carte was absolutely incredible wine was lovely too (same served throughout the hotel). The menu here was a much better than we expected as I think it is described as tapas but we enjoyed fillet steak which was a pleasant surprise!    Food in the buffet restaurant was of a good enough standard as with all AI resorts it did get repetitive but still represented great value for what we paid. The snack bar has a good menu if you want to change it up at lunch time however I would say that the lunch buffet was superior to the evening one.    Yassir on the pool bar is an asset to the hotel he seemed to really be proud of his work refreshed our drinks as he cleared tables and our order was often poured before we reached the bar if he spotted us walking over.    The hotel grounds are immaculately kept and the cleanliness is of a high standard in the rooms and across the hotel. In particular the poolside toilets which in many other hotels we have stayed in have always left a little to be desired but these were the cleanest and driest I’ve seen. Whatever they use to clean also smells incredible!    With that in mind we had to keep reminding ourselves that this was a four star hotel. There were a few things that could have been better. The minibar had water in on arrival and was refilled possibly twice during our one week stay. As the bar closes relatively early it means that water is not available again until breakfast which seems unusual. The drinks in general were poor quality and often we had to ask what was in them. The pool bar closes before dinner and there are only a couple of seats outside of the lobby bar but inside the lobby bar is bright and characterless and the bar staff there a little surly so there was nowhere to enjoy a drink in the evening really resulting in us going in to the city which is not a bad thing.    The shuttle bus is great there is nothing nearby the hotel so you need the bus and it runs a really good timely service. It drops off near a few shops so can grab supplies for the room if needs be. We used the bus during the day and at night and enjoyed all our visits to town. The city is definitely worth visiting so do give it a go.    Animation team are hard working and definitely persistent! It seems odd to have a dance class at the end of the pool felt awkward for the people taking part to be watched by everyone else but each to their own. The activities did seem to be aimed at the young adults exactly as it should be but some of the team did get a bit grumpy when we didn’t want to join in.    We did enjoy our time here and the price we paid was a bit of a steal so five circles from us.

The staff (big shout out to the entertainment crew Sara Lina Ayoub & Yassir) and the holiday makers all made this holiday so special.  Everyone went above and beyond to make sure we felt at home. I never wanted to leave :(  The variety of food catered to everyone was a huge selection every night (the desserts are amazing)  The entertainment team kept us busy during the day and the shows in the evening had so much effort put into them.  The hotel was immaculate so super clean.  The receptionists bar staff and waiters all so kind and helpful.  This hotel is suitable for ALL ages!  Any negative reviews on here ignore them all!

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Karen G wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Brilliant holiday,The staff were all friendly and helpful and the hotel was spotless. The animation team worked hard at keeping all the guests entertained with one problem because most of the guests were French all their announcements were in French & only said in English when they were reminded to which had to be quite often. The food selection was excellent for all meals with chefs on hand to cook extra or special requirements. I feel that tea & coffee making facilities should be available in rooms as the restaurant didn't open until 7am. Overall an excellent hotel.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenG688
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Saria T wrote a review Jun 2018,50,AMAZING HOTEL!,I recently travelled here with 2 of my female friends... as a group of 3 young women we found our overall experience at the hotel to be amazing. ALL of the staff were absolutely incredible but we would like to send out a special mention to Sara Ayoub Lina and Yassir who made our holiday extra special! I celebrated my birthday whilst in Morocco and the staff went above and beyond to make sure that I had the most perfect day!    The hotel is suitable for guests of all ages with a designated area for children to play and kids club. We met a French couple in their 70’s who also said they loved the hotel. My friends and I are from England and aged between 25-32 so it really does cater for all ages. Our room was beautiful and was thoroughly cleaned everyday (we couldn’t believe how much effort the housekeeping team went to everyday). The buffet restaurant had a wide selection of food so there was something for everyone (2 of us are pretty fussy eaters but we enjoyed the food) we also went to the other restaurant onsite on my birthday which was lovely. The entertainment team do a fantastic job of including all guests in activities such as water aerobics and dancing (all activities are of course optional but it was nice to have a mix of all ages involved). At night the entertainment team put on a variety of shows and activities for the hotel guests (we didn’t miss one!)    I have never written a review before but this hotel definitely deserves it! We loved this hotel so much that we didn’t leave the hotel once in our 10 days there although we had originally wanted to explore Marrakech! So now we have decided to revisit Morocco for a longer stay! ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC HOTEL!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sariat2018

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,O6190NQmike wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Allergy Hell!,"Our holiday was ruined by a select few people at this hotel. It is a real shame as several members of this hotel work extremely hard particularly the restaurant manager and bar staff who are very pleasant so its very sad that our lasting memories of this hotel are the negative experiences. My baby has severe food allergies so in order to make this a positive holiday for us as a family I called the hotel in advance to check that they could cater for my baby. Having been on several hotel breaks I always do this to check in advance. I explained to the hotel that my baby has a range of allergies and it was very important that she didnt eat these items and did the hotel feel able to cater for her or I should I make alternative arrangements. The hotel explained that they were very confident to deal with this and I did not need to make arrangements. On arrival to the hotel I spoke to the receptionist and manager about the allergies and they fobbed me off telling me to simply talk to the chef. At each meal I spoke to the chef explaining the situation it concerned me that he didnt appear to check any ingredients before confirming that the food did not contain the relevant allergens. I did repeatidly tell them it was very serious and could they check of which they simply told me they didnt need to check as they knew it didnt contain the relevant ingredients. On the fourth day of the holiday my baby was EXTREMELY unwell with a severe allergic reaction after confrontation to the chef he did confirm that he had ""made a mistake"" and the food had in fact contained butter (very serious for her). After 24 hours of an extremely unwell baby we decided that we needed to get some help as the poor little girl had been very unwell within the room and we didnt have the facilities to clean it all up the last thing we wanted was for the maids to get a nasty suprise as they had been extremely diligent during the week. We went to reception and explained calmly that she was being very unwell in the room the manager said no problem at all and that they would come and collect all the items and simply pop in the wash for us. Very helpful.......until checkout when we are stung with a huge laundry bill which no one had mentioned to us at any point. Not only had they poisoned my baby (enough that she was admitted to hospital with a bleed in her stomach) we were then CHARGED a huge amount for laundry of all the items my poor child had been unwell on. At checkout we were addressing that we were quite displeased to be told that we had a huge laundry bill to pay when the receptionist then told us that we had to pay £120 for a broken phone in the room. We explained that we had no idea what she was talking about and that we had moved the phone so that the baby couldnt get hold of it. We told her that we wouldnt be paying for these charges. I popped the baby into the taxi which was waiting to take us to the airport. She then got security to keep us in the hotel because we had questioned the charges whilst the baby was sitting in the taxi on her own. Shocking! The receptionist repeatidly told us that there were no managers in the hotel (unlikely i feel with a hotel of this size!) and she said that the receptionists were not allowed to cancel the charges only managers. She explained that the security would hold us in the hotel until we paid.....meanwhile my baby continued to sit in the taxi on her own. We paid the charges and left.  On arrival back in the UK disgusted by this all and to update the hotel of my daughter being hospitalised as a result of their ""accidents"" we tried to call Sara the Public Relations person at the hotel in order to discuss getting a refund of these additional charges . We spoke to her 3 times and she told us she would call us back- she didnt. We called 7 additional times leaving poilite messages for her which she never called us back. She has our money now so why would she care what has happened?  I understand that my daughter is an unusual case but I did everything in my power to make this a positive experience (calling ahead checking with manager etc). I completely understand that accidents can happen but I certainly do NOT expect to be stung with huge laundry bills (and random telephone bills?!!) after the accidents were on their side.",Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6190NQmike
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Trish.UK wrote a review May 2018,40,New and nice.,Haven’t experienced all inc before and thought maybe food would be disappointing. Pleased to say it was excellent. Varied and well cooked. The desserts were to die for and different everyday.  Room on the ground floor was very nice spacious new wet room. Small terrace outside into the garden. (Upstairs rooms only have a tiny balcony ) pleased we had downstairs. Only two floors and they were designed so all room doors opened into the outside not corridors.  Hotel was quiet as it was around a 15 minute taxi ride (200 Dm.)  Into the heart of Marrakech. In an area slowly being developed.  There is a very nice Hamman spa in their sister hotel a few hundred yards away this is a 5star hotel and supposed to be adults only but it had only just opened so we guessed they were commissioning it as several children were snacking in the foyer.  We had absolutely no complaints with this hotel and if you want to be away from the city bustle it’s a good choice.,Date of stay: April 2018,,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/superirons
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Ricardo wrote a review May 2018,20,Far from a 4 star resort,My partner and I booked a 10 day stay here mid May. We both lead busy lives back home and considered the price to be fair - for such a resort on paper/from the photos and reviews..  We however feel borderline ripped off...    It is not a 4 star resort I have stayed at 3 star 4 star and 5 star resorts. At very best you would call it 3 stars.    We booked 10days here to relax and unwind. You sadly do not get any peace and quiet. There is only one pool here and from morning through the entire day there is a speaker system right around the pool which pumps excessively loud music...  There is also an MC who shouts over the music..and when we asked on our first day could they turn the music down at all I was close to laughed at and told Sir you have booked a 'club hotel!' - no where was this stated? Well looking at the website and every description of the place it is really not billed as that..... That was the first experience of the customer care....    Anyhow... If you move to the end of the resort where there are sun loungers away from the pool you are next to a main road instead and behind the wall you have constant traffic beeping etc. and genuinely NO quiet down time at all.    At night there is a guard dog in the corner of the resort chained up to a metal pole who runs round in circles (poor thing) clanging his chain but also barking crying and howling at the several stray/wild dogs that are the other side of the wall doing the same... The resort is in the middle of nowhere on its own on waste ground. (20mins shuttle bus to centre) and whilst on the subject of animals there are farmyard animals in a run not far from the pool which you can imagine the smell of the ground floor corridor (as cute as they are)......    Main problems we have that were not resolved...  - Sewerage smell constantly in the bathroom which is unbearable when it rains!  - Shower blocked and flooded the whole bathroom and hall of bedroom. Maintenance came out to resolve and when we tried to use the shower again we had the same problem?!....  (We are currently sat waiting on our patio outside for it to be unflooded and unblocked again. 2 hours after reporting the flooding happening again)... Not to mention this is our second room change of our stay!! Lilly to have to move AGAIN.  - no peace and quiet or privacy considering we wanted a romantic break.  - beds are also two singles pushed together again not ideal if you're wanting a romantic break!!!    Food was very average in quality and taste very much canteen style with repetitive choices and clearly uneaten food mixed in with next days dishes with a few more onions!    Some of the staff were lovely but the whole place is lacking any guidance from management and making this place anything like advertised. Which is a real shame.    Really don't bother booking.... We feel completely dissapointed and misslead waste of only it holiday this year. Really needs assressing.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardwW9877KJ
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Fabio A wrote a review May 2018,50,A good place to stay for sure!,Me and my girlfriend enjoyed a lot our vacations in this hotel. It's 15min (by car) away from the city center wich is good because the center it's really crowded and noisy. You have a free shuttle to the city center that you have to book in the reception. There's some tours that you can book there. The room it's good and confortable and always very clean thanks to the houskeeping team the pool it's good as well. The snack bar in the pool offers you very options of food and drinks. The buffet and breakfast was good had some typical food and intercontinenal as well. They have a souvenir store wich is very handy. The reception staff was very helpfull. And they have a restaurant that you have to book previously...and this one was a BLAST typical marroc food and that chocolate cake desert with ice cream on top...amazing! We loved it. Special thanks to HASSAN!!! He was very kind to us and very helpfull! :)  Things that could be better: the animation team was good and funny but if you don't speak french probably it's not gonna be the same. The bar in the lobby could had more options specially food or at least more drinks. And some staff in the buffet or even in the pool sometimes were always looking at us a little awkward because we were trying to relax a bit in our vacations.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Samantha B wrote a review May 2018,50,Amazing!,I can't fault this holiday experience at all.    I was a little dubious about the location as it seemed as if we were driving further and further away from civilization but I couldn't have been more wrong. It was also a short drive from the airport no more than 20/30 minutes.    We arrived well before check-in and was asked to wait in the lobby for about 15 minutes while they prepared the rooms. We literally ordered drinks and then taken to our room shortly after. Staff were so helpful friendly and courteous. I'm from London and communicating was never an issue even though they didn't speak fluent English. The room was beautiful and spotless and cleaned daily. The AC wasn't working which made it chilly in the morning/ evenings (we traveled at the end of January) and they moved us to another room without complaint.    The restaurant had an array of delicious fresh food and drinks - all inclusive.    Hamza the tour guide was a delight and very informative and there were plenty of things to do with a free return shuttle bus from point A to B. Everything was steeped in history culture and colour and the locals were nice (there were the odd few who took bartering in the souks to the extreme but it was an interesting experience nonetheless).    This has been my best holiday this year and will definitely visit again.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,steve e wrote a review May 2018,40,Nice quiet weeks holiday,Firstly the staff at this hotel are amazing if it's the waiting bar or animation team are probably the best we have come across and we have travelled substance a lot . Nothing is to much for them.  Hotel  It is in the middle of nowhere so if you like to take a walk outside this may not be for you.  We had a ground floor room which meant we could have private sun loungers outside our room only interuption was by the gardeners  It did face the road but there was little noise  It was very quiet 10 O'CLOCK and only 6 sun loungers taken what a please tell change  The Al a carte well worth a visit but you need to book  Pool far to cold for me and yes lots of flies but in past holidays we have been plagued by wasps so it's just a minor annoyance  Not a great place to socialise only 2 other couples here were English which was great for me as I am not very sociabe  Drunk and loud french tourists broke the peace and quiet on one day the cocktails are recommended  The music most of the time around the pool is fine until they do some activities can get a bit loud then  The food is good we are used to seeing rice pudding and veg for breakfast but the biggest problem for me was the inability to keep the food hot the food served in the silver containers with heaters underneath were usually fine but at the chefs station where they cook the meat and fish and eggs pancakes etc were stored on hot plates well warm plates unless you had freshly cooked food it was at best warm even the soup in the usual cauldron was not hot warm chips you expect in McDonald's but not here. It makes me think that the food is designed for our french friends taste not ours  The shuttle bus to the souk worked well and once again our visit to the square was great a must for everyone on balance really nice holiday but if they could sort out the warm food it would be classed as a great holiday venue  Well done to all the staff,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberystwyth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevee936
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,xlolz wrote a review May 2018,40,"Really good, but just not perfect.","First the bad stuff:  - English people seem to come last here. The hotel is very much catered more towards French speaking guests - when it comes to the hotel reception anyway. We had a mini drama when we arrived as we were given a twin room even though we booked a Double room. We went back and forth to reception and wasted over 2 hours to ask them to sort this out and they kept telling us ""Someone will come right now"" - when you're told this you'll wait to see everything will be sorted right because it should be over quickly?! Wished we hadn't wasted precious sun time that day. The final time I went to ask for the same update to be told ""They have already sorted it"" when I had just left the room 2 minutes before so there was no way they would have done it. In the end it emerged something was clearly being lost in translation and causing the confusion. Eventually someone did come to sort this out for us but only after finally speaking to Sara who was extremely helpful once I explained the situation. I just wish the receptionists had bothered to admit they didn't understand!    now to the good bits:    Location: around 20mins by car/bus to the main Square. Hotel provides shuttle buses everyday but remember to pre-book the day before. The bus was fine though punctual and comfortable. Personally after being around the craziness of the markets escaping the area was great and I liked being able to sunbathe by a nice large pool.  If you travel to the centre yourself ask the hotel to book you a cab. A grande taxi arrived for us and the price was fair. You will realise how fair if you need to get a taxi back to the hotel from the centre when they charge you over double. Haggle haggle haggle!! We got them down to the same price the hotel got for us on the way out (100DH to the Majorelle Gardens)    Food/Drink: Food was great lots of tagines vegetables salads and your average chips rice for the boring folk! (sorry if that's you!) I was in healthy-food heaven and never went hungry! However the layout of the buffet restaurant was very canteen-like bright and loud so it made dinner times feel a bit rushed.    Make sure you book a night in the A la Carte restaurant - it wasn't made obvious to us at all that it was even an option but we knew from reviews that we had this available. I think had we spoke French it might have been made more obvious.    Facilities: Pool is lovely! Although sunbeds definitely seemed to fill up by mid-morning which kind of ruined my lie-ins in desperation to tan! Previous reviews said sunbeds weren't a problem but I guess that was just a quieter season. There were a lot of kids when we were there which was unexpected as it didn't seem to be a school holiday. In hindsight I would probably have preferred an adult only experience.    Gym is ok - dumbells up to 25k. some upper body machines no lower body weight machines and no barbell    Room: Lovely. Once all was sorted we really liked our room. Bed is very firm however by the last night I was starting to miss my softer bed at home. The window into the bathroom is a weird feature and could have done without being included. It's not nice to use the loo wondering if your partner might walk past the window!    Overall for the price we paid for a 5 night all-inclusive I have no major complaints.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,code5 wrote a review May 2018,10,Nightmare 12 km away from the center!,You want to check in on May 1st at 2.30 pm? Expect just one person at the reception (as always....there is one simple rule: one person or no one) and a waiting time of 30 min to finish formalities and the key for your room with a nice view to a gas station and a noisy road.  The hotel is heavily booked. I think 200 adults with 300 small children one restaurant for all. Take your ear plugs if you’re looking for a noise reduced meal as these kids will do what they like. At the pool you will enjoy loud terrible music  relaxation is not important. You can do so at home. And don’t even think to go tongue reception. Cue up and enjoy the waiting time.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,SLO2BET wrote a review May 2018,40,"Good Potential, a few little tweaks needed.","My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights all inclusive in April 2018. We booked for a good price through Fleetway Travel who dealt very efficiently with our travel arrangements.    It was an early flight out & after a slightly delayed transfer we got to the hotel which is in the middle of nowhere at midday. The check in time was 3pm so we had to wait around for 3 hours. However we could get a drink & have some lunch. The check in was smooth & the staff were super polite & helpful.    This hotel only opened in Oct 2017 so everything is modern & new which is great. The hotel is situated on a compact site which is a good thing. The rooms are spacious with an interesting design where a person in the bedroom can see through the shower & bathroom into the toilet which some might find a little intrusive. Just one channel for English speakers on the TV.    During our stay the hotel was only at 60% capacity so there was little queuing & plenty of everything to go round. Sunbeds were plentiful as was the food. I could see how the restaurant & pool could be a little overcrowded if the hotel was full which I was informed it will be from the first week in May through to September. I was told that the average split of nationalities staying at one time is 40% British 40% French & 20% Spanish.    All the staff are efficient & polite. The activity team try to get you involved in the activities & I certainly enjoyed my time more when I did. There are fitness classes an interesting darts comp water football French bowls & even a poker tournament. Bearing in mind they have a table tennis table adjacent to the pool I was surprised there wasn't a tournament arranged. Previous reports have suggested that the music round the pool was too loud but I didn't think so & I'm nearly 50. Maybe they have addressed this point. My main gripe about the pool area are the amount of flies. They are the normal type of fly that we get in the UK but about half the size. They are continually landing on you & really annoying but of course not dangerous. As there are so many staff at the hotel I would suggest that a member of staff goes round with one of those tennis racket style fly killers. This would solve the problem. On our final day the pool bar decided to put some extra food out on the bar for the guests. This was a nice touch by the staff but because it was not protected with a mesh type covering the flies were all over it straight away. We did not experience any issues with mosquitos.    The staff put a lot of effort into the evening entertainment but personally I didn't think it was particularly good. Maybe it will improve as the season develops.    The hotel offers a free bus shuttle to & from Marrakech town centre which takes about 25 minutes. Central Marrakech is OK in small doses. The locals spring out of nowhere & badger you to buy their worthless goods. This can be a little uncomfortable but ""When In Rome"" etc.    I can't really comment on the kids club but the children looked very happy when entering & leaving it.    Overall I enjoyed my stay & would recommend the hotel. I don't think a 2 week stay would be the way forward though as all the activities would be repeated & nothing else to do locally as the hotel is so far away from anywhere else.",Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLO2BET

We asked for towels for the pool and were able to leave the deposit in sterling £20 per person.  On the whole the staff were extremely friendly attentive and polite however the female receptionist could do with some pointers on customer services.  We were never disappointed by the variety of food available in the restaurant all the catering staff deserve a round of applause.  We used the free bus into the old town on a number of occasions and can not fault the service.

Downside was the disco music loader than necessary around the pool all day and evening entertainment mostly for the children.  Watch out when you first arrive when approached by a member of staff telling you how dangerous the town is and offering guide service that is not needed at a high price.

The indoor bar we had to wait to be served even though the staff weren’t serving anybody.  The food so far has been good with plenty of choice nice and hot and freshly cooked.  The rooms are lovely clean bright and modern. The wardrobe door fell off when we tried to hang our clothes up but we were assured this would be repaired within 10 minutes .  You have to pay a deposit of 200 dirhams for the pool towels which I think is excessive as we only bought 520 dirhams with us we shall be left with money at the end of the holiday which we shall have to end up spending at the airport.  I think the hotel has only been open since September so maybe these few issues will be sorted out in the future,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hove, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eady56

The hotel is modern comfortable & spotless clean the staff are amazingly friendly funny & very caring nothing is too much trouble they are on hand to please all the time & that includes all the staff!  The weather was perfect the swimming pool was so inviting the food was AMAZING!  Had fun with all the animation team & you would not believe the 'Lionel Ritchie' look a like....awesome guy!  The bedrooms are beautiful we were on the ground floor which led onto our lovely little patio we had a lovely bathroom had a fridge(my mate would have liked it filled daily with water so she always had cold water! Loll) I would have liked tea & coffee facilities as it is the 1st thing I want when I wake up....a cup of tea!  Only 2 little grips but apart from that we had an amazing time topped off with a beautiful meal on our last night at 'Patio & Lou' the alternative restaurant at the hotel!

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,KJ137 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Lovely Holiday,Have just spent 5 days at this hotel with my fiancé- it is a lovely hotel very modern and has everything you need. Rooms are large and comfortable with very modern bathrooms- hairdryer in bathroom and basic toiletries provided all the rooms have little outside balconies/terraces as well which is lovely if you want to read outside your room :) we were all inclusive which we were so glad of because it was so hot we drank so much water (in between the cocktails!) As it is outside the main city there isn’t much around the area except for a petrol station there is a little shop in the hotel but I imagine prices were cheaper at the petrol station. The Buffett breakfast lunch and dinner were very nice lots of variety and the dinner changes theme every night lots of fresh salads hot food and some amazing desserts! The pool is lovely to spend a lazy day at! However if you are looking for a lovely quiet lazy day by the pool- be warned that they do a lot of activities at this hotel which can mean that’s it’s quite noisy by the pool- they do water polo badminton etc throughout the day and crank the music up during these activities. They have a nice little pool for kids with slides etc and I did see adverts for a kids club as well. Main downside was you have to pay a 200dhs deposit for pool towels per towel- which then means your spending money is just sat at reception which we found annoying!  The staff are all amazing and so helpful! They really can’t do enough for you and are all happy whilst they do. The entertainment team really do try and get everyone involved and enjoying themselves.  There is free shuttle bus throughout the day which takes about 25 mins and drops you off in the main medina near to the Koutoubia mosque- you have to book into this with reception in advance. Get prepared to be pestered a lot as you go around the markets as everyone is on the sell! It was interesting to have a wander around and you can do this on your own- just be warned if you go at night stick to the main streets and square because we got a bit lost and had 2 lots of 3 youths try to go through my fiancé’s bag and steal stuff which was a bit scary luckily all they found was water bottles! We got a taxi back which cost 150dhs but we did have to haggle him down from 200dhs.  We did the Marrakech half day tour through the hotel which some parts were more interesting then others- you get to see the olive gardens Koutoubia mosque Kaspa mosque and the Saadien tombs and Al Bahia palace- a lot of it would probably be nicer if you explored on your own as the tour guide didn’t really add a lot of value.  Overall it was a lovely relaxing holiday but I think for us if we came back we would try the adults only hotel which is next door- just depends what you are looking for in a hotel seemed to be great for families or singles looking to get involved in activities.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KJ137

All the stay are super friendly and attentive from the entertainment staff to the bar staff everyone was amazing. The waiting staff are always on the look out to help you especially Abdelhafour he is so sweet. There was never a dull moment always something to do. The food and drinks available were the best couldn’t have asked for me!! The entertainment staff (Yassir Amine Johnny and Ayo) were also so good always keeping people upbeat and their shows in an evening were so funny and enjoyable! The best bunch of people :)    The hotel is such a good location outside the city so that you can relax away from the hustle and bustle but also can go and explore places such as the markets.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Macclesfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZakSF
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,sarahkarlo wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Amazing holiday 1st class,Arrived in Marrakech as a single parent with my 3 children slightly nervous travelling alone but within minutes of arriving at Be live hotel was made to feel very comfortable. All the staff are so friendly and great with kids. The animation team and mini club were superb Johnny yassir and the other guys put so much effort into the shows and entertaining the guests round the clock.  The food is unbelievable very high standard fresh and tasty.  There is a shuttle bus into Marrakech town centre takes about 20-25 mins  Did the quad and camel excursion that was unreal  Would recommend this hotel highly no complaints re the hotel but be prepared for a long wait at the airport coming into Marrakech filling out the entry forms and getting through customs....long process,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sawbridgeworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahkarlo

This was the perfect holiday for us amazing hotel so clean and modern. All of the staff were amazing and made you feel very welcome including the bar staff and restaurant staff. The reps around the pool would always be asking you if you wanted to participate in the day time activities. Amine and Johnny were both crazy and guaranteed to make you laugh. The boss yasir was very nice and made sure oh we’re all ok. The food and drinks were all so lovely and enjoyable.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,tgnarsi wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Excellent holiday,Stayed for 9 days and had a lovely time. All the staff are very friendly and happy. Rooms were spacious. Bathroom had a fabulous walk in shower. There was a glass window in the bedroom to bathroom wall. An excellent idea as it allowed natural light into the bathroom but the glass was clear and should be frosted to allow for privacy. Towels were big and fluffy.  Everywhere was kept very clean.  Large selection of drinks and cocktails. Dining room was set out nice with lots of choice of lovely food. At times it was very busy. There was a snack bar by the pool which cooked food to order. Plenty of comfy sunbeds.  Animation team worked very hardduring the day and were very friendly. They didn't hassle you either. Being a four star hotel belonging to a big hotel chain I did expect some professional shows in the evening but it was just the animation team doing their best.  The hotel is about 20 mins from the busy town centre. You can get a free shuttle bus which is a comfortable coach into town.  I would definately return to this hotel.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tgnarsi

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Experience706497 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Fabulous hotel,This hotel is beautiful immaculately clean and the staff are amazing! I've never felt the need to tip bar staff at all inclusive resorts before but I couldn't help myself on this stay.  Rachid and Yasmir at the pool bar are great bar men and always had a smile and a chat. Yaya and Kebir in the lobby bar were the same. All lovely lively guys. The animation team were great. Always trying to amuse people.  Yes the music round the pool could be a little loud but this was mainly when the activities were on so there were also quiet times.  The hotel is by a main road but I spoke to people on that side of the hotel and they said they couldn't hear the traffic.  Unfortunately there isn't much of a view from the rooms on ground floor just a wall but it didn't bother me. Not sure what the views were like from the upstairs rooms.  The food was always fantastic. I found something different to eat every day.  There was one issue with my room.... somehow there was a leak in the shower room wall and I think the water that was coming through was from someone else's toilet or a sewage pipe. The smell was awful. It happened twice unfortunately. Not sure if the same happened in any other rooms. Try to avoid room 2019 and see if you can stay in the rooms staying with 20 as that way you are away from the road.  I would highly recommend this hotel and will no doubt be back again.  Oh and the Monday night show by the animation team is the best. Never laughed so much!!!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Experience706497

The hotel is beautiful and they gave us a free upgrade when we checked in. The food is really good and make sure you ask for a mojito from Ismail they are fab! The staff are really nice especially the entertainment team. They made us feel really welcome. We met Johnny the first night and he was always super friendly and got us involved with the entertainment. Amine was also really good he is so excited about every activity and loves to socialise with the guests. His ability to talk to all the guests in their first language is very impressive and you will automatically feel very at ease and welcome.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Ian T wrote a review Mar 2018,50,A great hotel with lovely helpful staff,We had a four night stay and have to say that the Be Live Experience was delightful.  The staff were always friendly and helpful the room comfortable with a small veranda (we were on the ground floor) and bathroom very nice with large walk in shower (though have to say cannot quite understand the rationale of putting a window in the bathroom into the bedroom- if you go to the toilet at night you light the entire room up - very strange)  The meals were buffet style though waiters supplied water and any other drinks you might require. The food itself was excellent with a wide choice available.  Also you can book for a special Moroccan meal which is waiter service and in a different dining room.  There is a superb swimming pool which does not have a deep end so ideal for non swimmers a children's area and a pool bar which also does snacks (burgers and the like) at lunchtime.  There is entertainment both during the day and in the evening but we did not try it out so are unable to comment.  A shuttle bus runs daily to the Souk the first leaving at 10.00am and you need to book.  The Wifi was great and a bit of a bonus the tv in the room has quite recent films in English with Morrocan subtitles.  Loads of sunbeds round pool - pool towels can be obtained from reception but a deposit is required - either 200 or 250 dirhams.  So all in all a great hotel - recommended,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iant2000

I understand that the hotel has no control over the Sanikel/Jumbo Tours staff however I believe to avoid tourists having a bad experience; the hotel could do more in terms of vetting the reps.",Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l0vinglife2018

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,muzzUk wrote a review Feb 2018,30,Lovely & clean. Shame food & wine poor,Just returned from a 5 day break here. Feb 2018. Pluses are that its clean new and staff are very helpful. The beds are very comfy and the pillows amazing. The rainfall shower in the room was lovely and plenty of hot water. Rooms are a good size and have safes and fridges. Nothing in the fridge? No minibar. But they said I could take water back to the room if I wanted. No kettle or coffee maker. Largish TV with a couple of UK channels. I'm fairly sure the bar closed at midnight so not a 24 hour all inclusive and no room service. Apparently there was evening entertainment however we didn't see it.  However the food is terrible. Everything is left out too long and is cold. Meat is fatty and poor quality. Vegetables look lovely but had a weird taste. Not sure if it's the oil they are cooked in. Desserts are tasteless. Wine is rough. The tea box was never refilled and staff unable to provide new packets of herbal tea ( amazingly the bar beside the restaurant had loads??) the sushi was disgusting made with spam type meat. Coffee machines were fine. French bread was good. However we ended up on chips and bread by day 3 as food was so unappetising. And we had to ask for fresh cooked chips. The A La Carte was not much better. The mint tea is lovely.  Toiletries supplied are basic. Generic products and no hair conditioner. No shower cap etc.  The FREE wifi is fab. We watched Netflix in our room.  We took a trip to the souks which we didn't like at all. We were told to offer ¼ of any quoted prices. However we were marked quite quickly at the souks and found it quite threatening.  The horses that are being touted for carriage rides aren't in too bad condition but I never saw them fed or watered. However the horses used to transport goods around the city were in a terrible state. With sores around the harness being made to canter on the roads and looking malnourished and exhausted. Very upsetting.    Sitting in one of the terraces high above the square was lovely though and we also found a very nice cafe on the corner near the drop off point Cafe Kif Kif. Serving smoothies and veggie options. ( we aren't veggie but the cafe was nice)    Cigarettes are exceptionally cheap on the flight home. £28.50 for 200. On Ryan air. But they only stock Marlboro red & gold & B & H gold. They probably sell it on the way out too but I was asleep on the flight. And £13 for a litre of decent Irish whisky. /vodka/gin. I'm sorry to say I wasn't impressed with Marrakesh or the hotel and wouldn't plan to return based on this experience.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/muzzUk

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Cats-whiskers-Ludlow wrote a review Feb 2018,50,"Away from the bustle, an oasis of calm.","We've just returned from a week at the Be Live Experience and a most enjoyable week it was. This was our first time in Morocco and we certainly got our choice of hotel right. Yes it's not in the centre but I wouldn't expect a large complex like this to be - the central area itself doesn't have that much spare land! I suppose you have the choice - an older more ""authentic"" riad in the thick of things or a suburban oasis. As the centre is anything but calm uncrowded and peaceful it may not be the ideal place for a relaxed holiday with all the facilities that most Europeans would expect.  In fact the hotel shuttle obviates any need to be further in. The Be Live is situated on the main Fes road and the shuttle bus (five times a day very punctual) takes only between seventeen and twenty-two minutes to cover the six miles to the very centre. Hardly an ordeal - and complimentary too. That saves on taxi fares!  The main advantages of the hotel seem to have been well-covered elsewhere so I'll be brief. It's brand new and standards of hygiene are exemplary. This extends importantly to the catering facilities - we're ex-restaurateurs and we notice such things. The chefs are clearly at the top of their game for this type of catering and they work with top-class ingredients. Fresh fruit and loads of veg appear at every meal along with a varied selection of other items - you'll never be short of choice. And yes the a la carte restaurant is a must-visit: everything beautifully presented.  As most reviews agree the staff are what make this place - we must mention Lamrani Amine and Assou Mehdi of the morning shift and of course Hassan whose enthusiasm in the restaurant was matched by his showmanship. But of course there were so many others - everyone from the front desk to the cleaning staff were universally polite and helpful. What more could you ask?  So was everything perfect? Well there was ONE peculiarity which may of course not bother most guests: there's a high-level window between the bedroom and en-suite. This allows natural light into the bathroom but anyone using it does not exactly enjoy privacy! It does mean that we older night-time wanderers must use the facilities in the dark - putting on the bathroom lamps would flood the bedroom with light and may well prove unpopular with the hitherto-asleep other half. Still that's hardly a deal-breaker.  All in all this proved an excellent choice and we'd whole-heartedly recommend it especially as it was outstanding value - what more could you want?",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ludlow, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cats-whiskers-Ludlow

Hotel was lovely with attentive staff in all areas exceptionally clean and rooms are a good size with the most comfortable beds and bedding. Fridge in room and you can get bottles of water from bar or restaurant to put in for overnight. The food was varied well cooked and plenty of choice - we also tried the pool bar on a couple of occasions and the paninis and burgers were lovely we used the shuttle bus most days and would recommend that you book your times the day before as it sometimes became quite busy. The only negative was that we found the entertainment very amateur and dated however the bar area was a lovely area to sit in and the other guests were very friendly so we often sat and chatted to like minded holiday makers !

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Andy K wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Superb Hotel - Highly Recommended,We stayed at the hotel from 19th to 26th January this year and have to say it exceeded our expectations in all respects. From the initial welcome by the reception staff the friendly restaurant and bar staff (Hi to Khadula and Yahya) everyone did everything they could to make it a wonderful break.    As others have said the choice of food in the buffet restaurant was outstanding - probably the best of any of the hotels we have stayed in! Equally good was the food in the a la carte rstaurant in which we ate one night.    The rooms are well furnished and clean the grounds the pool and other facilities such as the excercise room are all well maintained. All in all difficult to find anything to criticise.    The only slight downside was the location mainly because we like to take a walk before the evening meal but there was very little to see and explore within walking distance of the hotel. That said it is only a short taxi ride to Marrakech or you can get there by using the free shuttle bus service.

There wasn’t as much choice as other hotels and unless you asked for more to be cooked we always found the food to be cold.  The a la carte restaurant was fantastic the food service and atmosphere was perfect although we were told we could eat there as many times as we like on arrival we were told they were only open twice a week.  The shop has all you need however it is very expensive.  The shuttle bus is a great free service the hotel offer picking you up on the hour at a time you request as the hotel is quite far out.

My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in January and were absolutely blown away. It was part of a deal from a well known holiday deals website and we arrived in Marrakech having done no previous research.    We had dinner one evening in the fancy restaurant and the service was top notch waited on hand and foot including bread and olives etc. Being part of the all inclusive package meant no hidden charges - we did tip afterwards!    Every evening we would visit the lobby bar for a few drinks before heading back to the room - Khoula was hilarious here and really improved our visit. Her vast knowledge of cocktails meant she was able to create fantastic cocktails for me (and sweet ones for my girlfriend!)    There is another bar outside that’s excellent on warmer days they had pizzas and burgers available out here.    There’s a lot of other information in the below reviews so I won’t go into much more detail but the hotels fabulous. New inviting and incredibly well staffed.

The food from the buffet were okay. What really annoyed us was that there were birds in the buffet restaurant and we found it very disturbing. We really enjoyed our dinner at the à la carte restaurant. My dad is vegetarian and the menu didn’t have any vegetarian options. However the restaurant made him a special meal. A shout-out to Hassan and Youssef who were very bright and provided us with outstanding service. What really made our stay memorable was the staff. All the staff were immensely friendly and always greeted us with bright smiles especially Mario and Amani. The performances on at night are themed we attended the Moroccan Show and really enjoyed it. One of my biggest concerns about staying in a hotel is the cleanliness. This hotel met my standards as I feel that the floor is washed everyday.  Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Margaret C wrote a review Jan 2018,50,A good friendly hotel,i have just returned form 5 days at the Be Live Experience. We found the whole stay very good The staff were always helpful. The hotel is still very new so obviously it suffers from some teething problems. If you found anything at fault it was promptly dealt with . Our room was very well appointed but we felt there should be some additional lighting in the living room would have been a bonus. Ours was 2 floor suite (with a mezzanine floor). this meant we had 2 fully fitted bathrooms which was a luxury.. In one review i see someone is complaining that there is a high level window between the living room and the bathroom and that interfered with privacy. If you wanted to look into the bathroom you would have to stand on a good height settee. What sort of friends/family do you go on holiday with if this is a problem?. It was too cool for us to use the pool but it looked most inviting well surrounded with loungers and a separate bar + snack counter nearby. Every thing is inclusive in this hotel which is great as you do not have any hidden extras to budget for. There is small collection of animals-sheep/goats/donkey/birds/chickens etcwhich is a nice touchand when the surrounding garden is mature it will all form a pleasant addition.There is one dedicated man who looked after it all who was charming. There is a courtesy bus that runs into town about 4/5 times each way every day with one return trip quite late so if you want a night out in the bright lights it can be achieved without using a taxi.These yellow vehicles are VERY numerous .I thought the selection of food was good and ought to appeal to most tastes There is also an A la Carte restaurant as well if you did not want the buffet selection.. The rooms were spotless and all the walkways.passages and terraces were washed every morning . There was a good selection of fluffy white towels changed every day and copious hot water. I felt it was a bonus to be well outside the noisy town-centre. It was beautifully quiet at night with great bird life around  I should be very happy to stay threr again,Date of stay: January 2018,,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaretC413

The positive is the hotel is new very clean tidy and the staff are very help full.  I am afraid everything else is negative - the hotel is of the motorway and traffic noise nothing near by the workmanship around the hotel is taky the food is bed and breakfast standardlthe entertainment is home made and could not be anyworse although the staff tried to the best of their abilities the atmosphere around the hotel is flat and boring the pool is freezing the sun loungers are facing a wall with taffic noise and the only way to describe this is Travel Lodge standard.

Al a carte food was delicious! We were all inclusive the drinks and cocktails were amazing as sometimes they can be rubbish at other hotels! Here they were the best cocktails! There is a gym which is very small however I feel it lacked facilities as unfortunately for us the weather was bad so no activities were on either and nothing to do. I think it will be much better when the sister spa hotel will be open too. They do have a free shuttle bus to the market which was good they had this service. The evening entertainment was rather cheesy however they made great effort and they also provided great dance classes in the day. The evening entertainment was in a conference room without a bar I feel it needed a bar or to be in a better atmosphere. Anyway to summarise I would definitely come back as the rooms are lovely very clean and well designed! Food great just cold and staff were excellent especially customer service. Thank you will see you again!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,essex uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caffcaff121

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,AnnieMac24 wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Excellent.... can’t wait to go back,I don’t usually write reviews but I had to write one for this hotel as we had such a fantastic time.  We stayed for 4 nights at the end of November we had a pool view room which had a lovely veranda with a table and two chairs.  The food was fantastic although not lots of choice but excellent quality and varied from day to day. I can honestly say the food was far better quality than a 5* hotel I stayed at in August. The French bread was always fresh and plentiful the homemade soup was delicious.  The staff can not do enough for you they clear the dirty plates quickly and efficiently kept the drinks flowing I would always tip for the evening meal a little goes a long way.  The main bar staff were superb the mojitos were on point and the strawberry pina coladas were yummy. The female lady behind the bar Houla? (Pronounced Howler) was brilliant always topping up our drinks before we finished. She definitely deserved her tips!  We had a problem with the maid not leaving enough towels as well but just rang reception and they were delivered in minutes.  The bathrooms are fabulous like a wet room spacious and they two different shower heads which was handy. The narrow high window through from the bathroom to the bedroom was an unusual feature..... some might say weird...? Especially when you have a pool view while showering.....!!  And now to the beds........ wow oh wow!!! I have NEVER in all my years of travelling experienced such a comfortable hotel bed and pillows..... the mattress had a memory foam topper I think it was even better than my mattress at home which is saying something as I’m very fussy about mattresses! The pillows were soft and full no lumps it was a pleasure to go to sleep...!  So I can’t recommend this hotel enough I will definitely be returning sooner rather than later.

Rooms cleaned daily and fresh towels. Extensive entertainment programme for adults and children.Well equipped gym. Lots for children to do including water parkplayroom and farm. Good security in hotel and police presence on roads around hotel. On outskirtsso Shuttle bus operating several times a day was welcomed taking us into the city centre.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Fleminpie wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Very chilling!,We're just back from a 10 day all inc' stay here; hotel is a new build and there are some outstanding works yet to be addressed - drainage design tweaks. Staff are the hotel are keen to please and there is a great focus on customer satisfaction. Few couples needed to move rooms and this was managed smoothly by Reception and front of house staff.  Rooms are extremely comfortable bit strange that there's a window panel in the main area which has the bathroom on the other side..and a glass panel in the bathroom which separates the toilet area aesthetic design maybe but possibly requires some frosting to offer a little privacy! Food at the hotel is amazing - quality and quantity this has to be one of the best 4 star hotels food-wise. There's such a range of food and no doubt all dietary requirements could be met - with a smile 😊Bar staff and Entertainment team do a fab job and do their best to engage the holiday makers but the entertainment room is set up like a conference event and doesn't lend itself to socialising as such unfortunately..  All in all a fantastic holiday and a bonus having the shuttle bus available 3 or 4 times a day - driver is very accommodating too - dropped people on route to the YSL gardens.  Rooms have loads of wardrobe space a free safe deposit box a small fridge and a hairdryer 👍🏻  £20 deposit for towels which is returned once you return them ...All good definitely go back there 😉,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fleminpie

Our room was a good sized clean double room on the ground floor with patio facing the gardens and pool. It was comfortable and quiet.    Food was first rate! An extensive buffet with wide choice of food ranging from Morroccan style to European style. Very tasty and plenty of it.    The staff were without exception very friendly helpful and looked cheerful.    The hotel ran a shuttle bus into the centre a number of times a day and this worked well for us. The hotel is about 20 minutes by shuttle from the centre.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,loubaz wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Could be so much better,We arrived to a lovely looking new hotel. We were hungry and thirsty it was lunchtime but no cool refreshing water was available whilst we checked in. Checking concluded our room was not ready but 3pm is advertised so no worries.  First impressions of food were good but the range on offer relatively small And boredom set in early on. The breakfast in my opinion was the worst meal. Mostly cold food that should be hot. I did speak to the head chef but to no avail. The fruit is lovely. The pastries are good but repetitive and a lot of cold pastry custard is used.  The room was spacious we had room 1017 and it was cleaned everyday but the staff kept forgetting to leave towels! Also a smell of sewage emanates around the whole ground floor but the area around our room seemed particularly affected.  The drinks for all inclusive were good lager in a large plastic wineglass was a new one on me though.  The swimming pool is attractive and easily accessed by shallow steps. There is also a splash area for children with slides and sprinklers.  The animation team do the evening show and it is beyond amateur but they are enthusiastic and energetic.  Just a warning do not go out with the team after they have finished work unless you are prepared for a completely different culture that has few rules when it comes to spending your money.  Finally we had a good cheap holiday we did not go hungry although we did have upset tums. We did get ripped off for £60 by a staff member so as I say keep your wits about you.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Keighley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loubaz

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Julesy1961 wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Very relaxing stay. Excellent Food.,We stayed for a week at the beginning of November on an 'all inclusive' basis. The hotel had only been open a month but has started well. The staff are extremely helpful and nothing is too much trouble. Our first room had a slight sewage smell and they quickly moved us to another room. The main buffet restaurant caters for all tastes and there is a huge selection of good quality food. We also ate in the speciality Tapas restaurant which was okay but not as good as the main restaurant. There is a lovely main pool (a little cold) and a nice one for the kids too. Plenty of loungers round the pool the music can be a bit noisy but staff will turn it down if asked. Room was excellent TV doesn't have many English channels however management said more were to be added soon. The entertainment staff work hard to provide various activities and shows  The hotel is situated in the Palmairie area and there is nothing worth walking to fortunately there is a free shuttle bus that goes regularly into Marrakech (20 minutes away) which is worth experiencing. We were fortunate the weather was superb during our visit. Definitely worth taking a day trip to the Atlas Mountains which makes a very enjoyable day out.  Overall this hotel was very good primarily due to the very helpful and hard working staff.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julesy1961
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,fromKenttoabroad wrote a review Nov 2017,50,"New hotel, great positive staff",Sitting approx. 6 miles from Marrakech this hotel for us felt very relaxed and restful. Meals were very good the entertainment staff laid on various classes (aquagym dancing stretch spin to name a few) as well as evening entertainment. From time to time the music did blare out but was usually at the right level. All staff were brilliant those at reception extremely helpful and in the area where food was served. If staying several days there is the possibility to eat at the tapas restaurant. Here my sole criticism advice is not to bother. You get a menu and limited choice. Sadly I would not call it tapas. The hotel runs trips into town several per day to a square by the souks. We went to the YSL garden and museum well worth the trip. There is also a shop in the hotel where you will probably get a better price for some items than in the souks. Sadly the pool heater was broken but should be fixed soon. There are a number of animals at the hotel to see chickens a donkey sheep goats and a number of birds.

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Brenda B wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Holiday,This is not a complaint about the hotel or the staff it’s mainly about the guests who allow their children to run riot particularly in the dining room. The pool area is not spacious. The sun beds are too close togetherIn the hotel info you are led to believe it’s a romantic place for couples this statement is a bit far fetched with too many children running around unsupervised it will be difficult to find a romantic spot anywhere.  I would also like to add this hotel is not disabled friendly. There are no hand/grab rails on the steps leading to the dining room or at the pool.  The rooms are modern with comfortable beds. No tea or coffee making facilities in rooms which was disappointing.  If you are looking for a relaxing peaceful holiday this hotel is not for you.  Although we made the best of our weeks stay at the Be Live experience we do not envisage making a return trip.  I hope those who own and run this hotel appreciate the hard work the staff carry out each day usually under very difficult circumstances.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendabF4042CM

Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Suzanne G wrote a review Oct 2017,10,Buyer Beware!,An expensive mistake. This was to be a special occasion and upgraded our room to a Duplex only to find the view from the room looked over a busy and noisy motorway. The tv and air conditioning not working fire alarm system capped off and the room consistently smelling of sewerage.  The lift was out of action for five days out of our stay. This new hotel has obviouy beeen built in a rush and the finishings were more like a Travel Lodge not a 4 star hotel. The staff appeared amateur and pedestrian only reacting when we lost our temper with numerous excuses and little action to our complaints. Their senior management and owners arrived during our stay but were too busy to see us.  The Rep was very good at taking our money for the trips we booked but regularly never got back to us even when he promised he would when we put our complaints to him.  Totally surprised no facility to use debit or credit cards or obtain cash at the hotel. No facilities in the room for tea and coffee and this could not be obtained between the hours of 11pm and 7am and then only from the restaurant which you had to fetch yourself - no room service. No Night Manager.  Felt very cheated by the whole experience which was expensive.

A few teething problems after first week of opening but they were listening to what people were saying. Food was good but a little bit on the cold side as the hot plates were not heated the food was kept warm by a light so recommended that a microwave was put in place. Also food was good but not labelled as what it was so had to ask. This was being rectified on our last day as they did start to label the dishes. The grounds and pool were great but obviously not fully established yet. Gym not fully completed but some things were in use. I think the were also building a spa but that was just a shell. I hope they will be able to operate to their full potential when the hotel is full as it was only about 30% and they struggled with serving dtinks.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hove, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J6908XFlisas
Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Rob D wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Superb new-build hotel,We arrived October 14th 2017 just over a week after the hotel opened.    My partner and I were on holiday to celebrate our birthdays and booked through secret escapes.    As to be expected with a new opening there were finer details still in the making (such as lawn still in development areas of the hotel still undergoing discreet maintenance etc). This didn't affect our stay but left me thinking how wonderful the grounds will look in 12 months.    The food was exceptional and service from all staff was amazing really warm and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble.    Having read reviews about 'loud music' around the poolside we were a little apprehensive. It's now obvious these were exaggerated. The atmosphere was lively without being intrusive with the music selection fitting the time of day. Upbeat during the day and relaxing during the afternoon/evening. There was entertainment throughout the day.    On the topic of entertainment I'd like to say a big thank you to Mario Yesser and the rest of the team. Who made our stay even more enjoyable through dance classes caberet karaoke water aerobics quizzes French bowls and table tennis. You really can see the hard work these guys and girls put into the preparation.    While I'm saying thanks I'd also like to mention the grounds staff bar staff receptionists maids kitchen and waiting staff and the nurse (had a burn from the quad biking) as they all came together to provide a fantastic service all-round thank you and hopefully see you again in the future!

If I had to have a bad point of the trip and be picky I would suggest them having a drinks menu at the bar and sometimes the food bar closes early so does the drinks bar but they can improve on this when they see the review.
