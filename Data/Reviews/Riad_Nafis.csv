Riad Nafis,ledinghams wrote a review Feb 2023,50,What a gem!!,We have just returned from 6 days staying at this delightful Riad. Right from the moment I booked (via Booking.com) Yazin went out of his way to be helpful by offering to organise an airport transfer which we were relieved to have accepted as it would have been tricky to find it under our own steam.

Riad Nafis,Sana F wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Gorgeous 4 star Riad with a 2 star price! A+,What a hidden little gem! We literally walked in and asked if there was a room because the Riad we had booked was really poor quality and we were desperate to move out. The host Yasin was so welcoming and hosted us very graciously instantly arranging the rooms for us. The staff is so helpful and well trained. The massive pool in the centre is beautiful! We had our Christmas eve dinner in the riads little restaurant and it was a very romantic evening. They put on the fire place played excellent jazz music and served us some delicious home cooked meal. Also the price of this Riad is far cheaper compared to others for how gorgeous the Riad is.

Riad Nafis,Sara A wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Very Nice,This is a small Riad located down a winding alley off of the main road. It’s about a 15 minute walk to the jemaa el Fna (the main plaza). We thought the location was very nice. The rooms are pleasant and well card for. Everything was clean and the staff was lovely. They do have a nice rooftop with comfortable furniture if weather permits. Breakfast I thought was delicious. If you are not accustomed to a Riad it is like staying in a large house so it’s a little more cozy than a regular hotel. The only real problem that we had was the water pressure one evening and that only happened once. Overall this felt like a very good value and a very nicely place to stay.

Riad Nafis,Peter G wrote a review Dec 2016,20,The hotel is a different style than advertised,After 1 night of 5 booked I advised the Manager that we were leaving the hotel. The reason for our departure is that the hotel did not fulfil our expectations and was a different style of venue than advertised. The hotel while quaint does not have some facilities that we consider standard such as TV the clothes rack beside the toilet is very much not to our liking and hotel access through lanes is intimidating particularly for my wife and also hard to find. Neither can taxi’s find the hotel. Further we were disturbed during the night by the water leaking through the ceiling onto our bed.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ferney-Voltaire, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2234LKpeterg
Riad Nafis,Kimmie K wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Marrakech Hospitality,The Riad Nafis staff took care of my husband and I from the moment we landed. We were anxious about visiting a new country and the put us at ease which made our short weekend very enjoyable. They arranged a taxi pick-up for us and met us in the street when our taxi arrived to walk us down the alley's to reach the Riad. This is a typical city with streets and signs that are easily read on a map so that was very helpful to us or we would have been lost immediately.  Check-in was very easy the room was comfortable well cleaned had soap shampoo and even hand towels ( which I forgot to pack this once).  They booked great excursions for us at reasonable prices. Even though there was a bit of a language barrier the man helping us was very patient and went out of his way to help however he could. We were glad they served breakfast here so we wouldn't have to wonder around for food in the morning. I enjoyed my first experience with Moroccan mint tea and now I love it.  The location can't be beat! I specifically picked this because of other reviews. It is about 7-10 min walk to the souks and restaurants. Depending on traffic it can be a 5-10 drive to/from airport and walking/pick up tours were easily done from here. Our stayed felt like we were welcomed into someone's cozy home and the staff really made our visit to Marrakech memorable!,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fort Walton Beach, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmiek386

Riad Nafis,evasan2rini wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Fantastic Experience,Just got home from 3 wonderful nights here. Our room Beldi was beautiful and spotlessly clean I loved our walk in shower! The riad is situated right beside the royal palace so there are police everywhere which makes you feel very safe and this little gem is within less than 15 mins walk from Jemaa al Fna where all the excitement is.  We contacted the hotel before arrival as we were coming in the evening and requested dinner. They had a lovely man waiting to pick us up on arrival who served us an amazing tagine for dinner in their lovely relaxing dining room. The roof terrace was fantastic both for breakfast and just relaxing after an exhausting day haggling at the souks!!! All the staff made us feel incredibly welcome and Abdou was brilliant giving us great tips on what to see and do and how to get around.  Be aware the call to prayer starts at 5am so if you are a light sleeper maybe bring ear plugs. Personally it didn't bother me at all it only lasts a minute or so and I just fell straight back asleep in the amazing comfortable bed. Also I found the wifi really good and never an issue. We will definitely come back!,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evasan2rini
Riad Nafis,ruky_khanom wrote a review Oct 2016,40,FAB 4 Nights.. couldn't have been better,My stay here was more than perfect. The hospitality was second to none. I can not thank the staff there for welcoming us soo much.  Once you arrive you are greeted with a welcome drink a map and a full explanation of where everything is. If your like me and a bit tired cos of your journey then do write everything down because you will forget later 🙈.  I can not fault anything with the staff or the riad. Once again thank you sooo much.  Notes...  This is a riad so please expect a little noise from families and children outside.. but this was minor only saying if you dont like noise AT ALL.  You will aslo hear the call to prayer every morning perfect time to ensure you dont miss your prayers.  There is no bodna/ lota so take a spare bottle or potty wipes.  Location...  Just ten minutes walk away from the main sqaure of jama el fna once out of hotel out of alleyways at the main archway point just turn left and walk straight you will see Koutibia mosque so walk towards that and hey presto your there. I spotted a KFC on route to where there is the main stand for all the Grand Taxi station.  Taxi to airport can be arranged via the hotel or just get a taxi and this is 70 DHS for a small taxi.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Luton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruky_khanom
Riad Nafis,wanderlustpalmer wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Home away from home,We felt so welcome as soon as we entered the Riad. Abdou was super lovely and took the time to show us a map and explain Marrakech. We were next door to the Kings palace and the security was high so we never felt unsafe walking to or from the Riad.  Highly recommend you eat breakfast each morning here we even had dinner twice during our stay because it was so good.  The souks and main square is no more than a 10-15 min walk (depending on the route you take).  During our stay we organised a hot air balloon ride and massage....incredible!  We could not be happier with our stay at Riad Nafis. The staff truly made our stay most memorable so kind and helpful.  Take up the offer of the airport pick up and drop off it's worth the money and you are taken straight to the entrance of the alley closest to the Riad where you are met by one of the staff.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustpalmer
Riad Nafis,Tim D wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Nice Journey & great trip,Riad Nafis is a nice and gentle place for some peace and quite. Abdou is a kind & honest bloke even with a pricing error he honoured the rate we paid with the promotion offer. Breakfast was great and if you want a true moroccan experience you should try this.    The place is via some side streets 15/20 mins from airport and next to the Kings palace. Security is very good there.    It is walking distance to the busy square and key sites.    I would recommend to give this riad a visit and you will only know yourself whether you have had a good time no matter which review you read. some pics attached...,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Darlington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timd860
Riad Nafis,Michelle G wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Staying here is a MUST if you're visiting Marrakech,I immediately felt welcome and comfortable when I entered the Riad. The Riad is located in an amazing location close enough to the important sites such as Jemaa el Fnaa but far away enough from the hussle and bussle. The Riad is also located in a very safe area and I never felt uncomfortable or weary.    Upon arrival Abdou showed us a map of Marrakech and explained where to go what to do and little tips here and there - I have never received such attention to detail service before this. Throughout the stay all the staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating and were always more than happy to help out and would do so with a smile. The Riad even has a booklet of excursion they can help you book so you're in good hands in regards to site seeing.    I have told all my friends and family about Riad Nafis and I would urge anyone to stay here as it will make your stay in Marrakech unbelievable. I can't wait to book my next trip back to Marrakech just so I can stay here again. If this review does not convince you to stay here I don't know what will.    My last tip is that you MUST try the food in the Riad at least once because Nayema is an incredible cook and you'll be sorry if you give it a miss.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F2854EBmichelleg
Riad Nafis,Scottmch wrote a review Jul 2016,50,AMAZING!!!,My daughter and I stayed in this Riad in late May and it is an absolutely wonderful hotel. It is a bit hidden but within very easy walking distance to the main square. Aside from how nice the hotel is the staff made our entire stay. They were extremely gracious kind and were always available if we needed anything. The breakfast was also top notch - so happy to look forward to in the morning. I would absolutely give it 5 stars. I would also advise anyone to take their offer to arrange for pick up at the airport. Upon arrival Marrakech can be a bit disorienting and Riads are often located within twisting alleys in the old city. So I would recommend having them pick you up so that your transition to the city is made easier.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bellingham, Wa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottmch

Riad Nafis,Jamie S wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Calm and beautiful riad with a beautiful rooftop garden,We initially booked in their sister riad but there was a technical problem which needed repair so they informed us ahead of time and offered to transfer us to Riad Nafis (or refund our booking). To make up for the changes they also offered to upgrade us to a better room. All these turned out to be such a good thing! Riad Nafis was calm very beautifully decorated and it has a very beautiful rooftop garden where we enjoyed breakfast every morning. The staff there was absolutely adorable!! When they knew that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary they baked delicious chocolate cakes and offered us mint tea to celebrate the occasion with us. We were extremely touched by they gesture.

Riad Nafis,andykk wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Nice little hotel with good service,"The hotel is clean and tidy we've been there for 3 days with their twin room which is located on the ground floor. Got a nice rooftop with some tables and sofas for a relaxing afternoon sunbathing. Tried the dinner there which is good value but remember to let the staffs know you wanna have dinner there at least on the same day's morning. The hotel facilities is acceptable while the polite & helpful staffs are what made this hotel better than the others.  The location is about 10 minutes walk from the ""square"" and quite close to a few palaces and tome.

Riad Nafis,Ramani R wrote a review May 2016,50,Wonderful stay at Riad Nafis,My partner and I travelled to Marrakech for the first time last summer and stayed at this absolutely gorgeous Riad.    It was an oasis of tranquillity in what can be a hectic and during August an incredibly hot city. It is walking distance from the central square and hubbub but far out enough to feel you're not constantly in the thick of it.    What I particularly liked was its authenticity. It's a small riad of around 4 rooms with a small central pool and so with only a small number of guests you can really relax. Our room was beautiful and we had a lovely big bathroom. The Riad is so peaceful and after arriving back from a busy day of sight seeing it's such a pleasure to step into a calming and gorgeous smelling (spa aromas) place you can call 'home' for a few days. There is a great roof terrace and as there are so few guests we often had the place to ourselves with a fantastic view over Marrakech.    As mentioned in other reviews it is the staff who make it the ideal getaway. The manager was brilliant throughout and was constantly around and ready to be of assistance if we needed him. When we first arrived he took us to the roof terrace with tea and traditional pastries and showed us the map of the city. He then arranged for another member of staff to actually take us around the city which was a great touch as it allowed us to settle in a get our bearings.    Just a word of warning the Riad is also very close to the airport which we hadn't realised and unfortunately meant we got completely ripped off by our taxi driver.    Finally the breakfast we received each morning was perfect home baked bread traditional pancakes and an array of condiments with lovely coffee and fresh orange juice to wash it down and set you up for the day!    I would highly recommend Riad Nafis and will definitely return in the future!,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/940ramanir
Riad Nafis,Tom21386 wrote a review May 2016,50,Best hospitality we have ever experienced!,For sheer friendliness and hospitality the staff at the Riad Nafis are the best we have experienced in any hotel we have ever stayed in. They are genuinely passionate about delivering a great service and went beyond expectations to ensure we had a fantastic stay.    This started from the moment we booked when we received a personalised email thanking us for our booking and offering to assist with any questions or services we required. Despite arriving late in the evening we were welcomed at the hotel with mint tea and pastries and given a useful briefing on the location of the Riad and nearby attractions.    I had my 30th birthday during our stay and the staff prepared a delicious 4 course meal for us including an ice-cream birthday cake with my name on it which we shared with the staff and other guests it was so big! We had a wonderful evening and I can't imagine having that kind of experience in an anonymous hotel.    The Riad is close to the main square the Palaces and Tombs and other attractions but tucked away so that it is away from the main hustle and bustle of Marrakech. It is clean comfortable and in traditional Moroccan style.    If you want all-inclusive anonymous luxury removed from Morocco this place is not for you. If you want an authentic (but very comfortable) Moroccan stay with delicious food tea and hospitality we would highly recommend this place. In fact we are already thinking about coming back!,Date of stay: May 2016,,"Taunton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom21386

Riad Nafis,Beta4David_Shelley wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Really Really Good,Calm retreat in hectic Marrakech. Small and friendly place - especially the staff who are all lovely and very engaging. Rooms are all nicely laid out. You are next to the Royal palace so security is good too. Yet you are not far from Jamaa el Fna 5 to 10 minute walk. Breakfasts are good brought up to the roof top terrace if you like and why ever not?? You can also partake of an evening meal so long as you order it in advance preferably the day before and they will ask you what you want. The warm 'salad' as a starter is good and of course the tagine or tangier of whatever variety. The call to prayer at 5am can be a little loud but I could easily sleep through it and when not it was charming.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beta4David_Shelley
Riad Nafis,Laura I wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Oasis of Calm in Marrakech,Riad Nafis is in a really convenient location it's about 15 minutes from the main square from where you can access pretty much all other attractions. The walk is somewhat off-road (as in the path has been dug up) but actually quite easy to navigate once you get your bearings. It's about 15 minutes by car from the airport so really convenient.    The staff are incredibly friendly and can organise meals transfers and excursions if asked. We were given a really comprehensive introduction when we arrived which was very helpful.    Breakfast was excellent it felt very traditional and really sets you up for the day with a good sugar hit. Our room was very nice if a bit cold (the weather was quite poor so I doubt this is an issue in the summer). The bathroom was very nice and the room was very clean. Terrace is lovely and the view is stunning pool looks nice but we didn't get the chance to use it.    One bit of advice: you aren't provided a key/code to the front door when you arrive so when coming back you need to ring the doorbell or knock. This in itself isn't an issue however we were in the Nomad room which is a twin room downstairs and were woken up around 2 am when the doorbell rang. If you're a light sleeper I would suggest you pay more and choose a room upstairs.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraI170

Riad Nafis,truemaster77 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Authentic Riad with super helpful staff,I stayed at this riad for 3 nights in January and I have nothing bad to say about it. The check in was anytime and breakfast could be arranged for anytime as well. Upon arrival a staff member took as aside provided a map of the medina and explained where everything was relative to the road and gave us tips on how much can fare should cost to different sites. The area is very secure due the the proximity to the royal palace. There is no tv in the room and no restaurant but at the price point that was minor because for me vacations are to be spent exploring new cities. There is an excellent restaurant at a nearby riad (villa des orangers).    The staff are understanding of English but are much more comfortable conversing in French or Arabic. It gave me the opportunity to practice my French. Distance to the airport is about 10k. The one difficulty with his riad is that it is located in the medina so transport will pick you up and drop you off at the medina gates and then there is a 5 minute walk through a labrynth like path to get to the front door. Everything within the medina is walking distance from the riad.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Pickering, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truemaster77

Breakfast was very good continental selection of items. It was laid out on the roof terrace.... which had amazing views over the nearby mountains. Its very close walking distance (10 minutes - we were slow with a pushchair!) to the djma el-fana square. The bathroom was basic but in a very traditional morrocan style - simple but very clean.

Abdul Rehman even went on his own and bought tickets on our behalf for our next day train trip to Casablanca to help us in avoiding any last minute rush - this is truly five star customer service and really made us enjoy our first trip thoroughly.

Because of this it is also very safe as there are numerous soldiers and guards up and down the ally that leads to the riad. We enjoyed our stay. Our room was comfortable and the breakfasts were delicious. They also arranged airport transfer for us which is good because the riad is very difficult to find.  The free wifi is not good. I had to sit in the bathroom to get a signal.  Unfortunately when we were departing (at 5 a.m. to catch a flight) their credit card machine suddenly didn't work. We had to run around to find a bank machine in the dark and take cash from my credit card (big added expense) and give them most of the Moroccan money we had left.  So by all means stay here and enjoy but make good and sure their credit card machine is working at the beginning.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mossylog

When we arrived at the airport we were met by a driver arranged by the Riad to take us there we were then met by Niema who was very welcoming kindly showed us around the Riad and served us Mint tea and homemade Moroccan treats on the gorgeous rooftop terrace. Niema spent some time with us pointing out our local sights and recommended things to see. The suite and entire Riad was beautiful extremely clean and well maintained and a perfect base for the week. The Riad is fantastically placed next to the Kings residence walking distance from the famous Jamaa El Fna and other sights including the Tombs Jewish quarter and both local palaces. We were served a continental buffet breakfast every morning on the rooftop. We had two evening meals at the Riad - the food was amazing & the best local dishes we ate in Marrakesh!

Staff are very friendly always there to answer any queries and Hisham went through a map with us when we arrived to point out the main areas to visit and was happy to ring and book us a massage at a recommended spa when we asked.    The location is ideal it is down a narrow alley way which appears confusing at first but if you get the airport transfer with the riad they will meet you from the car and show you the way they then show you the best way to walk into the town centre which is just a couple of minutes. I felt safe throughout something I was concerned about as we are two 25 year old girls the riad is next to the Kings residence so security guards are placed along the walk to the riad    We stayed in the twin room which was very clean great shower with comfortable beds and good air conditioning which was a life saver in the 40 degree heat! The roof terrace is beautiful with sun loungers and seating areas in sun and shade good views. Breakfast is served up here which is lovely. Wifi worked well especially on the terrace. There is also a small pool on the ground floor it is very small but we enjoyed sitting on the side dipping our feet to cool off! On one day we felt like we wanted to relax by a pool as it was so hot and many hotels allow non residents to use the facilities we chose the Sofitel which cost around £25 for the day.

Riad Nafis,afrieg wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Beautiful and relaxing oasis,The staff (especially Hisham) was extremely accommodating and friendly; they truly go out of your way that you are 100% comfortable and have everything you need. On my first night they had a little party for the guests to celebrate the 5th year in a row of winning a TripAdvisor award which I could not attend. They saved the food (various salads) for me which I had the following day for dinner -- delicious. Finding the riad is a bit tricky as it's at the end of a dead-end ally in the middle of the old medina but this adds to the charm and privacy as it's secluded a bit from the busier/louder main streets. It's also next to the royal palace so I was never worried about my security as you have to walk past the royal guards on the way to the riad. Would stay here again no question!,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled solo,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afrieg

Riad Nafis,Delinblack wrote a review May 2015,50,Superb,My wife and I have been staying in the Riad Nafis since the 12th May and leave tomorrow. The staff have made it a really enjoyable stay. They have been really attentive but unobtrusive.    Nothing is too much bother and things like meals are served when it suits you.    Breakfast is nice. We had dinner in the Riad and they asked us what we liked and that is what they made. The main course was a chicken tagine and was delicious.    The sun terrace and small pool are very comfortable as is the little lounge. If you want a nice relaxing place to stay with nice facilities and great staff check out Riad Nafis you will not be disappointed.

Riad Nafis,lolly5249 wrote a review May 2015,50,A hidden gem in the heart of the Medina,My friend and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was absolutely lovely (this riad was recommended to us by other friends that stayed here and loved it). The location is perfect- a 5 minute walk to the main square and the souks. It's a bit hidden away in maze-like walkways so do what we did and take pictures of front doors to guide you back on the first day as you will get lost! It is not a place that you would just stumble upon if walking around.    The room was clean nicely done up and there were a lot of nice Moroccan features (lanterns etc) to make you get a feel of Marrakech. The beds were comfortable the massive shower was hot and powerful and there was air-con in the room. I've never ever stayed in such a friendly place with such attentive staff and such a personal touch it was amazing! The manager even picked us up from our taxi and walked us to the riad at about 2am when we arrived then served us Moroccan tea and had a chat whilst checking us in (cars cannot drive right up to the riad so arrange an airport transfer with the hotel and they'll get you from door to door). He also escorted us to the nearest main street so we could get our bearings the next day. We were given a lovely breakfast on the roof terrace each morning and the staff were all very friendly always asking if we needed anything what our plans were and whether we'd had a nice time each day. There was also lots of advice on hand about the local area which was very useful.    The pool was an added bonus as a quick dip (be warned its pretty cold!) cooled us down after being out all day in the sun then the roof terrace with loungers towels and sun hats was a tranquil place to hang out and relax.    It is VERY reasonably priced and great value for money. We were so impressed by the service provided by the staff that we were recommending it to other tourists whilst we were still in Marrakech! Both my friend and I absolutely loved it at Riad Nafis we felt very safe staying here and highly recommend it to others thank you so much to all the staff for making our stay so wonderful!,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolly5249

Riad Nafis,Johnny M wrote a review Apr 2015,50,An oasis of calm in a buzzing city,Had a short break here at the beginning of last month. Everything about the Nafis is wonderful - it's location the room the rooftop terrace the views the hospitality the tea and when we ate in the food and local wine. The service was fantastic and the staff couldn't have been more helpful - arranging transfers to and from the airport and excursions into the Atlas Mountains and to the coast at Essaouira. Marrakech is not a city where you get hassled any more in my opinion nor ripped off. One tip - always have plenty of cash as invariably you'll want to or feel obliged to make a purchase and in a place with credit card facilities. Morocco felt very safe warm and welcoming to this pair of travellers visiting for the first time in early Spring. The Nafis contributed much to that.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VKJ

Riad Nafis,unravelingrivers wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Amazing!,This Riad was perfect. The location was nice the beds were comfy the food was great and the staff and manager were beyond accommodating. I travelled to Marrakech with my sister and she got sick during our stay. As she has allergies I was a bit nervous about finding medication that would not be dangerous for her to take. I asked the hotel manager Hicham about it and he promptly delivered some medicine to our door.  I also made the mistake of purchasing a mirror without any real regards of how I was to get it home. Hicham took the mirror and went to DSL and priced shipping fees and then looked around and found a bag that I could fit the mirror in that I could purchase for a lot less than shipment. All of this without accepting the tip that I offered!  I have traveled quite a bit but there are still often times that something unexpected comes up and I start feeling a little nervous about finding my way about. These little things often seem big when you are in unfamiliar places but with Hicham and Kevin and the rest of the staff I felt surrounded by warmth and a little less further from home.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Fayetteville,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unravelingrivers

On stepping inside we were in a beautifully appointed world of tranquility. The manager Hicham and his staff were attentive to our every wish and to ensure our stay was memorable - it certainly was. All the food we were served was authentic Moroccan and of the highest quality and we considered it to be far nicer than anything on offer in the city. The breakfasts were fabulous and the time taken to enjoy them on the rooftop terrace really started the day off well. The roof terrace also had sun loungers with towels and large straw hats provided (Essential).

Riad Nafis,c r wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Very good service,We had a long weekend - 4 nights - at the Riad Nafis. The Riad is hard to find - taxi driver had no idea - and can be reached only on foot. The hotel itself is lovely with rooms arranged around a courtyard. Our 1st floor room was very clean with a comfortable bed and en suite. We had our breakfast (yogurt pastries coffee orange juice eggs) on the roof terrace which is extensive and furnished with tables and chairs and sunbeds and offers a view over the rooftops. We also had dinner one night in the hotel (meals need to be ordered in the morning) which was good with interesting beetroot appetiser.

Riad Nafis,LizzieN wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A beautiful riad in the heart of Marrakech,We stayed 4 nights at Riad Nafis. Hicham and the team made every effort to ensure that our first visit to Morocco was memorable indeed.    The riad is beautiful and considering its central location it is incredibly peaceful. Our room was very comfortable with a wonderfully spacious en suite shower room.    We booked the airport transfer through the riad which I would recommend and we received a tremendously warm welcome from Hicham followed by a wonderful evening meal which we had booked in advance.    The following morning was warm enough for breakfast on the lovely rooftop terrace. Hicham spent time explaining the local area and outlining trips we might want to take. We were incredibly lucky to be shown many of the well-known sites of Marrakech by a knowledgeable and charming guide Mustapha including the beautiful Majorelle gardens.    The following day we took a trip to the Ourika valley and had fun scrambling up the rocks to see the waterfalls. It probably helps if you're fit (which we're not!) but we managed nonetheless. Our third day was spent in Essouira a very picturesque fishing port with a fascinating history - would definitely recommend 'Chez Sam' for a great lunch.    A small word of caution; Hicham recommended a restaurant for an evening meal which unfortunately we didn't find. If anyone approaches you offering to 'help' you find the way beware! However the following evening we had a tremendous meal at Le Foundouk just north of the souks.    Our final meal was on the rooftop terrace at Riad Nafis. Wonderful food and charming service as ever from Kamal.

Riad Nafis,Xxx wrote a review Feb 2015,50,VERY HIGHLY recommended.,The Riad Nafis is an absolute gem - a haven of tranquillity on the edge of the medina. It is beautifully decorated and very comfortable (taking mint tea under the rooftop pergola or in the lounge was a perfect way to recharge the batteries between forays in to the souks). Even more importantly the staff are very welcoming and friendly. In particular we would like to praise and thank Hicham the manager. He could not have been more helpful. One evening we were at a restaurant on Djemaa el-Fna when without warning I had a seizure (the first in several years in spite of taking anti-epileptics). My husband rang the Riad to ask for someone to meet our taxi and help us back to the Riad. Instead Hicham came all the way to the restaurant and physically helped get me to the taxi and then to the Riad at the other end. What a hero! We were/are so very grateful.  I must also praise Abdul the chefs cooking. We made a reservation to eat there the first evening. Having told them what we didn’t eat/like he then chose the dishes for us. It was a great introduction to Moroccan food – everything was delicious and included things we may not have been adventurous enough to order from a menu. We ate there again our last evening and were similarly impressed.  Our main advice to anyone staying here would be to ask the Riad to organise a taxi from the airport. Like so many buildings in the Medina it is not possible to get a car particularly close to the Riad. Having arranged the transfer Hicham met our taxi. Without that I really don’t know how we would have found the Riad.  We will definitely be returning to Marrakech and will definitely stay at the Riad Nafis again.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norfolk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetZ5097QV

Every room has it own design which makes them so unique special and cute ;o)  Rashid (Manager) and the stuff there is very helpful and kind. They welcome you on the terrasse with a The a la menthe and Rashid then talks you through Marrakech especially Medina shows you places on the map where you have to go and recommends you dinners. Which is not usual to be honest going to a Hotel and the Manager takes such good care of the guests.  The Riad is very well located it is 5min walk to the Koutoubia Mosque and let's say 10min to the Jemaa El-Fnaa square.  I would definitely recommend to everyone to book a Pick up from the Airport to the Hotel otherwise its Mission Impossible to find the Riad. And just to don't have the stress when you arrive there with finding a Taxi dealing a prize etc please book a pick up! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  If you are looking for a cute quiet and charming place in Medina then Nafis is definitely recommendable.

Very small Riad and that makes it unique and special. We also pre-booked a dinner and asked to be surprised with the menu and we were! Tagine salad and fruit for dessert.

A plain door belies the stylish oasis of calm beyond...and we were greeted with hot sweet mint tea by Rashid who welcomed us to our 'home' in Marrakech. We had also pre-booked dinner for our first night which was served on the roof terrace - delicious Tagine salad and fruit. All the Nafis staff were lovely and all very attentive. The rooms are simply furnished but straight from a style magazine set! The beds were extremely comfortable and we all slept well.

Rashid was always there to help and advise a wonderful thing when you are in a new country. Every evening before he left he took time to come to the terrace to say goodnight.

How wrong we're we on entering we were met by hachim with such warmth into our ' home ' and felt instantly at ease we were shown to our amazing room we stayed on the first floor the decor was luxury and the view of the pool was superb.  On having a peaceful nights sleep we were met by Rachid the general manager who gave us a general tour and told us about the history of Marrakech and things to do as it was my birthday! Breakfast was whenever we woke up and it consisted of breads pancakesjams yoghurt and tea and coffee and lovely fresh orange juice which was lovely. Marrakech is a busy bustling hot city so it was fab to return home in the evening to chill and have a shower and rest in such a great riad. The service was 5 star they couldn't do enough for us! We would definitely recommend a stay there so authentic and genuine.  A lil tip in Marrakech haggle with prices and some cabs are after a quick buck ! we found a fantastic cab driver who was reasonable his telephone number 0610765278 ( cannot remember his name unfortunately ) whenever we rang him from anywhere we were he would be there to pick us up and take us to our next destination and back to the riad and didn't charge over the top prices.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mp289

Riad Nafis,Trip Educator wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Peaceful Solitude in Hectic Marrakesh,Let me start with the general manager Rashid. When was the last time you personally sat with the general manager of a hotel upon check-in and were served a complimentary mint tea to sip on while tasting a variety of local treats? And did that same general manager give you a tour of his luxurious hotel and provide you with a map and suggested itinerary on what to see in the city you were visiting? Then when you checked out did the general manager help carry your luggage to an awaiting taxi? Didn't think so!    But Rashid and the entire staff at the Riad Nafis will make your trip to Marrakesh wonderful! You'll have a great breakfast promptly served upon request on the rooftop terrace while watching the stork give himself a bath on the minaret a couple of blocks away. The location is terrific - within the medina (old city walls) and next to the Presidential Palace but away from the never ending noise of the Jemaa El Fna. It's a moderate walk to everything in Marrakesh you'll want to see and easy to find your way around thanks to Rashid's directions and map. When you return home you'll leave the energy of the city center behind and get a good night's rest.    If I ever return to Marrakesh I'll happily stay at the Riad Nafis where service comes first!,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,MESA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966TomH966
Riad Nafis,Stephj1981 wrote a review May 2014,50,Beautiful Riad and 5 star service,Riad Nafis was an absolute gem in an amazing city. I read lots of reviews before our stay and thought to myself that nowhere can be this perfect but riad nafis is even better than perfect.    We arrived late and were greeted at the airport and taken direct to the Riad. I would recommend this as the riad is tucked away in the narrow streets of the medina and could be hard to find on your first attempt. Upon arriving at the riad we were shown our room. A beautiful twin bed room with air con and good shower. We had pre booked dinner and were shown around the riad and enjoyed a delicious 3 course meal on the roof terrace. The service was first class and the food was one of the best meals we had during our stay in marrakech.  We were also served a lovely breakfast each morning on the roof terrace a combination of fresh fruit yoghurt fresh bread and pastries. Just what you need to start the day before you head into the hustle of the city.    The riad is approx 10minutes stroll from the main square. We found it useful to use the Koutoubia Mosque as a guide and we never got lost (apart from in the Souks when the stall holders deliberately send you in wrong direction by saying some directions are closed- all fun though!)    Upon our return to the riad mid afternoon we spent a few hours on the sun terrace unwinding before heading back to the square for dinner in the evening.    Staff at the riad were extremely helpful and kind offering advice and sharing best places to dine etc. They were extremely polite and made our stay extra special. Fresh towels daily and they helped us make the most of our stay they also booked a horse and carriage to collect us from riad and take us to the jadin majorelle. It was also lovely to share a mint tea on the roof terrace with them they really are genuine people who care for their guests.    We found that we were the only people to be guests in the riad for some of our stay it felt like home from home pottering around the building up to roof then down to our room (although I can only imagine having such a beautiful home!)    I would definitely recommend this riad for anyone travelling to marrakesh. Amazing place.

Riad Nafis,Thompsons92 wrote a review May 2014,50,A wonderful stay at Riad Nafis,Home from home. Rachid and team gave 100% to ensure we had a memorable holiday. We arranged a collection from airport through the riad- we were worried as flight was delayed but no need- collected and taken to door if Riad( recommend you do this). Made welcome as soon as we arrived. Lovely rooms very clean and comfortable towels changed daily. Breakfast taken on roof terrace- plentiful and delicious. We also ate at the Riad for one evening- highly recommend wow the food delicious and as usual service with a smile. The Riad is about a 15 minute walk to the square- we got a bit lost but all part of the fun. Rachid provides lots of information and recommendations. It was our 25 years wedding anniversary and a lovely bottle of wine (and a beautiful letter that made me cry) was left in our room. We were waved off with tears in our eyes- we were sad to leave our friends behind. Don't hesitate to book this Riad!

Riad Nafis,Hniki234 wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Great place to stay!,We couldn't have been happier with our stay at Riad Nafis! It was very clean the rooftop was cozy the water temperature was great and the water pressure was great. (We had a room with a shower.) The staff couldn't have been more friendly or more helpful! It was an easy walk from the riad to the main square.    We contacted Riad Nafis and scheduled our airport transfers and excursions/tours without any trouble at all. The tour guides that Riad Nafis recommended were top notch as well.    The only way we'd hesitate to stay here again would be if we couldn't have a room with a shower. (Some rooms only have a tub with a handheld spout.) We're shower people and do not like baths so that'd be our only block to staying here again.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Louisiana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hniki234
Riad Nafis,shaggyshoo wrote a review Mar 2014,50,wonderful oasis in marrakech!,I cannot say enough wonderful things about this RIad. From the moment we were collected from the airport until the second we bid farewell to the manager we were treated like old friends. The rooms are very clean and beautifully decorated and we enjoyed having a delicious breakfast and relaxing on the rooftop terrace which had amazing views. Seriously though this Riad was so peaceful and calm providing a welcome contrast to the bustle of the Djema el-Fna and all the excitement going on outside. I would recommend this Riad to anyone!

Riad Nafis,TASNEEM_JAIGIRDER wrote a review Mar 2014,50,A peaceful haven away from the chaotic noise,This was our first holiday with our ten month old baby. From the moment we entered we felt a wave of calmness and peace surround us. The ambience of the place was set by the soft music playing in the living area overlooking the pool.    We stayed there for 5 nights and didn't see any of the other guests apart from our first morning. It felt very intimate and just like home away from home. We had access to the kitchen 24hrs a day. This was necessary to make up bottles for our baby etc.    Rasheed the hotel manager really made us feel at home. Unfortunately for me I was very ill one day during our holiday. But Rasheed called a Dr for me and after a few shots I was fine. I was really looked after well by the whole staff there. Not only this but my son was entertained by everyone whenever he started crying.    We stayed in the junior suite located on the ground floor. The room was really romantic. The riad itself has all these gorgeous little details that make it amazing. It's a very traditional riad which makes it so exquisite. Even the doors to the rooms are lovely.    We regret that we never managed to have dinner here as we were always out in the evenings but we loved our breakfast everyday. Fresh pancakes biscuits and cake accompanied with fresh orange juice amazing jams yoghurt and tea or coffee.    This riad is situated very closed to everything. In fact we never needed a taxi. Everything was walking distance. On our first day Rasheed showed us how to get to the main road and back. We would have got lost otherwise. We made several trips to jemaa el fna (the main square) in a day as it was only 15min walk away.    We also visited an art museum and Bahia Palace which were again walking distance.    My favourite part of Marrakech was the shopping!!! The souks and stalls are just amazing. It's annoying to haggle for everything though. But you get the hang of it after awhile. Also neither of us speaks Arabic or French but we managed to get by somehow as many of the locals speak English.    I really enjoyed our trip to Marrakech and would love to return again one day. And if I did I would definitely book this riad again.,Date of stay: March 2014,,LONDON,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TASNEEM_JAIGIRDER

I emailed before our stay to arrange airport transfer and a trip to the Atlas Mountains they were very fast and efficient at answering my emails and booking this for us. The breakfast is great and we had dinner on one night which was delicious definitely recommend this. On leaving we decided to get a taxi to the airport ourselves Rashid walked us to the road and got us a good deal with the taxi driver which we really appreciated we felt very at home at riad nafis and will recommend to anyone we also hope to visit again sometime.

We were then given a short and helpful introduction to Marrakech by Rachid. The Riad is in a really convenient location just a 10 minute walk to Jemaa el Fna square. We would advise you book airport transfers with the Riad as it can be difficult to find first time the prices are very reasonable.

Riad Nafis,mmmaryx wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Incredible hospitality,Me and my friend stayed here February 2014 and we absolutely have no regrets.    While my friends and I are generally budget-hostel seeking types but I'm North African and know first hand that it pays to go a bit further on the stay chain for safety security and cleanliness. Especially as a woman traveler.    My brother and my dad had been to Morocco the previous summer and stayed at Riad Nafis' sister location in Marrakech Riad Al Badia. They praised the staff and hospitality and were excited about the location in the center of it all. When booking I lucked out the other riad was booked but was given a room at Riad Nafis for a very fair price.    Our room was spacious and spotless the bathroom was beautiful with plenty of hot water & good pressure (things I often take for granted till I am traveling).    Rachid & Hicham were both great hosts and unbelievably helpful from our bags recommendations to eat helping us book our trip into the sahara (desert majesty- if you were wondering is the way to go!) to just being kind and friendly.    The breakfasts were fresh and delicious (carb/gluten heavy for those of you who are wary of those things) and we sat in for dinner on our last night which was so filling and absolutely delicious. Great in house chef Naïma!    The airport pickup provided by the Riad is definitely more than you would pay for in a cab (but you would have to haggle relentlessly with the driver of course) but was so seamless and easy especially getting off a long flight or hurrying to get to the airport - I'd highly recommend it.    Oh and the wifi connection was great if you're into that sort of thing!

Riad Nafis,MuditaAshteadUK wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Home Away from Home - 6 Star Hospitality.,"It feels like you are staying with your dear friends or relatives when you are staying at Riad Nafis. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave they take care of everything and create beautiful memories of holiday and time spend there. For these attributes I award them six stars as this is exactly what I am looking from my holiday.    I choose Riad Nafis on basis of past reviews for my Marrakech holiday and made booking through Expedia. For my excursions and day trips I then opened a line with them 30 days advance of arrival all my mails were promptly replied. I also booked a day trip to Atlas Mountain  a guided tour of Marrakech and Dinner on First night with them and it was all arranged without hassle.    As advised earlier by fellow travellers a pick up taxi was booked from the airport ( cost Euro 24). This is a MUST you want to start your holiday peacefully and without stress. We were welcomed with mint Tea all the directions were provided.The staff (Naïma Najat Karima Hicham Rachid & Laurent) are excellent attentive but not intrusive they did all they could to make us welcome. There are only five rooms we stayed on the first floor and took two rooms one with a shower and one with a bath and both were equally good. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and bedding quality is on par with any good 5 star Hotel.    A continental breakfast (Orange Juice home made yogurt pastries Crepe's etc.) is served WITH SMILE on the roof garden weather permitting or in the Lounge and is of good quality.    The location of Riad has Pros and Cons  on the plus side it is in old city 10 mins walking distance to the all the tourist spots on the Minus side some travellers expecting a posh location may find the entry walk to it from the main road a bit downmarket. However once you enter the Riad and appreciate the character and the service it makes up more than for that one negative aspect.    One meal at the Riad is recommended to appreciate fine Moroccan cooking and comes at reasonable price. The staff will be happy to provide you recommendations in case you want to venture out.    We would like to Sincerely Thank - Naïma Najat Karima Hicham Rachid & Laurent for creating beautiful memories for us which will stay with us for the rest of life and whenever we will think of Marrakech we will fondly think of our time spend at Riad Nafis.

Riad Nafis,tomas A wrote a review Jan 2014,50,An oasis of calm within the hectic bustle of the Marrakesh medina,"We stayed at Riad Nafis for a week and we could not have expected a better service. From the moment we organized our car to reach the Riad (highly recommended) to the moment we left and were accompanied by Rachid and their driver all was absolutely fantastic. We have been granted by Moroccan pastries and a sweet mint tea then we have been given a short but precious introduction to Marrakesh and to the local usages what makes you feel far more comfortable when you arrive first time. Marrakesh is a huge theater fascinating but extremely busy and coming back to the Riad was just a bless. The girls Karima and Najat were always very kind and careful and the ""must"" : have a dinner at least once at the Riad. The food is absolutely delicious a real treat of home made genuine Moroccan Cuisine Naïma is the best chef we enjoyed the food during our all stay. On duty at night Ismaïl charming with a great sense of humor is just a pure delight.

Riad Nafis,Erwin T wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Best Place to Stay in Marrakesh,Before I booked our stay in this riad I made sure that I read previous reviews. One thing I noticed right away are the responses written by the riad staff on the reviews. They sounded very caring courteous and respectful towards their guests. As far as I could tell it is the only riad that responds to reviews on TripAdvisor. It was a sign that they truly go above-and-beyond on customer service not only during the stay but even after. So I did a little bit of experimentation to determine the level of customer service before our stay. A few days before my wife and I left for Marrakech I emailed the riad and requested for airport-to-hotel transport and for options on sightseeing tours. Laurent replied within a few short hours confirmed our transport and listed our options. So right in the beginning I was already impressed by the responsiveness. So I completed my booking knowing that my (4-months) pregnant wife and I would be in good hands during our 3-night stay in Marrakech.    Upon arrival in the afternoon we saw the driver with the Riad Nafis sign. After a 10-minute van ride through the medina he parked on a busy street and walked with us to the riad. Pre-arranging this transport is definitely a must-do for first-timers in old cities like Marrakesh that has numerous alleyways that do not have names and are not necessarily on a map. We were greeted by Laurent and his staff welcomed us with tea and pastries and showed us around the riad. The place is as beautiful as the pictures shown here on TripAdvisor and elsewhere maybe even more. I think there was only one other couple who was staying there at that time and so the riad felt really intimate and special. We felt at-home in an exotic location. Another great thing is that we ordered our dinner there on our first night. Served as a 3-course meal our tagine dinner was home-cooked plentiful very delicious and romantic. The meal was a fantastic way to cap off a 30-hour journey from the US and a superb way to regain our strength for the next day's city tour.    Laurent arranged for us a full-day tour of the museums and sites with a local guide named Moustafa. I was so happy we did a full-day as opposed to a half-day because we really maximixed that day. We got to see all the museums we wanted to see within the medina got to hear all the inside scoop--history facts/fiction appropriate tipping--from our guide and got the best bargains in the souks. That marketplace is a maze. There is no way a first-timer can efficiently navigate through the souks without a guide. When we got back I braved the relaxation pool at the center of the medina. Like in most non-heated pools once I dipped my body below my shoulders the water became very invigorating. The bath tub in our room was small for me so the dip in the pool was the next best thing to a shower. Plus I listened to soothing Morrocan music from the adjacent lounge area.    I hope this review will help future travelers in deciding where to stay in Marrakesh. I sincerely recommend Riad Nafis as the best place for their service hospitality safety cleanliness and unique Morrocan experience. If given the chance to visit Marrakesh once more I will surely stay at this riad again.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Alta Loma, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErwinT

Riad Nafis,aubin785 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,"Wonderful Riad,fabulous Marrakech",This is a perfect place to stay!  It is close to the Medina & a pleasant walk to all the central areas. The Riad is just as previous guests have described it is a perfect haven of tranquility. It is spotlessly clean & nothing is too much trouble for the smiling and attentive staff.  Importantly they will make certain that you have your bearings & can find your way back they will advise you on managing the inevitable offers of guides and shops to visit! They are truly interested in what you would like to do & will offer practical advice.  The food is marvelous especially the breakfasts enjoyed on the roof terrace. Relax & enjoy an evening meal there too.  If you would like some Henna ask at the Riad Karina will make it a beautiful experience.  I would really recommend contacting Laurent before you arrive to arrange taxi pick ups it worked perfectly and would be really difficult otherwise.  If we have the good fortune to be able to return to Marrakech this is where I would want to be it is comfortable well located with fabulous staff and gives you a real feeling of connecting with the city that you could not get in a chain hotel.

Riad Nafis,pongotravels wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Don't stay in a big chain hotel - stay here,We stayed at Riad Nafis in September for 5 nights (sorry for posting this review late) and it was amazing in every way. Please don't be afraid to stay in the old city - it was a totally safe place to stay. Other people we have talked to afterwards regretted staying out of town.  After booking the Riad we contacted Laurent to sort out taxi pick up (highly recommend) and depatures a meal on the first evening and quad biking. He responded to our our queries and sorted everything out for us at a reasonable rate.  Upon arrival at the airport our taxi driver was waiting for us. A short walk from the taxi brought us to our Riad. The pictures do not do it justice - it was like walking into an oasis in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. They took our cases showed us round the Riad gave us tea and pasties and generally made us feel relaxed and at home and that was even before we saw the room.  The room was fantastic (Junior Suite Saltana) beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean (like the whole Riad).  We wanted to start exploring and were walked to the main road and shown where we were in relation to the main square - an easy 5 minute walk. We did get lost loads of times in the medina but it was always easy to find our way back to the Riad. The people are all friendly and happy to give directions (for some small change).  You must book a meal at least once in the Riad. We had a vegetarian meal and it was the best we had whilst there - sat on the terrace watching the sun going down. We just felt bad that we could not eat it all. Naima is an amazing cook. The breakfasts are also wondeful. To end a hot dusty day with a dip in the pool was lovely.  Everything about this Riad was perfect but the main thing was the staff. Nothing was ever too much trouble (the quad biking they booked was a fantastic day and a must). They are all so proud of their Riad culture and city and it really showed.  We will be going back there next time we are in Marrackech.

Riad Nafis,Spruce912 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Immersion in the Medina,Leaving the taxi at the gate next to the wall surrounding the Royal (Residential) Palace and walking five minutes to this riad is to enter a different world of small traders selling food clothing and other goods children kicking soccer balls women in traditional dress hustling along with baskets guards at the palace and even motorbikes in the narrow lanes. Then through a big wooden door one enters a private quiet world where the first sight is the swimming pool filling the space of the courtyard. Inside the staff is eager to fulfill every need and to make one comfortable. The rooms are nice sized and spread over two levels. There are stairs and it is a pleasure to report that the stairwell is wide and the stairs evenly placed. An excellent continental breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace with the amenities of a table cloth and table napkins. The only less-than-enthusiastic things I can say are that 1) the rooms (I was there six nights and stayed in two rooms) are dark and poorly lit and 2) while the location is good Moroccan taxi drivers and others are confused when they are asked to take the passenger to the gate of the Royal Palace because there are several royal palaces one not far away; showing the spot on the map is useless too because Moroccans are not familiar with maps.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Decatur, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Spruce912

If it’s hot you can refresh yourself    Riad Nafis was our last hotel in Morocco and it couldn’t have been better!

Riad Nafis,annewhite74 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,The ONLY place to stay in Marrakech,We can't thank the staff of the Riad Nafis enough for a fantastic stay at your Riad. Everything was just perfect and the location is excellent with clost proximity to the old city with all of the charm of a lovely home within the ancient walls. Our group of 4 adults and 1 child commented many times that we felt like Kings and Queens staying here. We really didn't want to leave. The decor is perfect as well as the suites we booked. The breakfast is a very nice traditional Moroccan breakfast with yogurt coffee tea jams and the Moroccan version of crepes/pancakes all served on the beautiful terrace each morning overlooking the city and the stork nests! Make sure to ask for their fantastic mint tea as well. The staff met every wish arranged reservations at wonderful restaurants as well as massages at a beautiful hammam and hooked us up with our favorite tour guide ever Mustafa. (Be sure to ask for him if he's available.) All were arranged at very fair prices for the quality.    HUGE TIP: Put away your Google maps as it will NOT find you in this city. Instead relax and let the staff take care of every desire including airport transfers. We didn't book a transfer to the hotel but I believe this is a MUST. It is difficult and overwhelming to say the least upon your arrival to find your way around in the Medina as it's mostly small dirt roads that are not reachable in a car. It's hard to believe in this day and age that correct maps do not exist of Marrakech but this is the case. We made it safely from the airport but I cannot stress enough that you must use the hotel. It's cost effective and safe.    Again thank you to Rashid and his staff for a wonderful vacation and memories we will never forget.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annewhite74
Riad Nafis,Christopher W wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A wonderful stay at a beautiful Riad,From the moment we contacted Laurent to arrange transfers (highly recommended) to the moment we left Rachid and the team could not have done anymore to make our stay memorable for all the right reasons. We were told on arrival that the Riad Nafis would be our home for the week and it truly was.  Breakfast was served at a time to suit us (which changed daily!) service was attentive but never overbearing and the riad was a welcome haven from the hussle and bustle of the medina. It's sometimes all about the small touches that make a big difference to how a place feels and that was definitaley the case.  Would recommend at least one meal at Riad Nafis as the food was exceptional the best we tried in Marrakech and the experience of eating on the roof terrace at sunset was very special.  The city itself is a pretty crazy and intense experience but in the nicest possible way. Expect to be hot and dusty on your walk back to the riad dreaming of taking a dip in the cool pool before lounging on the terrace and claiming bragging rights on who haggled the best discount at the souks! Yes the doors don't have locks and some of the rooms don't have a stand up shower but that is all part of the charm and we felt very safe more like being a guest in someone's home rather than staying in a faceless hotel.

Riad Nafis,Betty H wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A safe Haven in the midst of the medina,The Riad Nafis truly is a safe and great place to stay. I am so glad we chose to stay in a riad as opposed to a hotel as the atmosphere is so friendly and they take care of your every need. They only have the six rooms so you feel like family with everyone that stays there while you are there. They even took the time to prepare breakfast for us at 4:00 in the morning as we needed to catch an early morning plane. The medina is busy but staying at the riad was peaceful would highly recommend.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lethbridge, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BettyH352
Riad Nafis,Andy n wrote a review May 2013,50,"Delightful oasis, staff very friendly and attentive, hard to find",Arrived late at night around 21:00 took a taxi from the airport but the driver didn't know the address. Managed to get us quite close but had to ask a young lad the way and unloaded us at the end of an alley - luckily 2 more youths showed us the way (for a fee!) because it is well-hidden and involves a few turns.  The manager greeted us and showed us the hotel I got the feeling he is very proud. The hotel is boutique only 4 or 5 rooms. Ours was quite small but adequate. It was comfortable although there was only a bathtub with a shower attachment and no curtain which made showering difficult.  A word of advice - wear earplugs. The call to prayer in the morning is very loud and occurs at around 04:45!  Breakfast was served on the roof and was very good and the staff attentive.  There is a pool in the centre of the hotel but we didn't use it ourselves.  If you want a hotel out of the main area (but still within walking distance to the main square and Mosque) I would recommend this - although finding it once you arrive in Marrakech may depend on a bit of luck. If I were the owner I'd look at providing a pick-up service.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy_N558
Riad Nafis,SoireeChef wrote a review May 2013,50,Our second stay at Riad Nafis was perfection....,Since staying at Riad Nafis last year we returned with friends for another Moroccan adventure. Marrakech and Riad Nafis were even better the second time. Our taxi driver was alarmed when I led the way through the maze towards Riad Nafis. I knew my way and was very happy to walk through the front door. Being greeted by the same staff members was like coming home. We stayed in the Junior Suite Sultana again and were very comfortable. Friends joined us in Marrakech and based on Mr. Olier's excellent recommendation we had an amazing three day adventure through the Atlas Mountains and Sahara with Adil with from 4x4 Camel. My passion for Moroccan food was given a significant boost with a pastilla cooking class with Mr. Olier and the Riad's cook. Based on the technique and recipe I look forward to recreating their delicious version of pastilla.

Riad Nafis,Julia8893 wrote a review May 2013,50,What a lovely place!,Four of us stayed at Riad Nafis in April and would not stay anywhere else now. From the airport pickup to the return journey nothing was too much trouble. Laurent and his lovely team were so attentive it was amazing.  We recommend everything we did which was all organised by the Riad. We did a half day tour with Mustapha which was well worth it. Also the Hamman which was certainly an experience. Laurent also recommended and booked restaurants for us which was great as we were only in Marrakech for 3 days.  The rooms were spotless the meal we had was delicious and you could not fault the staff.  Thank you to LaurentRashidHashim and all the other staff that we can't name.  What a lovely trip.

Riad Nafis,SongbirdMelbourne wrote a review Apr 2013,30,"Friendly staff, small room",It was our first trip to Morocco and We stayed here for three nights in April 2013.    Upon arriving at the airport we withdrew some local money from ATM and got a taxi. There was a big board outside the airport saying to go to city the taxi charge is 100 MAD but the guys there insisted as we are a couple charge therefore is 200 MAD. Go figure that out! So we had no choice but paid 200. After arriving at the old town the driver said he couldn't go any further and dropped us off outside the palace. Two little kids then showed us to the hotel's door. To be very frank if not for them there was no chance that we will find the hotel ourselves as it is really hard to spot. Then the kids wanted money. I emptyed my pocket and can only find Euro change but the kids wanted 'paper money'. The smallest MAD money I had was 200. So I refuse to give them that. The arguing was heard by people inside Nafis and they let us in. The whole experience was very stressful!    The staff was very friendly the hotel was charming with a swimming pool in the centre court yard. However our bath room only has a bath tub and there was no shower curtain around it and the tap can't be hung up. To have a shower I had to sit in the tub and wash my hair and then call my husband to hold the tap and rinse for me! It was very inconvenient. I had to do the same for my husband too. But there are still water spilled everywhere.    Our room was very small. We had nowhere to open our suitcases and had to use the bed everytime we need to get something out which is all the time. There were two very big pillars in the room right in front of the bed. My husband walked into it to go to the bathroom the first night. In fact they are very hard to miss even during the day because the room is so small.    We love the terrace breakfast and the location of the hotel but overall it's disappointing.,Date of stay: April 2013,,Melbourne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SongbirdMelbourne

The location slightly away from the madness of the El Fna but close enough to walk to in less than ten minutes suited us perfectly.  Our room was lovely rustic enough to feel we were away from a typical European style hotel but spotlessly maintained.  The sun terrace was great with a view of the storks nesting atop a nearby mosque. We ate breakfast there each morning which was delicious and served at any time up to midday.  The staff were incredibly attentive and as there are only a few rooms able to look after you without the usual ""what is your room number"" which feels like a nice touch. We booked a few restaurants through the hotel including a dinner at Kosybar where they managed to guarantee a table by the edge of the terrace. When we arrived the maitre d' told us they would not normally do this so hats off to the Nafis.

Area is very safe as it is next to one of the kings palaces with lots of guards. Extremely helpful and friendly staff who simply assist you with all you need. Have them organize the taxi ride from and to the airport as they get a better price than at least we got and also a tour guide maybe for the first day. Ok the Muezzin wakes you up every morning at 5 a.m. but this is part of the arabic experience you want to have and unavoidable unless you are outside a big city.

We had arranged with the Riad for a driver to come and meet us I definitely suggest doing this as the riad is a little difficult to find at first especially if you arriving late at night as we did. The riad can't be reached by car so our driver stopped at the nearby and lead us right to the door where we were greeted by Hicham who went to make us mint tea and brought mini pastries as we relaxed in the salon after our long journey.  Breakfast each morning was tasty pancakes and bread with diffirent flavors of jam  It's a perfect place to relax after fighting your way through the souks a proper escape and the hospitality was second to none. the manager and his team went out of their way to make our stay amazing and they definitely succeeded,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuletA

Riad Nafis,Jacqal wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Excellent riad with superb service and great food,At the time of writing this review TripAdvisor holds 65 reviews rating the Riad Nafis as excellent and 6 as very good (that’s 71 out of a total of 74). The Hotels.com reviewers’ rating is an average of 4.9 out of 5. That sets the expectations of anyone who may wish to stay at the riad a challenging level for the staff to maintain.    This review adds to the excellent ratings.    However we think it helpful to qualify those expectations and hopefully help the riad to maintain its high ratings. This is a traditional riad situated down a set of narrow pedestrian streets (derbs)– you will not find it by chance. Do not expect a view from your bedroom window or gardens to walk in or somewhere close to park a car. The five guest rooms are all different. We had the Beldi – a delightful room full of character but long and narrow. That meant the double bed was quite small (no room for one larger). The marble/stone top holding the sink was a bit longer than ideal encroaching a little on the toilet. The room had a balcony overlooking the pool. We didn’t really have an issue with the quirkiness – it all added to the charm and the room was beautifully decorated. However you might find one of the other larger rooms more to your liking. I do have one small criticism though; there was not enough light in the bathroom and shaving was a bit of guesswork. That’s something that does need to be addressed.    Having booked through Hotels.com our experience with the riad started with email exchanges with Laurent in which we booked a taxi from the airport requested dinner (one vegetarian) on the first night and ‘discussed’ possible day trips. Our flight to Marrakech arrived 40 minutes early so we reasonably expected to have to wait for the arranged taxi. But the driver was waiting when we came through from arrivals. We were impressed. He then took us directly to the riad parking as close as possible and helping to take our luggage to the front door – he could have just pointed us in the right direction which we are sure is what would have happened if we’d just taken a taxi on our own. Impressed again.    We were welcomed by Rachid who marked up a tourist map explaining the key sights whilst we were served mint tea and delicious Moroccan pastries on the roof terrace. Introductions complete our luggage was in our room. When we were ready to start exploring Marrakech Rachid took us out through the derbs pointing out the landmarks we should use to find our way back. Impressed yet again.    When it came to dinner given there are only 5 rooms in the riad we rather expected our request for one vegetarian meal to result in two. But no. We were both served different main courses. All the food was beautifully presented and delivered and very tasty. Service was impeccable. What was so nice about the food was the way the ingredients of each course were explained the obvious pride everyone took in Moroccan food and their desire to delight us. And they did. We ate there a second time during our stay and the food and service were impeccable again. We admire their dedication hard work and their achievements. Well done everyone!    Breakfast consisted of freshly squeezed orange juice three kinds of pancakes three choices of jams (all great!) vanilla yoghurt and Moroccan or French bread with tea or coffee which we ate each day on the roof terrace. It didn’t seem to matter what time we ate. Service was again first rate. However it was exactly the same breakfast every day and by our fifth day we would have liked something a bit different. Come on guys with all that lovely fruit in Marrakech how about some fresh fruit at breakfast?    Whilst staying we also had some considerable help from Laurent and Rachid especially with planning our day trip to the Atlas mountains which was absolutely great. On leaving the riad Rachid presented us with the forms required at the airport for departure completed on our behalf (impressed yet again!) and Laurent and Rachid insisted on carrying our bags through the derbs to the taxi which delivered us back to the airport.    The riad is conveniently located about 15 minutes leisurely walk to Place Jemaa el Fna with other sights such as the El-Badia and El-Bahia palaces and the Saadians tombs even closer. A taxi ride to the Majorelle gardens cost us 32 dirham.    So in summary the Riad Nafis provided us with a comfortable quiet clean convenient location with top class service and excellent food and a real Moroccan experience rather than some 4*+ plastic large hotel which could be anywhere in the world.

We came out of arrivals and there were 25 signs for Riads but not ours went round all the signs twice - nothing waited 5 minutes and realised I would have to get a taxi so had to get currency long queue so left wife and went back to check again - still no sign eventually got currency and as a last thought on way out went back for last time and the so & so had turned up. Stayed at Riads Nafis & Al Badia both have same owner and both excellent but would never book again as I don't need the hassle & stress on arrival.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpod2
Riad Nafis,ayeshasb wrote a review Sep 2012,50,An absolutely wonderful place to stay!,We definitely recommend - From the mesmerising Riad to the so very nice staff at Riad Nafis we had such a lovely experience in Marrakech. Located in the Old City in a residential area where you can experience 'real' Marrakech. A short walk to the main square and Souks. Lovely view of the Koutoubia Mosque. A part from the beautiful room and relaxing terrace and swimming pool the best part of our stay at Riad Nafis was Rashid and the staff.

Riad Nafis,Sabia C wrote a review Sep 2012,50,A GREAT STAY IN MARRAKECH,I loved my stay in this little B&B in Marrakech Morocco. This place is very clean nice and has a great set up. The staff was very polite attentive and efficient. Their breakfast was really really good. And they used fresh ingredients to cook my lunch. The food was 10x better then other 5 star hotels that I have stayed. My stay in this place assisted me greatly to deal with the craziness of Marrakech.

Riad Nafis,Michael D wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"Great Escape from the ""madness""","While I exaggerate somewhat about the ""madness"" of Marrakesh it is definitely true that the Riad Nafis was a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of a MUCH busier medina than the medina in Fes or Meknes. The manager and staff were extremely friendly and the facility itself was brilliant. The plunge pool in the middle of the Riad was beatiful and the terrace was great. Ideally located within the medina the Riad is minutes away from everything. We especially liked it's closeness to a phenomenal massage and spa called Le Bains de Marrakesh...not to be missed especially after our battle royales in the soukhs and the Jmaa al-Fina. We definitely recommend this location if staying in the city. Our only regret was that we were there only one night. We spent a few nights at Le Meridien and after our stay at Riad Nafis we wish the terms of stay were reversed...A spectacular notch above any main-stay resorts.",Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southern Pines, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721MichaelD

Riad Nafis,Nas544 wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Perfect stay,I booked a room at the riad for my wife's 30th birthday on the previous reviews and can say that they were NOT wrong. The service and the staff were all perfect. We arranged a transfer via the riad and were taken into the riad by the driver. Upon entry and completion of some paperwork Mr Laurent sat down and went through the map on places to visit and excursions avaiable. In this time we were serviced pastries and mint tea. We were offered to be taken round town. We strolled the souks and the medina and what an experience. The food was lovely and cheap and the medina was within 10 minutes walk from the riad. We had a wondeful few days. The room was clean and the service was of a 5 star hotel. We arranged a transfer back and again were taken from the riad and to the airport. Mr Laurent was going to meet us but due to his car breaking down he called to say goodbye.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a personal service and a pleasent peaceful stay.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nas544

The riad was peaceful and comfortable the rooms relaxed with that unmistakable exotic Morroccan decor. The food sumptuous having dinner at sundown on the rooftop overlooking the medina was such a great suggestion from Laurent. We unwound from the days travel sipped a marvelous morrocan red wine dined on Morroccan delicacies and watched the storks on the nearby Koutoubia minaret. I was just waiting for them to say cut it was a scene from the movies! Do yourself a favor and use the pickup service from the airport or train station you'll know why once you get there!

Riad Nafis,woowuo wrote a review Jul 2012,50,A jewel in Marrakech!,Entrance into Riad Nafis is a transitional experience from the busy Médina - it is truly a tranquil place! The inner courtyard is a jewel.     We enjoyed our stay for 10 nights residing in the Junior Suite which was a bohemian mix of furniture dream like and romantically decorated including a draped fourposter bed.  Breakfast each day was plentiful.  When we dined in the meal was very good and reasonably priced.    Our stay in Marrakech was actually a surprise gift from myself to my partner.  On the day of his birthday after dining at the Riad we found in our room a surprise gift  from all the staff - a bottle of wine and birthday poem awaiting our return.    All at the Riad were so nice and accommodating.  When we visit Marrakech we will stay again in this beautiful Riad!

Riad Nafis,Julia C wrote a review Jun 2012,50,"A gorgeous, serene island of hospitality and excellent food in a bustling city.",My husband (!!) and I just finished our amazing honeymoon where we spent most of one week in Marrakech and staying at Riad Nafis. I have never experienced such amazing and warm hospitality in my life before. The staff here are extremely open and friendly and take such pride in their work! Truly they are all the heart and soul of this place. Our vacation was a success through their help and advice from the moment we arrived being greeted by mint tea home made pastries and being provided with a city map as well as a quick tutorial on what to expect and how to get by in this new city and foreign culture! They truly want you to feel at home in the Riad. And this spirit lasted through even our last moments in Marrakech.    The atmosphere is relaxed and serene immaculately clean and the interior is truly Moroccan chic! Amenities include a beautiful rooftop terrace with a sun-bathing area and a canopied area that is beautiful for taking in fresh air and particularly nice in the evening when you can watch nearby stork nests and listen to the beautiful calls to prayer from the city mosques. There is a wonderfully refreshing pool in the inner courtyard area as well - always welcome after long hot days traversing the myriad of souks and historical sites of the city! Additionally the bed rooms have air conditioning available which makes sleep comfortable durin the hot months (for us temperatures were in the 40s C)    And finally the piece that never escapes my notice the food. The chef at the Riad is a precious resource! Breakfast made new every morning ready whenever you wake up. Moroccan breakfast foods are on the sweet (but not overly sweet) side. Always something fresh made and new bountiful and very filling. We often did not need lunch afterwards. You also have the option of having the Riad prepare a 3 course dinner for you for a modest price which I highly recommend you do at least once! We did this on our last night in Marrakech and it was the best meal of the whole trip!    We'll be telling all of our friends and family about it but I'll tell you too - you cannot go wrong by staying at Riad Nafis!  All the best  Julia and Michael,Date of stay: June 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMCunningham
Riad Nafis,jean-marc s wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Exceptionnal,I cannot speak highly enough of the welcome and service we received from LaurentYussef and all the staff at Riad Nafis. Always available nothing was too much trouble.  Laurent did organize our airport transfer (recommended on 1st time).  As soon as we entered the riad we were greated by Youssef who sat with us we were served mint tea and delicious home made pastries. Yussef provided us with the all information about Marrakech he shown us on the map the places to visit restaurants 1 day trips away from Marrakech enough to make you feel confortable to approach such a different culture and enjoy the best of the destination.  We had the Sultana Junior Suite which is located on first floor overlooking the fabulous swimming pool patio. It was furnished with lots of delicacy in details very clean air-conditioned and the queen size double-bed was comfortable.  The Riad is a subtile mixture of traditionnal Moroccan decoration with contemporary art from a local Artist we loved the sublime bust of woman ! Free Wi-Fi is also available in the Riad.  We had tasty breakfasts every morning on the top floor terrace overlooking the koutoubia and we had dinner on our first evening.  This was our best meal in Marrakech. We can not recommend more highly to anyone staying here to have at least 1 dinner at the riad.  All is homemade with fresh vegetables from the market so you need to book ahead Naïma prepared for us a delightful assortments of Moroccan salads with verrine a tasty tajine and refreshing dessert.

Riad Nafis,bc2013 wrote a review May 2012,10,Riad Nafis= Greedy Greedy Thieves,Being our first trip to Morocco we we’re encouraged by the great reviews of this place. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our three person party was greeted at the door by Yousef the hotel manager who informed us that because our reservation listed 2 people we would not be able to put 3 people into a room. Mind you on our reservation listed 2 people (plus one cot). A logical person reading that would have assumed that there should be a bed for two people plus a cot for another. Instead we were told that the only way to stay in the hotel would be to rent another room for one person for another 90 Euros! The hotel owner Laurent came and we went back and forth. At one point they pretended to call another hotel to see if they had openings. Not surprisingly there was no answer. If it had been any other country we would have been able to simply leave and find another hotel but in Marrakech the hotels are not easy to locate and we did not speak the language. Laurent and Yousef knew this and we were handcuffed to the Nafis. We had no choice but to pay the 90 Euros for both nights (180 extra Euros for nothing ($252)! But that robbery wasn’t enough to quench their greed. They went on to cheat us on every transaction we made with them. Every bill was filled with extra charges and over conversions. They were determined to steal everything we had and it made our stay miserable. There is no reputable hotel in any corner of the world that would treat its customers like that. If you want to travel to Marrakech I recommend not staying long. If you do DO NOT STAY AT THE NAFIS! If you find yourself there bring your calculator with you at check out time. I promise there will be some interesting math on your final bill.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Austin, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bc2013

The staff were so caring and attentive to our every need. How pleasant to come back to this place each day after the chaos of negotiating through the souks and traffic of Marrakech. I came for both work and pleasure so our stay here was longer than average--8 nights. Our 8 year old son fell in love with Morocco and this Riad and staff in particular and can't wait to come back.

Riad Nafis,cate j wrote a review Apr 2012,40,peace and quiet and excellent food.,My sister and I stayed in the Riad Nafis for 3 nights. We wanted a city break with the chance of some sunshine and culture. Marrakech is everything you want it to be and more. All your senses are attacked from all angles! The Riad Nafis is a great place to take a respite from the crowds and noise.  Location: It's a 10 minute walk from the main square in one direction and the Tombs and palaces in the other. Located next to the Royal Palace walls means there are palace guards about 24 hours so it's really safe day and night. Yousef gave us maps and a guided walk to the main road on arrival so we knew exactly where we were going.  Rooms: We had the twin on the ground floor right next to the pool. All the rooms looked amazing and unique. We found ours a little dark as there are no windows and lamps were subtle!! All the furnishings are 5star - beautiful lamps rugs wooded wardrobes and inlayed doors. The bathroom was fantastic power shower loads of hot water hair dryer big towels nice smellies etc. We had thick lovely duvets for the colder nights and crisp white sheets.  A bottle of water was provided in our room on arrival plus mosquito coils (never needed) and wifi login.  Be aware there are no locks on doors but security is tight and no one is allowed into the Riad except guests.  Facilities: There is a lounge area next to the pool where you can eat and lounge and play music read watch swimmers. No TV of any sort anywhere!!  The sun terrace on the roof has sun hats and towels providedon loungers and lovely sun beds.  Food/drink: There are no coffee/ tea making facilities and no bar - but you can ask for whatever you want from the 24 hour staff. We are big wine drinkers and tried the house(Morrocan) rose and white - both were excellent and around 12Euros a bottle.  Breakfast - was amazing - like everything in Morrocco it appeals to the sweet toothed! But all I will say is that we never needed lunch! There was always more than enough to eat and fabulous orange juice and coffee. Each day we had slightly different things which I thought was fab.You can choose where you ate (terrace or lounge or room) and can have it any time you want to!  Dinner - we ate dinner twice. I wont spoil it but gorgeous tagines and lots of local ingredients. 18Euros for 3 courses plus coffee. reasonable for what you get. All very filling!  Swimming pool - wow it's beautiful. It is not heated so not for the faint hearted.    Other stuff: Mint tea and pastries on arrival. Fabulously helpful staff (Yousef and Laurent are both wonderful) Nothing is forced on you yet they always seemed to be there if we needed something. They organised taxis from/ to airport worth doing if only so you dont get lost.  Gave us umbrellas when it rained.    I would definitely stay here again. It's peaceful and stress free and close enough to everything you need to see.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47catej

Behind an old carved door is a modern reception area that opens on to a pool open to the stars in warm weather. The 5 bedrooms look out on to the central open area. The rooms are nice sized comfortable beds. The bathrooms were luxurious. We had breakfast outside on the rooftop terrace a delicious mix of the best that Moroccan and French can offer.  We ended up at Riad Nafis by accident. Due to a computer glitch our original reservation at a different riad was overbooked. The manager knew we would be arriving late in the day to Marrakesh and re-booked our 2 rooms at the Nafis.

Riad Nafis,taryn615 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,One of my favorite hotels in the world,I travel a lot and have a list of my favorite hotels... Riad Nafis easily makes it in to my top 3. The property is beautiful and the staff are the most friendly and accommodating I've ever encountered.    Breakfast is wonderful and served on the roof top terrace each morning. After a cold winter it was nice to sit outside and soak in the sunshine while enjoying the fresh squeezed orange juice and homemade breads and jams. Breakfast is served whenever you wake up which was a nice treat for my group since we slept in until 10am the first morning.    We choose to have dinner at the Riad 2 nights. Both meals were wonderful and it was a treat to eat in the common area enjoy wine and not have to worry about walking back late at night in the dark. (Although the neighborhood always seemed very safe.)    I suggest booking transportation to/from the hotel through the hotel. It was very reasonably priced and I can't imagine how difficult it would be to get there without someone who knew the way.    The bedrooms are beautiful and comfortable. The hotel is truly magical from the open floor plan looking down to a swimming pool (often with floating rose petals) to the warm common area/sitting room.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Caldogno, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taryn615
Riad Nafis,Travelhag wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Thoroughly recommended,We stayed in this charming traditional courtyard house for a week at the beginning of February. This small hotel (5 rooms) is clean comfortable and has as many staff as rooms although you don't feel hassled but they really look after you and even taught my husband to make the traditional mint tea. Yusef arranged a car and driver to take us to see the women's argan oil co-operative and Essouria about two hours away on the coast. The trip (and the hotel) were very reasonably priced and having our own driver meant that we were able to stop when and where we wanted. We had arranged to be met at the airport as I was concerned that we may not find the hotel in the unmarked streets of the old medina and I would reccomend this option as it is not much more than getting a taxi from the airport and the driver takes you to the door of the Riad. When we first went out Yusef walked with us making sure we knew how to find our way back and showing us how to get to Jma el Fnaa a few minutes walk from the hotel. Breakfast was served on the roof terrace but you can have it served inside if the weather is too cold which it was on a couple of days but then you miss watching the storks on the nearby mosque and the eagles soaring overhead. We also had dinner in the hotel twice you have to order this in advance as they then buy the ingredients that day. When you arrive you are told to treat the hotel as your home and that breakfast is served when you want it this certainly was true for us. I would certainly stay here again and would thoroughly recommend it for anyone considering visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriamundi

The riad was clean and in a great location five-ten minutes walk to the square and other attractions. There are a couple of alleys you have to walk through to get to the riad but it is located near one of the palaces so guards and police were constantly roaming this area and we felt very safe.    Although it was such a beautiful riad what made it so much more special were the excellent staff (in particular Youssef the riad manager) nothing was too much trouble.

Riad Nafis,Victoria K wrote a review Nov 2011,50,What a wonderful Riad!,I stayed at the Riad Nafis for four nights from 10th November to 14th November 2011 and all I can sya is what a wonderful place it is to stay. It's a little daunting as you walk down the alleyways on your arrival to the Riad but once you step inside it is like walking into a beautiful centre of calm in a busy bustling city. The Riad is beautifully decorated with 5 bedrooms a swimming pool (though it was too cold to use it on our visit) a lounge/dining area and a roof terrace.    Altogether the Riad Nafis was a wonderful place to stay. It is ideally located right next to the Royal Residence in the Medina (old town) within easy walking distance of everything in Marracech. A huge delicioud breakfast is served daily on the roof terrace with great views of the city and the Atlas Mountains. We ate at the Riad for 2 nights and the food was as good as in the expensive restaurants in town.    Upon arrival we were greeted by Laurent the Riad owner. He sat down with us and gave us an incredibly informative and useful guide of the city and told us all the most interesting places to go and how to get there. He was also wonderfully helpful and booked all of our excursions for us and explained which were the best places to visit.    All of the staff were incredibly helpful and they all went out of their way to be kind and helpful to us. We went for a balloon ride on our final morning and had to leave the hotel at 5.30am so Hisham the night staff made breakfast especially for us at 5am and then walked with us to our pick up point to make sure we go to the taxi ok. Ahmed the Riad Manager was also very lovely and helpful and walked our cases to the taxi to take us back to the airport.    I would definitely recommend Riad Nafis to anyone who is looking for somewhere to stay in Marrakech. It is a traditional Riad in an ideal location with lovely staff.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Llandeilo, Wales, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaK98

Riad Nafis,moira a wrote a review Oct 2011,50,"Fantastic, faultless, can't wait to return",My friend and I returned from a 5 day stay at Riad Nafis 2 days ago. It was a blissful and enchanting experience made as such by the wonderful young team of staff there. I cannot praise them enough as the service and attention provided by them all was second to none. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and told to treat the riad as our home. We were given valuable information on where to visit and personally guided out to the main road by Mahdi the manager on our first evening there. The breakfasts were delicious as was the evening meal we had arranged after one long day in the souks. The location of Riad Nafis is also perfect a mere 10 minute walk to Jemma el Fna and infinitely preferable to the large modern hotels in the new town. The entrance appears wanting on arrival but before long we looked forward to the walk through the alleyways and past the familiar locals and traders all of whom were helpful and respectful at all times. Riad Nafis is a beautiful oasis of calm after the hot and busy outside world with delightful areas in which to relax or sunbathe. The accommodation was spotlessly clean as was the pool sprinkled with rose petals. I cannot recommend this place enough and can't wait to make a return visit myself.

Riad Nafis,wrekdiver wrote a review Oct 2011,50,A gem in the Medina,I just got back from 3 days in Marrakech and without a doubt this Riad was my favorite part of the trip. It was a beautiful oasis from the hectic life of this crazy city. Mahdi was very helpful in recommending excursions and restaurants and everyone else was very helpful and friendly. I loved the fact that it was hidden back in the neighborhood and was part of the history of this great city. Having said that I would recommend at least having them pick you up from the airport because you will not find it without help.

Riad Nafis,RhianBulmer wrote a review Sep 2011,50,A tranquil home away from home,What a wonderful Riad: calm tranquil and beautiful. The staff were helpful and attentive but not intrusive.  We were made to feel completely welcome and at home from the minute we arrived.  Breakfast was lovely and served whenever you wanted on the sun terrace.  Our room was beautiful (fully air conditioned) and it was serviced whilst we had breakfast.  Drinks were available 24/7 and served wherever we wanted.  Advice was readily given and trips were organised at our request with ease and efficency.  We requested the transfer too and from the airport: this was a really worthwhile service as the Riad manager met us from the taxi to direct us to the Riad.  The sun terrace has a wonderful view over the city with sun loungers towels and hats provided.  The plunge pool was brilliant and a heaven-sent in 40 degree heat.  I cannot reccommend this Riad highly enough.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhianBulmer
Riad Nafis,ibuckingham wrote a review Apr 2011,50,Five star accomodation with friendly helpfull staff,We booked four days at the Riad Nafis April 12 - 15th 2011. Staff couldnt do enough to help us clean rooms very welcoming excellent value for money.  When we arrived we were greeted by Mehete and Karima who made us mint tea and we sat on the sun roof terrace overlooking Marakech. Mehete's personal maps and advice to go during the day and evening was really helpfull. Breakfast on the sunroof every morning with freshly made orange juice was lovely.    We ate in the Riad Nafis on the first night and it was really nice and just as good as the expensive resturants we tried.  Our room was very clean and comfortable and had a morrocon theme.    Short walk to main square we really enjoyed our stay in Marakech and would definetly come back to the Riad Nafis it made our stay really enjoyable.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stafford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibuckingham
Riad Nafis,Tracy S wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Friendly and excellent riad,"Very welcoming and friendly staff. Excellent meal on arrival - we just asked them to ""make sometihng"" and couldn't fault the meal served on the rooftop terrace. Very comfortable but unfortunately our room looked out onto an alley and peoplepassed from very early in the morning disturbing us somewhat. The bathroom was big and luxurious with a roll top bath but a shower on the wall would have been appreciated - however the shower in our children's room was excellent.  The staff were very attentive and a very good breakfast was served on the roof. We asked advice on restaurants they were booked for us and the recommendation was spot on.  Some of this sounds a bit negative but they were small points which didn't detract from this place being very good overall",Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leedslassie
Riad Nafis,Bazzathetraveller wrote a review Dec 2010,50,a true home from home,I have just got back from Marrakech with my friend and had to write a wee review about this wonderful oasis! We spent 2 nights 23rd and 24th of December and I must say I have worked and stayed all over the world but nothing compares to the excellent attention to detail the staff esp Rashed and Lauren ( perfect hosts) and the food was totally authentic and very tasty. We even managed a 2nd visit whilst in Marrakech for dinner the food was so good and the continuity remained. All we can say is well done to the team at Nafis! you made us both feel so welcome almost like family and nothing was too much trouble.

Riad Nafis,Alexander1971 wrote a review Dec 2010,50,"Perfect stay, superb staff",We spent a wonderful week in Riad Nafis and we had an unforgettable time in this beautiful little oasis in a very good location in the medina close to many sightseeing spots . Everyone of the staff was really outstanding and so helpful that every whish was taken care of. Breakfast and dinner were very good and more tasteful than in many high priced restaurants that often are rather tourist traps.  The hotel is easy to find close to one of the king's residences. The neighborhood is very friendly and welcoming where you will always feel safe. By foot you are quickly at Jamaa El-Fna and also close to main streets where you can take taxis to go to Gueliz or so.  When we come back to Marrakesh we will certainly try to come back to Riad Nafis. We would recommend everyone to stay there instead of staying in one of the more big hotels in the modern part of the town. You will simply make a different experience that the modern part cannot match and again... such a nice staff you won't find easily again thank you Shukran!,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Frankfurt,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexander1971
Riad Nafis,AJFRAF wrote a review Oct 2010,50,A Great Base to enjoy the Medina,We were a bit anxious about taking our infant daughter to a Riad - after all they are supposed to be places of calm! However our fears were soon put aside by the wonderful welcome from the owners and staff who had provided a sumptious room complete with a huge bath and top-notch baby cot. We really did feel like we had a team of caring experts on hand while staying at Nafis - advice fabulous service tasty food wi-fi even offers of babysitting - nothing was too much trouble.  The Riad is perfectly placed towards the perimeter of the medina to allow a casual 10 minutes walk into the central square and we found it easy to walk back when the day heated up for a siesta or lounge on the roof terrace with mint tea. Nafis represents extremely good value for money and with only 5 rooms had a great European vibe with a cosmopolitan mix of guests. We recommend it whole-heartedly.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJFRAF
Riad Nafis,koycegizladLondon wrote a review Aug 2010,50,Beautiful Riad - perfect location,My wife and I stayed here for our 25th wedding anniversary which also coincided with her 50th birthday so we obviously wanted something special. We were not disappointed. All the rooms are beautifully decorated. The breakfasts on the roof terrace excellent. And if you decide to take advantage of the evening meals they are of high quality authentic Moroccan cuisine and very good value.    The staff were very helpful and attentive and the French owners are often on hand to recommend places to visit etc.    Perfectly situated to visit most of the major sites I would certainly not hesitate in recommending this Riad to anybody looking for a small Riad with a warm friendly and relaxed atmosphere.,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/koycegizladLondon
Riad Nafis,diana1216 wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Great Riad would highly recommend,Stayed at the Riad Nafis for 3 nights and it was perfect. We prebooked transfers with the Riad in advance which I would really recommend as it would be hard to find if you purely got a taxi from the airpot. Friendly staff great breakfast on the terrace and a much appreciated plunge pool after a hot days exploring.

We stayed here in march 2010 and were very inpressed by the owners and staff.  So warm friendly and caring.  Imagine waking up having a great breakfast on a roof terrace overviewing Marrakech listening to birds singing.  After a full day in the city or the mountains come back home have a drink or a swim stay in the riad for dinner or check out all the restaurants in the city.  The owner guides you with a lot of info maps reservations touristic info.  We took a private driver up into the mountains had tea with the berbers it was great.

Riad Nafis,CambridgeJoe wrote a review Mar 2010,50,"Exceptional experience, an excellent riad",I booked this Riad after reading the previous reviews and having purchased flights already. It was a short fifteen minute drive from the airport and the transfer was reasonably priced and arranged by the Riads owners. It is located just inside the main walls and borders one of the kings palaces. The location is ideal close enough to the main square and sights but far enough away to be a quiet peaceful relaxation space    The Riad is beautiful an absolute gem that makes you feel instantly at home. There is a central bathing pool and the rooms are on two levels above it. The roof contains sun longers and a beautiful little gazebo that is perfect for a drink in the evening whilst the sun goes down    My room was individually decorated with beautiful hand picked and designed furniture and fittings (the owner is a graphic desifgner who hand drew what she wanted and commissioned local artisans to produce) and the bathroom contained a shower room. It was very clean well kept and the staff were very attentive.    I cannot praise the staff enough they treat you individually and are there for anything at all you may need. They have a dedicated night staff member which means it is staffed 24 hours a day    All in all this has been the best stay in a hotel/riad i have experienced in many years and cannot wait to go back. I would reccomend the riad to solo travellers and couples as there are only five rooms and it makes it a very tailored experience.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CambridgeJoe
Riad Nafis,ahadd wrote a review Feb 2010,50,Fantastic Riad with fantastic service,After being picked up from the airport I was a little dubious about being taken several dim winding allies to an unmarked front door. However inside the Riad is beutifully decorated with modern comfertable fixtures. The owner gave us the lowdown on Marrakech with some ideas on what to see and eat.    The staff are fantastic always on hand to help . The swimming pool was a little chilly in January but I am sure lovely in summer. The roof terrace has great view over Marrakech to the mountains where you can have breakfast (very tasty) or lounge on the chairs in the sun. Also just a short walk from all the sites in the Medina.

As described Mohammed the night guard and the whole staff were absolutely lovely and we felt at home instantly. Catherine was a gracious and involved host.

The lounge and the terrace are wonderful for eating and chilling.  I also have to mention Mohammed the night guard who is one of the most friendly people I have ever met in a life time!

Riad Nafis,TrudesandNeil wrote a review Dec 2008,50,Loved Riad Nafis!,My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in September 2008 and loved it. Herve picked us up from the airport and gave us an overview of the city on our way back to the riad we were greeted with tea and home made shortbread whilst he advised us of the main sites in Marrakech The Riad is about a 20 minute drive from the airport.    Riad Nafis is chic and elegant. We stayed in two different rooms the Sultana and the Berber and loved both.    Catherine Herve's wife has designed and decorated each room beutifully in collaboration with the local artisans. The attention to detail is superb. Each room has its own stylish elegance.    In the Sultana the fabrics were luxurious velvets with a gold gilt bathroom.    The Berber room used traditional design elements from the recycled cedar support posts to the arabic inscribed bedheads. The free standing clawfoot bathtub was a delight and the cool greens and blues lovely.    The beds in both rooms were very comfortable with the highest quality sheets and bedding.    The pool and loungeroom area are lovely places to chill out and the rooftop terrace affords superb views over Marrakech to the High Atlas. We spent many hours relaxing there.    The three girls who work at the Riad are beautifull and will accomodate you at all times. We were able to orgnise lunch only 1 hour after arriving during Ramadan !!. The girls made the best breakfast and the lunchtime Kofta was one of the best we had in 3 months of travel.    Mohammed the night guard is charming and will greet you like an old friend when you return each evening. When we had to get up early (5.30am) for the high Atlas and for our flight he woke us and tended to us serving breakfast and carrying our bags to the car !    Everyone at the Riad Nafis is friendly and extremely helpful. Catherine Herve and their staff felt like familiy by the time we left.    The Riad' is not in the Place Djemaa el Fna but it's only a short walk (5 mins) to all the major sites.    The Nafis was a sanctuary to return to after the chaos of the souks and the streets of Marrakech !    We could not recommend it enough and hope to return one day.

Yes its tucked away down some back streets which initially look rather suspicious but they soon become familiar and the same faces will greet you happily each morning.    We stayed in the twin room on the ground floor. Lovely. Herve's wife has decorated the place wonderfully - the attention to detail is second to none.    Bathroom was spacious and spotlesss.
