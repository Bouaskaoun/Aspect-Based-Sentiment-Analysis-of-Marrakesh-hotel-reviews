Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Batemans wrote a review Yesterday,30,Somewhere different with sunshine,Thought we were try Marrakesh. Chose the Dar Atlas Resort as good price and all inclusive (which we don‚Äôt normally do) just wanted to relax and enjoy the sun.  The Hotel is ok Good points plenty of sun beds no reserving with towels happening. Big pool however very cold at moment but after a couple of minutes in it you adjust and it not so bad. Food is pleasant and plentiful at meal times food is not labelled to say what it is so you have to guess what it is. Lol.    One main bar. Drinks if you want cocktails forget it also the beer is served in sprit glasses so 2 swigs and it gone. However the beer is not weak it‚Äôs a reasonable 1/4 pint üòÇ.    The staff all seemed friendly. The entertainment is lacking professional acts. Basically you get the pool day team dragging people up to dance with them. No singing just music playing. Shame as live music would make the evenings more enjoyable for us.    Room was a bit tired and old but bed comfortable and nice sheets etc. No kettle. Also we had no furniture on our outside terrace. There seemed to be a struggle with towels at one point as ours got taken by cleaner and not replaced twice. Even thou we hung up as still want to us. I heard other people had same issues. (Maybe struggling with demand of people) . It was all good after the until last day. Went to breakfast came back & all towels goneüòÇ    We caught the bus into Marrakesh which is 20 md return each booked in advance. Well worth a visit. Very chaotic but enjoyable. We also did a 4x4 into the Atlas Mountains booked In hotel very little explanation of the day. It turn out ok. Views great but some of the stops and lunch could of been better.    All in all we enjoyed our stay but if to return we would probably try another Hotel. At best I would say its a 3-4 Star hotel but pleasant.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Caterham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BatemanWakelings

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Clare B wrote a review Mar 15,50,Amazing week!,Just back from a week at this hotel!    After reading some reviews was a bit worried about going but honestly there was nothing to be worried about.    The hotel was lovely clean and fresh and the grounds were beautiful to walk through the rooms were clean and fine- could do with an upgrade but were clean and we had no problems!    The activity team were absolutely amazing always including you but leaving you alone if that‚Äôs what you wanted sammido and coco rico especially were amazing!    The pool was freezing but once you got in it took a few mins and was fine!    The food was lovely a lot wasn‚Äôt labelled which wasn‚Äôt too great for my partner as he has allergies however everything I had was amazing g and fresh couldn‚Äôt have complained.    Every staff member was absolutely fantastic attentive and strove to answer any questions we had.    We booked all our excursions through the hotel and the staff there are second to none really took the time to explain and go through it with us so we got the best experience.    Mitchum at the bar could not have been better he really made our holiday with the fantastic service we received so a big thank you!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,GrandTour62120596125 wrote a review Mar 14,50,14 days in paradise,We have stayed 14 days at the beautiful Valeria Atlas nestled in the Atlas mountains Marakesh : On arrival we were welcomed by Zouhair the guest manager who looked after us on a daily basis with lots of care  happiness and compassion. The entertainment team  Mida and his friends would greet us  speak about culture and places we could visit  they always ask us go join in with  yoga french bowls and numerous games . All staff were more than happy to help us with anything we would want. Genuine help and communication every time we would meet.Our room was clean and chamber maids met all our needs to make sure we had a clean and comfortable room to rest.The hotel grounds and outdoors is spectacular maintained to high standards. We enjoyed beautiful walks through the tranquil gardens surrounded by orange trees palm trees and quiet spaces to rest. The gardeners work so hard to maintain green spaces where birds sing creating a wonderful atmosphere.We have travelled extensively with holidays in Europe and have never found such hospitality and the highest standard of cuisine. Every day the dining room staff waiters and chefs ensured we enjoyed our meals. We can only describe the food as excellent with a fantastic selection of food .We were made to feel like family and highly recommend the hotel Valeria for families and couples we cannot wait to come back we will miss you all. We want to say a special thank you to Zouhair for being such a wonderful person .,Date of stay: March 2023,,"Isle of Skye, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandTour62120596125

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,niblets wrote a review Mar 12,40,Good value All Inclusive hotel,We picked this hotel for the price and value. From some of the reviews we read after booking we were a little concerned as to what we were going to get but we needn't have worried  There are around 16 rooms in each Riad (block) with an inner courtyard very pretty as you walk up to your specific Riad. The pathway from the main reception takes you amongst the orange trees and roses and with the birds singing is lovely at all times of the day and then put up very pretty at night.  Our room was comfortable we found the beds a bit hard but we did sleep. We had a quilt each as it was still the winter the pillows were ok although we had 1 each and 1 spare so we asked for an additional pillow which was provided immediately. The air conditioning worked well and was not too noisy. Free safe plenty of hanging space and storage space for clothes also a big mirror in the room and bathroom. Bathroom functional with good hot shower good toilet and large sink space with working reasonable hairdryer. The balcony was a good size with lots of flowers growing around it with 2 chairs and the afternoon sun. Room cleaned daily by pleasant cleaning staff who couldn't do enough for you. Some of the fixtures could do with a bit of upgrading the one plug was hanging out the wall a bit there were plenty of other plugs though and a working fridge. The furniture was a bit rustic but was useable.  The grounds...these are beautiful and a real plus for the hotel lots of gardens to walk through also a lovely wild pool where there are ducks guinea fowl etc and also a beautiful fountain..  Two lovely clean and well maintained swimming pools although the one I went in up at the quiet end was very cold but I soon got used to it.  We found the food tasty you have to be adventurous and also remember you are in Morrocco. We just tried everything and enjoyed it all. Make sure you don't miss the outside food for both breakfast and lunch. If you go out on the sun terrace from the restaurant and go to the left you can get omelettes fried eggs Morrocon crepes and a type of donut for breakfast. Lunch they do pizzas outside which were lovely with some salad.  The drinks are ok we tried a couple of the AI cocktails and didn't find them the best so stuck to the beer wine and Gin and tonic as these were good. You also get 1/2 bottles (as many as you want) of wine at evening dinner which we thought was a nice touch along with tablecloths etc...  The staff were generally good and pleasant we didn't partake with the animation activities and didn't at any time feel under pressure to do any of these but they work very hard and if you are someone who likes to do things on your holiday you won't be disappointed.  Finally one of the most pleasant staff members was Mr Tash....you'll see why when you meet him. He is the photographer but just generally a really nice guy. He remembered our names throughout the holiday and always spoke to us whenever he saw us. Of course we had our photos taken but didn't feel under pressure to do this. The pics aren't too expensive and are of good quality.  Would we go back definitely if we were ever to return Marrakesh as it was really good value and a very relaxing place to be.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Lynsey S wrote a review Mar 11,50,Animation team make this hotel,Just leaving after a fantastic week. The animation team really make this hotel encouraging to have everyone involved but not too pushy if your just looking to relax.  Pool is big but freezing (I never made it in fully yet) and no issues getting sun loungers so didn't need an early alarm call.  There is place to book excursions in the hotel and was reasonably priced and trustworthy.  Food was good but I'm a fussy eater and nothing had labels if you have an allergy it might be a bit risky.  The Guest Service Manager (sorry I forgot his name) was really helpful my fiance had organised some surprises for my birthday and he was an amazing help!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Terry F wrote a review Mar 8,50,My experience at Dar Atlas Resort,Have just had a great few days at this resort. The rooms are very clean the staff cannot do enough for you and the holiday reps are the same everyone is very friendly but maybe a bit over zealous as the reps try a bit too hard to get people involved when it is quite obvious they do not want to. This is a resort and there are a couple of shops outside but don‚Äôt expect a high street or any bars. The food is quite good the downers for the food was that hardly anything was labelled and when you have allergies to certain foods this is a must. Secondly again about the dinging hall the 2 coffee machines were always out of milk. I would have liked to see a couple of coffee machines dotted about around reception and other areas for self service as is only available when either the bar or canteens are open. It has been a nice peaceful break and would recommend to anyone who wants a quiet break.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194terryf

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,john w wrote a review Mar 2,20,Poor hotel for all inclusive,After arriving early evening was told go get food before check in well what was left was warm or cold chicken and veg and other food which we had no clue what it was all the eating times we never see a sign saying what the food was and was never hot.  going to the bar to get a beer was handed a glass which you would drink a short in and was also told only 1 at the time but after drinking it i did not want to drink any more as was like fizzy water just like the shorts they served to get a premium drink was told would have to pay which worked out at around ¬£7 or more and thats even if you are all inclusive.  The swimming pool was so cold no one got in it and entertament was a joke to nothing to do but silly games which lasted 20 to 30 minutes that if you like playing poker dartsand dancing and the music was mostly french or morrocian played loud but english music was turned down low. the rooms well nothing like the pictures shown ended uo with single beds pushed together and quilts that just about covered the bed broken bedside tables dirty table and chairs on tiny balcony Having been on many all inclusive holidays over 20 years i have to say i will never visit that place again. service was slow ques every day for food and drink.i could go on but its depressing me having wasted money on going there was looking after 1 day to move to the ibrostar 15 minutes down the road,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L8073IPjohnw

We used the hairdressers facility the girl worked really well.  Tried out the massage which was nice and relaxing.  Drinks were nice and had enoug options.  The staff are really helpful. Manger also explained everything and always checked of everything was okay. We felt really well looked after and had positive experience. We would definitely recommend it and would happily come back to this resort.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kameliyaa2018
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,HI wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Run down and Tacky,I would describe our experience at the Atlas as extremely disappointing. The food was always cold tasteless and nothing is labelled. The bread was stale everyday. The coffee machine was either empty or broken more days than not and when it was working the coffee was horrible. The restaurant where the buffet takes place is very similar to a school dinner hall. Very outdated and full of screaming children. The all inclusive drinks include very watered down spirits and cheap wine. The actual grounds of the hotel have potential to be lovely it just needs some attention and TLC. The entertainment team were very enthusiastic but also need to read the room and realise when someone doesn‚Äôt want to get up to join in with the 1000 activities a day. Great for kids but if you‚Äôre an adult wanting to relax and not get pestered it‚Äôs not ideal. If you want a relaxing traditional Moroccan break this is not the hotel for it- it‚Äôs very far out and there is nothing surrounding the hotel. We actually ended up spending money on a gorgeous little Riad in the Medina just to get a break from the run down hotel. On the plus side the rooms were clean and fresh towels were provided each day. All in all I would say the hotel is tacky and the food needs to improve massively. I am very confused at the 5 star ratings that have been left- it leaves a false impression of the reality.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/485heatheri
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Veronika P wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Definitely recommend super welcoming and lovely place to stay!!,We went here for 5 nights Feb 5 - Feb 10 for my mums birthday and the resort is AMAZING they‚Äôre super helpful with anything you need we needed extra towels and blankets in our room and they were sent up to our room in about 10 minutes. They have a shop on site which has all your basic supplies like shampoo and body wash as well as some snacks which is very helpful. The rooms are very comfortable there‚Äôs aircon which you can heat or cool the room depending which time of the year you‚Äôre visiting it‚Äôs a little bit older style but the beds are big and it provides a good night sleep so it was perfect for us. Everyone we met was super helpful and friendly I unfortunately didn‚Äôt get everyone‚Äôs name but they made us feel so welcome and it was very nice that whenever we walked past people they‚Äôd say hello and some of them would even start to have a chat with us. The food was stunning everyday we had a choice of something different at least 2 types of different meats and multiple veggie options and many different starters and desserts there was always some sort of pasta so it caters for everyone the only downside for food was breakfast as there was the same options every morning which got repetitive after the 3rd day but everything still tasted delicious at lunchtime you can also get a fresh oven baked pizza made in front of you! Inside of the resort they have an trip organisation shop we went on a few of the trips and they‚Äôre well worth it they‚Äôre quite cheap and you get to meet new people from the resort. As it was my mums birthday they made a cake for her for a small extra fee but it was so so special and about 15 people from the kitchen and waiters walked out to sing happy birthday in English french and Moroccan! And we also were gifted special cocktails for her birthday so everything they did for us was amazing and I‚Äôm very grateful for everyone that we met and I can‚Äôt wait to return again soon!,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veronika200128
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ben P wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Great place and convenient out-of-town location,Lovely place to base yourselves for day trips to the medina. 15 mins by taxi 100-150D or 25 by shuttle bus at 120D return.    Firstly the Animation team are very good. The weather was inclement and they did well to keep spirits high.    Mr Tash was a family favourite though he kept beating me at Rummy!    The food was great by kitchen staff. The service team was a little less on the ball though possibly understaffed for the halfterm break post covid.    Front of house reception were good but we did have a big issue with our neighbour and they struggled to show much of a positive effect until we went to the animation manager who got right into the problem and resolved it.    Adjoining rooms are separated by a hollow door and there is very little sound proofing.    Spotless rooms and around the resort.    We didn‚Äôt let the neighbour issue impact on the holiday.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,elliot w wrote a review Feb 2023,10,All inclusive? Thimble sized glasses. You need to pay after 11. Foodies stay away 3 star in disguise,Firstly reading some of the 5 star reviews really has me questioning if we stayed in the same place! I think the entertainment staff are keeping the hotels head above water. They are brilliant really friendly and engaging. That‚Äôs the only positive I can say.    The hotel is run down old damaged and dilapidated. It‚Äôs in desperate need of refurbishing and/ or regrading.    I found 1-2 friendly bar staff all the others felt like they were doing you a favour when they served your drink in the smallest tumbler they could find regardless of what was ordered.    The food in the restaurant is bland boring and lazy. The food tasted really unseasoned. Bearing in mind this is supposed to be a 4 star resort often tables have no cutlery glasses or napkins.    The room:  It was very hot with no remote to turn it down. We asked multiple times at reception and was plainly ignored.  The furniture was tired and dirty 1 bath towel for 2 people dirty sheets on arrival and again mid stay (old blood!)    The balcony is nicely designed but old dirty plastic furniture (4 stars?!?)    Paying for water after 11pm I thought it was all inclusive? ‚Ç¨10 deposit for a pool towel I thought this was a 4 star resort?    As I said at the start I think people are bonding with the entertainment staff and ignoring a host of issues with this resort. The 5 star reviews from said people will lead to a lot of disappointment for other guests. Hence my 1 star review,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotw706
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Watson wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Find somewhere else,Considering the area this probably is a 3 star hotel at a push but generally the hotel found many ways to disappoint. The room was wiped clean although dusty and I had a stained pillow to sleep on.  I‚Äôll be honest I was taken here for my 40th birthday so I was willing to let most things go as it was free to me however it became a bit irritating.    The hotel started well we arrived just as lunch ended but they noticed we were hungry and the staff kindly put together a plate of food for us and waited until we ate to clear away very nice and appreciated. Sadly this is where going beyond ended. The food was always luke warm at best or cold and not very nice to be honest. One evening there wasn‚Äôt any crockery nor cutlery and after twenty minutes of waiting and searching for some we found nothing left to eat other than the salads and bread and this was only 40 minutes into the 2 hour window for all inclusive dinner.  The first breakfast I had 2 fried eggs which were not cooked properly so from then on I had omelette which was nice. However 3 days into the trip there were no eggs at all nor omelette as an option.  To be honest I could write 50 things about this hotel and why not to go there but the main ones that most people would probably care about is that the food isn‚Äôt good the service isn‚Äôt good anything other than wine or beer is diluted or unavailable. Many of the staff are rude and the rooms were crap. The shower floods the bathroom the lights barely light the room. You will be lucky to get more than 1 towel you will be paying for your drinks after 11pm you will be writing the same review as me a week later.  Marrakech generally is an experience like no other but the hotel itself could could be so much better.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Kelly wrote a review Feb 2023,20,in no way a 4 star hotel,This hotel is barely a 3 star let alone 4. Official pictures are very generous but the reality is very different. Rooms are basic which isn‚Äôt an issue it‚Äôs just somewhere to rest your head but ours was not even clean. The bed sheets were stained the floor dirty the shower unclean the bedside table drawers had to be forced to open and were filthy inside. What 4 star hotel has dirty old plastic lawn chairs for balcony seating?    When we arrived the heating/air con unit was on full blast and over heating the room but there was no remote control to turn down the temperature. We asked 3 times for a control to turn it down and it never materialised. In the end we had to borrow one from another guest.    The food is dire it‚Äôs not just bland but mostly inedible. I will say though the bread and pastries were good. The restaurant also smells badly of grease which lingers on your clothes and hair. One night there was no cutlery or glasses to be had and staff did not seem to care.    Many of the staff were very friendly but some were just plain rude. One of our group was spoken to so rudely she made a complaint.    Wifi is very unreliable and barely works in the rooms. We also only had 1 towel between us for the first 2 days.    If you are all inclusive any drinks you want after 11pm  you have to pay for including water.    The hotel is generally run down and badly in need of refurbishment and regrading 4 stars are exceptionally misleading and not reflective of the quality or the hotel food and service.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OutofOfficeX

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,DJD wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Enjoyed our stay - will return.,Stayed in late January and our stay coincided with unseasonably cold weather so the pools restaurant and bar areas were freezing. The hotel isn't geared to cold weather although heating was provided in the rooms. Guests can use the heated pool in the sister resort next door though and there is a heated indoor pool.    Grounds and pools were superb and provided a lovely setting for the holiday. I would imagine that in spring the flowers would be fantastic.  The rooms are a bit tired but had everything that we needed and they were cleaned every day.  We found most of the staff very helpful and friendly. We arrived at 10.15 pm after the restaurant had closed and there was a plate of food ready for us - very welcome after travelling and I have never experienced that service in any other AI resort!  The odd problem we had with the room was dealt with immediately.    Some waiters in the restaurant could be a bit unhelpful at times however the animation team went out of their way to engage with guests all the time whether you were taking part in the activities or not. A lovely bunch of people who are a credit to the hotel.    We found the food very good with plenty of choice however it is generally Moroccan so be warned if you want chips burgers etc there is absolutely nothing for you and you will be disappointed (and hungry)! It wasn't labelled but that wasn't a problem - try it and if you don't like it then leave it!  The food could be improved by keeping it hotter during mealtimes though and they sometimes ran out of spoons and bowls but everything was freshly cooked and the restaurant was spotless.    The location is a bit isolated and a taxi ride to Marrakech would be about ¬£12 each way but the shuttle bus runs regularly and is only about ¬£4 return and very easy to use. Plenty of superb excursions available via the hotel or other providers.    An ATM is available in the sister hotel next doorbut it is essential to get cash at the airport when you arrive. WiFi was very good in the hotel but if you use your UK SIM out there it is very expensive so we bought a Moroccan SIM in the airport arrivals hall. Maroc Telecom - 200 Dhyram for 20 Gb but they also accept 20 Euros or ¬£20.    The biggest downside was lack of a minimart nearby. There are some shops on-site but they don't sell anything particularly useful so if you want soft drinks snacks etc you can't buy them. Also no other restaurants nearby and the in-house Moroccan and European restaurants were shut as the hotel was pretty empty. Marrakech though is amazing for restaurants of every type.  All in all we loved Morocco and Marrakech and look forward to returning soon. Apart from a few minor downsides the hotel exceeded our expectations and we will stay there again next time we go the Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/867djdd

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Curtis F wrote a review Feb 2023,40,"Good hotel, room for improvement","Was a good comfortable hotel and stayed for one week in January 2023. The grounds were lovely room was basic and bed was very comfy. WiFi worked fine overall with some outages late at night but seemed to remedy itself and worked better early in the morning. Staff were friendly enough and the entertainment crew Mario and Ayoub put a smile on our faces! Food gets quite repetitive here and would have liked more options than pain au chocolats or tagines. Bar staff need to work on their customer service skills as they took forever to serve me my beers; which were in a tiny glass smaller than a mobile phone- on one occasion the barman asked me to bring my glasses back? And some drinks aren't all-inclusive which is misleading as you should not have to pay for anything extra in an AI hotel. Shower worked fine but hairdryer was very basic so bring your own unless you want a slow experience drying your hair. Was relieved there was other English speakers on holiday there as read before this hotel caters better to French speakers but had no issue finding friends for the week or having a conversation in English. Didn't use the swimming pool as was freezing outside and nor did anybody else for that reason. I would happily return to Morocco and would recommend this hotel to other people but I am unsure if I would return to this hotel. There is no kettle in the rooms and the coffee machine in the restaurant is present at breakfast and taken away afterwards to be replaced with a choice of three soft drinks- Pepsi (was actually Coke) 7Up or Orangeade. I wish the hotel would read my review and act upon these improvements as I'm a Scotsman I find the beer portions ridiculous and think the response to a customer at the bar should always be ""no problem"" or ""yes sure"".

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Judith C wrote a review Jan 2023,50,"1st visit to Morocco, will not be my last",Before booking my 1st holiday in 4 years I of course read the reviews most being very favourable. So here we are and I have to say this is my 1st all inclusive holiday and it hasn't disappointed me at all.  As a veggy the food is lovely I wish they'd label the food but it's easy enough to ask and they're only too happy to help.  I recently read a review that was very dismissive of the entertainment staff I have to say they're talking nonsense as the staff always put on a good show so thank you to Sam Mido Kader Smiley Ayoub Fatima Oumaima Sania Rico & Amin.  The bar staff go out of their way to provide a friendly service and never cease to make you smile so thank you to Said Ahmed & Hisham.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,trvl84155 wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Winter break in the sun,A great winter break in the Moroccan sun! We got exactly what we paid for the rooms extremely clean and quite spacious the walks to breakfast in the morning with the birds in full song and orange trees lining the path very charming! The food could be better but it‚Äôs all inclusive and if you‚Äôve been AI before then you know how it is. The absolute best thing here is the staff Hicham Ahmed Said at the bar - brilliant! Sam is the entertainments manager and does the best job at leading his team huge thanks to Kadir Mido Rico Ayoube Smilie all who keep the pace going even when it‚Äôs quiet and more of a challenge thanks for making our week! You‚Äôll also find Zhouhar around near reception or in the restaurant genuinely asking how you are and how your day has been.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Dominique G wrote a review Jan 2023,20,Poor,All inclusive is not worth it the food is underwelming and the drinks are watered down on our second to last night we decided to pay for premium drinks that aren't part of the all inclusive and we actually caught them watering them down I get the impression they think we are stupid.  We went on a few excursions and the sucked the fun out of everything by milking as much money as they can out of us even though we had paid good money for them most of the staff are a bunch of chavs and all they are after is your hard earned money literally everything we did they expect to be tipped or paid for the pleasure everyday we felt we had been mugged off or robbed.  Service was bad apart from a select few staff and that is not very many.  The entertainment team are a bunch of sleeze balls that all they want to do is try it on with the hotel guests and get them back to there rooms if you are a single lady look out.  The hotel was in the middle of nowhere so there wasn't anything to do couldn't walk to a shop to get snacks ect the surrounding areas were slums.  The only good part of the holiday was the lovely sunshine but my partner and I will never return and would never recommend morocco to anyone of my friends!!!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,vic079 wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Honest Review,Went 30/12 for the New Year which I have to say was an excellent night.. Wasn't sure what to expect having read so many bad reviews. I am well travelled and stayed in 1 star to 5 star accommodation. I will try and put over my opinion based on my own experience.  There was absolutely no distinction over the French and English tourists. The attention and service was excellent. Tables set out when you went in to dine and offered wine through out your meal. We were in Morocco so no English fried breakfast but lots of nice food to choose from at every service. For those who complain about the food then stick to Benidorm.  Rooms were a bit outdated but clean. The house keeper provided clean towels loo rolls etc. every day.  Never had a problem with drinks at the bar and yes if you take your own glass they will let you use it.  For the money we paid and the service we got it was a value for money holiday.  The lady who works in the excursions office is so helpful and the trips are also great value for money.  A big shout out for the waiter called Heyub (don't know how to spell it but this is how its pronounced) he was so attentive and nothing was too much trouble.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vic079
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Kirstin G wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Good fun for family holidays,The hotel itself is an impressive building with lovely grounds areas are clean and guests are greeted with a refreshing virgin mojito. There is an entertainment team keen to get people involved and arrange activities based on interested numbers which isn't my cup of tea so I was glad to not be forced into taking part in Zumba. The food is of great quality - there is so much choice for every meal even including more expensive foods like lamb tagine or paella with extra large prawns and mussels.  The only thing to be conscious of is that this is a Muslim country and physical contact is frowned upon even in the confines of the hotel.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Earthscape_explorer
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Nikkia27 wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Great hotel with beautiful grounds,We stayed here for a Twixmas break in December - highly recommend it. Beautiful hotel and grounds lovely Hamman/spa volleyball court tennis courts indoor pool & more.    Great entertainment team and a good location.    I read a few complaints about the food before I went but actually there it was great. Note - there are no food labels on anything apart from the jams at breakfast so it's all a bit of a guessing game. I LOVED the fact that there was no English breakfasts - you're in another country so enjoy the local food! The moroccan pancakes (cooked outside) are especially super tasty for breakfast and we had lots of fresh fruits and tasty treats for dessert.    Dinner was a bit of a bun fight but there was always something I could eat - plenty of aubergines veggies a delicious chicken pie one evening and freshly carved meats.    Outside of the food we used the resort shuttle to head in to the main souk and we also did one of their tours of the markets which was good if a little rushed at the end.    We thoroughly enjoyed our break.,Date of stay: December 2022,,Berkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikkia27

They have lots of entertainment for kids like table tennis tennis football pool  darts and games for kids to join in like yoga and others. One thing that could be improved is the food which isn‚Äôt amazing and isn‚Äôt labelled.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,nicblue13 wrote a review Dec 2022,10,"Absolutely awful hotel, avoid at all costs",The hotel favours French & African people. If you are British do not come to this hotel. Our room had to be changed as it had wires hanging out of the ceiling & walls the shower didn‚Äôt work correctly. The room was dirty the balcony had no furniture etc etc where do I stop. They did change the room but not much better. The beds are so hard it‚Äôs like sleeping on plywood. The food in the restaurant is just about passable if you can actually get any. Although the restaurant states that it is open for 2 hours don‚Äôt be fooled. After the food has gone in the first 30 minutes you will then fight to get any as for all inclusive drinks you have to basically beg for a small bottle of wine at dinner and the rest of the drinks in the bars are so watered down you may as well drink water. The staff at the hotel are rude and arrogant. The entertainment is abysmal. The pools are not heated and all very basic. I couldn‚Äôt wait to leave.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Jess B wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Great family hotel for Christmas sunshine and full bellies!,After reading some negative reviews before writing this one I wondered if the authors were a) staying somewhere else or b) knobjockeys. This is a hotel in Africa with international guests where most people are not white and the food is not baked beans and hotpot - how wonderful! We've met people from Somalia Iraq Germany France and Yorkshire!  The food was excellent. My two children found something they liked and even tried new foods (but for fussy eaters you can have pasta if you want). The salad bar was great the Petit fours type desserts were great the veg meat and fish were all delicious. For reviewers complaing that they ran out of chips - stick to Butlins or Benedorm - this is not the place for you. You must ask a waiter to bring you wine (but they bring it quickly - rose was our favourite). And yes occasionally they run out of plates and you have to wait 20 seconds and go on a treasure hunt to find salt but that's all part of an all inclusive where let's face it we all become greedy animals that eat 10 courses!. Breakfast was amazing - omelette cooked to order outside boiled eggs tomatoes spicy sausages potatoes cheeses fruits yoghurt cereals and pastries - oh my god  I ate so many pain au chocolate and learnt to toast them using the toaster conveyor belt... coffee machine excellent fresh juice hot chocolate.... If you don't put on 14lbs then I don't understand how!!!  Entertainment team- if you want to avoid then you can as there's lots of beautiful gardens and sun loungers around this vast place. There's a lake with ducks and orange trees and bougainvillea everywhere. If you want to join in playing darts or learn to Belly dance then they will welcome you whole heartedly.thet are particularly good with kids. Special mention for Tash man the photographer who is genuinely lovely and interested in everyone and so friendly with all the kids. They are full of energy and probably don't get paid enough!  We were here over Christmas. There was special events and they decorated with European Christmas stuff everywhere. Santa arrived by camel with gifts for the kids a living Nativity with donkey lamb and wise men a cabaret show (think Spain 1988 - great fun). Gala dinner with seafood and turkey!  Rooms are a little tired but make the best of it - for the reviewers with their glass half full I suspect that they never have anything nice to say about anything. We came with easyJet and paid just under ¬£2000 for 4 of us and think that it's exceptional value - remember how much we've saved not buying Christmas food!  We went on two trips - Atlas mountains and central Marrakech with museum and gardens. They were great but be prepared to spend some cash on souvenirs as the driver inevitably pulls up and a knows just the shop to go to etc. But we should spend some money here - wages are not the best and the people are tolerant friendly and the souvenirs don't cost much.  We would come here for winter sun again. Pack a couple of hoodies for early morning and evening but shorts and t-shirts 12 til 5.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Sims wrote a review Dec 2022,10,LOWEST standard for a 4* hotel EVER!!,Dear Reader this hotel has got the LOWEST standard for a 4* hotel EVER!! Do NOT be fooled by the photos. We (4 Adults) booked through BA and were assured that their representatives check the hotel standard so don‚Äôt cancel based on the reviews. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth! All I can say is that there is NO standard either BA reps have had exceptional service which is not the norm or they haven‚Äôt actually visited the correct hotel. In summary this was how our 8 day stay panned out:  - This was NOT an English speaking hotel. 98% of the staff do not understand and those that claim they do nod. Even when using google translate they seem not to read French or Arabic  - Only 1 keycard for the room given. If you ask for another the original keycard is deactivated. Be prepared to play ‚Äúfollow the leader‚Äù if you share the room with family/friends  - Bed linen was not changed on a regular basis  - If we were not entertained by the Moroccan TV we could hear our neighbours‚Äô shower toilet being flushed singing and MORE!  - Body wash was refilled on rations even after asking multiple staff. On the third day when I escalated to the Hotel Rep Manager a staff member was sent (no housekeeping in the evening) and handed me a refill to replace it myself. No other toiletries are supplied!! Toilet paper is also given on rations  - Housekeeping insisted that 2 towels were sufficient for 4 adults! Had to complain at Reception and wait over an hour for more towels. Repeated almost every day!  - Room telephone was not working on arrival and after repeated requests I had to ask a technician inspecting the room key to fix it  - Crockery and cutlery left in the room was repeatedly not removed for days by housekeeping  - Ants crawling in the room due to lack of proper cleaning  - No iron ironing board or kettle. You can forget the mini-bar and any room service!  - The gym consists of 1 threadmill and 1 bike. Cost to use is 100dhr per day  - You will not get a bottle of water before 10am. This is because the mini-bar can only give water!! If you are going for an excursion remember to pick up water the night before.  - No large glasses are allowed to be given out for drinking water. These are for cocktails. Need to make multiple trips as small glasses are only used  - After asking and using google translate we were still given food containing egg!! Thankfully a serious allergy didn‚Äôt occur  - No food labelling in restaurant forget even thinking about allergens!! There is a board as your enter the restaurant in the smallest font and you will need to figure out what is what!! Chefs will smile and state they ate pork accidentally so if you eat something you don‚Äôt normally ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay‚Äù!  - Do not expect the kitchen staff to accommodate your requests. Something as simple as ‚Äòchips‚Äô took 30mins or so to negotiate. When we went back to collect them another conversation had to be restarted if they could be made?!  - No food after 9:30pm. If you catch the late shuttle back you will need to wait until breakfast. Mini-bar opens at 10am and closes at 11pm.  - There are birds cats and flies in the restaurant. Staff are standing around busy talking and not ensuring some sort of hygiene is maintained  - A single tong is used for all desserts not suitable for those who are vegetarian/vegan/other allergens. There is no concept of separate food catering for veg/non-veg i.e the same pizza cutter is used for all pizzas etc..  - Old food/bread is recycled the next day  - Temperature of food is very hit and miss. 8 times out of 10 it‚Äôs luke-warm  - Generally you are eating A LOT of the same vegetables. These are boiled courgettes/carrots saut√©ed aubergines/green peppers/grilled tomatoes.  - Our mother was told by Restaurant Management she was ‚Äúbeing watched‚Äù to pick up some salad on second trip to the restaurant. It‚Äôs supposed to be an ‚Äòall inclusive‚Äô so why approach the guest and question a small plate of food! Makes no sense?  - There were more staff eating in the restaurant than there were guests when we arrived  - Three varieties of sodas all of which are ‚Äòextremely‚Äô watered down!!  - Shuttle service last service is at 9:30pm. The timings are quite random. In our first experience we waited over 30mins to board  Finally on a light positive note the SPA is nice! We paid for 3 services and got 2 as the jacuzzi wouldn‚Äôt heat up even after being there for 90mins! You can‚Äôt have it all :),Date of stay: December 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simac251

I totally accept responsibility for my actions and I don‚Äôt mind paying for what I had done! But that was taking the biscuit! They wer very rude and wouldn‚Äôt even acknowledge us at the reception desk  As we was trying to barter with them on the price!. They said we had wait for the manager a few day later  Was very distressing for me As we was treated like criminals. But we finally did get the manager to drop the price to fifty pounds :-( Next the food was awful  there was nothing I liked and I‚Äôm not fussy and did try it all so I loved of a roll from breakfast and hard boiled egg for ten days!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Maryam A wrote a review Dec 2022,50,enjoyed stay but needs some improvement,stayed at dar atlas in November for 5 nights . We enjoyed our stay at the resort. The entertainment team was superb and kept us entertained. They would always check on us and make sure that we are involved in activities. The reception staff was great too and helped with any queries . There were few things that I thought could have been better - food was a little repetitive and finger food like chips wasn‚Äôt part of the menu. The snacks bar didn‚Äôt have much! The rooms are little dated and needs revamp. Apart from this the services were great . The shuttle service provided by the resort was great and always on time.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Russtasia wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Great family +baby-friendly hotel,This is a great family hotel. We stayed for 10 days (a 6-months old baby parents and grandparents). Went all-inclusive in November 2022.  - Animators work tirelessly to create a fun and joyful environment. Lots of daily activities from darts to football to dance classes and diverse shows/ performances.  - Food was good. Some comments say that there are no signs making it hard to pick what you want to eat. They have attempted to fix it by putting signs (occasionally) although if you ask you almost always get a response. Breakfast foods are always the same (all you need really) however lunch and dinner foods varied. Some of us don‚Äôt eat meat and for sure didn‚Äôt go starving.  - Rooms are a little outdated however really comfortable and spacious. Cleaning was done daily. The hotel complex is really nicely set out.  - Wifi was good for us in the rooms and on the premises. Good enough for Zoom/ Skype calls watching videos social media etc.  - Perfect hotel for a ‚Äòlazy‚Äô holiday if you want to chill eat dance and sleep next to the pool.,Date of stay: November 2022,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Russtasia

Room was perfect nice terrace overlooking the tennis courts very clean room thanks to the maid service. Hotel facilities were great... two gorgeous pools one lively and once quiet. The entertainment team were very helpful and fun. Thanks to the team who showed us how to cook using Moroccan tagine the stretching and dance classes and the daily theme tune dance around the pool. We loved the tennis facilities petanque courts. Food was good... especially the salads and also via the hotplate meals team. Omelettes and pizza's were delish. Thanks. We stayed all inclusive and the bar staff were helpful and friendly. Acholic and non acholic cocktails coffee regular and Moroccan tea on tap all day and night. If you live sweet patisseries they had loads of tasty cakes and puddings.. Easy to book trips and shuttles to and from the City. Fabulous day temperatures for November.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Aisha R wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Enjoyed it but average,First of all the staff that greeted us were all extremely friendly no complaints there at all. There was one staff member in particular who was always coming around and asking all the families how we were doing which was a really nice touch. The one thing this hotel need to improve on is food as for the 5 days we were there they didnt have any child friendly food no chips/fires whatsoever. Therefore my child had to eat pasta for 5 days straight! We did ask the staff member to see if they could include chips in the menu and he said he tried his best but they didn't include it which was fine but still disappointing as my child was asking for them and he is autistic. Granted I should've done my research before going but I had heard from several people that the food was suitable for fussy eaters. I completely disagree as even I and my parents were restricted with what to eat. Most days we would survive on fruit bread and butter. The snack bar wasn't great either they only had soggy pancakes which a runny chocolate sauce and reheated pastries from the morning which were lacklustre. Instead of including savouries in the snack bar it was all sweet stuff. Another thing that they could improve on was that they kept running out of plates bowls and cutlery. We were constantly having to ask some of the staff to bring more bowls etc out. The staff were helpful and did so but if there was enough out they wouldn't have to go through the hassle.  Rooms were clean and tidy no complaints.  Overall it is a nice hotel but a few areas could do with improving.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760aishar
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,vicksg wrote a review Nov 2022,50,"Wonderful solo stay, perfect choice for a relaxing break",I booked my first ever solo holiday and chose Dar Atlas from its excellent reviews and the strength of its entertainment team. If I was going to be alone all the time at least I'd have lots of activities to join in with.  What a great decision I made! The ents team are simply brilliant and there is always something to do despite it being off season and fairly quiet in the hotel. I would like to specifically mention Rico Kimo Youseff and Amin but they are all great.  All the staff were lovely. I had a bar man at each bar who spoilt me rotten (Ahmed and Salah) as did my evening waiter Mahmoud.  As mentioned the rooms are a little tired but they are scrupulously clean and comfortable. I did turn my mini fridge off as it made a little popping sound in the night. If you have rooms near the pool you will hear the noise of the entertainment but this always finishes by 11pm at the latest.  There is a main pool with a children's pool and then hidden away is the wonderful Zen pool which is extremely quiet and empty (at least in November). It was great to have the choice.  The drinks aren't great. A short list of cocktails none of which tend to taste much of alcohol. No classics like Pina colada are included but are available to purchase. 1 beer on tap and 1 choice of wine in each colour (none of which were particularly lovely). I read a review saying they will serve you in a tiny paper cup by the pool so I made sure to take my own (small - so I wasn't taking the p***) plastic cup which turned out to be a genius move.  The pools are unheated so pretty cold but I've known worse and I did manage a swim/float every day.  Transfer time from the airport is very quick. I booked with easyJet holidays and from start to finish everything was perfect.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AND I hope the Manager / Owner reads this and rewards his/her wonderful staff for their hard work dedication and sense of fun.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicksg

When we arrived at the hotel we were welcomed with warm greetings from every staff member to give you a little back story we had a tough time arriving in Marrakech we lost a day of our holiday and we lost our luggage and needed help to contact the airport since my cousin had arrived before us she had let the hotel know what had happened and they straight away were on it to help us solve our problems. (Zahir) one of the managers at the hotel had helped us get a taxi to the pharmacy to get medication that we needed to get for some of the adults in the group and also let us his personal phone to contact the airport since it would have charged us a stupid amount. Honestly so grateful to have staff members like them because I know most hotels would not consider it to be their problem. Every evening they would host events such as karaoke and dancing and much more entertainment for everyone no matter how old you were you still enjoyed it all they had activities during the day such as water aerobics volleyball darts belly dancing and also would show people different parts of their culture so you learn so much. All the staff members: were so nice to us and would talk to you every time they see you even would sit down with you and have lunch/ dinner with you when they had their breaks. I mean honestly what kind of hotel staff would do that it was literally the nicest thing ever. literally the most down-to-earth people ever everyone was so nice and anyone to tell me otherwise is lying the food and drinks were amazing. They also have a water park next door and to get to clubs and to the markets weren't that far away overall it was an 11/10 experience best believe I will be back again and will for sure be staying at that hotel again. shout out to Zahir and Ayoub there are a few more people but I'm rubbish with names if you guys see this you guys are AMAZING thank you so much for the best holiday I've had so far so much love for you guys!,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anjali062

It doesn't take much to be civil and respectful to another human.    We liked the helpful reception staff the always-busy bar staff and the smiling entertainment team; who were always around to answer questions or assist.    The rooms were clean well presented and big enough to not feel cramped.    The complex itself was well maintained with flowers and water features aplenty.    The inclusive food was perfectly edible with some nice special dishes.    One thing I did not like was the abundance of flies and wasps over all the food.    I'd like to think some bug-zapper lighting around the food or sealing it within accessible containers would help that more.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ellie F wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Lovely hotel - food a massive let down,Lovely hotel - could do with being finished to a higher standard but the grounds are beautiful  Different pool options both are large pools one with entertainment and one quiet. Entertainment team are there throughout the day and there are plenty of activities to keep you busy - team are lovely but very enthusiastic and do encourage you to join in. Evening entertainment fab for children and they have different themed evenings. Halloween night entertainment was brilliant. Members of the team youseef smiley and Rico very friendly and always asked how we were enjoying our holiday. This is a very entertainment focused hotel so perhaps if looking for a quiet relaxing holiday maybe go elsewhere.  Food was not the best mostly the same food every day and little to no vegetarian options. None of the food is labelled also. One of my friends was ill during our visit and dreaded the food on the last few days.  Room was nice and spacious with 2 balconies although there was lots of ants. We had issues with one of the light bulbs and air con not working but when we reported these they were rectified quickly.  Cups for drinks are very smalls and there‚Äôs lots of bees so I would recommend maybe bringing your own cup with lid.  Really enjoyed the trip into Marrakech and the camel riding however the booking experience through the excursion shop was not the easiest. We had been booked onto the wrong bus through no fault of our own a female member of the travel team was very rude and made us get off the minibus only to then let more people on and tell us we could get back on and try and stand. This was very embarrassing and the low point of our holiday and that particular member of staff did not deal with the issue in an appropriate manner telling us it ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt her problem‚Äô. The gentlemen at the desk who had originally made the mistake was very apologetic and did eventually get the issue sorted for us.  Rooms were cleaned every day to a high standard although bed sheets were never changed but we didn‚Äôt find this to be a problem.  There‚Äôs a shop on site that sells ice creams souvenirs clothes and a limited selection of snacks.  All in all we did really enjoy our holiday and will definitely plan a return trip to Marrakech but we will not be returning to this hotel this is almost all down to the food which let the hotel down.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/934ellief

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,kathryn r wrote a review Nov 2022,20,Valeria Dar Atlas Resort (Unfortunately I do not recommend),Beautiful grounds to the Hotel and lovely reception area. The room needed attention as none of the corners or behind doors had been cleaned with cobwebs and bits on the floor that had clearly been there some time. Bathroom generally needed upgrading though everything (except the hairdryer) worked. This was reported several times though there was a language barrier basically take your own hair dryer! Once towels had been used housekeeping would remove them however they were not replaced until late afternoon. This was a huge problem if you were planning to go out early and had no towels to shower. Reception were contacted several times though each time we were told they would arrive later! Pool areas kept clean and tidy though the main pool was quite noisy all day there was another pool which was for adults only which was lovely and relaxing. Went to the spa had a massage which was relaxing. The spa also needs upgrading. Huge selection of food which was well presented though myself and a number of other guests had upset stomachs while we were there which continued after arriving back home( though apparently Marrakech is known for this) !!  The team who organised the tours were very helpful and we enjoyed a number of tours. Don't be put off by how intense the Souks can be go on a group tour to start with be cautious be bold and enjoy. Please don't engage with any of the traders in the main square with monkey's and snake's it's beyond cruel and completely unethical in this day and age!  In all it's ok? not quite acceptable! I understand the world is coming out of a pandemic and money is tight however... some money needs throwing at this hotel and I'm sure it could be turned around. Housekeeping needs much more attention!  Just remember if you can't boil it peel it or if it isn't in a sealed bottle.. definitely DONOT eat or drink it!!!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stafford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathrynr462
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Lisa R wrote a review Nov 2022,40,"A good resort for an pool side, lazy holiday",Context: 30 year old couple from England. Pretty relaxed and make the most of things whatever the case.  Check in and room:  We spent 4 nights at this resort. When we arrived check in was advertised as 2pm however we couldn‚Äôt check in until 3:30pm with the excuse being that the rooms wasn‚Äôt ready because they were ‚Äòfully booked‚Äô. It seemed we were forgotten about as everyone else had checked in and we were still waiting. After pestering reception 3 times they reluctantly switched us to another room which was ready. We were given our key but no further information on how to find the room. Once we‚Äôd located our room we were met by an invasion of ants over the floor and up the walls. Apart from that the room was clean. We let reception know about the ants but the problem wasn‚Äôt rectified until the next day. No towels in the room when we first arrived and we had to wait for these - I assume they were washing them from previous guests. There is no bottle water in the room but this is available from all the bars in the resort.  Pool:  Pool towels are available to hire for 100dhs each for the duration of your stay however make sure you get there at 10am to get a towel as by the afternoon there won‚Äôt be any left and you‚Äôll be told to come back in the morning. The pool water was very clean but cold. Lots of sun loungers available but lacking in parasols.  Food:  All inclusive food is very average with very similar options each day. There is an outside serving area which we didn‚Äôt discover until day two. There are no food labels. The restaurant was often over crowded and lacking in cutlery and bottled water. Once tables had been used they didn‚Äôt seem to be replenished or cleaned for the next person. Drink cups are tiny in the restaurant and bar. Many drink options included in the all inclusive deal. Bar snacks consisted of pancakes daily - you didn‚Äôt have a choice of snacks.  Entertainment:  The best asset for this hotel. The animation team work tirelessly to ensure guests have a great experience throughout their stay. We went around and on Halloween so there were a lot of special events and shows happening. There‚Äôs something going on at all times from aqua aerobics to yoga to card games. There‚Äôs lots of entertainment for kids and all the staff are brilliant with them. There is a show each night for guests which is a lot of fun. A shout out to Rico and Sam for their energy and fun throughout our stay. There are also football tables and a pool table but this costs extra to use (coins).  AOB:  WiFi not great and not really reachable in the rooms. Very remote location with a few shops as you enter the resort. Very limited snacks in the shop in the form of crisps etc. There was a currency exchange desk at the hotel where you can change GBP into dhs.  We stayed in the premium resort as we assumed all the families and kids would go to the family resort across the road - this wasn‚Äôt the case. There were a lot of kids around at all times.    Aside from these issues we had a great time and stay. These points are particularly harsh but I would have found these points helpful when booking and could be a deal breaker for some.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisarH5591AG

Special mention to the animation team (especially Kimo & Sam) the main and pool bar staff (again the lads in pool bar who desperately tried to teach me some Arabic) and Zouhair (ask him to do his card tricks). The hotel itself was basic but clean but the staff made this hotel/holiday.  Yes it can get busy at lunch and dinner but the staff will always help and find you clean plates cutlery etc so never an issue. Could not fault any of the staff and they made this holiday a great one.    If I had to say any negatives and the only reason it didn‚Äôt get the full 5 stars it would be the food wasn‚Äôt great but could generally find something pool wasn‚Äôt heated and they served the pool drinks in an espresso size paper cup (yes they ran out of vodka and beer whilst there but not for long) but never had an issue with sun beds - no 5am wake up call needed. Still plenty at 9-10am and later.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Alpa wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Poor Resort,Catering - We arrived at the resort after the dining hall had closed and asked if we could get some food. We had mentioned at reception that we are all vegetarian. The staff provided us with a platter each which had tuna and chicken on it. Having called the waiter over to ask them to remove the meat they told us it wasn't meat/it was halal.... They provided us with another plate - which still came with meat on it. We gave up.  At all mealtimes it‚Äôs a challenge to find any cutlery or cups to drink in. During breakfast times the yogurt pastries and honey were always accompanied by wasps which the staff did not try and eliminate. The cups are chipped. The good fruit would be sparse and if you didn't get to the dining hall for opening time - you would miss out.  We also found one of us sitting on a broken seat at breakfast one morning!  The meals themselves were an OK quality however you would not want to eat after seeing what you do at breakfast. If you walk into the dining hall 30mins after opening most of the food is gone anyway.    We had ordered a cake for a 5th Birthday which we had to repeatedly ask for on the night - the staff told us it‚Äôs on its way. The cake was presented an hour late and was also one that was created for a 70th anniversary. However we were still charged for the cake and the hotel manager refused to provide a refund.  However they did try and rectify this by providing us with 'free drinks' but the attitude of the staff did not make us comfortable. It was evident that they are short staffed.    The rooms are of an OK standard in our room we were two towels short so had asked to extra towels. We again found ourselves asking for towels about 4 times per day and had them provided on the third day as we refused to leave the reception desk until they were provided.  The toilet roll holder in our room was broken with no effort to fix and we found ourselves walking into the toilet with giant ants all over the floor one evening.    We had provided a deposit for pool towels. But when presenting our receipt at the pool kiosk we were told they are out of towels. The next day we went again at 9.30 am and were again told the same. After speaking with reception they advised they couldn't do anything about this. So we asked for a refund on our deposit - which we did get.    The guest‚Äôs native language is categorized by the colour of the band you wear. We did find that those that spoke Arabic or French would get a favorable service.    Overall we mostly stayed out of the hotel and only used it as a base to sleep! Will not be going back to this resort. It‚Äôs not of a 4-star standard and is pushing it at a 3 star. The hotel lacks communication between staff lacks basic hygiene and is extremely dis-organised.    Would not recommend...,Date of stay: October 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alpav3008

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,SusanBFraserburgh wrote a review Oct 2022,40,"Great resort for the price you pay, however they need to purchase more cutlery and glasses!!",I travelled to the Valeria Dar Atlas Resort in September with 3 other friends. When we arrived at the resort it was in the early hours of the morning and the hotel had a cold supper waiting for us which I thought was very nice. The room which was situated in accommodation blocks was a double room leading off to another room with two single beds. There was a shower and a seperate toilet which worked out well with 4 of us sharing. There was 2 balconies which was great and the room was clean and well equiped. The pool area was spacious with a lovely sized pool and you can pay a deposit to have a clean towel everyday and at the end of your stay you get your money back. The food was good with a plentiful selection each day. The entertainment team were really friendly and they took time each day to go round to speak to everyone which was nice. The entertainment was good also but perhaps a change of entertainment away from the entertainment team some evenings would be welcomed. The hotel staff we met were very friendly and for the money we paid for our holiday this resort was really good value for money. Being with my 3 friends we had a great time and lots of laughs. The only thing that I would say on the negative is that the size of the drinks was not the best. Watching the bar staff pour drinks sometimes it certainly wasn't a british sized nip that was being recieved. Also they use really little paper cups for drinks at the pool they need to get bigger cups. The size of the wine measures was great though. In the evenings there was quite a queue at the bar so they could have made preparation for more bar staff. The other negative is that every evening there apppeared to be a shortage of cutlery and glasses which was very inconvenient. The dining room was often very hot and we were told that the air conditioning was broken at the time of our visit. The hotel really do not to get better with drink sizes and purchase more cutlery and glasses but apart from that it was a nice resort and good value for money.,Date of stay: September 2022,,Fraserburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanBFraserburgh
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Sara wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Fantastic holiday!,We can‚Äôt believe the bad review! This holiday was perfect for our 4 girl holiday. Nothing was ever too much trouble for the animation/house keeping teams.    On arrival we checked in easy and got some lunch. Our rooms were ready and a member of staff carried our bags to our room - when i say room it was basically a little apartment 1 double bed and 2 single beds two balcony‚Äôs and a separate toilet and shower which worked well for 4 girls.    We enjoyed walking around the complex and loved the pond with the ducks the head of consumer experience took us on a tour around. In the evenings we enjoyed cocktails (ignore the comments about price - there is always a all inclusive option to everything if you want to pay extra you can but we didn‚Äôt see the point) - you can get vodka/gin/whisky/ wine and beer inclusive - there inclusive non alcoholic cocktails and alcoholic cocktails.    The dinners were always great - large amount of choice - our group had a wide range of dietary requirements / vegan/ veggie and a fussy eater and we always could get some food - however stuff isn‚Äôt always labeled but there‚Äôs always a member of staff behind the counters to ask. the deserts were a work of art I can‚Äôt believe that they were so many of them!    Breakfasts had a fresh omelette/egg maker and pancake/donut maker (outside on the patio) the flatbreads with the marmalade with fresh oranges were a good choice. always available is fresh morrocon tea.    the pools - there is 2 main pools at this hotel one with activities like yoga/water aerobics and one called the zen pool for quieter experience. You can only get soft drinks/water/tea and cofffee at the zen pool no alcohol as they want to make this a calm environment.    we enjoyed the activity like a cooking demonstration/ morrocon tea tasting.    You can use the facilities at the hotel next door (literally 2 mins walk) it has a fantastic water park to visit at least one of the days and another pool next door to use if you choose    Lunch was a wide range of things - they always had pizza/burger and chips for people who are after that kind of thing.    evening activities were great/ there was quizzes and even a nightclub to visit.    top tip    - bring our own cup (we got one of them large cups with a lid with a straw) staff will fill them for you so you can have a proper cup of beer or a cocktail or vodka coke / instead of the small paper cups they give you ( there‚Äôs no glass around the pool so everyone has small paper cups which can be a pain)    - maybe pick up some alcohol in the airport / we got a Bacardi. You can get non alcohol mojito‚Äòs and add your own bacardi in the evenings. i do think they water down there own spirts - the only night we felt abit tipsey was using own one alcohol instead of the hotels. However i think this is normal for this price all inclusive.    - The Azar restaurant is lovely in marrakesh if you what a fancy meal out of the hotel one night - the hotel can book you taxis or you can get the hotel shuttle bus    - they do offer beach towels for ¬£10 deposit however they weren‚Äôt always ready early morning as the laundry doesn‚Äôt arrive back until later on in the day - probs best to get a cheap beach towel if you can fit it in your bags    - there‚Äôs some small shops in the hotel which you can get sun cream from but they are expensive    for the price of this hotel we had a fanatic holiday - and honestly I think we would all go back if we were looking to go to marrakesh again.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Go11179856186
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Caroline S wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Lacking in alcohol and cutlery.,We are currently staying and would advise people to bring their own cutlery Every day we have to try and find a table that has been cleared as the staff are slow. Once you have found a table you then start the hunt to find cutlery there is never any forks.... and the plates/bowls are chipped. Staff do not seem to be organised or able to relay a table once cleared. The flies are swarming all over the pastries in the mornings and no one seems to take any notice there is no prevention measures.  For the 2nd day running they have run out of the local vodka (yesterday it was by lunch time). Have to question how the hotel can't get the ordering correct and the staff don't seem to care. So for an all inclusive you aren't getting what you have paid for.....  Air conditioning unit in bedroom is extremely noisy sounds like it is going to fall off the wall and have to turn it off when we actually go to sleep......,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Farnham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineS314
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,nanasmurf68 wrote a review Oct 2022,20,"Avoid this hotel, there are far better out there!",On entering the resort and being escorted to our room our first impression was ‚Äòthis hotel is in need of TLC‚Äô. The water features along the walkway were dry and left open a trip or stumble would lead to a severe injury but it just looked unsightly. When we entered our room it was dark small and certainly not what we‚Äôd expected. The bathroom was dark and to be honest not what we‚Äôre used to. The whole bathroom needs updating and a thorough clean. The bathroom would flood every time we showered. My husband is recovering from a torn Achilles and it was extremely unsafe for him.  No tea making facilities in the room. We always bring our own tea bags and coffee but could not make drink.  Repetitive food daily butter for bread in the mornings was scarce. No alcoholic drinks other than wine allowed in the dining room unless you brought it in yourself which you are not initially told. Chipped crockery extremely dangerous and lack of tea spoons.  No fly covers or electric fly zappers over food. Food was crawling with flies and wasps. No showers by the main pool. The best thing was the staff who were lovely and the weather which was beautiful. This is our fourth visit to Marrakesh and was nearly our last because of this experience. BUT we will return to previous hotels that we‚Äôve visited.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baldock, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanasmurf68
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Gabby L wrote a review Oct 2022,40,A good stay for the price you pay,Let me start off by saying that after reading the reviews we came on holiday with an open mind & to be honest we weren‚Äôt expecting much.    To be honest we were impressed by the majority of things on this holiday. I‚Äôd read a number of reviews saying that the staff were rude and unapproachable we found this to be completely untrue. We checked in were given our wristbands and shown to our room. Yes there were different wristbands for the English and the French but I don‚Äôt think that altered the way we were treated. Everyone would talk to you and everyone was incredibly friendly.    We never really got involved with any of the entertainment as that‚Äôs not really our thing however all of the animation staff were incredible & ensured everyone was always smiling. In the evening they made an effort to ensure as many people as possible were getting involved.    There are two pools the main pool & the zen pool which is adults only. We split our time between the two however the zen pool ended up being our favourite due to how calm it was. The only thing I will say is there was no alcohol served at the zen pool unless you paid for it. When we‚Äôve paid for an all inclusive we didn‚Äôt really want to have to pay for any drinks and so drank soft drinks on the days we spent there.    On the subject of alcohol the drinks were incredibly watered down and you were given small paper cups that must‚Äôve only had about 2 sips in each. Myself and my partner were drinking all day yet we felt as if we hadn‚Äôt drunk anything at all.    The all inclusive drinks also end at 11pm every night which I found odd however we never stayed as long as this so it didn‚Äôt affect us really.    The rooms were clean and spacious. Nothing crazy to shout about but nothing awful either.    The food was fine and it was pretty standard for an all inclusive holiday. There was always a good variety and we never went hungry. The only thing was the wasps flying around the food especially in the mornings. However towards the end of our stay the staff ended up shutting the restaurant doors and this definitely helped the issue.    We also enjoyed a Hamman at the spa during our stay which was definitely worth it.    The hotel is quite far out of the city however the hotel offers a shuttle service which I believe takes you straight to the medina. There is also an excursions office however we found it cheaper to book online either through TripAdvisor or Viator. We went on a sunset camel ride which we both thoroughly enjoyed.    Overall we both enjoyed our holiday and we were super lucky with the weather too. It was never going to be a 5-star holiday for us but I think 4-star is completely reasonable. Plus for the price we paid we could never really argue with the experience we had.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761gabbyl

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,hkaur2 wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Ok for 5 night stay,Was unsure as the reviews are mixed but I was happy. Food choice is excellent but they really need to do something about the wasps and flies around the food. This is not hygienic. Flies carry disease.simple enough to solve; cover the food and set fly traps. Staff are very good and welcoming. Biggest gripe is with housekeeping. Took us so many asks to get the soap dispenser refilled. Then there‚Äôs the towel situation. In this resort they enter your room on three separate occasions: once to remove all the towels then to make the bed then to replace the towels. The only problem is the towels are taken in the morning and not replaced until after 3. So if you want a shower between collection and 3 you can‚Äôt. This became a real issue for us. They clearly need more towels!! The entertainment is ok but we‚Äôre not keen on that type of thing. Massage was very expensive and not very good. Would not recommend. Also you have to pay for the shuttle bus (not mentioned ) 2 dhirams there and 2 back. The bus times are quite rigid.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hkaur2
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,John B wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Fawlty Towers re-incarnated,Hotel was clean but very basic. The rooms we had were twins with a third bed/day bed TV and nothing else. The area outside the patio door only had a single chair after 'borrowing it' from a friend's room.  First evening (this is an all-inclusive deal) the bar ran out of beer!? And again on the second night - at least they got some cans in later in the week. Also ran out of ice a couple of times. The pool bar was supposed to be open until 4pm (ideal for those of us who played golf) but it was hard work trying to get any food out of them - no menu take what is dished up.  5th morning in they decided to mop the foyer area and basically stopped all access which makes it difficult to get to the loos near reception AND difficult to get prepared for a trip out. When I say mopped I mean flooding with buckets of water and then mopping it up and the water came from the fountain in the enclosed courtyard!! And whilst this was going on doors were barred with 'slippery floor' type signs.  Some of the staff tried some of the staff didn't care. One of our group had dirty sheets on one of the twin beds they came and stripped them - then left the unmade bed for 5 days.  For British readers let's just imagine that Basil Fawlty was in charge - that sums it all up!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Luton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Golferat29

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Dan R wrote a review Oct 2022,20,You get what you pay for,Upon arrival you have to pay the tourist tax which luckily we had cash to pay for after reading a few reviews before travelling. Upon check-in you're given 1 key card and a sheet of paper with the times for food etc. We had been put in the furthest block away 1907 I noticed certain guests (French) being shown to the room however being English we had to walk ourselves.    Once we got to the room it was reasonably sized with a mini-fridge ideal for water no towels in the room and we had to wait nearly 5 hours for them the safe didn't work either in our room.    The rooms serve a purpose but we didn't have any chairs or a table outside on the balcony area & the room is littered with ants the mattresses are rather hard so unless you're used to this it takes a while to get used to this. Aircon works for about 10 minutes and then doesn't really serve a purpose.    On the first 2 nights we found a few bar staff rude but not everyone some would be really helpful and go out of the way. After the first 2 nights a young manager came in to speak to the guests and we noticed a real difference he seems to care about all guests and would spend a good 5/10 minutes chatting to you to ensure you're having a good time!    Food is basic breakfast everything is swarming in flies/wasps I am not a fussy eater but found myself eating the basic foods. Drinks are poor served in small cups and often the beer would run out spirits seem watered down from when the bars open to close me and my girlfriend would pretty much drink during all of the hours but yet still felt like we had not had a drink.    After the new manager came in you really could see the difference and I hope he manages to improve the hotel as you could see the signs it was getting better.    But for what we paid for a week it's nice to be away in the good weather.,Date of stay: October 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8465HBdanr
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Tommy9776 wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Not a 4 star.,I‚Äôll try to keep this to the point.    On arrival we had no towels the safe wasn‚Äôt working and the AC was terrible. I reported this to reception we got towels. Nothing else was fixed. I reported again and again nothing was done. I never slept under my covers once. It was horrible.    The room was basic but no big deal I‚Äôve no idea why some reviews are saying really clean I was say a very basic standard of cleanliness ants as part of the furniture. The food was ok no complaints really.    The drink was as bad as it comes. The wine from the restaurant was the only thing worth drinking even tho you weren‚Äôt allowed to take open bottles out of the restaurant to drink in the bar. (Everyone seemed to do this)    The bar closed at 11 forcing you to leave.    The staff I had no real complaints but if you‚Äôre French or you tip well you get what u want. It was actually embarrassing at times.    The outside bar the cups are terrible and again if u tip you don‚Äôt need to ask for a drink they give you it. Even tho others standing waiting. This seriously needs to be looked at. I tip for good service not before.    The entertainment team were excellent tho my group never really got involved but it was good to watch.    This isn‚Äôt a 4 star and I‚Äôm not being harsh. It‚Äôs more like a 3 star (even that‚Äôs a push)    A wee point I did spk to the new manager and he arrived while we were there.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Gina M wrote a review Oct 2022,30,A lengthy but fair review! Please read!,To set the tone I am not a frequent all inclusive holiday attendee so this would be particularly helpful for those like me. Manage your expectations .. if you aren‚Äôt used to an all inclusive experience you will have a shock! However firstly addressing the comments on rude staff. We didn‚Äôt encounter a single member of staff who was rude or unhelpful! They are all fantastic with welcoming smiles and fabulous manners I cannot fault them.    Food - as a vegetarian we struggled enormously! It is heavily meat & fish based (expected in this country) however in this day and age I would expect more accommodation to suit! We did however mention this to reception and found that there was more variety thereafter but if you‚Äôre looking for food that actually tastes nice this isn‚Äôt the place. A salad bar is available but it‚Äôs more or less the same every night and the likes of lettuce and cucumber grows tiresome. The reviews of wasps surrounding the pastries at breakfast are true I don‚Äôt understand why nets wouldn‚Äôt be covering these so we steered away from them. The puddings are fabulous the bread also! There is pizza freshly made outside which is nice and honestly was our survival food at lunch! If you don‚Äôt eat carbs regularly you will feel terribly bloated after each meal. Food times are: breakfast 7:30-10:30 Lunch 12:30-2:30 Dinner 7:30-9:30! This is a long wait until dinner so people are queued in the lobby bar until the doors open. Queue the masses.  To reinforce the issue is the food NOT the staff!    Pools - we frequented the Zen pool everyday as we were searching for a relaxing holiday. It is more quiet than the main pool however the only difference is the music not how much people talk! Again not a hotel issue these are the guests (mainly the French) I do see what other reviews mean when they refer to the French experiencing a different holiday yet I don‚Äôt believe this is due to staff preference. This seems to be because the staff all speak French being Moroccan of course! So I wouldn‚Äôt let that sway you.    The rooms are well situated we were in the 1200 block which was far enough away to not be disturbed by any evening entertainment when retiring to sleep. The rooms are dated no denying it but ours was clean and everything worked! Can‚Äôt speak to other rooms but ours was fine and if you wanted to change rooms I had heard from another guest that they are happy to accommodate. Don‚Äôt expect a swanky penthouse suite or anything but they are certainly suitable for the intended purpose! The hairdryer is small and old I would bring your own as I did if you blow dry your hair properly with a round brush for example as you‚Äôll be stood there for ages trying to dry your hair! Towels are collected in the morning from your room restocked at 4:30. You do need a ¬£10 deposit per person for pool towels they only accept cash! There is an ATM machine in the neighbouring hotel if you did not arrive with cash.    Drinks & snacks - if you are all inclusive you will have full access to all drinks however at the Zen pool all you can get is water & soft drinks. Cocktails here are chargeable which is mis-advertised! The snack bar is by the main pool and the food is essentially left over lunch so don‚Äôt count on this for any afternoon nibbles! We took a pizza from the oven at lunch and stored it in our room fridge as our afternoon snack! The reviews mentioning small cups are true we brought our own solo cups and found no trouble but we did only drink bottled water all day.    Evening entertainment - I can‚Äôt speak to this as we weren't interested in this portion of the holiday however my understanding from other guests is the staff are great and if you are looking for a lovely evening they have different themed nights for you to enjoy!    The transfer is 30 mins from Menara Airport where we had a personal driver take us when we only booked a shuttle so don‚Äôt waste extra money on a private taxi! You get it anyway!    Also if you have a heart you‚Äôll be saddened by the cats and dogs that live here but are essentially strays. The cats do venture through the dinner hall in the evenings which I am more than happy with as a dedicated animal lover however not everyone shares my opinion. The dogs mind their own business but this displays as fear of people I fed two of the dogs and they were ravenous so I don‚Äôt think they are cared for and they hid behind the bushes any time someone walked by. For me this was particularly difficult to stomach but again not everyone shares this opinion and this would be found in most hotels. So that one is just for the animal lovers!    Overall for what we paid for a week including flights it was what you would expect. Everything is clean and the staff are very polite and helpful so if all you want is a fly and flop holiday and you aren‚Äôt a vegetarian this would be suitable! Had we of had better weather this would have been a better holiday but that obviously is just down to luck!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginamR2344LM
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Keenan F wrote a review Oct 2022,10,"Mis sold, mis treated,",We stay at the Valeria dar atlas resort 5th of October to the 13th of October it was our first holiday for the year and was super excited to get away however when we arrived we have been met with small inconveniences that have built up over time causing us to not enjoy our holiday as we should have.    Upon arriving at 10:30am ish and our documents stating there is no check in time due to covid they told us we would have to wait until 12:30 before we could check in. We were given a sheet about food times and drink time and sent on our way. We had to ask other guests as to where the toilets are to get changed we were sat around the pool with our bags with no offer of storing them somewhere. We later have seen other guests storing bags at reception.    Once we got into our room we had 2 single beds pushed together after booking a double room. We was shown how the air con works but it just kept leaking all over the floor. Both of these things were reported to reception however the bed wasn‚Äôt rectified until 10th of October when they made the 2 singles up into a double. And despite multiple complaints about the air con it hasn‚Äôt been fixed and now leaks when switched off. We had to use towels to stop the water going all over the floor and the water even leaked on to some clothes leaving dirty marks.    It states that snacks are served at 2:30pm until 3:30pm but there hasn‚Äôt been any. The late breakfast and coffee break are just left over pastry‚Äôs from breakfast which are covered in flies and wasps during the morning as they aren‚Äôt covered for breakfast service!    The food has a good selection but can sometimes be very repetitive and it seems like lunch left overs are severed again at dinner. They keep running out of cutlery and glasses and just don‚Äôt seem to be able to keep up with the demand. Some of the staff are fantastic but others are getting back handed tips and are setting up ice buckets and nice tables for those who have paid them. If you ask for one then you are told they have ‚Äòrun out‚Äô.    In the restaurant both inside and out you‚Äôre greeted to flies on the food and cats and dogs roaming around constantly which isn‚Äôt good from a health and safety standpoint.    The beer goes off at the snack bar at 5pm everyday however if you‚Äôre French they keep serving you. The hotel uses different coloured wrist bands for the French and British. They serve the drinks in small paper cups and only allow you to take two at a time. By the time you‚Äôve sat back down the cups are giving way and are about to break. You have two mouth fulls and your drink is gone.    The hotel has 2 pools. The adult only one won‚Äôt serve you alcohol and makes you pay extra despite us been all inclusive. We were never told that this was excluded from the all inclusive.    The bar states it‚Äôs open until 12am but all inclusive drinks end at 11pm and you have to purchase drinks from them after 11pm however the bar has been closing bang on 11pm with not been able to purchase more drinks. The staff start putting all the table and chairs away around you making you feel like you have to leave and go to bed.    Some staff are great however others will just ignore you. When with my partner no staff from the entertainment team would speak to us however when my partners is on her own they always come and speak to her.    A water park is advertised at the hotel however is at the sister hotel a 10 min walk. This was never advertised when booking only told this when we asked at the reception.    There‚Äôs towel hire however they don‚Äôt have enough for all guests. We went to hire some at 11am and was told to come back at 4:30pm as they didn‚Äôt have any for 3 days they didn‚Äôt have any so had to use ones from the room.    Certain guest have been given better treatment over others. It seems to be the French who have been made to feel more welcome. A coach came into the hotel with more guest and the hotel brought more staff in and set up a red carpet and really made their welcome special hot towels tea music drinks ect where as others have been left to find there own way and like us left sat with luggage around the pool.    The biggest problem we had is on the last day when it came down to settle the bill. I proposed to my partner while on the holiday and asked the hotels photographer to take photos of the event of which he agreed. He wanted to charge ‚Ç¨100 for said photos. After going through the photos we chose only two as the quality of the photos were very poor. He added the charge of ‚Ç¨100 to the room and expected us to pay that for the 2 photos printed and a digital copy of the rest. We received the printed photos but not the digital. We agreed that we would pay for the prints and did so but the photographer demanded the prints back and the hotel had to give us a refund. This has really upset me and my partner as those were photos to treasure of our engagement and we will never get those back. As you can imagine this has absolutely ruined the last day of our holiday and really has made the whole experience a negative one.    As you can see they are all small things that if only one of them was happening then it would be fine but as you can see it‚Äôs been multiple different incidents one after the other that‚Äôs not only been effecting us but many other guest as we have been speaking to others. It‚Äôs made the holiday less enjoyable it‚Äôs made me feel like I‚Äôve been at an inconvenience because I‚Äôve constantly had to ask for things that should have automatically been included. As a result I will not be returning to the hotel again. The hotel is rated 4 stars but in my opinion it needs to be reassessed as it‚Äôs not a 4 star hotel.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/780keenan

There was a great mix of action and tranquility you decide which you'd prefer. The resort was quite large but felt intimate and safe. Staff were great. Entertainment was interesting but entertaining!!! If you're coming to Morocco expecting English food inc full breakfast and chips you'll be disappointed.

Just remember to leave used towels outside your door.    When I first arrived I was allocated a room farthest away from the main building. There were no batteries in the Aircon controller. So I had to return to the main building for some. Then I find that the Aircon doesn't even work. An electrician came to look at it that evening but to no avail. I went back to the front desk in the morning. They assured me both the Aircon & the shower head (which had a leak) would be fixed that day. They were not and so they agreed to change my room.    Food wise...so far food is pretty much the same each day. Lots of parties on offer but nothing covered so flies/wasps happily get their sugar rush. Very little if any of the food is labelled. They repeatedly run out of wine. But the staff try their best for the guests which is a good thing. Also note hotel is a good 20 minutes from the city centre. They do run a shuttle bus but you have to pay for it.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197richif
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Keith P wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Magnificent Value Holiday,The layout of the accomadation blocks are very well thought out and authentic. The room even if a little basic was generous in size the double bed is 2 singles pushed together. With a small balcony we were at the front on the first floor. The rooms were very clean and tidy. The foos is served for breakfast lunch and dinner. all in the the large dining hall and buffet style. More choice than you can shake a stick at and as expected focus on local produce and dishes but they did do chips. You also have a choice of sitting outside overlooking the pool or in one of the delightful court yard areas. You do have to ask for wine at dinner and lunch inn which they serve half bottles of Red Rose or white wine. We got to know one of the waiters who was very helpful and well mannered Samir who setup a table each lunch time with wine in ice ready to go. Honestly it really is the small touches.    There was entertainment every evening and during the day the Animations team who's job it is to get youmoff your lovely sun lounger and particpate in some sort of activity dance classes yoga water arobics and many more. They failed with us and soon realised that we were planning on observing the activity rather than taking part. There was another pool in the grounds the Zen pool if you like it really quiet.,Date of stay: October 2022,,"Chippenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E1947JIkeithp

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Matthew S wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Disappointing,We came here pre covid about 3 years ago as a family of 4 . Decide to come back with friends as a party of 4 adults. The hotel is clean and tidy but is a bit run down now with broken tiles and and slabs in places . The rooms are dated and looking a bit tired. (The shower can be very slippery getting into it BE CAREFUL) . Most the staff very friendly No table service it's find your own table . Normally a bottle of water is waiting on the table but you are not asked or served any drinks . They do come and take away your plates very quickly. Food was alright we didn't starve  fussy eaters might struggle a bit . As for the bar we found this to be the biggest let down to the holiday . Tiny little paper cups (good job we took our own) every day at some point they ran out of beer of an evening they had got hold of more beer that then ran out also . Vodka ran out most nights also and to be honest I think they was watering it down. At no point of the 5 nights did any of us even feel tipsy. Tried to be as honest/fair as possible won't be returning to this hotel again . We have been to Morocco 8 times now and loved the places we have stayed . Its a lovely country don't let this review put you off going to Morocco.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9232XGmatthews

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ryan & Laura wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Great Holiday and value for money!,We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel as some of the reviews we read before hand weren‚Äôt the best.  With the price being ridiculously cheap we weren‚Äôt expecting 5* but this hotel is lovely and you get what you pay for.    We arrived at around 11:30 and checked in but we‚Äôre advised our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready so to grab a drink and some lunch (12:30) and come back after which to us wasn‚Äôt a problem in the slightest bit. We were shown to our room and our cases carried for us. The room was lovely and alot better than we expected (again due to reviews) the whole hotel is clean and we wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs dated just more authentic.  Mini fridge in the room with bottled water (can ask for this at any bar) and aircon which isn‚Äôt particularly great but come night time you can open the patio door and a lovely breeze comes through and no bugs.    If you are planning on coming to Morocco and expecting a full English breakfast and ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù food then you need to consider going elsewhere.  Breakfast is predominantly breads pastries cheeses cereal yoghurt eggs and pancakes. There is a lot of wasps around the sweet pastries but the staff do try there best to keep as many out as possible.  At Lunch and Dinner there is a choice of meat fish potatoes rice pasta couscous breads pizza & burgers (sometimes) breads and lots of salad dishes. Desserts are lovely with a range of cake and biscuits.  Drinks aren‚Äôt too bad but served in small cups if you tip the bar men they will always find you a bigger glass. Cocktails are nice but can be different depending on who serves them and soft drinks are branded Pepsi and 7up.  You can purchase branded alcoholic drinks (absolute vodka Bombay Sapphire Jonnie Walker etc)    We haven‚Äôt found the staff to be rude but have found them to be more French focused simply because they speak fluent French (and the French always tip) and alot of the staffs English is quite broken but not one has been unpleasant to us.    The animation team are great and aren‚Äôt pushy trying to get you to participate all of the time.  The little Moroccan lady who does Henna tattoos by the pool bar is also great and does some beautiful designs for very cheap (around ¬£10 for full hand)    the hotel shop isn‚Äôt great if you want snacks as there isn‚Äôt really much choice but the prices are really good there is no where close to get anything so bring snacks with you.  The closest cash machine is down the road in another hotel.    We highly recommend going to the Souk but follow the advice and dress modestly. if you‚Äôre an anxious person just please be aware of how busy the markets are and it is like a maze.  We also recommend the desert trip in the evening camel ride Bedouin tent and Moroccan meal. Wear long trousers and sensible footwear (trainers) as you don‚Äôt want to get saddle sore from the camels or lose a shoe.  Overall a fantastic holiday fantastic people and a beautiful country.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ben M wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Realistic Review - Value for Money,"First things first I think most of the 1/2-star reviews are very misleading if you are going away you check up on the reviews... people moaning about where the hotel is or its not what they expected I just think that's on them. I myself checked 100's of reviews and was slightly surprised just to how wrong people were this whole "" the French are treated better "" just isn't true the difference is the French TIP and also they aren't afraid to ask for things unlike most brits.    The main part of this review i want to focus on the Value for Money expect this hotel isn't the best there are a few faults on some days it's a 4* hotel with 3* features on other days it's a 3* hotel with 4* features i can only go off the time we had me and my partner spent 9 days there i would go as far as saying 8 of them we had little to moan about CONSIDERING the price you pay I'm not saying the rooms are perfect but we all know this hotel is very affordable. The Zen pool was our go to pool first few days the sunbeds were never full but towards the end of the holiday around 1pm you'd struggle to get two beds together often people in reviews complained this bar wasn't all inclusive which at first i was like that's annoying but the whole point of the Zen pool is its quiet and relaxing and if they did do drinks would mean most people would then come to this pool from this we took our chilly's bottles meaning we always had cold water anyway an easy fix ps they do actually give you water if you ask as that bar. The SPA was very well priced and well worth a visit. One thing i did like is Most people didn't leave towels they'd just wait till they are actually getting on the sun beds to save them but again this is only off our days there this could be different depending on how busy.    The food again on the topic of value for money the food is 7/10.  Breakfast - Coffee & juices are lovely loads of pastries pancakes and cereal the only negative about that is as its sweet pastries Alot of wasps are around which can get annoying.  Lunch- I think over the best meal always had a safe option be it breaded chicken Hamburger Pasta some sort of chicken and 1/3 days chips. drinks are help ya self-small cups but its all-inclusive what do you expect.  Tea- Overall pretty good never went hunger always has a style of white meat/ dark meat and fish no labels which on here seems to be a big issue but most things do actually have a label or its very obvious what they are I think we all inclusive no matter where they have to carter for everyone some nights the foods going to be just okay and that's something you have to think about me and my partner personally one night rather than moaning we just went to the restaurant which IMO 320 DH for 2 mixed grills was a steal.  Drinks- Personally I have been to 5* Hotels and 3* hotels the drinks aren't something of an issue you can ask for bottles of wine with lunch and tea 2/3/4 bottles if needed drinks are small yes but never once was told no too asking for two and always seemed to get ice which a fair few people on here had issues with we did pay for some and i would say if you can why not 80DH for a large cocktail I think as a treat was value for money.    Trips- The women in the excursion's office is a superstar she is great with customers answers all questions and helped make our hotel that little bit better. you can book trips out of the hotel and most likely it is a little cheaper we just liked paying that little extra for a more organized trip.    Extra Positives which I've not seen mentioned on here- Shop in the hotel for Crips/ ice cream/ pop not at rip of prices lifeguards will help move sunbeds football on tv screens with big sofas.    Negatives / Improvements- I think the main negative as we saw on our last day when the hotel is busy the staff are stressed which leads customers getting annoyed and we sadly saw this on our last night. the main food hall we struggled the get seats no forks at one point there was no glasses for drinks luckily for us this was our last night but I do feel for people whose first / second day that was as if it stayed that was it wouldn't have been a nice holiday. We aren't sure how many times our bedding has been changed.    Overall- VLAUE FOR MONEY we had a lovely holiday and more positives then negatives as people who don't like all-inclusive holidays this wasn't as bad as we first thought i think the main point to take has to be think about what you have paid for this holiday before you start to complain about the drinks / Staff not waiting on you hand and foot.",Date of stay: September 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benmP8421VL
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,karys wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Poor hotel not what I expected,Arrived at 9pm to check in and wasn‚Äôt shown to our room we was the furthest block away. Once we finally found it after asking 2 more staff while walking around we finally found it once we lugged the suitcases up the stairs we then find out the key card didn‚Äôt work. We had to walk back to reception 2 times and still wouldn‚Äôt work so they finally called for a maintenance man. He came and there was no electric in our room so he tried to open the electric box with a screwdriver instead of a key then had to wait for another maintenance man to come with the actual key to fix it.    This also happened to us on another 2 occasions.    The drinks are ridiculously small by the time you get a drink and sit on your sun lounger you have to get back up again to get another one.    The waiters are so miserable slamming your drinks down infront of you. Paid for all inclusive and half of the time when I went to get a drink at the pool bar they either didn‚Äôt have any beer or vodka so I just ended up drinking bottles of water during the day time.    The food is the same most days I ate the same breakfast for 10 days lunch is the best. The omelettes aren‚Äôt cooked and the eggs are so under cooked I don‚Äôt know how they can even serve them.    Animation team are really good and try hard but they do the same thing every week which meant we sat through 2 quiz nights with exactly the same questions in it.    They seem to treat the French like royalty wine in ice buckets on a table that is reserved for them with bread rolls on the table. English just get water. Think I managed to get wine twice only when I got up and asked them.    French just barge infront of you and take the last of anything you have queued up for.    All in all it wasn‚Äôt the best hotel and I wouldn‚Äôt go back here. I looked up and there are better hotels around this one so I‚Äôd recommend spending that little bit extra and not being disappointed like we was.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Grays Thurrock, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karyslouise98
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Sunjay M wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Poor quality service,The stay was poor (less than satisfactory). It started well with a room upgrade to a family room (thank you). However the rooms are tired and the walls are thin.    The air-con drowns out noise from guest but it also circulates dust (nasty cold throughout).    We emailed the hotel in advance re our dietary requirements. However the hotel does not cater well for vegetarians/vegans. Also the chefs have no idea what foods contains eggs (different opinions). Non of the foods are labelled. This in itself is a health risk if anyone has allergies and especially if the waiting staff have no idea if foods contain certain foods such as eggs. The lack of food choice caused my wife to have bad stomach problems.    There appears to be a major restriction of bathroom and swim towels. When we arrived we asked for towels even though the rooms were cleaned but were told we would need to wait until after 16:00. Fresh towels were only provided in the late afternoon.    We went to the Spa to check out the exercise equipment but were turned away as the room was being used. Furthermore we were told there are only two basic cardio equipments and to use them we would need to pay extra.    The quite pool was inviting but the all inclusive does not extend to this pool which is again very strange.    Reception staff seem to have different functions rather than one person being able to handle the most basic queries so the time taken at reception is not ideal. We decided to leave earlier than planned due to be wholly unsatisfied with this hotel.    As a positive our cleaner was very good and caring to our needs. The quite pool is pleasant. The day trips to Marrakesh are easy to arrange and decent in costs.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310sunjaym
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Kirsty M wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Not a 4* utterly disappointed,From someone who genuinely doesn‚Äôt want anyone else to be disappointed‚Ä¶  We arrived at the Valeria atlas resort a supposed 4* all inclusive hotel at 10:30 am to be told we cannot check in untill 2 which was pushed back till around 3.  We then finally got told our room was ready to which we were not shown to just told ‚Äúit‚Äôs down there 6 blocks on the left‚Äù . Upon eventually finding our room we discovered the dirty bedsheet no pillow cases filthy shower mouldy ceilings which were falling down in places ants taking over the place air con (not shown how to use) leaking everywhere tatty broken furniture. Nothing at all like the photos when we booked which may I add was not cheap. We thought we could look past all of this untill realising there was no towels what so ever we couldn‚Äôt even shower . The next red flag I went to speak to reception to see if we could get at least a towel to be told we have to pay ¬£10 each for them! And I was to have to find a housekeeper myself and ask her for them. I was shocked but did as I was told to be ignored by 5 different house keepers ! 6 hours after arriving we finally got our towels.  Next we thought we could try and forget about the sh*t start and go and get ourself a drink to be told that we had to pay for anything alcoholic! We had paid for all inclusive ! False advertising! Staff were unbelievably unhelpful and rude one even man shouting at me when I asked a simple question . Pools all had debris in the bottom and not clean along with broken sun loungers. Now for food‚Ä¶ where do I start. Drinks served in tiny espresso paper cups which you‚Äôd finish after 1 sip and be back at the bar. Breakfast there is swarms of wasps and I mean hundreds all over the not fresh pastries . Stale bread dirty bowels and cutlery. Ants in the ‚Äúclean‚Äù glasses. No napkins. Just utterly disappointing. Timings were never stuck to. Lunch starts at 12:30 but they don‚Äôt actually open till about 12:45 sounds silly however I have a condition meaning I need to eat at certain times and have to take medicine a certain time before hand. Options were fish fish or fish. Not an issue unless of course like us you don‚Äôt like seafood . Finally dinner. Dirty tablecloths just turned over when the next person was to sit there. Never have I wrote a review however this was completely shocking experience and I genuinely wouldn‚Äôt want anyone wasting their hard earned money or time on this place. There is no way that this is a 4* hotel . It‚Äôs a 2* /3 if everything went amazing for you and you were really pushing it.  I‚Äôm utterly disappointed and upset with this whole experience.

We had a very warm welcome at the reception and have been escorted to our room. They brought our luggage up checked the AC and explain how the safe worked. Big thank you for that!    Special thanks goes to Sam Smilay and the rest of the Animation team. They know how to animate the people from early in the morning with aqua-gym all the way to the dancing in the evening. Loved the different evening themes and the connecting shows with it. I can only recommend to go to the theater show from them! They are doing everything on the French and English :)    Hicham and the bar team were great and quick with making your drinks and you never had to wait long.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Terri D wrote a review Oct 2022,20,This is not 4 star...,Writing this review from a sunbed around the pool.    What's good: entertainment team and the programme. They are not too pushy and tbh they are the only reason I am giving this review 2 stars. The bar staff are also good they do well to accommodate what you want.    Each room has a safe which is free to use and you also can access the WiFi all over the hotel and fro your room.    What's not good: 1. the accommodation is not what you see on the photos. It's a small dated room with a separate toilet and bathroom. We asked about this on arrival and the rooms advertised are apparently the family suites. There is no iron in the room my partner also moved the top blanket arrangement on his bed one afternoon to find blood stains on his sheets. However we didn't come all this way to stay in the room so it does what it says on the tin. Our air con works there's a mini fridge which works although the onsite shop is too expensive to keep filling it up.    2. The bar shuts promptly at 11pm and you cannot get a cup of tea or soft drink thereafter unless you wish to go to the discotheque and pay.    Also the drinks are served in small espresso paper cups by the pool and tiny glasses in the evening which is frustrating as two sips and you're up again to get another drink.    3. The food...I have read lots of reviews on here which mention a good variety of food. Indeed there are lots of large trays of mixed meat and veg  but there are no plainer alternatives for the fussy eaters. Unless pasta and bread rolls floats your boat!! We have seen French fries once in 5 days and there was a mad queue for them and the restaurant could not keep up with the demand.    What food does take your fancy is often like warm at most.    The hotel is miles from anywhere so you can't just nip out to eat either. Majority of the guests at this time are English and many that we have made friends with have skipped meals because the food is not to their taste. My partner is quite an adventurous eater and even he has said to dodge dinner as he couldn't face the poor selection.    We thought the snack bar would serve the regular hot snacks of pizza burgers nuggets chips etc....this is not the case it literally serves Danish pastries left over from breakfast and fresh crepes at about 3pm.    The best meal here by far is breakfast - but don't expect to see a fry up in the hot trays!! The egg counter is the best option which can be found outside in the morning.    4. Service in the restaurant usually in 4 star hotels we would expect some form of seating you at the table and some customary bringing you a drink etc. Not here literally it's a scrabble to find a clean set up table. If you want wine or a bottle of water you need to catch a staff members eye.  Even then they may not come over!!    I guess I am just wondering why this hotel is rated so highly - unless the rating is for the TUI sister hotel which does appear more plush from a brief visit for the cash point. We won't be coming back to this hotel and would not recommend it.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Jamaal B wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Average - False advertisement - Honest review,Arrived at 9.30 pm was told to go straight for dinner leaving our suitcases out in the open at the main entrance. Then asked to keep our passports as we went for food. Our key to our room did not work the whole duration of our holiday which meant having to go back and forth to reception to activate our key which still didnt work. Not the best start. No iron No drinks in fridge (that barley worked). If you are all inclusive drinks finish at 11pm if you are there by 11.01 you will be paying. Gym is not included only 2 pieces of equipment which they then try charge you ¬£5 for. Food is shocking seems like they reused the food and no care was given. Finding hair and stale taste. Very false advertisement the pictures included advertising this hotel is infact another hotel. You can use the pool however no drinks food or access to some parts. On the plus side the entertainment staff especially were very lovely and really made us feel welcomed. The scenic route was really beautiful and hotel lovely. The aqua slides were fun however in the other hotel. Overall we will not be returning. Would definitely return to Marrakech however not this hotel.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Mitcham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808jamaalb

We noticed after about two days and a couple of chats with animation team that  Das Valeria shares with a French outfit called club Corrija  This is a French company for French holiday makers and have some different functions this wasn‚Äôt communicated very well and led to some confusion and irritation as some British people were turned away from certain programs.  Once we had sorted that out we got on with our holiday it was ok we just left the French to themselves  But it is a very French resort english is spoken there but some days we thought we were treated 2nd class  Rooms were always cleaned fresh towels food was ok I have had worse on my travels,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Ellesmere Port, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/934IanB

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Paula wrote a review Sep 2022,30,3/5 but no return for us,Arrived around 11 am and room was ready so able to check in straight off. Room was basic but cleaned and towels changed every day. Little terrace to sit on but both chairs were broken so had to be changed..took 3 days. 5 coat hangers between two of us..asked for more never arrived.. like the duvet we asked for as cold on some nights..never arrived. Site is well landscaped and pleasant to walk round. Pools one large with entertainment...this needed a good clean. Plenty of beds and always got umbrella but lots broken. Other zen pool was busy so had to get sunbed at times.  Entertainment team yes they work hard but their persistant approach us gnawing at times.  Food yes varied but wish they would sort signs for dishes.  Drinks are hit and miss.. think the hotel needs to invest in large glasses and a better ice machine..nothing worse then warm pepsi.  The down side of the holiday was a stomach upset 4 days before home...could have been too much sun the water (ice) or food but in last 4 days we spoke to at least 10 people who had same 'Moroccan tummy' and fact reception was giving out sachets of remedy could have indicated something.

When we arrived we were told our room wasn‚Äôt ready we said that‚Äôs fine they showed us to the bar area and we were served drinks of our choice. When we arrived at the room the only thing they had yet to do was put pillow cases on ( not a biggy) and we went to have a look around.    Ok the room Decor maybe a little tired in places but you go on holiday to explore and see the country you are visiting - not sit in your room!!! The room was clean and cleaned daily the beds were comfortable and clean.    Food was absolutely fine a huge selection for breakfast lunch and dinner again some say a little bit Samey but when you‚Äôre cooking to volume it‚Äôs hard to impress everyone!!. My hubby was a chef for 26 years and ate his body weight in food whilst he was thereüòÇ    We found the hotel nice relaxing and yes set up more for the French visitor but seeing as French is mostly a second language in Morocco it‚Äôs not a shocker!!! We did receive information in English for all the trips out and enjoyed a few we had our own English speaking guide and the French had theirs.    We had a fabulous time at the hotel been to a lot worse!. The staff be it cleaners entertainment staff bar staff waiters were all very friendly and helpful.    Don‚Äôt be put off by negative reviews- go see Marrakesh for yourselves it‚Äôs an experience and although a busy city we felt very safe. It‚Äôs a crazy busy place full of life yeah there are posh bit and not so posh bits - like any city in the world.    We had a blast and all four of us were impressed and would definitely visit again. My hubby left his go pro in a taxi- the taxi driver returned it to our hotel now would that happen here in the UK??

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Jay wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Enjoyable Experience,A first time All Inclusive for me but my wife has experienced this kind of holiday before.    The hotel was clean with spacious rooms and the food you could not fault. Alcohol the wine was palatable and the spirits we tended to drink Vodka or the Cocktails which were fine but the paper cups could have been bigger to stop the yoyo effect of going to the bar for beers! (a minor critic though)    If you enjoy activities then the Activities team will entertain you all day! We preferred a quieter time away from the loud music and activities near the big pool and found the more peaceful Zen pool more to my liking. However a small negative but the evening entertainment was very disappointing... Kids entertainment up until 9/9.30 but for the adults not much.    All staff were very friendly and helpful not going to name anyone individually as they were all so helpful.  The rooms were clean and tidy and towels were returned in the afternoons on every occasion if left out for washing.  The hotel gardens are beautiful and well maintained there are outdoor activities i.e tennis and petanque if you can manage to play in the heat.    Trips out  Marakech markets are an experience be prepared to haggle otherwise you will for sure be ripped off......but it is enjoyable and you will see how others live in this world. There is a minibus you can book at the Hotel (the Excursions office is next to Reception and the staff are brilliant).  When you get off the minibus turn left on to the main road and walk for some distance until you come to the coaches and horses then turn left and you will arrive at the square.    We ended the week with a Trip to the waterfalls near the Atlas Mountains and would recommend it but it is steep so wear shoes that grip!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Michelle H wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Do not believe the negative reviews,I was sceptical about coming after reading some of the reviews but I need not have worried. We stayed here with our two girls aged 13 and 12 for 10 nights during the summer holidays and we had a really good time. If they tweaked some parts this hotel could be amazing.    Negatives    The food in the restaurant was not that great for kids or fussy eaters and there was no labelling but if you asked the servers they were more than polite and helpful.    The excursion shop in the hotel had nothing in English to explain the trips it was all in French. We had to use Google translate which was very frustrating. The lady in the shop tried her very best to explain but again she was affluent in French not English. A lot of the entertainment in the evening was in French but the entertainment team did their best to speak in English also. One night there was a casino night but we could not join in at all as it was all in French which was a shame.    Wasps /bees. There were lots around the pool area which put us off drinking in the day. As soon as you put your drink down they were all over it. My husband was stung but it could have been one of the kids. I am allergic to wasps so it really concerned me and I could not relax fully.    Bar workers. I read a few reviews about the people working in the bar asking for girls numbers. Our girls are 13 and 12 but look much older. Yes on occasion they were asked their ages but once they all knew and I made it clear they were younger than what they thought the attention stopped.    Positives    The entertainment team make this hotel. They work 17 hour days to make sure you are having a good holiday. if you say no politely they walk away. My husband and I hardly ever join in activities as we like to relax however we played darts table tennis aerobics and joined in the pool games most days. The evening entertainment they worked really hard on also.    Restaurants. Whilst our kids really struggled my husband and I really enjoyed the food. There was plenty of choice and all of the food was cooked nicely. Being able to have a bottle of wine at lunch and dinner was a bonus. Some all inclusives are really tight on this. They also hand out large bottles of water whenever you want so again another bonus. We did not use the two restaurants that you pay for so cannot comment on these however we did not feel we needed to pay extra as the food in the main restaurant was varied each night.    Pools. We did not use the adult only pool as we always found sunbeds around the main pool. There could do with more sun shades as not enough and it was sweltering! Yes it was a little noisy but the kids enjoyed it and it didn't ruin our holiday.    Aqua park. This is just a short walk down the road from the hotel. We all really had a great time each time we went. It was never that busy that we had to queue for a long time and the slides were great. Having this included in the all inclusive was again another bonus that we were grateful for.    Overall we had a really really good time and would certainly be back if we were to travel to Marrakech again.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Barbi wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Not good,Our bags were taken from us upon arrival. Check in was easy enough but we were left waiting in reception for over an hour waiting to go to our room which we were told was ready. In the end we found our luggage and made our way to the room. The room was dirty and very disappointing. No towels or pillowcases on the pillows. We didnt have a clue where anything was in or around the hotel so were left to our own devices.  Complaints to reception were met basically with there is nothing we can do as there were no other rooms available. They had a very unhelpful attitude. We later discovered from a lovely French family they had asked to change rooms and were given a choice of three other rooms.  The hotel is set up for French speaking visitors most of the time we didnt have a clue what was going on.  On the second day whilst we were out of the room the air con failed and dripped water on the floor which I slipped on hurting my back in the process. Again  when this was reported to reception they didnt really want to know. They sent someone in a few hours later who looked should have fixed it but didnt as it dripped again soon after leaving us with no air conditioning in a stifling room for the rest of our holiday.    The food was ok that deserves the 1 star rating.    There are very mixed reviews regarding this hotel.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Kelly C wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Absolutely appalling,If your English don‚Äôt go here unless you can speak fluent French. The moment we stepped into the hotel we were treated like dirt because we were English if your French you are treated like royalty.  It just got worse and we were only there 1.5days until we flew back home absolutely heartbroken.    Upon our arrival at the hotel we were told where to put our luggage and then told to go and sit in this room when entering the room it was cool and it was a welcome treat to sit and cool down there were refreshments given out although they run out and we were not given any. In fact as soon as they realised we were English we were escorted out of there and taken to the desk the gentleman took our passports from us photocopied them and given back to us all he did was put an inclusive band on each of us and told us to go and eat pointing to the dining area.    However with the other people in the cool room they were French speaking and they were all given refreshments they had their passports taken from them and then when the guy escorted us to reception he handed over the passenger‚Äôs passports and was given a handful of what I would call posh all-inclusive bands and then the guy returned to the room with these. I can only imagine that they were all sitting there and being waited on while they were being booked in and given their rooms in a nice cool and relaxing room and we were just shoved into a warm dining area and told to eat!    When we came out of the dining area I asked if our room was ready and we were told another hour! So we sat around and waited we were not given any information there was no relevant information whatsoever there was no map of the complex we were tired hot and exhausted that‚Äôs why we didn‚Äôt explore. If we were told we could go to the bar and relax or sit somewhere there is air condition would have been an immense help but nothing. An hour had passed and I approached the reception again bearing in mind everyone else has been booked in given a room and yet we were still waiting in fact we were the last ones left still waiting. The receptionist that proceeded to tell me another 20-30mins wait. NO I was not having that I had two kids we have had enough by then I was fuming I even mentioned the fact of how we were treated and yet the French have all cooled down in their rooms and no doubt happy. She could not answer that because she knew it was true. Then I asked why the room was not ready and she said they have not long checked out but I said everyone checks out at 12 she just looked and me and said YES that is right so how come our room wasn‚Äôt ready as it is now 4pm. She made a phone call come back and said they just need to sort a blanket will you be ok with that I said yes.    We then had help taken our suitcases to the room but when we got their it was more than just a blanket they hadn‚Äôt even finish we are now waiting outside the room for another 10-15mins.    The room was ok nowhere near like the ones on the website and this hotel is certainly not 4 stars! I would say more 2 to 3 stars that is regards to the areas we saw food room hospitality and the overall experience. Majority of the place looked run down.    When looking around the room I notice there was only one shower towel. I rang reception and they said they will drop more off. With that we had all passed out as we had been up since 01:30am when we woke up we had missed dinner my husband rush down to the dining area just after 9.30pm (When they had finished which I always thought when it 7.30-9.30pm surely you can still go in just before 9.30pm and eat but not here they want to be cleared and finished by then) to see if he could get anything for the kids especially my son as he was really hungry who didn‚Äôt really eat at lunch due to the fact the food didn‚Äôt look appetising he was told NO all finish he asked if there was anywhere we could get food they just said no they wouldn‚Äôt even allow a little something like a bread roll. My husband came back and with that we all tried to sleep again until the morning.    The following morning my husband was making the bed and noticed the pillow he slept on had no pillowcase on it and when he turned the pillow over it was stained which looked like blood we check the other pillows and none of them had cases on but looked ok. We all got up for breakfast still wearing what we had on as no shower towels had turned up. My husband and I went to reception and once again asked about the towels and now about a replacement pillow we were told they will sort it out. We had breakfast well lack of it anyway (the food poor therefore meaning we didn‚Äôt really eat a lot apart from bread rolls and butter). We went back to the room and once again there were no shower towels or replacement pillow I rang reception again and they said they will get this sorted as I told them I have asked for them twice now. None of us haven‚Äôt even had a shower yet by this time we were getting more frustrated.    So we thought we would have a walk round to see where the pools are etc. Well when it was stated 4 Large pools they didn‚Äôt specify 2 small baby size ones one main one and one adult one. Also the pool bar by the main pool looked derelict no signs at all as to what was on offer or what you can have no mention of food or anything. Just a few sorry looking tables around and that was it.    We asked for soft drinks although made to feel uncomfortable when doing so. After that I said to the kids let‚Äôs go and see if we can arrange some excursions if anything it would get us out of the hotel and see more of Marrakech. I entered the little room where we were put first thing as it was also for arranging excursions. I looked on all the boards all the information around and once again nothing in English. I came out and said to my husband this is ridiculous he went in and tried to ask but just got ignored. I thought I won‚Äôt give in so I went back into the room and waited to ask. The couple in front of me (French) had done what they need to do then I was next. He stretches over to pick up some information and then looked beyond me and said to the couple behind can I help you Madame (French). I tried to say I was next but he just ignored me too and carried on talking to the other couple. We then went into the bar area to have a drink and see if there was anything else we could do I got some drinks for the family from a nice friendly barman while we waited for dinner. We again didn‚Äôt have much to eat due to the poor quality food.    We returned to the room and still no towels or pillow! Then just to put the icing on the cake the air con stopped working at 8.45pm. We spoke to reception and they said they will send a technician to have a look. Over an hour passed and my husband rang again and was told they will send a technician then approximately 1hr and 10mins later they knocked on the door. This is approximately 11oclock at night. He fiddled with the buttons and said something to the other guy and he said to my husband would you be happy to swap rooms he said yes because it was way too hot. They took my husband to the reception then said to him they will call in 30mins with a room. He came back to our room and waited in the meantime I pack everything up so we were ready. Again well over an hour this is passed midnight now my husband rang reception and was told they checked 2 rooms but air con not working they will check another 2 rooms and they will let us know that call never came we had all passed out now due to the it being 2am. Then the stupid thing is that the maid turned up with one small towel at 10.20am I said don‚Äôt bother too late we were going home that day.    We have never felt so isolated so alone and to be treated like that was an absolute insult. It was rude and bad enough when we came into the hotel on arrival I even said to the receptionist that they were rude when I was trying to get my room but even then she was looking at me like I was nothing. To be honest the way we have been treated the time we spent at the hotel I wouldn‚Äôt even treat a dog like that. I have travelled a lot in my life and I must say that is the worst place I have ever come across.    Some of the problems to be aware off:    ‚Ä¢ Their food snack mealtimes etc are ridiculous long wait.  ‚Ä¢ They are certainly not a 4* hotel more like a 2*  ‚Ä¢ Their rooms are nowhere near as the photos online  ‚Ä¢ The food was horrible its quantity rather than quality pretty much the same every day and just no signs.  ‚Ä¢ Dirty/Bloody pillow which didn‚Äôt get changed  ‚Ä¢ It feels like they are rude to you if your English  ‚Ä¢ They don‚Äôt want to help you  ‚Ä¢ Calling the reception line takes ages for them to answer  ‚Ä¢ You get a little paper cup by the pool for a drink which only really lasts one sip.  ‚Ä¢ There is no information at all as to what is available for food or drink  ‚Ä¢ The pool bar is so uninviting only 3 tables. The bar staff were miserable and rude towards you very unwelcoming  ‚Ä¢ All excursion information should be available in the languages for all the guessed not just French.  ‚Ä¢ Out of the four food restaurants one you must book and pay for the main one is poor. The poor bar well we never saw anything available and the timing is only for one hour and we couldn‚Äôt find the other one.  ‚Ä¢ As for 4 large pools that is not the case at all 1 main 1 adult and 2 small (baby pools I would say)  ‚Ä¢ Bars once again only one found and the only place that seem to have air con staff didn‚Äôt want to help when asked about others.  ‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt even know where the spa was  ‚Ä¢ Didn‚Äôt see or wasn‚Äôt given any information regarding the aqua park,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellycB9962AY

The vibe as soon as you walk in as so welcoming and all staff here are super chill & wanting to help make your holiday the best it can be.

I must say that they are point on with their cleaning me & my partner have seen all areas of the hotel outdoor facilities being cleaning regularly which is reassuring for how busy the hotel is.    Our room was lovely and had our own balcony for our own quite time as a couple :)    We had a very spontaneous photo shoot which captured our first night here.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Angisplangi wrote a review Aug 2022,40,A Great Week Away,From arrival to leaving it has been a great week away. We came on this trip to celebrate Mia's 21st birthday and have laughed so much. Nearly all the staff were helpful(you will always get the odd few) and ready to serve you with a smile even if they've been at it all day. Food was a little repetitive (especially breakfast) but plenty of everything always being refilled. AI spirits were limited but the measures were generous...they did AI cocktails plus cocktails you could purchase using branded spirits. The entertainment team were excellent always on the go encouraging but not pushy if you said no. Rooms were basic but provided everything expected. The main pool was busy as expected and rammed with sunbeds but not enough parasols for the amount of beds so try get yours early (lol). You can buy a ticket for towels for the week which you exchange every day for clean ones and get your money back at end of stay. The zen pool lovely if you wanted to get away from the kids in the main pool but whilst we were a party of 6 adults the day we went we were laughing but not overly noisy and were told to be quiet by the pool life guard who spent most of his time on his backside with his head in his phone and when a French family came in and started throwing a ball about being much noisier than we were he just shrugged his shoulders and said I don't understand in French when we questioned him. I have read many reviews about the staff being biased towards the French but this one incident was the only time we experienced it. The maids/cleaning staff & gardners did a brilliant job and our maid was so lovely. You had access to the water slides in the sister hotel but we were told we couldn't eat there. Would recommend a trip to the Souks (markets) by the hotel shuttle bus. When you get off the shuttle bus behind the small craft Market you need to get to the main road and turn left and keep walking till you see all the horses & carriages. Go up past them and you are at the entrance to the main market area....its an experience for sure. The half day trip to the desert with camel ride entertainment food and pool was OK albeit a bit long but we were told there was beer & wine and when we got there there was only beer and was chargeable bearing inmind we'd paid 50 euros per person  The photographers were good always clicking away but not intrusive. If you want some beautiful pictures to remember your holiday by then speak to them.    If you wanting a good value all inclusive holiday then this is it. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves but a holiday is what you make it...Enjoy,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kendal, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angisplangi

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,RHulett wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Generally very good,Genuine review-  The physical hotel is what lets this place down. The grounds are beautiful and well kept pool is great and there were plenty of sunbeds. The rooms are dated in all honesty and the shower area is not fit for purpose as it floods every time. Towels were not replaced straight away but were taken first thing so you could be left until 7pm without fresh towels which wasn‚Äôt ideal.  However beds were comfy and the cleaners were great it was cleaned every day.    The staff make this place. Sofyan was brilliant when we arrived. Bar staff - Hicham Solomon Salah Madjhi to mention a few and the bar manager were just lovely people knew our drinks orders and couldn‚Äôt help us more. Were teaching us Arabic and generally chatty every single time.    The entertainment team are amazing. Jimi Rico Issa Smailey Amine Zac Sam all stood out - they don‚Äôt stop and try to involve anyone in anything. Again chatty friendly always and generally fun to spend time with - really made our holiday.    The bus service to Marrakesh isn‚Äôt bad- one bus was 45 minutes late and there is no way to contact the hotel if like us your phone doesn‚Äôt work in Morocco. The yellow taxis from outside hotel took us there for 150D sk we did that instead.    The food was decent we found. Different most days generally quite tasty. There is A LOT of fish and meat and nothing is labelled so this could be difficult for some. Children I imagine it being difficult for. Drinks are average too.    Overall we were generally quite pleased- it was an affordable all inclusive and is probably better than most I‚Äôve been to in Spain/ Greece for a similar price. Get to know the staff they will make your holiday and try everything you want to - we only wish we‚Äôd joined the activities from day 1!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RHulett
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Carly H wrote a review Aug 2022,50,"Great hotel, great facilities, friendly staff, nice rooms. Exceeded my expectations. Don‚Äôt be put off by bad reviews.",After reading some reviews before visiting this hotel I was a bit concerned about our stay. However Our experience at this hotel was very much a positive one. Do not be put off by negative reviews!!    On arrival at the hotel we were given a tour from Soufiane who was very welcoming helpful and friendly. This was the case throughout the holiday whenever we saw him.    The food was lovely even for someone with coeliac disease. The staff were very helpful whenever I asked questions and they informed me of what I could eat. They even got yogurts for me from the kitchen when I asked for them. All staff at the hotel were very friendly especially the entertainment and bar staff.    The drinks were also nice; a variety of cocktails beers wines and local spirits were available. Some branded alcoholic drink you had to pay for but we didn‚Äôt feel the need to do this and chose from the all inclusive options.    The quadruple hotel room was clean and spacious with two balconies. We had a fridge which was nice as we were able to keep our bottled water in there.    The animation team did a great job at keeping everyone entertained. Lots of sports and activities ran throughout the day and the shows in the evenings were great. Despite the entertainment team working long hours they were always in good spirits.  The staff were friendly and polite and always up for a chat. Special mention to smiley and jimmy.    The hotel ran shuttles to the centre of Marrakesh for a small charge which ran at various times of the day which saved us having to order a taxi.    The spa facilities were nice and we got a great deal which involved a Hammam body scrub seaweed wrap massage and access to the spa pool.    The hotel has two pools one busier one with access to the entertainment and a quiet ‚Äòzen‚Äô pool. It was nice to have both options.    We were able to connect to the hotel wifi at most places in the hotel free of charge which was also great!    Throughout the holiday if I ever struggled to carry drinks my suitcase or anything I was always helped by the staff even if I said I didn‚Äôt need it which was great!    The only downside to the holiday was that we had to ask for rooms towel as they were sometimes taken and not replaced but this wasn‚Äôt a big issue.    Overall great hotel great staff would recommend!  Be friendly and polite to the staff and they will be friendly to you!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlyh286
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Andre M wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Avoid at ALL costs !,Very sad to leave bad review but could not allow myself not to. We stayed 4 nights in this resort and it left us disappointed to say the least. The following are the reasons why so you take precautions:  - The WiFi did not work at all in our room I told reception 3 times on different days they asked me to show them on my phone and since it was connecting on the reception area they said it worked. I had to go back to my room and take a screenshot from the WiFi network page reading 'connection failed' only then they accepted it didn't work and the only thing they seem to have done was put my room number on a WhatsApp group and said it would ne fixed. Never happened so no WiFi in my room throughout the entire stay.  - On day two my husband asked for an additional key as we only got give one and they refused. I went and asked for one and they gave me one but the previous one we had was no longer working. So we got told we could only have one at the time which meant we could never do stuff separately and come back to the room at different time. Not Ideal.  -If you have any allergies you will struggle at the buffet as apart from one day during dinner the food had labels of what it was staff had no clue what was in it or could not advise at all. Breakfast was always the same food and limited. Again not ideal.  -Our A/C did NOT work in our room during the ENTIRE stay. We told them several times and even asked if we could change rooms but they either pretend not to understand or just said it would be fixed. We ended up having to rely on wet towels on top of us and sleeping with the back door open to let some air in albeit hot air. This was a health and safety hazard and yes we ended up getting sick from heat exhaustion under a 45 degree weather during the day and having no chance of cooling down this hindered our stay as we could not to everything we had planned.  -The mattresses on the beds are beyond uncomfortable they are lumpy and tough I slept on the floor once as it was much better than this godawful beds.  -Lastly we thought of treating ourselves to a Spa treatment within the premises and they had an 'Oriental Ritual' package which included the following: body scrub and foot scrub hamman preparation body sculping and massage and scalp scrube and massage with a rinse of rose water at the end - All for 350 MAD per p. We requested this service for each and they said that it didn't include the massage do if we wanted one we had to pay 100 MAD more. I was confused as the massage was listed and they kept saying it was not that no massage would be given if we went for the one infront of us on a printed sheet. We ended up agreeing to pay 450 MAD each to get everything. The scrub and massage went well and they sent us to a private pool for the spa to chill which we enjoyed we knew we were still missing the scalp scrub and rinse we got out the pool and asked where to go next to the remainder and they said we didn't pay for that as we decided to go for the massage package. WHAT?? this was never agreed and they just ignored us in the end and said we were done. A total of 4 people in the reception just blanked us and said no more services for us. Absolutely shocking.    All in all please go elsewhere when you travel to this beautiful country. We will return to Morocco but never set foot in this place.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3168IRandrem
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ben M wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Honest UK guest review - August 2022,This was our first holiday in almost four years (and my youngest daughter aged 2 first ever holiday) and was left a little deflated with the experience (except for the entertainment team). Firstly the rooms are very basic the A/C worked but never got really cold just cool enough to not be uncomfortable at night. We had ants every single day coming through the patio doors and asked at reception but nothing got sorted. The rooms were cleaned every day and towels washed and returned each day. Food was pretty good given the mass production - lots on offer each evening and this for an AI hotel was ok. One comment is that there wasnt an awful lot for children apart from pasta. DRINKS - this is the biggest let down. Literally we did not see an ice cube all week. The inclusive cocktails were pretty awful and only local beer which you could only get a small glass at a time of. The service at the pool bar and the normal bar was awful and not an enjoyable experience at all.    SERVICE - well where do I start. As others have advised wrist bands are given out to all guests and are colour dependant on what nationality you are. It is very clear that the French are given better service ICE and it looked like premium spirits as well without additional pay that the English were asked to pay if we wanted them. I genuinely am shocked at the way that English people were attended to VS other nationalities. We spoke to a few guests there who all felt the same as us (and in fact had an even worse level of service than we saw) The main benefit of this hotel is the entertainment team who worked so hard every day. From games in the pool to the evening shows they were fantastic. Top marks to Sam who remembered my daughters names and always went out his way to speak to us. The girls loved the fire show but the rest of the evening entertainment was pretty much the same each night in the main outside bar. They had an indoor theatre that had a variety show/karaoke/kids show - pretty typical for what you would expect from a holiday resort.  Also a special mention to the photographer/moustache man Hamzar who again loved my two girls and spoke to them every day. - top quality guy!    Hotel management should look at service levels lose the wristbands and treat guests a lot better. Ive been to a fair few all inclusive hotels mostly 4* and above. They put this one at 2* at its very best.,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5161QJbenm

The hotel is beautiful always someone gardening/maintaining the grounds very scenic looking gardens around the rooms. The rooms were basic but clean and had air con and a mini fridge. The all inclusive drinks were really nice and the food was good with loads of variety. Barmen were always pleasant to speak to especially Solomaine Haisham and Sallah - who taught us to count to 10 in Arabic! The entertainment team were fantastic the best I‚Äôve ever seen! Always getting us up to do activities and so much to do for both kids and adults here. These guys just didn‚Äôt stop! Even when he was on his day off Sam was DJ‚Äôing the disco!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,SKH wrote a review Aug 2022,10,"AWFUL EXPERIENCE, NO SAFETY, THIEVES, LIARS",This is an awful Resort to stay in the food variety is the same each day and gave me food poisoning they have no real care for hygiene. The towels are removed every morning (when you are supposed to take a shower) and are never replaced despite requesting several times. The rooms are very basis and the AC has a mind of its own - it works when it wants to. The staff are completely awful and lie to your face. They have a real issue with sun beds and umbrellas; you have to sit in the heat without an umbrella despite requesting these.    The most shocking experience was when two random men walked into our room at approx 8am with a keycard and the Resort staff called us liars that this wouldn't happen; despite accepting to me that their key card system does not work properly. They say one thing and then another - constant lies. My designer sunglasses also got stolen at the Resort when they held my luggage hostage as I refused to pay the bill because they refused to resolve the issue about men walking into my room. I called the Moroccan police and reported this incident and till this day have not heard anything back. The Manager and staff were very rude shouting and aggressive; I did not feel safe at all! If you are just females travelling then this hotel is not for you. Money was also stolen at this hotel and the hotel staff did nothing.    They are all well versed with their stories refuse to help you and make you feel helpless.

We were not sure what to expect but have been so surprised by every single aspect of the hotel.  The all inclusive food is great quality and there are plenty of options even for fussy eaters. Lots of options for all inclusive drinks including hot drinks cocktails and soft drinks.  Facilities include main pool with entertainment all day; zen pool which is more relaxed; spa facilities at a great price (around ¬£20 for a 25 minute massage); plus table tennis and football tables.  The animation team make the hotel what it is. During our week we were particularly impressed with the service from Smailey Zak and Mamado. The staff are always cheerful and full of energy.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,S S wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Not all that it makes out to be,So went as a family of 8 during the end of July for 5 nights and 6 days and our experience was definitely in the middle. Not all the best but not the worst.    Firstly be expected to pay a city tax to the hotel. It works out to ¬£20 per person for 5 nights. This was unknown to us but we paid it.    We were given some drinks on entry which was nice of them as it was so hot.    We then had three rooms booked 2 doubles and 1 to be shared by 4 but when getting there we realised that the sofa on the side counts as a bed which is a shock as you‚Äôve paid for each person equally to get an actual bed.    On top of that we arrived at half 11 and online it does say check in at 12 but we were made to wait till 2.30 pm and only got our rooms at 2 after I had to complain that my dad is unwell and needs to rest.    When going to our rooms we realised the 1 double room was great as the AC was actually working fresh towels were placed and it was ready to go into but the other two rooms which were joined (as in the door between them was unlocked) were not ready. No towels and very poorly working AC.    After complaining about it many times they moved me and my husband to another room and finally locked the door in between (which we felt was left opened because that way the AC for the other room would keep our room cool.)    Now moving into the new room the 2nd night was fine at first but between the 3rd and 4th night the AC was a mess again and on the 4th night the AC began to crackle and release smoke. In the morning little bits from the AC were on the floor which worried me as I am pregnant also.    After complaining once again they did manage to sort it but it didn‚Äôt do much as we were leaving the next day.    Now moving into food. There was a massive variety in the all inclusive but what we didn‚Äôt know or wasn‚Äôt told about was firstly what each food is so it was literally a test and trial error because of the lack of labels.    Aswell they had an outside mini kitchen which did pizzas and omelettes but again we weren‚Äôt told about that and on the last morning when we did find out the queues were long under scorching hot sun so it wasn‚Äôt even worth waiting for.    What we also weren‚Äôt impressed with was on the second evening we went to sit on the tables on the left which were for families of 8 and as we sat down the waiter literally said ‚Äòoi for families for families‚Äô I told him I was with my family and they are coming down but the tone he took and the way he spoke to me was so rude and disgusting. So we had to move to the other side and join the two tables. I don‚Äôt know if it was because of who we were or whether he just saw the 3 of us first but it was unacceptable. And not only this when we later returned to get water bottles he again questioned why we came to the canteen as if accusing us of returning for more food which to be honest is no concern of his as it is all inclusive for a reason and we have paid.    Entertainment was good but luckily we weren‚Äôt forced to join. Partially because we didn‚Äôt get to close but we could see how they are very social with certain groups of young women but I have no personal complaints about that.    In terms of tourism and being shown around luckily my husband had contact with a driver who showed us around and took us to places so the hotel didn‚Äôt really do much in regards to that but there were options at the hotel but considering how much we paid and how much the hotel stated it is better to go private.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssY811RF
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Maria wrote a review Aug 2022,30,This hotel is an average hotel,English is minimally spoken here and it may take a couple of tries but you will get there in the end French is a more common language here the reception staff are the same it will take a couple of tries before they understand what you mean or respond to you but they try and they will get there. The reception also don‚Äôt tell you about all the things that are available in the hotel or even give you a nap as the hotel grounds are huge and you are expected to just figure it out. The food is average and does the job but it would be nice to have actual Moroccan food and maybe a larger variety. The animation team are really lovley and energetic and always put their all into the shows however since we are in morroco it would be nice to have shows that are morrocon orientated and have some morrocon culture. The shops outside the hotel are quite expensive and their isn‚Äôt any more shops around and you have to travel at least half n hour to get to some shops. Your probably better off booking trips of Tripadvisor before you get to morroco as you won‚Äôt be able to find anyone. It would probably be nice for them to provided some equipment to play with at the tennis courts as we didn‚Äôt even know they were here till our 5th day here as you have to walk down a garden path to find it. All in all it‚Äôs an okay hotel and it‚Äôs not all that bad,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"West Yorkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Odyssey32270887528
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Rachel C wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Good but be prepared,Staff are amazing especially Loko Sofyan and all of the entertainments team so much energy so friendly and they make the hotel! A few things I wish I knew before coming :    Aircon the aircon in the room is just OK not as strong as most air con units! Air con in the bar and resturant is very very faint only just a little cooler than outside.    Food: all meals are in buffet you can pay to go to the Al la carte. Snack bar does not serve lunch only pancakes at around 4pm.    Drinks - a small selection of cocktails and mocktails some spirits coffee tea white red and Rose wine.    Can pay for premium cocktails for 70dhs around ¬£5 well worth it.    If you have allergies this is not a good hotel for you! Nothing in the buffet is labelled nothing at all!!!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,MF wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Would not return,On arrival (11:30am) we were told our room was not ready and we would have to wait until 2pm in 45 degrees heat. Not ideal in the slightest. We were then given wrist bands for all inclusive and soon realised that you were given different colours depending on your nationality. At first we thought that was so the staff knew what language to speak to you in however we soon realised that the English get treated COMPLETELY different to the French.    The French were called to the front of drinks ques at the bar and would get served ahead of the English wearing the light orange wrist bands. The French would receive double the measure of alcohol that the English were given. They also had welcome drinks on arrival (we were offered nothing). The French were also given their drinks in the bottles themselves where as when we asked for that we were told no and that we had to have tiny white plastic cups that you‚Äôd get at a kids party. We have never been away and felt we were being treated differently due to being English. Absolutely shocking.    The rooms were basic and are in need of TLC. I would not rate this as a 4 star hotel by any means. The food was not good either and there were no labels on ANYTHING which was completely helpless when you couldn‚Äôt guess what anything was due to it‚Äôs appearance‚Ä¶‚Ä¶    The entertainment I couldn‚Äôt really comment on as we didn‚Äôt get to see it due to there being a very small amount of tables that went by 6pm.    My last negative comment about this hotel would be how inappropriate the entertainment team are with girls who come here on holiday. It was cringeworthy to see and very much a put off.    We would never look at returning to this hotel.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMWF19
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,D W wrote a review Aug 2022,10,NEVER AGAIN!,PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING HERE!  The Dar Atlas may look appealing in the photos however the place is very dated and run down. I wish that was the only problem with it. If you want to witness how a hotel makes a profit from all inclusive you‚Äôll see it here. Ridiculous queues for every meal with poor quality food the reward for your patience if there‚Äôs anything left at all. We tried various times for all meals with the same results. If you want a drink from one of the two poorly run bars set aside 15-20 minutes to get your very small beverage usually with no ice because the bucket is empty and nobody can be bothered to refill it. And forget about sitting to enjoy the ‚Äòentertainment‚Äô as you‚Äôll need to get fed and seated by 1800 to stand a chance. It may seem like trivial points but over the course of a week it really starts to annoy and you realise just how overcrowded the place is and how bone idle most of the staff are. I say most of the staff some are incredibly active and turn the pool into an aqua aerobics human soup at least 5 times a day with music so loud and distorted it‚Äôs almost unrecognisable. The cleaners never cleaned our room once never changed any sheets or replaced the 2 towels they expected a family of 4 to share (asked for more and was repeatedly chinned off).  In summary; The best time we had on our holiday was the time we spent away from this shambolic hotel.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwN9464RU

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Luke J wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Fantastic family holiday.,"Just returned from a fantastic week at dar atlas resort. Honest review ahead.  The hotel and grounds are beautiful and spotless cleaners are constantly out day and night making sure everything is clean and tidy gardeners maids bar staff waiters all fantastic and very hard working.  Talking of hard working i really cant describe just how amazing the animation/entertainment team are at this hotel constant fun and getting everyone involved yes they do tey to get you up to join in but a polite ""no thank you"" is all you need. Big big thanks to Amin (the really lively one) sam rico zac mido and all of the others for making this place so memorable. Food: the restaurant is large and busy with the normal things that should be expected from a busy all inclusive restaurant its not nuggets and chips everyday always a good variety and always hot and plentiful morrocan night was great with lots of local dishes cooking away on traditional tagines. Plent of wine juice bottled water and fizzy drinks continental style breakfast with pastries cheese ham etc good coffees too. Pool. The pool is much larger than it looks in the pictures and our family of 4 never struggled to get 4 sun loungers with a parasol the pool are is busy and loud with music and activities going on throughout the day. There is a quiet (zen) pool on site too which looked lovely. You do have full use of the water park at the sister hotel next door (5-10 minute walk) which is great fun there is also an atm machine at the sister hotel which was handy. Room: we had a quad/family room upstairs in one of the many riad style buildings the room was quite basic but the aircon was good (weather was 40c during the day and 25-30 overnight) so the aircon was very appreciated. Our room was cleaned everyday with new towels provided and we were perfectly happy with it. Location: this hotel is a 25 min drive from central marrakesh and menara airport it's quite literally in the middle of nowhere with no shops or a.enities within walking distance the hotel provide a shuttle service to marrakesh for 20 dirhams each way per person.  Negatives: although we had a fantastic family holiday here there were some things that could be do a bit better. Although its classed as all inclusive there are hidden charges everywhere you have to pay for drinks at the zen pool why when they are included at the main pool 2 mins away ?? you have to pay for juice in the bar why when its free in the restaurant next door ? Premium cocktails have to be paid for and so does a city tax of 20 dirhams per person per night for your whole stay we didnt know about this until we arrived to check in. Glasses for drinks are so small you have to constantly queue up to get another one in the intense heat if only they used bigger glasses/cups it would save a lot of unnecessary queuing. Apart from these little blips i would highly recommend this hotel and would happily return for another stay.",Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454lukej

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Daniella L wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Honest review below Average not the best hotel,Went with my sister and booked through love holidays    When we arrived we were told we had to pay tourism tax which we did not know which was about 600 diram for a week and was told our room wasn‚Äôt ready and would be ready about 3/4 hours time    We had spare clothes and swimwear in our hand luggage so went by the pool and came back a few hours later and it was ready    Amazing hotel with beautiful greenery and two pools (ones a big main pool and the other smaller and adults)    Rooms were nice and was clean very good aircon which was needed with the hot weather our room was cleaned everyday but had a few days were our towels were taken and none replaced so had to call front desk for towels which we didn‚Äôt receive till the next day. Shower was very slippery and asked if we could have a mat and was told they didn‚Äôt have any to give so had to use a hand towel as slipped and hurt myself multiple times in the shower    Entertainment team were really good during the day and had a lot of activities to do during the day which were fun and put on a show every night were VERY VERY pushy to get people to go into the nightclub and wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer a few inappropriate comments and stuff made which made us feel uncomfortable and a few incidents with young girls being asked to go back to the entertainers room. Didn‚Äôt know if it was because we were two girls but the entertainment team would not leave us alone    Food was the worse part‚Ä¶breakfast was very limited no hot food and mostly just pastries lunch and dinner were very repetitive. If you liked meat then it‚Äôll be alright but no vegetarian options and hardly any variety especially for fussy eaters    Waiters were really nice and brought wine and drinks to our table most nights and made sure we are alright throughout the time    Booked all inclusive but found there was a lot of extra payments for things including the second restaurant tea/coffee cocktails etc and had to pay past 11 for any drinks wanted    Booked a few trips with the rep and they are not as advertised at all and were not warned went on a trip to the Atlas Mountains and wasn‚Äôt told this would involve climbing the mountain to see a waterfall with my sister who has mobility issues she couldn‚Äôt do this so wasted lots of money for something she couldn‚Äôt do was then told we had to pay the tour guide 100 diram for his time which was meant to be included in the price paid    All together was an ok hotel but not 5 star or worth paying for all inclusive.

Drink - must try the Atlas cocktail my personal favourite cold bottles of water always available but plenty of other choices too.  Pools - there are two pools in this hotel family one and an adults only one with a third pool/aqua park in the sister hotel 5 mins down the road. They are clean always plenty of sun beds and you can hire towels if you need to and if you can grab a parasol you will definitely need it.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Aabi WP wrote a review Aug 2022,30,AVOID IF YOU HAVE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS,The general rooms cleanliness was absolutely fine. Most staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Entertainment team MAKE the hotel and are the best part of it. They're are different activities every day and always some form of entertainment.  Bartenders are lovely drinks were absolutely fine and the option for Shisha in the evening was nice.    The ZEN pool is a life saver if you want a quiet area for just adults (although if you want safe space under some shade you'll have to get there early. Soft drinks are free at this pool alcoholic drinks are not).    My biggest issue and biggest complaint is the food and the entire dining situation. Unless you are at the door for the exact time meal times started you are never going to find a clean table or have hot food. The table clothes are just flipped around so you can still see stains from the previous families eating on that table).  You had to hunt down cutlery and plates yourself. And if you were lucky you might find food that was actually hot.  My biggest concern was when I asked a chef for a spoon for a vegetarian item he told me to just use the same spoon from the fish dish. It made me concerned about cross contamination and being sick.    Unless you're a meat enthusiast you'll be eating the same food everyday and unfortunately food is a major part of being on holiday.    I once got some carrot mash that had a whole uncooked carrot it in that hadn't been mashed up properly. Some days my roast potatoes were completely raw in the middle. Lunch and dinner are pretty much the same foods (other than pizzas outside) which meant I lived on pasta and courgettes all week. (Once I had a real treat of a stuffed pepper).    Breakfast is acceptable but if you're looking for a hot breakfast you'll be disappointed.    The entire dining experience stressed me out and it felt like you had to fight for a table or just hang around and wait for someone to half clean a table whilsts certain others received special treatment with a clean table automatic wine on their table and some didn't even get out of their seat for food and drinks! (Once you see the coloured wristbands you'll understand).  Cross contamination happened all over the restaurant so if you have an allergy or worried about being sick don't come here.    I never expect much as a vegetarian travelling abroad but this was the poorest experience of food I've ever received.    Other negatives:  -They didn't change our bedding the entire 7 days we were there.  -They DO NOT exchange money at the hotel so please change it at the airport. You have to walk to the sister hotel to use the ATM.  - It's difficult to find seating on an evening most people were using deck chairs by the pool so they could enjoy drinks and some entertainment.  -shuttle bus into Marrakesh doesn't have air conditioning.  -Not enough parasols/shade to keep out of the sun when using the pool!    Positives:  -The Excursion team are lovely and we had the best time seeing the waterfalls.  -The hotel has an amazing photography team.  -Shisha on an evening was lovely and we were well looked after.  - the grounds are lovely and green and well maintained.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aabiwp

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,James Gleave wrote a review Aug 2022,20,Full review if Valeria Dar Atlas,On arrival we whwre met with city tax that was 20 dirraham per day oer person this should have been highlighted with our travel agent. Our rooms where not ready at 13.00 and reception gave us the light coloured orange band meaning we where English this I thought to be extremely poor and is not equality as we would learn over time.    Rooms where very basic with poor flow of weak Aircon. Tv was small and looked as if it was thrown on the wall. WiFi signal was very poor and no towels tl have a shower. We had to contact reception daily to request clean towels and toilet roll as the cleaning consisted of emptying the bin and taking old towels. After 6 hot uncomfortable nights we had to complain again as the bedding had yet to be changed.    The food was much the same ever day and manic at meal times. The day time snack bar was a bread roll and jam which is extremely poor. The zen pool offered foor for a premium price and charged you for alcohol.    Entertainment was poor from my opinion and the notice boards for Entertainment did not match what was on. The staff where friendly enough but as the week went on we started to notice how the dark orange bands clients where served quicker larger drinks and did not have to pay for coffee which we had to. If you spoke French you received a lot better treatment than any other language.    Overall if I could claim a refund I would. It has put me off returning to morocco as the advertised hotel was not what we got.    2 star at most.

Holiday review o  Holiday review of CLUB DAR ATLAS.    On arrival to the hotel we where shocked to discover that we had to pay morrocon City taxes at check in. It was 20 diraham per person per day. Our stay cost for 2 people 400 diraham.  Our rooms where not ready untill mid afternoon and we had to wait round with no offer to change clothes since it was 46 degrees.  The rooms are basic and need a update but ok for for a couple but not a family as far too small. Air con was not the best in the room and none throughout the rest of the hotel.  Rooms was not cleaned daily and we left our sign out to request it be done daily.  Limited on toilet paper where we had to take napkins from the bar and call reception several times.  Meal times was extremely busy and very unorganised. Not a great choice for children. The have a pizza bar outside the food court that is only open when restaurant is however 2 hour wait for a 6 inch pizza as children was sick of eating pasta.  No where to get snacks from when the main food court wasn't open as the snack bar didn't actually provide food and if they did it was a piece of cheese and a bread roll.  The was one bar of a evening with one beer pump that kept needing changing so they would provide small cans of luke warm beer. The was limited staff serving at the bar.  The paid cocktails was exactly the same as the all inclusive ones but just served in a nicer glass and with ice.  All the staff work extremely long hours and seem to be there every day. The was very friendly.  We was there for 9 nights and are bed had not been changed until night 6 after complaining to reception again.  One bath towel and two head towels provided however if u hand them in to be washed you struggle to get them back until 6pm ish.  The second pool area is called the trinity pool. It has a bar and a restaurant however you have to book to use the restaurant and you have to pay for the same food as the main hall. Only difference was that it was more of a private meal. The bar itself only provides soft drinks and charges for tea and coffee.  WiFi is poor through the complex  TV signal poor.  Excursions to Atlas mountains on 4x4 was absolutely a big rip off. Spent all day in a 4x4 with several stops to places that only forced us to buy things. I was personally told I must buy some morrocon oil. I said no and the lady continued to tell me I had to buy and followed my around the hut that ended up costing us 80 pounds for a small 30ml bottle We had lunch included in the excursion however my partner was told off for drinking his own bottled water. He was told must purchase from them. He bought two cans of sprite at just under 10 pounds english money.    You are given a nationality wristband. English was light orange French dark orange green Spanish etc. Personally I found this to cause a little diversity. Especially at the bar and a meal times as dark orange wrist bands seem to have had more of and advantage of being served and as a petty ad it may sound drinks measures,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisabW1097EC

I can understand this mistake but what I can't understand is why this hotel denied us access to reception so we could connect to the WiFi to try and get in touch with our travel agent and use the facilities. Instead we were left with security at the side of the road in rhe middle of the day in 46 degree heat without access to food water or a toilet.    Disgusting way to be treated.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,kelly i wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Valeria Dar Atlas,This was the first time my friends and I visit Marrakech the hotel was amazing plenty of green space to go around the rooms were simple and clean in addition to the bar which was top quality a very special and big thank you to the waiters for their kindness and big smiles and especially their chef Youssef. When it comes to the restaurant breakfast i would honestly say is fine but lunch and dinner are pretty repetitive because the choices are a bit lacking and there isn‚Äôt enough of them however there is 3 swimming pools : a pool with animations and activities another one for zen and the last one with the slides in which we had a lot of fun. The animation team was doing a great job the spectacles the activities and the night parties everything was mesmerizing and fun but there was one major incident which ruined everybody‚Äôs fun and it involves the leader or supervisor of the animation team he has to stop hitting on and harassing customers my friends and i were in the club having fun and he started harassing one of my friends touching her and trying to force her to his room and this without me trying to go to too many details because it was honestly disturbing and scary but luckily we were there to fend him off of her we came to the hotel to have fun and feel safe not to be harassed and especially not by personnel however i wouldn‚Äôt change anybody else because everyone was very professional and welcoming.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,K-L-C87 wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Overbooked and Unhelpful,We arrived at this hotel which we had booked and paid for 6 months in advance only to be told at the security gate that they didn't have our booking and we would have to phone our travel agent to sort it out.    It was 1am 40¬∞ heat and we had very poor phone signal and no Internet. The hotel would not even allow us in to use the foyer and WiFi to call home to sort it out. We had to wait by the side of the dusty road with only our (non-english speaking) taxi drivers and an aggressive wild dog for company. Scrambling around in the dark to find our documents and emergency numbers to call home with poor connection.    Whether it was the hotel's fault for overbooking or our agents fault for not organising it properly we don't know. However to not even offer assistance or a telephone to use was very heartless and made us all feel vulnerable at the start of our holiday.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katylyn87

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Charlotte M wrote a review Aug 2022,40,10 day couples holiday,We just came back from our 10 day holiday staying at this hotel and although we enjoyed our stay there were some negatives to our stay    The rooms were very basic not like in the photos they were very clean but the air con was not great at all most nights we slept with our duvets off.    We didn‚Äôt go to the main pool as it was loud and busy which some people may like however we stayed at the zen pool which was lovely and quiet only fault was that there are not a lot of umbrellas for shade so you have to get there early to get a bed.    The food was okay very repetitive lunch was the same food every day and dinner changed but not very often sometime the meat was very dry and there are lots of little bones so keep an eye out for your little ones.    The entertainment was incredible they make the hotel what it is they have something happening most of the time and there is something fun planned every evening.    The excursion team were very helpful we recommend going on the trip to the waterfalls in ouzoud. Was beautiful and a lovely day!    The hotel is very out of the way from everything which stopped us from doing a lot so please note that it is not that close to the city centre,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlootey99

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Cally wrote a review Aug 2022,50,"A fantastic first ""all inclusive"" experience for our family.","We've just returned from a magnificent family holiday spending a week at Valeria Dar Atlas all inclusive. The weather hit 46 degrees and was a little tooooo much but we did pick to visit Morocco in late July!  Let‚Äôs start with the best bit ‚Äì the staff. The staff make this hotel they made us feel truly welcome and took note of what made us unique as a family. Our thanks have to go to Ahmed (bartender and our v shy daughter‚Äôs new friend) Soulamain (bartender taught us some Arabic and showed us how to write ‚Äúthank you‚Äù) Sofyan (liaison agent and metal music fan like us ü§ò) Idriss (young bartender and the most polite person ever) Azzedine (bartender) Hamza (photographer) Rico and Thomas (both entertainment team). We hope this review reaches their boss!  The hotel - classically designed for a modern hotel in Morocco it's set out in Riads of maybe 8-16 apartments/rooms round each courtyard. Our family apartment had a very large double bed and TV in a large main room with a mirror and bedside tables. Kids had a twin (note no doors between them and us!) there was a combined bathroom and shower (shower tucked around a wall so quite private) and a separate toilet room. No photos/artwork just plain walls so it did feel a little basic but it was spotless - the cleaning ladies are amazing. The air con (2 units 1 in each bedroom) don't really work to the point of making it cold so i can see why some people have complained about them but they do bring it down to bearable-in-almost-no-clothes and stop the otherwise continuous perspiration!    Theres a shallow baby pool and main pool at the main complex hub the main pool is shallow one end (great for games and aquazumba) with a shelf to a 1.6m deep end. Plenty of space for everyone while we were there. The separate adult only pool (away from earshot of kids and music) isn't deep but it is quiet and very pleasant. The aquapark ‚ÄúPalmeria‚Äù is based in the sister Hotel next door about 8 mins walk from Dar Atlas. Its free for anyone staying here and was worth a trip the main pool is big and cooler in temperature and the slides were good fun!    Entertainment is varied different each night of the week with live music singers games discos. Kids mini disco every night 830-9pm. The entertainment team do try to get everyone involved. The pool party was our favourite üòç    The main bar is air conditioned but I have to say it waa still very hot in the afternoon! The staff in here were our favourites they work constantly serving the many clients and always have a smile. Drinks that are included are various sodas tonic water and fruit juices whiskey vodka gin and mahia. Red rose and white wine as well as hot drinks and Moroccan mint tea. There's a cocktail list of included drinks (about 8 alcoholic ones and 8 non alcoholic) as well as a ""premium"" list which costs 70dirham each about ¬£5.80. If you buy a premium drink from time to time and tip the staff go the extra mile helping to find you a table or popping over with your ""usual"" included drinks which adds a lovely touch.    Finally the food - I've never been all inclusive before but we considered it to be a large selection at each mealtime we didn't have to eat the same meal twice. Lots of vegetables stews and tagine roasted meats and couscous and always plain pasta with a simple sauce if desired. A large salad selection breads cheeses at every meal. Dessert perhaps wasn't to our taste - it's little bite sized layered sponges and the Moroccan pastries were v heavy with orange flower oil (think about eating grannie's perfume and you're spot on) but theres always fruit available at mealtimes. We didn't feel the need to snack!    We had some professional photos taken by Hamza on two occasions and are really pleased with them. He even rushed our last set through to get us printed copies of our last night at the hotel before our 0645 taxi and was just a genuinely nice guy. The photos have turned out so nice we‚Äôre busy planning where to display them now we have come home.  It really was a fantastic holiday and while we probably can‚Äôt afford to come back next year we will try to come back in 2024 ‚Äì for our first all inclusive experience it exceeded expectations and we‚Äôve all fallen in love with Marrakech.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,nemo wrote a review Aug 2022,30,Honest Review,Honest Review.    Marrakesh in general was lovely but this hotel was very out the way about a 25 minute drive to the centre which also meant you had to pay for the hotel shuttle each time you use it or pay for taxi which is almost equivalent to ¬£15 one way. There was a lack of air conditioning around the whole hotel which was quite frustrating as it was hitting 45+ degrees. Entertainment staff was 10/10 along with the housekeepers excursions guide security guards and restaurant staff but receptionists came across very rude.  Food was very repetitive and basic. Same stuff ALL the time. Rooms were very outdated and nothing like what it looked like on the pictures. No ice ever lol. As a British person it was extremely difficult to communicate and understand anything as they seem to only want to cater for French people.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ashton-under-Lyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guide47702430194

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Bruce Wayne wrote a review Jul 2022,30,Honest review,On a 10 day holiday with my girlfriend we arrived at 11am and met with cold drinks with extremely friendly staff. We were told our room was ready for us early so we was very pleased. The room was also clean and tidy. Couple days in you find the food is very basic and it‚Äôs basically chicken or beef in the evening. Lunch was always better. Breakfast was ok but it‚Äôs mostly sweet treats. Pools are always clean and entertainment team are amazing big shout out to Rico Mouse Zak‚Äôs and Mido who made our holiday so fun. We enjoyed playing cards darts volleyball and water polo.    The pool bar is run by a guy called Salah and he was amazing and was always so happy. He always joked with me and was helpful with bringing drinks over made the days by the pool so much better. However the drinks are in very small cups. Some reviews say all inclusive drinks aren‚Äôt great but tbh we were more than happy. They have the usual with some alcoholic cocktails. Some weren‚Äôt great but we enjoyed the ‚Äòatlas sunrise.‚Äô Also you do have to pay for drinks after 11pm. But we always took a bottle or 2 of wine from lunch or dinner and brought that with us.    Had a few issues with evening bar staff we met other groups of couples and friends and they got funny with ordering more than 4 drinks even though it was clear there were 7 of us. Most of the time the girls came back with drinks which were clearly stronger. Also there was a member of staff from the bar seen asking a 15 year old for their number.    We had a few incidents here. My girlfriend choked on some food but the team are not allowed to touch anyone. Luckily the photographer came to help and he was amazing. There was also another incident which did result in an ambulance coming due to severe injuries. My girlfriends a nurse and we‚Äôre glad we were there at the time however some staff were caught videoing the incident and sending the video to all staff. She then asked reception whether they could wash her dress but they said she would have to pay which I find outrageous considering no staff knew how to help the guy after the incident. It seemed like no one was first aid trained at all.    Yes we had a few incidents however the hotel is average. They had a few good evenings where they had singers perform which were great. Some evenings were repetitive and often staff did nag you to dance. Which is hard when it‚Äôs still 40 degrees in the evening. One thing I will say is that the zen pool and water slides in the sister hotel is defiantly worth a visit. I hope this review doesn‚Äôt put anyone off as like I said the hotel is average and worth the money you‚Äôre paying.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Basildon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackwashere1234
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Claire H wrote a review Jul 2022,40,A great value hotel,Have just returned from this hotel a four night break for rest and relaxation with my husband. Firstly we have travelled extensively on the med and north Africa and were pleasantly surprised we found this hotel to be a good value choice for what we paid. The few negatives.... Not enough sun umbrealls/shades around the pools in the 40C+ heat this was sometimes an issue and hotel was only 60-70% occupied do it voukf get worse. Not enough hand sanitiser around (saw just 1 bottle at reception!) with covid on the rise and sharing of serving spons for food we thought his was an issue (we took our own small bottle everywhere) the zen pool does not serve booze?... Why? rooms are a little dated the main pool is bonkers loud busy chaos but if you want a bit more peace a 5-10 mins walk away is the zen pool utter bliss highly recommended. Now all the positives... Hotel has friendly staff spotlessly clean rooms well appointed rooms excellent air con any 'issues' (we had a broken safe) were dealt with really fast food was exceptionally good varied tasty and well presented the hotel caters for a French and Arabic customer think amazing pastries crepes at breakfast and amazing tagines at dinner this is not somewhere for an English brekkie chips or junk food you need a cultured palette and try the food out! drinks offering was fair to good branded non alcoholic and local alcoholic all tasty bar staff were patient and polite despite the lack of tips the staff especially animation team work soooo hard they deserve a medal entertainment was good especially for kids. This is a 4 star hotel officially and they'd get that for value and effort but technically I'd say it's more of a good 3 star if you want to dip into Marrakech it's close by (about 15 mins in a taxi) cost 150dh about ¬£12 there is a shuttle but we didn't use it it's much cheaper but at set times. This is overall a good hotel if value is key freindly people and tasty food is your thing you're onto a winner here.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pussycat81

The entertainment team are the best we have experienced and we have travelled all over the world. It was such an amazing holiday and was our first time in Morocco . The VALERIA DAR ATLASS hotel was incredible high standard. From the wonderful world buffet drinks selection of meal in the restaurant. The pools are is fabulous and you have a choice to take part in the many fun water games or dancing or chill by your lounger. We experienced an incredible fire show which every guest in the hotel probably came to see. Spectacular event! A massive Thankyou to all the staff- lifeguard who is super efficient DJ bar staff gardeners and cleaners who ensure the standards are very high. The Moroccan people are super kind respectful helpful and we never at any time felt unsafe even in the souks in Marrakesh. Massive Thankyou to the entertainment team who really made our holiday- (MAMADOSAMSOUFYANERICCOMIDOULILIFAYROUZADWA).and the lovely üíÉSANYAüíÉ the choreographer. Amine is just brilliant.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Taryn K wrote a review Jul 2022,30,First time in Marrakesh,"Arriving at the Valeria Dar Atlas resort we were met by friendly reception staff the room wasn't ready for us to check in but we were given our bands to access the all inclusive. The surprise at the reception was the city tax we had to pay this hadn't been mentioned on any previous reviews or had come up on the gov website when researching Morocco. The rooms were basic and clean however the maid helped herself to my friends money when she reported the incident the process was unclear as to how this would be resolved no compensation offered or follow up was made by they hotel. The member of staff had informed us similar complaints had been registered from other staying without our block of rooms. Moving on to the entertainment team. They do work hard and put a lot of effort in however they are relentless and do not accept no for an answer which I personally find frustrating especially when you are then told ""you're lazy"" ""you're boring"" not what I expect when I politely decline to join in. I found them to be very intrusive of my personal space constantly touching you grabbing your hands some would put their face very close to your own which is difficult to move when you are seated. One evening the entertainment team tried to force us to write a review he offered to write it himself this could possibly to flood down the serious incident review from the previous day. We used the spa which was a great experience the hotel has a shop with some basic snack bits no lays :( I would recommend researching any excursions you would like to do as the ""hotel rep"" didn't provide accurate information for a trip we booked. The food was alright nothing exceptional room for improvement. Previous reviews mentioned a Moroccan evening however when we arrived there was no mention of this by staff or on the activity schedule board. Despite previous reviews stating there was no food labels this seems to have been taken on board as the majority of food did have a label if not staff would advise you what the dish was. There was a lot of flies on/around the food which I know can't be overly controlled but just something to mindful of. The snack bar would serve drinks in small paper coffee cups no more than a couple of gulps per cup. Plenty of bottles of water they are colder from the snack bar opposed to the restaurant. Overall generally happy with the time spent in Marrakech.",Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119tarynk
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Bek wrote a review Jul 2022,30,"Good, improvements needed",I recently returned from a weeks stay at this hotel with two friends. Positives the hotel was basic but clean the pool area was lovely. The spa was wonderful! Entertainment staff were freindly and regularly tried to get us involved however im more of a spectator rather than a participator. All bar staff were friendly and really lovely!    Negatives food was below average for a 4* hotel. Limited choice and felt repetitive. Food was occasionally cold.    We did have an incident within the first few days where money was missing from my purse this was reported. This was missing as me and another person in my party withdrew the exact same amount in the UK before travelling and I only went into my purse the first time we left the hotel to realise I was missing money. I reported this as soon as I was back at the hotel the security man came to the room to view where the money was and take some details positovr start... please note I take responsibility for leaving my purse in my bag and chosing not to pay for the safe but i didnt expect someone to help themselves to it. I was told to either file a report at reception or go to the police station i went back to the reception after dinner to file this report to be told the security man will do this and to come back a few days later. A few days later arrived so I went back and the reception had no report and seemed unaware of this. So I cut my losses checked out and it was never mentioned again.    I have given 3 stars as I enjoyed the holiday things could be improved but I don't want 1 individual to ruin my experience or anyone else's. My recommendations provide safes for free if there is an issue in the hotel and improve customer service when issues are reported. And mix up the food choices.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bek201

Eventually got our room 902 not a lot of space to put clothes away especially if your there for 2 weeks and travelling as a family rooms are very basic and definitely need upgrading. Air conditioning wasn‚Äôt working properly so we asked to move rooms hotel did accommodate us straight away. Moved to room 1007 air conditioning was working great. Food is very basic and very repetitive after the 1st week we were dreading getting up to go food wasn‚Äôt cooked properly and we did complain to the head chef who corrected the problem straight away. Never seen any chips for a whole 2 weeks until it was EID then chips appeared. The drinks are not the best glasses are not washed properly leaving residue from the previous drink in it. This hotel is advertised as a 4‚≠êÔ∏è Premium it‚Äôs no we‚Äôre near that it‚Äôs not an all inclusive holiday you have to pay for the Al Alarcte restaurants if you visit the quiet pool or ZEN POOL you have to pay for alcoholic drinks and food. The water park and infinity pool as advertised is NOT at this hotel it‚Äôs in the sister hotel called Mango with which you can use but drinks and food you have to pay for. The only thing that this hotel has going for it is the entertainment team the go out of there way to entertain you work really hard and very long hours there a credit to this hotel 100%.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,TravelNotComplete wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Another fantastic visit,This is my second time visiting this time with my husband it didn't disappoint (to much)    Let's get the negative or disappointment out the way first the food let it down a little bit this time breakfast it all seemed to be the same options I'm sure last time we got more options including sausages etc (not cooked in sauces) and 2 days the evening meals seemed very limited but the soup was nice everytime I had it and the desserts were always great.    Now onto the staff I didn't encounter anyone who appeared unhappy in their job the Animation team were amazing as ever Soufiane Sam and everyone else ensured everyone had fun and nothing was to much bother for them.    I also have to mention the spa....you have to visit and get a hammam at the very least I ended up going back for a second hammam royal and my husband joined me for the second one definitely worth every penny.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ellie-Sue wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Amazing holiday at dar atlas valeria,We had the most amazing stay here at Dar Atlas. When we first arrived we had arrived late after our flight and the food service had stopped. However the man at the desk sorted us some food special from the kitchen himself. The room was lovely they are located in little blocks with amazing open courtyards in the middle of them. The air con was great and made the room a nice space away from the 45 degree heat when needed.  They mix the food up every day and at every meal which is great as you never get bored of the food. Some days there was burgers and and bbq for lunch and then a nice leg of lamb for dinner. There‚Äôs a salad bar as well if you fancy something lighter. All of the food is really nice whatever you fancy.  The pools are great and the entertainment that they put on throughout the day is great. They do water aerobics water Zumba and games of water polo. There is always something happening and to get involved in if you would like. Or if you would rather relax then there is a quiet adult only pool. Everywhere you go though there is always someone there get you anything you need and help in any way.  In the evenings as well there is lots of live music and other activities for people to get involved in. We got to dress in traditional Moroccan dress and take part in a fashion show which was a lot of fun. The entertainment team are always brining the fun so there is never a dull moment whilst staying here. Big up to Sofyan and sam sania mamado dj abdel rico mido mouss fayroz and fadwa Taha‚Ä¶ thank you so much for making our holiday amazing .  10/10 definitely would recommend wether you‚Äôre in a couple or with family or even solo!,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellie-Sue1

The bar staff for both the indoor bar and the outdoor bar by the pool have been amazing especially Salah his very attentive.

There is meant to be snacks as part of the all inclusive but it‚Äôs very hit and miss with what comes out. The best day for food was Sunday for Eid there was a bbq and the entertainment during breakfast was nice to experience the culture.  We had a power cut whilst we was here one evening and the reception staff handled it very well.  The room does slightly let down the hotel it‚Äôs very basic and although there is air con it doesn‚Äôt feel as cold as it should.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Lauren G wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Amazing!,Just returned home from holiday with my mum and sisters after staying at the Dar Atlas. The weather has been amazing - although almost too hot at times! The facilities at the hotel are amazing with enough space in the pools and outside areas for everyone and there needs.  All the staff at the hotel are more than helpful and everyone from the front desk to chefs and lifeguards are more than happy to help with whatever you need - often without you needing to ask them. The animation team here are amazing - we felt at home and welcomed the moment we stepped foot through the door. They work tirelessly and are so much fun - Soufiane Amine and Sam to name a few! Dancing and getting involved is very big here and there‚Äôs always something for you to do with them! The only thing letting the hotel down slightly is the food - but not everything can be perfect!

Special shout out to Moussa Sam and Rico who were very friendly and encouraged everyone to take part in activities. Also the female serving staff at meal times were very helpful especially Amina. Only two points which are disappointing is the food (quite dry and bland meat and deserts taste essentially of just cream). I had expected more traditional tagines and deserts! Also the hotel is on the outskirts of Marrakesh and you do have to pay for the shuttle bus all of which can add up. We did do a day trip to Casablanca too which was arranged through the hotel and which we enjoyed especially due to the cooler climate! The female member of staff who organises day trips is lovely and very helpful.

Arrived but rooms very not ready at 2pm and were asked to left luggage in untidy undone room.  Rooms were clean otherwise good size for a quad family with balconies no toiletries provided apart from shower gel and always had to ask for towels on numerous occasions even though it was a family quad room. The arc was a bit noise need a bit of maintenance.  The hotel grounds are kept clean and well looked after with lots of green and trees.  We enjoyed the spa facilities at a charge and found it to be very good value to money and enjoyed relaxing massage with hammams.  The property has 2 swimming pools including one for adults only and we enjoyed the both.  The food spread was good and offered a variety every day something for everyone. The AI  Local drinks were not upto scratch but enjoyed the beer and mint tea and coffee.  The hotel provides entertainment everyday and night to keep everyone busy with lots to do like Table tennis darts yoga classes aqua games cards etc.  Evening entertainment was set at different theme and enjoyed the atmosphere.  The entertainment staff were very friendly and attentive and look after their guest well with good laughs.    We had access to Aqua park located next door in sister hotel as part of the AI deal and thoroughly enjoyed it.    Staff at restaurant work hard but leave all the crumbs on the mats and chairs set for next diners need to be a looked at  and even saw a couple of times staff helping themselves to salad whilst clearing plates it was shocking when it comes to hygiene cleaning tables and putting same hands in the salad.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,IrinA wrote a review Jul 2022,10,My teenage daughter and her friend were sexually assaulted by a hotel worker,As I write this I am on the verge of tears and I hope this serves as a cautionary tale for others. My daughter is currently at this hotel with her friend. the girls are 19 and 20 years old. On the 2nd day of their holidays both were sexually assaulted by a worker. Listening to them describing what happened tells me the individual is a sexual predator and is used to doing this with tourists. I encouraged my daughter to report this but she felt vulnerable. I contacted Love Holidays who they booked with sending an email to an email address that no longer works. finally today my daughter having found alternative accommodation for the remainder of her holiday reported the incident to the hotel. initially the hotel seemed supportive but as my daughter waited for them to take action the hotel became more hostile and are now saying because she didnt report it at 12 o'clock today its got nothing to do with them and that my daughter needs to go to another hotel and get a taxi to the police station. earlier the hotel told my daughter that there have been other similar complaints made against the same worker yet despite this she just saw him working in the kids club with children sometime after she raised the complaint. I tried to speak to the hotel as a concerned parent but they didnt care - I asked to speak with a manager and was told the only way I could would be to send a message on tripadvisor.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irinadD1822YR

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,M S wrote a review Jun 2022,40,4 day break,The resort offers many tours and experiences with the advantage of pickup being from the hotel. In addition the reosrt has its own bus which travel to Marrackesh centre (Medina) every hour and costs 2 Euros. the quad biking was excellent and makes good use of the terain. Moreover it is only a few minutes walk from the resort.  Bear in mind the resort is in the middle of nowhere and you will need transport to venture into Marrakesh centre.  The waterfall tour was really great and is not too demanding on the legs. The food at lunch was also nice.  During our stay we opted for the all inclusive. The food was well presented and offered different varieties of meat dishes etc.  The bar at night was limited to just one barwhich meant the services for drinks was slow and often had to queu up for drinks. The entertainment was on everynight and is great if you have kids. The pool was adequate for the volume of people on the complex.  The staff were really friendly and helpful.  The rooms were ok. I was transferred twice from my original room because the AC did not work. Eventually I was given a room which was nice and cool. However many people complained that the AC was not cool enough in their room.  Overalla decent resort good food offering many tours from the resort.

Meal times were pleasant with a great variety on offer and no lengthly queing. we are in the mango restaurant which was an additional cost but so worth it.  The animation staff are absolutely fantastic in particular Amine Rico Mousse Sam SanyaNinaMamadofayrouzfadwamidou who worked their hardest to make us feel welcome and included. Both during the day and in the evening. theres always something to do if chilling out is boring for you.  would definately recommend this hotel even if based on staff alone. sorry to be leaving but im sure we will be back. We met these people as staff but we are certainly leaving them as friends.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivanbC2819MV

Honestly they are so welcoming friendly and full of fun.*hotel management if you are reading this you have employed absoulte gems - i hope you appreciate them* Food is good it's fresh and tasty but I'd imagine for the more fussier folk it may not be so good. The rooms are basic but seeing we paid at least half the price of some other 4* hotels its a compromise we were more than happy with. You can go to the water park too at the next hotel good fun! Lots of entertainment during the day - water polo darts dancing aerobics. There is also a zen pool and a massage spa area but we never went. Great night time entertainment it's in a mix of French and English but it didn't bother us.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,lsdmg wrote a review May 2022,40,Very good holiday on a budget,I went on a solo trip for 4 days to this hotel. I was straight away made feel welcome by all of the entertainment staff and the reception staff. In particular Sofyan would always check that I was OK. There is plenty to do. The entertainment schedule had lots on all day every day and a show in the evening. The entertainment staff are mainly there for the French travel company but they do make an effort to include everyone and speak both English and French. They work amazingly hard and a real asset to this hotel. The rooms are clean and spacious. The pool area is fairly small but there are plenty of sunbeds for everyone. I managed to get a sunbed at anytime of the day. The pool bar provides drinks in very small cups but they will give you a large bottle of water if you ask. The all inclusive drinks are OK. I mainly drank rose and the white wine which was decent. The all inclusive buffet food has no labels so you have to guess what it is. Again food is OK nothing amazing but is sufficient. Be aware that some food at breakfast and lunch is outside which can be confusing. The Wifi is hit and miss. Worked perfectly first couple of days including in the room until the 3rd day where it was only available in reception and then at the end of the 3rd day and whole of my final day the wifi was completely unavailable. I booked one trip via the hotel but it is designed for the French so worth looking into an English speaking company. The trip I was on was completely French speaking people no one spoke English apart from the guide who would describe everything to me on my own privately. There is a shuttle to the souks but I wasn't brave enough to go alone but everyone else coming back seemed happy with bags full of stuff. There is a little git shop on site selling souvenirs and basic stuff however I would recommend making sure you have everything you need such as sun cream toiletries etc as there isn't much to buy at the hotel nor is there anything around the hotel to walk to.

The room was clean fresh and well presented only slight issue was the phone didn‚Äôt work however we never needed to use it.    The entertainment team staff at this venue are amazing especially Sam and Soufiane.They constantly have conversations and want you to have the best stay possible asking if you had a good night sleep to do you need anything. Always putting you first and always smiling!! Won‚Äôt forget Sania choreographer and mamado the boss dj abdel Amine and locos faytoz fadwa and rico‚Ä¶    The facilities and activities available to you are best to none. There are several activities throughout the day. Water polo tennis aqua gym table tennis stretching and the list goes on!!!    There is also a smaller pool more exclusive and more private.

Everyone from the staff (Sufiane at reception) to all the amazing entertainers (especially Amine Sam and Rico) have made us feel so welcome from the moment we arrived and we made memories we'll never forget. The all inclusive provided us with unlimited cocktails coffee soft drinks moroccan tea and a variety of foods including authentic tagine. Definitely check out the aqua park at the neighbour resort called Valeria Medina they also have a quieter pool space and a range of water slides for kids and adults.    The shows in the evening were so much fun every night was different there was dress code for every night. We got to experience the different cultures in a wonderful performance they put together for us all at the resort.    Overall the resort provided us with the best facilities and everyone is super friendly and loves to get to know more about you and your experiences in Morocco.

The hotel was clean and tidy- the house cleaning was done to a high standard in the rooms.    The animation team went over and beyond to ensure we are having a good time and get everyone involved - 10/10 for entertainment.    The bar staff were lovely and very attentive! Always very quick and accommodating.    The only negative was the food was very disappointing- made me unwell. Nothing was labelled potentially the food was catered towards the French a bit more.

Sofyan Rico Locos Sam and Amine put in 100% effort along with Sania the choreographer. Mamado certainly knows how to run a great team. Abdel the DJ always has a variety of playlists to suit all tastes. The team as a whole always have activities and games available for the guests including volleyball water polo water aerobics and much more.    The bar staff were very attentive and nothing was too much to ask. Youssef the boss and his assistances samir and sbiti were great!    Our rooms were cleaned to a very high standard on a daily basis with clean towels always at the ready.    The food in the restaurant is more catered towards the French taste buds - so as a Brit I would certainly pack a few tubes of Pringles for times of desperate measure.

This hotel is supposed to be all inclusive we were on a 3 day high end mini break the the bathroom light didn't work we complained 3 times to reception no one came and fixed it we had to use our phones for light they didn't replace the toilet rolls and towels as standard we complained to the reception and nothing happened we ended up having to ask the maid directly we were charged to rent a safe and the beer they gave us as part of the all inclusive package was served in a small coffee cup ( 4 cups made one pint ) All other drinks were charged apart from one disgusting tasting cocktail and flat soft drinks. They charged for pool tables and when I asked for change to use the tables they didn't have any ( tried at reception and at the bar).    2. The sun umbrellas were all broken apart from 5 which people were fighting over people kept steeling ours when we were in the pool made it very uncomfortable.    3. The bar staff were rude the manager in the main bar poured my beer in a small glass and I saw there was a pint glass I asked for a pint glass he said' maybe later' gave me a filthy look handed me the small glass and walked off.    4. None of the food was labelled my wife is allergic to fish and we didn't know what contained fish. The meat was so tough it was inedible. Mass produced slop.    5. We have been to Morocco 5 times and this is the worst trip we had. If you want small cups of watery rank beer and food that tastes like it was frozen before covid then this is the place to come.    6. The pool guys were good though ( sports events thumbs up).    7. Evening entertainment was non existent.    8. Day trips trying to get information on them was like pulling teeth so gave up.    9. In the dining hall high end food items ( freshly cooked stuff) was put on the side of the counter ( such as large pies ) but not cut so you had to wait for a chef to walk over and cut them people came up to the counter for a piece of pie and the chefs looked up saw you and ignored you so people walked off if you stood there for ages eventually they came over and cut a piece (probably another way to cut cost).    10. weather was great.    11. The free bus drops you miles from the main market (souks) centre you get jumped on by so many people waiting for you there ( tour guides etc) after fighting your way through these people you have a long walk in the backing hot sun to the souks. Never had this before all other hotels drop directly at the main souks.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leehaddock

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Robin W wrote a review May 2022,50,Fantastic hotel,Fantastic stay here. We came home 2 days ago and I‚Äôve got to say the hotel was fantastic. The hotel itself is situated about 20 mins drive from the main square and souks but there is a bus that runs from the hotel every hour or so that costs 40 drms return. The hotel caters for families and couples with a lovely separate quiet pool and a pool with entertainment if that‚Äôs your bag. The food was superb with a wide variety to choose from and the staff were excellent. There was evening entertainment if that‚Äôs your bag but we just had a drink and flexed. This hotel was superb and I would have no issues recommending it to anyone travelling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St Austell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9002PRrobinw

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Andrew D wrote a review Apr 2022,50,A great hotel for couples and families alike,Dar Atlas is a great hotel with a great variety of activities to keep visitors of all ages entertained. I attended with my partner as part of a larger family group. The staff are universally friendly and are always happy to help out.    The animation team are truly the stars of the show. They're hard working and have a seemingly endless amount of energy and always aim to keep the guests happy. In particular Soufianne was very friendly and always made an effort to speak to the family and keep us entertained. Sam also did a great job of involving and encouraging our group to get involved without pushing us too far. Be warned - the animation team will try and get you involved and they can be persistent but if you're willing to go with it you're going to have a great time. If this isn't your thing you can always escape to the relative peace of the serentity pool. We attended as part of a large family group with a range of ages but we we never found ourselves short of activities to suit everyone. Across the course of the week we found ourselves involved in everything from volleyball to darts to the onsite spa.    The hotel is generally well presented. The gardens in particular are beautifully maintained and present many opportunities for holiday photos. The bedrooms are basic but generally clean and fit for purpose.    The hotel's main restaurant provides a good choice of food that will cater to most tastes. The Morrocan themed night went down particularly well with out party with a great choice of tagine dishes on offer. The restaurant would benefit from the use of labels on dishes. Often the soup of the day would be a lucky dip. While there were a good variety of dishes suitable for vegetarians the absence of labels was could be a little concerning.    Evening entertainment was varied and interactive. The animation team put in a lot of effort with kids and adults alike. The bar offers a decent selection of cocktails while the house wines and beer were not bad for an all-inclusive. My only criticism would be that the drinks tend to be served in tiny cups resulting in multiple trips to the bar.    Overall a great hotel that I would recommend to anyone visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewdT8259AR
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Clive wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Easter holiday,My partner and I visited Dar Atlas with her family for a week in April.    The hotel is pleasant and the pathway to the rooms (or riads) are particularly beautiful. However it is out of the way which means that you can't go for a quick walk - instead you will need to jump in a taxi or book the hotel shuttle (a day in advance) for transport into Marrakesh.    Rooms are suitable but perhaps in need of some modernisation. The patio and balconies looked out onto wonderfully managed green areas. Air con worked a charm. One room key card stopped working multiple times and probably should've been replaced by reception staff rather than being reloaded.    Breakfast lunch and dinner had plenty of variety although at times food items ran low and wasn't replaced quickly enough (or at all) by service staff. Cutlery also ran out quickly and was often unclean. The Morrocoan night was by far the best for food - with proper tagine rather than food being cooked elsewhere and then put in for effect like it was on other days. Lack of labels and allergy notices for food was disappointing.    Animation are the highlight of the hotel and other staff could learn a thing or two. They were very enthusiastic with their daily activities and events but weren't too pushy if we just wanted to relax by the pool. Particular thanks to Soufianne and Sam! I had a blast with the volleyball! Truly awesome group here.    There is plenty of pool space and sun beds however it was more of a hassle to get pool towels than it should've been!    Bar staff weren't very friendly to myself but seemed much more comfortable with women. Beer was pretty good and cocktails were fun even with vodka at 30%.    Spa was very reasonably priced and I really enjoyed the hamman experience! Worthwhile knowing that you may need to book 24+hrs in advance.    Lastly this is a predominantly French speaking hotel and many staff don't speak English particularly well. This means many activities are held in French and some documents such as pool towel reservation cards are only available in French too. It isn't a problem but just something to be aware of - brush up on some basic Arabic and French to help you along.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clivecf
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Clarissa O wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Family of 9 Easter Holiday Break,My family and I and our partners all came to Club dar Atlas for a week during the Easter Holidays.    The riads and the setting was beautiful although there is not much near the hotel and you will need to taxi or shuttle to get into the city centre which is easy enough with the taxi rank just outside.    There is just enough sun loungers available for the amount of guests although on our first day there were not enough towels.    The food was enjoyable though there are no labels and as a vegetarian it was guesswork to know if there was any meat in what I was eating. The Moroccan night was especially my favourite with the wide variety of beans. Really enjoyed the extensive amount of traditional pastries available for dessert.    There is a wide variety of alcoholic drinks included in the all inclusive so there should be something for everyone.    On our last day we went to the hotel spa that are on the grounds for a traditional Moroccan Hammam which was relaxing however the description should not include the term ‚Äúmassage‚Äù as it was more of a relaxing rub and scrub rather than full on massage but would still recommend.    The animation team are really enthusiastic with different entertainment provided every evening. There are a variety of activities provided throughout the day such as volleyball yoga dance classes darts tournaments as well as specific activities for older kids and although they encourage participation they also respect when you wish to just relax by the pool which is appreciated. Big shout out to Soufianne and Sam who took their time in trying to get to know us all individually as guests to ensure our stay was continually enjoyable.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clariscoll

A group of 9 ranging in ages each had something to keep them occupied. Many sports competitions dance classes and pool activities as well as the use of the spa and the zen pool. The animation team are friendly and inviting (especially Sam and Soufiane). The music and fun throughout the day was unmissable with Mamado and Abdul. The family friendly evening activities are great fun with Santa which lead to the discotheque into the night. The food varied each night and was enjoyed by all of us.

The hammam experience and body scrub was amazing relaxing experiences. There are interactive shows each night my favourite was Moroccan night showcasing traditional Moroccan musicians and dancers including the candle dance and belly dancers. This was also my favourite night for food. With the tasty tagines and spiced lentils beans and chickpeas. We were well looked after from start to finish by the animation team including Soufianne Sam Rico Sonia the choreographer DJ Abdel and Mamadol.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,donrash wrote a review Apr 2022,40,Easter Sun,We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights over the Easter Holidays.  Rooms are situated in lovely surrounding grounds they are clean & basic.  Food - nothing is labelled it can be a guessing game what you are eating. If you don't get in to the restaurant early it can be difficult to get a clean table or cutlery.  Pool bar - drinks are served in small paper cups there is a snack bar but it only serves pancakes & pastries at 4pm. There is no problem getting a sun bed you don't need to get up at the crack of dawn! Wi-Fi can be a bit hit & miss.    Reception staff - no customer service - they need some training from the Entertainment Team we asked for change for the pool table he just shrugged his shoulders not helpful why have a pool table if you can't provide change for it!    The Entertainment Team - They are a credit to this hotel they work really hard day/night offering a lot of different activities. These guys made our holiday enjoyable a BIG THANK YOU to Soufiane Sam Mamado and the rest of the team.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Kate S wrote a review Apr 2022,30,"Mixed bag, room for improvements but we had a very good holiday",Stayed in April 2022 with family.  On the plus side the hotel is beautiful and very clean reception area is stunning with a mosaic ceiling and enormous Moroccan lanterns. All communal areas are very good especially the grounds and gardens. Staff were welcoming and friendly in the main too. Lovely view of snow capped Atlas Mountains low level 2 storey hotel.  The negatives were that bedrooms are in need of an update especially the bathrooms which have a walk-in shower but no grab rail or rubber shower mats. A few of us in our party nearly slipped over - quiet dangerous. The food was average at best I ate mostly salad and bread all week. The dining experience was chaotic- not enough plates glasses cups serving utensils etc. When an item ran out there was no rush to replenish it nothing was labelled and due to the lack of serving spoons/tongs etc there was lots of cross contamination between dishes. Allergy sufferers nightmare! They don‚Äôt seem to have the basics right and definitely don‚Äôt cater to children‚Äôs tastes my son stuck to pasta all week. Deserts were better than mains lunch generally better than dinner.  Animation team were very good friendly and energetic. But after 7 days it did get a bit wearing and same-y. Still taking nothing away from them they work very hard and made our stay enjoyable.  Lack of umbrellas around the pool area and those that were there kept getting blown over. Needed to be more plentiful and substantial- another H&S issue. No tables with the sun beds either so when anyone jumped into the pool there was a surge of water which repeatedly soaked the floor and our belongings. Pool itself is ok but not heated so it was chilly - minimum depth 100cms in the adult pool with a shelf going to 150cms at the deepest part.  Towels provided for use at the pool have seen better days some were stained and a little threadbare.  Soft drinks served from 1ltr bottles which meant they kept running out and this caused delays at the bar.  All in all we had a great week the hotel is good but there is room for improvement especially on the H&S and catering.,Date of stay: April 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateS4012

Everywhere is spotlessly clean and the food is excellent (especially the lamb tagine).    The entertainment is very good (shout out to Soufiane Sam and team). They work hard at keeping the energy levels high even through Ramadan. They aren't pushy but are always on hand if you need them.    Kids club is great (Khadeja and her colleague).

This included airport parking flights hold luggage x2 transfers on arrival and all inclusive at the hotel.    We ate like a king and queen for the week and loved spending an uninterrupted week by the adult pool just soaking up the sun enjoying each others company and enjoying the delicious food. We didn't partake in any of the sports or evening entertainment but had a couple of drinks in the bar.    The staff are all extremely hard working there was only really one member of staff we found easier to communicate in English although the others did try.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Bethany hart wrote a review Oct 2021,30,Mix review.,Let‚Äôs start off with the rooms. On our first day we had to be moved rooms 3 times due to ants everywhere on every single room! Lucky on our 4th room there was zero problems and we could then start to relax and enjoy our holiday.  This hotel is lovely has beautiful scenery however the food massively lets it down!!! There isn‚Äôt a lot to eat and if anything I lost weight on holiday rather than gainingüòÇ  The bar staff were lovely especially said he made us feel so welcome from our first visit always would joke and laugh with us.  I just want to say a massive thank you to abdel and Sam from the animation team and they made us feel so welcome and relaxed and probably were the only highlight bar the sunshine within our stay here. They always done daily checks on with us and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and a massive help when it came to our room situation so thank you!!  Our holiday got cut short due to government guidlines changing. So it was a bit of a sudden leave for us but I just would like to say thank you to the manager at reception for understanding and sorting our rooms if any problems with your room go to him first as he sorts it right away that was the mistake we didn‚Äôt do.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Scott P wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Great holiday. I would stay here again,I stayed here for 4 nights from the 12th to the 16th of October I had a great time and I wished I stayed longer. The hotel is about a 25 minute drive from the airport. There's not much to do within walking distance to the hotel. There is a shuttle bus avaliable which was pretty cheap.    The hotel was clean and tidy and the gardens were picturesque. Both of the pools were very big. There's a main pool and also a quieter pool.    The food was pretty good it was mostly Moroccan food and there were plenty of things to choose from. Breakfast would have been better if there were more English food like beans sausages and bacon. Although the omelettes were great. The all inclusive beer was a bit watery but the gin and tonics were good.    The best aspect of the hotel was the entertainment. The entertainers were great at getting everyone up and dancing in the evenings.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Jeb wrote a review Oct 2021,10,Terrible Service,Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights from the 11th till the 15th of october. So I must start this review by mentioning the worst aspect of this hotel which was definately the sevice or shall I say the lack of service. The Waiters and staff running the bars are completely incompetent. We went all inclusive and each time we had lunch and dinner we would have to ask about 3 times for a bottle of wine. We are a party of 4 and they keep bringing a small bottle of wine which is not sufficcient to pour for all guests. Our hotel room did not have pillow cases and the sink in our bathroom was constantly blocked. When we pointed this out the estates lady simply unscrew the sink and left it upside down in the bathroom. You could see all the raw waste. absolutely disgusting. On thursday night they served food however decided to bring food to 3 of the guests on our table and kept serving other tables before actually finishing our table. This meant that everyone had to wait 22 minutes whilst there food was getting cold for them to bring the fourth guests food. What a terrible service. The bar staff are very impolite and everything felt like a chore! I would not recomend this hotel to anyone.  The animation crew where really good and friendly. They where very inclusive and tried there best. Also they kept saying snack bar however each time you asked for a snack they would say its run out. they dont actually have a snack bar!    I dout this is actually 4 star. more like a budget 3 star.,Date of stay: October 2021,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheltenhamspa1990

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,castigergirl wrote a review Oct 2021,40,Great for the price.,Stayed here for a long weekend. Would recommend for people on a budget but would pay a bit more and stay elsewhere if I were to return. The hotel itself is very nice spacious reception and dining area grounds are lovely and everywhere is well maintained and very clean. The two pools were spotless. It was quiet when we stayed and always plenty of space around the pool and minimal waits at the bar. The room was large and comfortable. The bathroom needs updating a shower room that has seen better days. The air con was effective against the 40 degree outdoor temp. The rooms were clean but do need a refurb. There is a lack of storage space small hanging area but no drawers or cupboards for a weekend it was not a problem but would struggle if staying a week or more. The walls are very thin and we could hear every noise from the room next door. The balcony was small but perfectly fine and private. There are no toiletries' provided other than a general dispenser of liquid soap. (not a problem but good to know) Daily housekeeping provided and one day we did have bottled water left for us. The hotel provides a shuttle service into Marrakech for 20 Dirham each way it was a 20 min trip and frequent. The all inclusive aspect was not what I have found in other places supplements were payable for most cocktails fresh juice and some hot drinks. The drinks were very small which meant returning to the bar more often. The package is supposed to include breakfast late breakfast Lunch late lunch snacks bar and afternoon tea and evening meal. We never found a snack bar open. One day at lunch i did not like the food (my personal taste nothing wrong with he food) went to find late lunch or a snack and was told it was closed until 4pm i asked at reception where i could get a snack and they directed me back to the person who said it was closed eventually a member of the entertainment team got me some food but this was a plated meal from lunch and not a snack or any choice. Dinner starts at 7.30pm which i find a little late. The choice of food was good fresh salads and different meat choices desserts were the same all the time. There is a lot of fish and poultry!! It would not be good for a vegetarian.  The best part of the hotel are the entertainment team they are all so lovely friendly and helpful. I took part in Arabic lessons but there was pool based activities and poker etc.. Each evening there was entertainment in singing disco and productions however the main even did not begin until 9.30pm.  Overall it was a good value for money trip.,Date of stay: September 2021,,"Castleford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/castigergirl

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Adam F wrote a review Oct 2021,30,Varied Quality,It is unfair to review this hotel as an overall instead I have reviewed various areas of the hotel    Grounds: 5* - The grounds are spectacular everything is very well tended with staff constantly maintaining the grass trees pool etc. The two pools are fantastic I can‚Äôt find any fault there    Staff: 5* - The staff are very accommodating they genuinely want to help you and seem to love their jobs. Sam in particular from the entertainment team is very personal not pushy but friendly    Room: 3* - Outdated and quite basic nothing wrong in particular just needs renovating hard on dirt in the rooms and on the windows. Not dirty in general but needs a touch up    Room Bathroom: 1* - Only word to describe these bathrooms is foul very basic just a standing shower that didn‚Äôt stay on the wall dirty and not maintained. If you are looking for a luxurious bathroom you wont find it in your room. The only positive of it is that the shower is powerful so you can get clean.    Food: 3* - I am not a picky eater whatsoever but this was very limited if you are or have a fussy eater or have a restricted diet I would avoid this hotel. The food they serve is okay in terms of taste but limited. When they serve Moroccan cuisine it is nice but the rest seems a stretch for the chef    In general all we enjoyed our time at the hotel but wouldn‚Äôt stay again its too far away from the city and there is a bit of a language barrier with most staff speaking broken English.    PRO TIPS!  - The shop at the hotel is limited you can buy some souvenirs and cigarettes but not much else NO TOILETRIES.  - The hotel offers a very limited shuttle service to the city so if you want to come or go to the city outside of these times you will pay 250-350 Dirham  - Taxis from the airport cost 300+ Dirham  - Go to the city to see the sunset!!!!,Date of stay: October 2021,,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamFletcher9233

Even though there was a curfew of 9pm at the time of our visit we still had a great time.    activities and entertainment was always great    I must say the customer relations manager was exceptional we had a few minor issues which was dealt with so professionally and quickly. he made time to introduce himself to all guests and made himself available when ever needed I was stung by an insect and he arranged for the nurse to check me.    TIPS:  This is a predominately French speaking resort staff have got a basic level of English but if you need a nurse ect. I would recommend to google translate questions/symptoms    They have an onsite shop which has your usual ciggerettes souviners ect.

We booked this holiday with easyJet holidays and it was down as a 4 star. I agree that the facilities spa pool areas cleanliness food and animation were probably to this standard but the rooms were definitely not. Unfortunately the rooms were quite basic and tired looking. The beds were too firm and the pillows weren‚Äôt great either (sorry!). It‚Äôs such a shame because the resort is so beautiful and picturesque. The air con was only to one setting and we couldn‚Äôt change it. The WiFi worked in the room but only in certain locations.  The food was fine but the queuing got a bit ridiculous I don‚Äôt know whether it was because were British and we know how to queue but there were several occasions where people cut ahead of us which got really annoying. Luckily the staff started to notice this the more busy it got.  It‚Äôs probably worth mentioning that we were perhaps only 1 of 3 other British families in this resort during our stay. The majority were french speakers and it was great obvious that there was a bit of a hierarchy when it came to getting drinks at the bar/ queuing for food/ entertainment (everything was in french).

Firstly the check-in .. they didn't make you feel welcome and it felt as we were an inconvenience . The hotel mainly seems to cater for the French. The food is horrible whilst there is a selection most of it is not edible in my opinion. Birds are eating the bread you will be lucky to get a clean table and if you do good luck finding cutlery. The drinks are as bad all local drinks but dont taste anything like the drink they are supposed to represent. There is nowhere to sit in the evening except the bar or outside which is packed. WiFi is only available in reception. The pool was nice but get there early as its packed and later on we saw guests sitting on the floor .

The level of all inclusive here is very low and you will be searching for food outside of breakfast lunch or dinner. The snack bar is a joke a couple of crossaints or a pancake. Poor selection and nowhere near enough on offer. Not all drinks are covered in the all inclusive either so be aware. The entertainment staff were good but they were sent packing by the management on day two of the trip due to the coronavirus. I have to be fair and say that these were exceptional circumstances but nevertheless this hotel was still very poor and I wouldn't recommend to anyone to visit. If you like a little bit of luxury and good standards then this isnt the place for you.,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanpoole12
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,kevred123 wrote a review Mar 2020,20,Started so well,Got to hotel in Friday night check in was nice and quick as they told you nothing just gave you keyhad to search for room. Room was good clean and cleaners were fantastic. Hotel grounds were amazing. Animation team great and food was good. This all changed on Sunday when there was a mass checkout of French and Dutch due to the covid 19 and the airport closure. With only english left the staff became rude the food became poor to say the least and help was non existent. We were all at risk of being stranded in Morocco for months and they did not give us any help what so ever and even refused to print our new flight tickets off. We were leaving 3 days early so surely would of been cheaper to do this. I understand these were exceptional circumstances but a little help would of gone a long way as this was horrendous for us and the worry was horrific,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevred123
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Mel P wrote a review Mar 2020,30,A chilled out week,Stayed beginning of March and blessed with excellent weather all week.  Arrived late and no problems with checking in no welcome or complimentary food or drink in the room - we booked through on the beach and I wonder if this is offered if booked through tour operator.  Room is adequate in size and very clean mattress was very clean with protector though not especially comfortable I have however had worse. Duvet clean and warm with additional blanket and only one pillow.  The room was dated the bathroom in desperate need of a revamp mould in the grouting and the condition of the shower was quite unacceptable though it did offer hot water. The position of the shower resulted in water coming over into the main bathroom area making it very slippery. The hairdryer kept cutting out.  The towels changed daily and where soft and white. No toiletries other than wall mounted soap dispenser.  No drinks making facilities.  Working safe but you had to pay for it.  Wall mounted TV offered some British viewing.  The whole complex was clean.  We spent the whole of our stay making use of the Zen pool and can only comment on that though we did use the pool bar in the late.  All inclusive at the bar by the zen pool only allows the bottled water all food and drinks have to be paid for.  When going to the pool in the morning - around 10.30 the beds would still be in the hap hazard way they where left the previous evening the water bottles and rubbish not tidied up  on two days the rubbish not removed at all.  We didn't participate In the entertainment and unable to comment other than to note people seemed to enjoy it.  The food was ok quite repetitive especially breakfast and lunch dinner was themed - Spanish Mexican Moroccan and a gala night. Service was good in majority sometimes too good where the plate was whipped away too soon.  My concern was the cooking process the omelettes where often undercooked though if asked they will continue to cook them for longer. They often serve the meat as rare and the burgers where just a little too pink In the middle. Pudding where a little disappointing and very repetitive.  Getting a morning drink was often a problem be aware you are charged for the orange juice and there was insufficient cups and machines for the hot drinks no decaf of anything.  All inclusive drinks where the usual none branded and good the bar always appeared to be well staffed but I failed to work out what system they were working to if you asked for a coffee they referred it to someone to the right they seemed unable to take an order of more than one drink or they just ignored you.  Money exchange on site and reception very helpful if not busy at most times.  Having looked at previous reviews it talks of language barriers I can‚Äôt say there was any problem with this other then as a Brit often it is our only language where as most staff seemed to be capable of offering us three options.  In summary we enjoyed our stay and on the basis it wasn‚Äôt expensive it was value for money. However it does not offer the 4* facilities you would expect like toiletries slippers WiFi throughout a sensible gym and more modern interior.  If looking for a inexpensive break I would consider it again but have stayed in a number of places in Morocco previously that have the edge on this.,Date of stay: March 2020,,Shropshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/85melp
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Susan W wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Nice hotel shame about some staff,Hotel facilities are good - you get what you pay for as always. Rooms spacious and 3 beds comfortable and clean. Bathrooms dated and our shower head broke sadly.  Small terrace to sit out although rooms sleep 3 every room only had seats outside for 2 !!    Food very good. Always plenty of choice and to a high standard for all inclusive. Breakfast hot drinks a little more tricky and would often run out of cups and with only 2 self service drinks machines they were often running out of something.    All inclusive drinks good - the usual beers wines and local spirits. A few cocktails also available with the option to pay for branded spirits and wider range of cocktails.    Pools lovely. Always plenty of comfortable sun beds at this time of year. Pool area clean and towels provided.    Entertainment team lovely. Very hard working and friendly. Always something to do if you‚Äôre that way inclined- aqua aerobics stretching darts dancing shows etc. Friendly and encouraging but we didn‚Äôt find them too pushy.    Sadly the only negative would have to be the attitude of some staff. Grumpy and unfriendly at times. Reception badly managed and we were made to feel like an inconvenience. When we asked about late check out we were offered to keep our room for 30‚Ç¨ - not worth it for a few hours although be aware there are no shower rooms available either to wash and change prior to departure.,Date of stay: March 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanwQ8337WZ

The staff were all lovely especially the animation team who worked really hard at various activities near the pool and encourage guests to join in. The staff always had a smile on their faces and ran the entertainment with much enthusiasm.  The swimming pool was clean and warm. There was plenty of sunbeds to sit on too.  The evening entertainment was really good especially the ' Fire Eating' evening.  We went on one of the trips to the 'souks' in Marrakesh. the trip was very well organised and gave us an insight in to the Moroccan way of life.  The food at the hotel was very good with a lot of choice even for picky eaters. The wine at lunch and dinner was really good.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,karenj27 wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Perfect mini break for one!,I went for my first solo holiday here in Marrakesh. Absolutely loved it! The hotel staff were very welcoming put on great entertainment and I didn‚Äôt need to spend a penny on top of what I‚Äôd paid.  The weather was ideal taxi transport to and from airport also really handy (I pre booked through Love Holidays).  I only stayed here 3 nights but will definitely be coming back for longer to do more exploring.  Room was clean and tidy. Perhaps a little tired in places but I‚Äôm not one to care about that. It‚Äôs only a bed for the night after all! There is a fridge in room so you can keep your bottled water cool.  No fights for sun loungers plenty to go round. Pool bar is great and offers snacks inside. Music is sometimes played around pool which I didn‚Äôt mind.  All meals in dining room were fine. Good choice of hot and cold options. The paella was lovely the tagines delicious and the omelettes were freshly cooked for you at breakfast time.  Tables were cleared a little too quickly sometimes I saw a few diners get up for more food only to return to their table to have it cleared away along with their drinks! But if paid AI you just get another. I recommend leaving an item on the table do they know it‚Äôs still occupied.  I asked my taxi driver to take me around one day as I wasn‚Äôt keen on doing the markets alone. I highly recommend you do as it was stress free and he takes you to see the sights. Only cost ¬£20. I visited the Marjorelle Gardens (note YSL Museum is closed on a Wednesday I got caught out ‚òπÔ∏è)  I didn‚Äôt use the spa but another solo lady I met did and she recommended it. Or at least to wander towards it as the area around the hotel is lovely.  Thank you for a very relaxing stay. I will be returning!

The hotel is very clean and the grounds are lovely. A few downsides not enough to spoil the holiday but I think people should know. All inclusive is just wine and beer all sprits and cocktails you have to pay for. The fitness centre you also have to pay for. We arrived at 2230. No food available which I guess is fair enough so went to the bar which is a bit like a working mans club and got a drink after 11pm you have to pay for all drinks even hot chocolate from a machine. I‚Äôm sure it said a free shuttle to the town but you have to pay not too much but still. Also you have to pay a tax when you arrive. They have a restaurant aside from the buffet but you have to pay for that!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Team Kemble wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Relaxing half term break with the family,Peaceful accommodation set out in little riads amongst beautiful gardens with rose beds orange trees fountains palms and even a lake. The rooms were spacious and comfortable . We were particularly happy with our south facing balcony. Heated swimming pool with plenty of sun loungers and shade if needed. Music and entertainment between 10.30 - 12 and again 3.30 - 6pm. The Aqua Gym class was a particular favourite for my daughters (16 + 9) and I. The staff were incredibly helpful and spoke excellent english. Thank you Sam Rico and Abdul for your jokes card tricks and morning yoga classes on the terrace. You can get as involved as much as you like with the activities/evening entertainment or retreat to the calmer parts of the complex if you want peace and tranquility. Food was varied with plenty of hot/cold options bread wine etc. My daughter and I are veggie and were incredibly well catered for. The Moroccan pancakes went down very well both a breakfast and in the afternoon snack bar. I'd recommend the hotel to anyone wanting a restful break with children. Only info that would have been useful before is that the spa/quiet pool are adult only so you are relying on good weather as although the main pool is heated it is still quite cold! We were very lucky and had 26 dgs during our week in February but you wouldn't want to swim if the sun wasn't out or if it was windy. The rooms are a bit shabby in places (particularly bathrooms) and you don't get robes toiletries tea/coffee etc so some people might question the four star rating however that didn't bother us as the beds were clean and comfortable and we had plenty of towels. The queues for food get a busy at peak times but the staff are all working incredibly hard to provide all we could ask for in terms of drinks/snacks etc. and we had a wonderful rest together. Our girls haven't stopped talking about the pool food and fun we had. Thank you!,Date of stay: February 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poodlenearly40

Unfortunately there was a problem with the heating in the rooms which was needed in the evenings but we were provided with a heater when we mentioned the lack of heating at reception. The hotel was less than a quarter capacity so meal times were a pleasant experience as the restaurant was not busy and the food was very acceptable and nicely presented. The animation team were enthusiastic and worked hard.  We probably won‚Äôt visit this hotel again but overall we enjoyed ourselves,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7173DGcarolynb
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Chris G wrote a review Jan 2020,50,A hidden gem,We and my girlfriend went for a couples retreat with no stress. Got exactly what we wanted beautiful sun staff that attend to every need we ever wanted! Everything that came with the all inclusiveness was amazing (but not the hangovers) Yes it is a French resort but EVERYONE who works there pretty much can speak English or on a basic level can understand you - room service is through and the AC is so powerful. WIFI actually works; which you need with it being outside of EU.    PLEASE WHEN TRAVELING FROM AIRPORT FREAK OUT. IT IS ROUGH ON THE WAY BUT BE PATIENT IT IS WITH IT.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Val W wrote a review Jan 2020,20,Very disappointing,Let's start with the positive - the site and the rooms were kept clean    The negatives - The whole place is tired and needing a good overhaul. The WIFI only works in the reception area as soon as you leave the reception you loose connection. The staff are polite but speak very little English which did cause us some problems. The entertainment was very amateurish always in French but executed with enthusiasm. We were there in January 2020 so a heated swimming pool and/or an indoor pool were essential. Sadly the heated outdoor pool was very cold and the indoor pool you have to pay to use. The food looks lovely but is served cold or luke warm we had to microwave the meals if we wanted a hot meal. Lots of the crockery is cracked and chipped. At meal times sparrows are flying around the dining room sitting on the food and pecking at it. Overall as English (denoted by the cream wristband we had to wear) we felt very out of placeisolated and not very welcome. We weren't treated in the same way the French visitors were. Thankfully we were only there for a short break but that was long enough. Our recommendation would be to steer well clear of this place.,Date of stay: January 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valw947
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,John Dempsey wrote a review Jan 2020,50,First time visitor,Really enjoyed our stay. The staff were friendly helpful and courteous.  We had no real problem as some have described with the language. A smattering of French helped but a lot of the staff had some English and a few of them were very fluent.  We thought the food was excellent with lots of choice.  Excursions into Marrakech itself were not expensive and we enjoyed the city immensely.  We did not do any of the day trips although they seemed reasonable.  The room was comfortable and was serviced every day.  A couple of days of rain (end of November) did not spoil it and the sun shone the rest of the time without being too hot.  The extensive grounds and gardens are well kept and really pretty with lots of flowering plants and loads of roses.  I would say that two weeks was too long for us and ten days might have been a better choice.,Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayemdee2

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,PL54 wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Family of 5 for 3 nights,OK I had read many of the reviews in advance of our recent trip - here are my observations following our family of 5's recent 3 night stay:    The food was good and plentiful and if my fussy 8 year old ate well then it must have been fine.    The primary language is French - which is not surprising as it is a primary language in Morocco. If you want an English speaking resort I suggest you go to Blackpool    Staff were generally good and keen to help - however anyone working in the bar beyond the age of 25 tries very hard to be as grumpy as possible.    The ATM wasn't working but the one in the neighbouring hotel was.    The Cashier / Bureau de Change had no change.    Rooms were clean and comfortable but probably not renovated since they were built so a little shabby. Shower cubicle especially needed a good overhaul.    Evening entertainment was fun but very amateur (and in French of course (see above)).    Grounds and pool area etc were pleasant and well maintained.    All inclusive drinks were fine - wine service in the (buffet) restaurant quite slow but we worked out how to serve ourselves :-)    Yasmine very helpful as highlighted everywhere else.    In overview - it is fine but not high end...we paid about ¬£35 per person per night for an all inclusive hotel so no complaints.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PL54_123

Food good for everyone but mass produced and different theme every night...do not expect a la carte !!! All spoke French...but ask for anything and they will try and get it for you. Ran out of food and drinks sometimes. Food available all day.  Minus points: tired and dated...but you don't go to Marrakesh for neat pointing on tiles in your hotel!!!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Janp wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Here for a 4 night break.,If you are considering hiring a car - DON‚ÄôT! We planned the route from airport to hotel & printed out a colour map... upon leaving the airport we realised there are no road numbers whatsoever! What road signs there are are mostly in Arabic & no road names are shown either. Suffice to say that it took 4 hours of nightmare driving conditions and 112 kilometres (over 70 miles) to actually find the hotel. The way the people drive here defy description & I cannot understand why there are no dead bodies littering the road - but they seem to manage getting from A to B in 1 piece...    As mentioned by others the hotel is off the beaten track per se but the staff are welcoming & try to accommodate your wishes (especially if you send them an email the week before - we requested first floor with afternoon sun on the balcony) & that‚Äôs what we got - grand! The food was plentiful & tasty & omelettes are good for breakfast but no sausages or beans... the rest of breakfast is a diabetic‚Äôs nightmare! Moroccan doughnuts pancakes honey & stuff like crunchy peanut butter - absolutely delicious! We were all inclusive so nothing else to pay unless you wanted branded spirits (the local gin etc. is 30% ABV) - the wine is local but very quaffable. Staff understand English so no language problems & its a refreshing change not to hear (sometimes) loud ‚ÄòBrits abroad‚Äô all around you - the French are much more quietly spoken.

The rooms here were basic no frills simple decor and clean and fresh with a small terrace through the patio door.  The bar and restaurant facilities were of a decent standard copious amounts of med-high quality food fresh hot and varied. Beef lamb and chicken were plentiful with rices pasta salads and breads.  Breakfast too was adequate with Moroccan pancakes and various omelettes being particularly tasty.  The beer wine and soft drinks were of a lower quality but an endless supply. The restaurant staff were so friendly often seating and bringing drinks to guests even though it was buffet service.  Entertainment was poor with little for adults with the hotel set almost in the wilderness it was a case of making do.  A band or a tribute act would have been welcome!  The worst aspect of the hotel was a busy reception desk with long queues. Nobody was available to advise or reserve excursions throughout our stay. No recommendations leaflets brochures nothing.  One member of staff who excelled was a ‚Äúsecurity guard‚Äù at the front door who went above and beyond his duties by organising taxis and even a camel ride!  We thank him for his friendliness and dedication.  The break was good value a reasonable hotel in a remote setting as for the surrounding areas it seemed like a war-torn region desolate and barren.  Think carefully before taking a trip into Marrakesh the town appeared to be full of chancers out to capitalise on the vulnerability of tourists.

Our room was booked for 3 adult people. There was no pillow & towels for my special needs son we asked twice at the desk that evening they arrived midday the day after! I had to ask to use the safe in the room and have it opened nor were told there was a cost. However on checking out we were asked to pay for use of the safe this was a guy who had perfect linguistic skills at arrival in the evening and played dumb when charging us! This is billed as an all inclusive hotel - really! The allergen advice required you first to know what dish you were about to consume it was all in French and in very small writing high up on the wall impossible to read! Food was therefore somewhat restricted even upon asking what was it called we merely was given a shrug of the shoulder. Drinks and instant coffee in the bar only free until 23:00 hrs and then only served in very small glasses necessitating several trips to the bar for even an equivalent pint of beer. The glasses were merely rinsed in running water then reused no regard for hygiene at all. The pool towels were stained. There was a nice looking restaurant towards the far side of the complex with a nice quiet pool however drinks and food had to be purchased at ALL times!!

They speak mainly French but hey your on holiday in a French speaking country not Margate!  There is a quiet pool ideal if you want to soak up the sun with plenty of sun beds.  Drinks are the norm for an all inclusive but again don‚Äôt expected gold plated when not paying for it.  Rooms were clean with good air con.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Pel1n wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Lovely time in Lovely Hotel!,Had some little worries after reading some reviews about this place however I needn‚Äôt have worried at all!    Firstly transfer from Menara airport is about 30 mins or so so not bad.  We arrived at the hotel around 1130 am and check in is not until 2pm but this was not a problem. We were offered somewhere to leave our cases and told our room would be ready in half and hour which is was!    Rooms are clean and well kept. We were on ground floor in a standard double and had our own little terrace. Our room did not have a kettle iron ironing board or hair dryer. Not sure if the upgraded room options do or not.    The food in this hotel is buffet/ carvery style and is amazing! Everything is being cooked fresh at each sitting right infront of you. Breakfast is pastries fruit eggs and omelette station. Lunch and dinner have a huge variety of meat and veggie options large salad bar and dessert station.    Hotel has 3 pools- a big one where all the entertainment takes place. A baby pool and an adult only pool which is really really quiet!    Had a massage in the spa which was really good. Paid about 460dirham for an hour.    The hotel has a couple of little gift shops connected to it BUT from what we could see there was no where to buy snacks etc if you like to have that type of thing in your room. So if you do I would advise to take them with you. We did and we‚Äôre glad we did!    We took the shuttle to the Souks which was 20dirham each way. However we got a taxi back which we paid about 100 dirham for. Souks were just what we expected lots of gifts souvenirs Argan oil etc. There are restaurants and cafes around too.    The animation team work alllll day long to keep guests happy and entertained. It‚Äôs true that they mostly speak French but they made an effort to include the English guest and explain what was going on. Their evening Caberet shows are easy to follow and fun.    Would defo recommend this place! Can‚Äôt wait to go back again.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pel1n
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Philip D wrote a review Oct 2019,30,A quick dash to Morocco with friends,We arrived very late to find the waiting car and sped of into the night. A desert trip that took longer than expected as the driver realised he didn't know to which hotel he should take us.  In the early hours he deposited us at the hotel and left.  We then discovered that were at the wrong hotel.A golf buggy was called up and we eventually arrived at Dar Atlas.    Lets start with the plus side. The grounds and walkways are enchanting.The food is varied and suits many tastes but is mass catering in a large dinning hall. Best to sit outside.  Although all-in the bar regularly has no beer or bottled beers available and the wine is either redwhite or rose.  The hotel is popular with our gallic friends so brush up on your french.  Sometimes the hotel staff are very helpfull and at other times not.  The bedrooms are basic and you have to pay for the safe. The mini bar is not stocked.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Adrian B wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A terrific place - one we couldn't recommend more highly!,We returned last week from a 4-night honeymoon stay at the Club Dar Atlas just outside Marrakech. It was certainly an eventful trip! We arrived after a 2000 mile journey to discover that our booking had been cancelled a week earlier without our knowledge. It turned out that our holiday company had been a wholly owned subsidiary of Thomas Cook and had consequently ceased trading at the same time as the main company. The holiday company that had taken on Cook's obligations hadn't got round to telling us about the cancellation. Nevertheless the hotel itself proved to be exceptionally sympathetic and understanding. - particularly their Guest Services Manager Yasmine. I had to pay again to secure some rooms but we were given upgraded accommodation in the Tizi N Tichka villa block which was really a quadruple apartment with two balconies. The hotel grounds were extensive and extremely pretty. There were two outdoor pools poolside bars and a spa. In addition there were many acres of well kept grounds with a large pond wildlife palm trees and vast amounts of blooming hibiscus flowers of all colours along the estate perimeters. We stayed on an all-inclusive basis and breakfasts lunches and dinners were all uniformly excellent. Food was served on a self-service carvery basis in a large sunlit hall. There was plenty of choice on all occasions and menus offered reflected a wide range of different tastes. - Not the place if you wanted frequent burger and chips but just the ticket if you enjoyed experimenting with well cooked tagines fresh salads fish and chicken etc. The clientele were predominantly French with a smattering of Dutch German British and other nationalities present. A few of the staff were reasonably fluent in English but French was the main language of communication. We got by without any problems using our basic school standard French supplemented with the odd learned word of Arabic (which caused some amusement). The entertainment provided outdoors in the evening was varied of a good standard and also delivered in French. Given the fact that Morocco was part of the French African empire until the 1950's it's not surprising that French is such a dominant language in the country. Without exception all the staff whether entertainers working for 'Club Lookea' bar staff caterers management receptionists or domestics were courteous and eager to help. In short the hotel is a terrific place - one we couldn't recommend more highly.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Cheshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snakehipsdawn46

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,needabreak wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Ignore bad reviews,Firstly yes it's mainly french so if you have a problem with them stay away  Secondly please ignore the bad reviews god knows what some people expect.  The hotel is set in lovely grounds and pool is a great size with ample sunbeds and never a problem getting one.  The food was lovely and catered for all tastes unless you like to live on a McDonald's diet. Food is available from 7.30am till 10pm so you wont go hungry.  As said before on here Yasmine in the reception area is a great help ( only needed her once ) to call our transfer to airport home and Najib in the pool bar is a credit to the hotel.  The bar staff in the Atlas bar arnt the most expressive when it comes to smiles and politeness but that's just a small niggle.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,LMS wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Average hotel - very french and cleaners steal from your room....,On our first day we went down to request for the safe in our room and go down for breakfast. We were out of our room for a maximum for around 25 minutes and returned to find some money had been taken from the room. We went and reported this to Yasmin as she is only one in the hotel that speaks really good English. Their processes around this are particularly strange including having 4 security staff search the room asked to identify who took the money (despite not knowing) and requesting we go with them whilst they search the cleaners and their lockers which we refused as it seemed particularly invasive. This was never resolved and the staff made no mention of this again.  Although Yasmin told us they had never had issues with theft before whilst walking around we heard her tell a further 3 people that this had never happened before  The entertainment every day around the pool and in the evening at the bar areawas all in French and we couldn‚Äôt understand any of it. There were 2 female entertainers who would point blank refuse to speak to anybody that was English there.  Every night we were there the beer ran out at the bar at 9:30pm - Which is quite annoying when all you drink is beer and not spirits.  The swimming pool was fine and we always managed to get a sunbed at any time that we went down there.  Overall we wont be returning for the main reasons of it being a very French hotel we had money stolen from us on our first day and the beer ran out every single night,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Yateley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leannesP3814UY
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Mark B wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Categorising guests and treating them differently - its 2019??,In general this was a nice holiday amazing weather and a nicely laid out resort with a huge swimming pool.    What really put us off apart from the bland and tasteless food was the bizarre and unnecessary wristband system:    French guests: Green  English guests: Beige  All other countries: Red    This seems ludicrous to us as why would any holiday resort make such a clear and blatant separation of their guests.    Well the answer to this became more clear as the holiday went on when extremely rude and sometimes aggressive bar staff ignored those without green wristbands . Additionally a guest without a green wristband is allowed to leave the restaurant with the remainder of their 1/2 bottle of wine but if anyone else does it you have two staff members almost rugby tackle you to the ground!    This review is in no way directed at the other guests - purely the staffs treatment of guests being completely inconsistent and inequitable. Just because it is a French speaking country there is no call to be rude or dismissive of guests from other countries.    Also just to add if you are going for a week or two prepare to go hungry for most of your holiday as the all inclusive food just becomes more and more inedible as the days go on. Even when trying to book the restaurant where you pay for better food the response was 'sorry its fully booked for important French guests'. Charming - are we not all important guests!?    We would return to Marrakesh but certainly not to this resort.,Date of stay: September 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2451HUmarkb
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ola wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Great stress-free holiday,I honestly don't think a resort could be much better than this one! We have received a warm welcome from the team and wonderful Yasmin who explained everything to us in fluent English and we have been taken to our spacious bright and air-conditioned room with balcony and stunning tropical view.    Room was very well maintained by amazing houskeeping team throughout the 7 night stay. On the occasion they run out of towels in the morning they didn't forget about the replacement later on. Very discreet quick and thorough.    We were located quite far away from the main lobby but it turned out to be a brilliant location. Only a few steps away from adult only pool and restaurant with another great team.    Biggest praise goes to the main bar crew. What those guys are doing is absolutely amazing. The volume of customers (not always polite) they have to serve during peak times is unbelievable but they carry on with smiles on their faces. Mohamed who I think is the bar manager made our stay an absolute delight. Everyone there spoke at least communicative English and we haven't for a second felt like we're a second class guests. I think the key here is to treat the staff kindly and they will give it back 200% - no matter what language you speak.    Same with entertainment - as soon as they've realised we don't speak French they were translating everything into English for us. My favourite part was an Arabic lesson with Karim who was juggling those 3 languages like a pro! I wonder how many languages all the complainers can speak?    The only tiny downside is reception who seem to be understaffed at most times but they are doing a wonderful job under a lot of pressure. Just take into account that you might have to queue for a few minutes (sometimes a few more as some of the guest don't understand a concept of a queue and just walk straight to the desk but whose fault is that?)    Overall I would recommend this place to everyone who want to relax and have a good time on their holiday. Staff will go above and beyond to make it happen. We will definitely be back for the unique vibe people and the best weather!,Date of stay: September 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/993olag
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,LeviaBuncle wrote a review Oct 2019,50,An Honest Review,Visiting this hotel with three other friends there is a lot to like. For those who like to weigh up their options I will do a PROS and CONS of this hotel as there are both:    PROS:    - The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained. The reception looks like something from a palace the pool area is immaculate and the gardens and scenery around the riad style rooms are pretty and tended to often.  - The bar staff on the whole are very friendly. Special mention to Najib on the pool bar. He made a special effort to welcome us on our first day and continued to remember us and our orders for the nine days we were there. There was a young glass collector also whose name was particularly difficult to remember who was also very friendly (he usually wears a white shirt and smart pants)  - The male entertainment staff were all very inclusive of guests. (Special mention to Fahd) They would go above and beyond to speak to guests. They would even occasionally join them for dinner and make them feel welcome.  - The food is above average to excellent at all times. There is always a nice range of options and even if something wasn‚Äôt to taste it was never due to poor quality but more just personal taste. They have different themes through the week ranging from Mexican to Moroccan to World Buffet.  - The rooms are basic but comfortable. Nothing out of this world but they are clean and you will feel cosy whilst there.  - The Quad biking offered by the hotel was incredible and a must do! We opted for the hour long session but we got more than our money‚Äôs with being brought along desert roads and out into the dunes to see Moroccan nature at its finest!  - Both Pools were spacious and fun! The larger pool occasionally features games such as water polo and there always feels like there is enough space for everybody.  - there is always food available even between lunch and dinner service in the main canteen due to the snack bar.  - There is a small pool full of cute terrapins just outside the hotel where we were allowed to bring small pieces of food to feed them.  - journey to the centre markets is a simple 25 minute journey and easily arranged at the reception.  - Henna is much cheaper at the small stall in the hotel than at the markets. It is a small table near the pool bar easily missed but it is there.  - don‚Äôt forget to tip the staff they really do look after you.    CONS    - We had an awful time when dealing with some reception staff. We were slapped with a tourist tax that we had not been informed of beforehand and the two members of staff that dealt with us Soufiane and Hanan were not helpful in the slightest. Soufiane did not even tell us the most basic of information at check in such as times for dinner and was more concerned with dealing with his colleagues issues than checking us in and Hanan stood there with nothing but a blank expression and a pen in her hand ignoring us. The rest of the reception staff were great but our multiple negative experiences with these two tarnished the credibility of that team.  - You should come to the pool early if you want a sun lounger as there is not an over abundance of themespecially if you are In a group.  - There are a large amount wasps near the bushes/bar at the pools. Obviously that‚Äôs beyond the hotels control but just heads up.  - All entertainment is completely in French there was not a single event hosted in the slightest of English. Whilst that is fine for some people and not always a problem for everyone it may be something to bear in mind if entertainment in English is important to you.  - It became a running joke between several guests seperate to us that you would only receive quick treatment from certain members of the night bar if you were wearing a red wrist band that signifies your nationality. Might not be true but it‚Äôs hard to ignore with what we witnessed.  - Some of the entertainment team namely the women were not the most welcoming unless you spoke French. Again not an issue if they cannot speak english but they could and would ignore us the moment we said we didn‚Äôt speak French. Made us feel a little uncomfortable.  - The hotel next door is connected to this one somehow and contains a small water park which is fun. However don‚Äôt expect the reception staff to give you directions on where to go. They seemed just as confused as y and what should have taken us 5 minutes to walk took us about 30 due to misdirections from staff.  - music at poolside would be fine but they turn it off after half a song and then don‚Äôt play it again for 30 minutes and then rinse and repeat. Just leave the off or on one or the other.    We enjoyed the stay overall and it was worth the price we paid. Not major complaints but more just things to be aware of.

The only fault I had with the staff was the bar man in the evening called siad which I thought was rude when I asked if I could have a tray he‚Äôd just slam drinks down and was more enthusiastic about serving the French..but the pool bar staff were fantastic and very friendly and helped me learn Arabic.  The couple of things which I did have with the hotel was    1)the entertainment it was MAINLY catered for the French so didn‚Äôt really know what was going on...so they should have had someone explaining in French then repeating in English however the animation Fahd and I cant remember the other one name with longish hair really tried to bring you in to and explain in English and brought you in on games and the aqua but it was like a guessing game what they saying if they didn‚Äôt say..    2). that you couldn‚Äôt book excursions with hotel if you wasn‚Äôt French..    however we booked with via tour so if you stay there I would recommend the Atlas Mountains and quad biking they pick you and drop you back    So Feed back I‚Äôd give is more English translation in the entertainment and animation so we know what‚Äôs going on aswell  Cause I would love to go back with my children so they could join and understand    But had the best 4 days xx,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chzoch87

The staff are amazing the grounds are beautiful and facilities excellent.  Yes it is very geared up for the french so you may have to dust off your O levels to communicate fully but even better learn a few Arabic phrases before you go. A simple 'Thank you' in the native tongue is really appreciated we found.  We had a couple of problems while we were there. A leaking air con and a dodgy door lock so we reported it at reception and the guy had fixed them before we made it back to the room! You can't ask for more that that surely?  Food was very tasty and quite varied. Certainly plentiful and the wifi signal was excellent in most parts of the hotel.  Security was incredible. The only thing that irked was the reception was always busy and you may have to queue. Maybe an extra person on there would hurry things along but you are on holiday. Who really cares?  Entertainment was possibly the best I've ever seen at a hotel. We had fun trying to understand the french but congratulating ourselves when we did. It was laugh.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Tarantella wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Dar Atlas is not as good as it is promoted to be,I visited Dar Atlas club this August (2019). Before visiting I read a mixture of reviews about the venue. Most were positive. Having spent time there below are my observations.    Staff ‚Äì Very friendly especially Yazmin in Guest relations Zakaria in Entertainment and Jamal in the restaurant.    Facilities ‚Äì Outdated deco. No wash basins in toilets. Rather casual and open grit in terms of wall tile to wall. Also Very old linen in rooms.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Sara wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Amazing family holiday, everything you need.",My two children and I just got back from The Dar Atlas hotel Marrakech for a 7 night stay. The hotel was amazing. On arrival we were made to feel very welcome by friendly staff and were provided welcome drinks and taken to our rooms.    We met Yassmine the guest relations manager on the second day and‚Ä¶ Honestly? She is an absolute hidden gem a true asset to the hotel. Yassmine was great always on hand to help and ensured everything was comfortable for our stay both of my children still talk about how lovely and kind Yassmine was (and is) and how she treated everyone with a warm smile and an open hand to help with anything we needed. Yassmine did this not only with us but with every guest she came into contact with (and she showed a genuine great interest into helping everyone).    All the staff are trained to a very high standard delivery exceptional customer service that includes from the catering staff the maids (Mariam in particular) the photographer (Osman I hope I spelt it correctly) security and not forgetting the gardeners for giving such beautiful views of the complex and make us feel the absolute pleasure to be surrounded nature.    The meals were absolutely fantastic with an array of choices. A special thank you to Zakariya and Zouhair and all the restaurant (catering staff) to the spa staff (Jamila and Amal) for always smiling and delivering exceptional customer service throughout our trip (my children and I are truly missing the meals).

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Mahelau92 wrote a review Jul 2019,40,"Has everything you need, just a few niggles",I can honestly say that this was a lovely hotel. The only thing is that if you don't speak french it is quite difficult as 90% of guests are french most of the tours are run in french and the entertainment is all in french.  The food was themed and reasonably varied. There were better days than others but there was always the western staples (pizza and chips!)  For the majority the staff were amazing and very welcoming they tried to talk to us as much as possible bearing in mind that my mum doesn't speak french. The entertainment crew were lively and upbeat the catering staff were always lovely and polite and of course Yasmine who was faultless! The only staff that let them down were the cleaners who didn't actually clean our room any day we were there they just put the top sheet back over without straightening anything; there was also the receptionist on our last day. He was very late and we waited 15 minutes for him to arrive so we could check out not even a sorry from him. There was also 2 barmen which ruined it a little bit with their attitudes but they can be overlooked.  You are also 10km from the city and souks so there is nowhere to go outside of the hotel which can be a bit isolating but means that it is a bit quieter,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahelau92
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Tillee91 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Amazing holiday!,On arrival to the hotel we was welcomed to super friendly staff provided us with lovely welcome drinks had to wait about 30 mins for our room to be ready which wasn‚Äôt a problem as we just got changed in the toilets and sat down and took in the beautiful surroundings of the hotel. Yasmine was the first member of staff we spoke to properly she greeted us and gave us all the info we needed and then showed us to our room. The rooms are modern and very very clean great shower too. There is a safe which costs 70 dirham for the week which is approx ¬£7. The weather was absolutely beautiful all week. Pool is massive and there are plenty of sun beds. There‚Äôs music on all day at the main pool or you can walk down to the quiet pool if you want some peace and quiet. The food was outstanding! Every single day there was plenty of food options with beautiful meats such as lamb beef chicken and turkey. All cooked to perfection. Plenty of selection on other foods too so there‚Äôs always something for everyone! Different theme every night also. All inclusive drinks are good they aren‚Äôt small measures either! The only lager they have is Flag speciale which is alright. Most of the staff are french but they do try their very best to speak English etc... and do try to make you feel involved in the activities and entertainment. Yasmine and Zakaria are an absolute asset to the hotel! They go above and beyond to help you and make you feel comfortable. All problems are solved quickly.  There is a shuttle bus often every day to get to the souks and the medina which is about ¬£2 each way and it takes about 30 mins to get there.  We also had a full body massage at the spa during our stay which was lovely felt so refreshed and relaxed after it so that‚Äôs well worth a go!  Overall we were super happy with our holiday here at Club Dar Atlas the hotel is BEAUTIFUL the staff are AMAZING! Food is beautiful just everything about the hotel is perfect!

This hotel is super clean with nice food I'm vegan and had plenty of choice with many veg based dishes most desserts were out of bounds for me but my partner said they were to die for. The staff are super friendly we were met by Yassmin on are arrival who looked after us through out are stay nothing was to much trouble from sorting extra coat hangers to excursions Abbelilah on our evening meals really attended to all our needs he was super friendly and made us laugh. We owe a big thank you to Zakaria who brought all the English people together also was super friendly and would put him self out to help any one if it wasn't for Zakaria I don't think our holiday wouldn't of been such a laugh would I stay here again definitely at the price we paid loved the holiday the hotel the staff and met some really nice people also check out the Zen restaurant in the other hotel lovely food for a change from the all inclusive food,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hydeeeee

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Alex C wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Don't be put off by poo reviews from English People. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!,"So like anyone we read reviews of hotels before going for them - I lost count of how many we read but we found Club Dar Atlas had a lot of good reviews but also some poor ones with poor experiences.    I am pleased to say that you need to ignore all of the poor reviews the people who talk about the fact ""no on speaks English"" and the ones who moan about the restaurant. They're all wrong!(in my opinion)    When we arrived we were greeted by Yasmine who was very welcoming spoke great English and was just in general a pleasure to deal with this continued throughout the week - we always knew that Yasmine would be happy to help if we had anything we needed! Yasmine is part of the guest relation team.    The brings me nicely onto Zakaria from Guest Relations - WHAT A GUY this man is a legend in the game and is a must meet if you go to Marrakesh. SO SO welcoming to us all and I saw him more as a friend as opposed to a member of staff even half way through the holiday!(Although he always handled himself professionally) He wanted to make us feel welcome and he really did I look forward to continuing talking with him and seeing him next time I am in Morocco!    The entertainment team are fantastic so much enthusiasm from all of them at ANY point of the day or night! The majority of the team could speak English and those that did not or didn't speak much wanted to learn which we found so nice - we were more than happy to help them learn!    Big shout out to Zak Karim Fahd Leila & Cloe from the entertainment team - these guys as I've just mentioned are awesome people always up for a laugh and a joke and just friendly people in general.    The main man has to be Abdel from the entertainment team we met him on the first day of the holiday and never looked back from there Abdel has an amazing way of engaging people and is definitely one to keep hold of! We cannot wait to come back next year and see the whole of the entertainment team again they really did make the holiday!    We will all look to keep in contact with them all on social media's because as I have mentioned we did not see them as ""the entertainment team"" they were more than that.    So if you want a lovely quiet hotel for your stay with great food plenty of drinks(shout out all the bar staff) a good pool and plenty of stuff going on then Club Dar Atlas is the one for you!",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexcN940DO
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Chelsie White wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Amazing holiday,DO NOT BE DISHEARTENED BY THE NEGATIVE ENGLISH REVIEWS.    I have just returned from a 9 night stay at the Club Dar Atlas with my partner and another couple. We had a truly amazing experience in this hotel and everyone deserves to hear this!    On arrival we were greeted by Yasmine who explained how the meals worked at the hotel took us to our rooms and helped us sort out a safe and unlock the door dividing our two rooms. The rooms are dated yes but they are kept clean daily by the maids and we had our bedsheets changed regularly. The maids would also change our towels everyday for us. People will always find something to moan about but the rooms were clean and the balcony was lovely too as we were on the top floor so we really had no complaints! The bathroom is separate to the toilet but it isn‚Äôt an issue if anything it‚Äôs more useful. The rooms are dimly lit but in a place like Marrakech you don‚Äôt want to be in the rooms all the time! The TV worked fine however there is limited English channels if you are wanting to watch Television in the evenings or at night etc. Overall the rooms were everything we needed.    When we were at dinner / down by the poolside we were greeted by Abdel. He is one of the animation team who is so lovely and went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Everyday he would come and speak to us testing out his English as well as helping us with some of the French signs etc. He would always come over and give us a high five or a handshake and ask how we were and so on which really made us feel welcome. The hotel is predominantly French but many of the staff will go out of their way to try and have a conversation with you and make you feel included in the holiday atmosphere.    We then met Zakaria from guest relations he is also superb. He would sit with us most nights and get involved in our conversations we were able to learn some Arabic from him as well as get some guidance for going to the Market and going out on the Quads and Buggies in the desert! (Two phenomenal experiences that I would recommend). He was incredibly welcoming and really made our stay amazing and we cannot thank him enough for his continuous work in making us all happy.    We also had many conversations with other members of the animation team: Zakaria E Fahd Leila and Marine. Zak and Fahd were lovely welcoming and would come and join us for conversation and chilling by the poolside as well as at the bar in the evenings which made us feel so welcome and involved. A lot of the time they would get us up dancing with them and also go to the on site nightclub with us! They made it known there was always something to do with the animation team and entertainment.    The entertainment in the evenings was always enjoyable despite being in French it was easy to understand what was happening. When we were unsure we would ask either Zakaria A or Abdel and they were happy to explain to us what was happening in the evenings.    The food was impeccable. There was always something to pick and a wide variety of vegetarian option as well as meat based options! The food on Moroccan night was so inspiring to the point we decided to make our own version of the couscous offered that night! The drinks were as an all inclusive is being local spirits and from 10am -11pm. People in these reviews tend to expect much more than what they are paying for. The bar staff are fast with their service and we soon learnt with giving them respect and not being rude like others were at the hotel they would pay the same respect back and enjoy getting our drinks/ having conversations.    The team are keen to make your stay as incredible as it can be; with various activities throughout the day as well as in the evenings. They were very included in our daily activities as well as in the evenings. Abdel Zak A and E Fahd and Yasmine were always attentive to our needs and were beyond welcoming and made us really feel like we could go back again.    Getting sun-beds in the morning was easy and we had no issues finding any or umbrellas for when the heat was becoming more unbearable. There was no fight for any apparatus and the lifeguards would come and help you find any items you might need when there. We used inflatables in the pool which made our time a bit more fun.    The WiFi is surprisingly good for the hotel being out the way of the city and it being free but at 100DH a taxi to the market we didn‚Äôt see this as a problem. We also paid for a safe in the room that worked every day perfectly.    The only downside I have about the hotel is one day we misplaced my bracelet and it never returned in the room. We spoke to the reception and they did what they could to find it but to no effect. It was a shame as this was a very sentimental piece of jewellery for me. Whether the maids had consciously or unconsciously taken it I am in no way blaming them as we don‚Äôt know what happened either.    I would really like to say thank you to Zak A Abdel Zak E Fahd and Yasmine for their continued interest in our stay and the welcome they gave us! This is definitely a place we would return to (especially to see Abdel and the team).    Overall a really great and enjoyable stay.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27chelsie
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,pegahdogaheh wrote a review Jul 2019,20,USEFUL REVIEW,I just want to firstly say that the staff were incredible especially Yasmine Yassine and the security guards. They were very helpful and made sure we felt welcomed and above all safe. I have no issues whatsoever with the staff.    My issue is with the actual hotel and the way it was run.  - Firstly it is not a hotel; its a riad. Meaning the rooms are much more older the toilet and showers were separate with no windows or air vents. There was ONE light in the entire room so you can imagine how dim it was and it was generally just quite old.  - Although the room was cleaned every day we noticed the bedsheets weren't changed daily. I had been sick and they didn't change the sheets until I had asked. When I did ask on the third time they sent someone up. They didn't have spare sheets so they took the entire duvet and instead gave us an old blanket. They didn't come to change or replace this and give back a proper duvet.  - We had paid for a safe to be used during our stay and again no one had come up to fix this.  - The entire entertainment was in French. Nothing was done in English or Arabic but only in French. Their excursions are also with French guides. It became very annoying as we couldn't get involved in the shows or entertainment. Don't expect anything to be done in English.  - We paid for all inclusive however there are a lot of hidden costs. You have to pay for the shuttle bus after 11pm you have to pay for everything there's probably only a handful of free alcoholic drinks to use the safe there's a charge.  - The alcohol is very cheap after 2 glasses of wine I was absolutely destroyed and experienced an awful time.  - Poor Wifi  - The food was quite poor and sometimes undercooked. They did have a large bottle of still water on each table which was good. You also had to pay for the A la Carte restaurant (‚Ç¨25 per person) which looked awful anyway.    I had stayed at Iberostar just down the road from Dar Atlas last year and although a little more expensive it makes up for all of the above. The entertainment was by far better more things to do (darts trapezing games dancing shows) and there was a free shuttle bus to the city centre! It just felt cleaner and more warm. It truly felt like all inclusive and a genuine hotel.    Hope this helps anyone looking to book because if I had known all of this I most probably wouldn't have gone here.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pegahdogaheh
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,HelenJ007 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Excellent staff,Booked last minute. Bit stressful as holiday company had not paid the hotel but sorted it out the next day. Then time to relax. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt speak French. Staff are so kind and look after the guests. Noisy pool and quiet pool so something for everyone. Food lovely. We just wanted a quick blast of sunshine and relaxation so this was ideal. Marrakesh def worth a few hours out of the hotel. One of those hotels you don‚Äôt have to think about anything - everything is easy and you can just enjoy yourself. I think you have to pay for baileys and drinks like that and all inclusive stops at 11pm. Pool towels included and worth getting a safe in your room. We changed English money into dirhams at the hotel which was fine or you can just use Euro‚Äôs. Enjoy. Lots of activities.Spotlessly clean. Great staff. Didn‚Äôt put the tv on but don‚Äôt think they have English channels which is perfect to have a proper break from home. Mozzie repellant a good idea.

The pools are good size and plenty of sun beds. The entertainment is good but all in French (we are British). The nightclub was good and the all inclusive drinks options are good. The only issue was food was too salty and no really tasteful. Apart from pizzas at the snack bar!    We met Zakaria who was Guest Relations for the English speakers and our holiday was made 10 times better by Zakaria. He helped us around the hotel told us the good things to do in Marrakech and also warned us what to avoid. He couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful we feel like he became part of our group while away!

The only let down was on the alcohol all inclusive was only on local brands which was not good and after 9/10pm you had to pay for everything. The hotel is very clean and has good facilities. As a couple it would have been better to have a double bed instead of 2 singles. There was no iron which was annoying.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Carol11287 wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Great time,Stayed here for a week and had a lovely holiday with my parents. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful loads of amazing flowers to look at with wildlife walking around including Guinea Fowl ducks a hereon and a tortoise (a duck even took to swimming in the pool). The whole of the grounds were covered in orange trees.    The rooms were a very good size lovely walk in shower room plenty of space.    I am wheat intolerant and was worried about the food but in the restaurant as you walk in is an allergens board displaying the contents of the meals (which meant no puddings for me as they were all cake and biscuit based :( but plenty of fresh fruit). The meals were well cooked but cold at times. Each night was a different theme - which also meant different entertainment each night.    The bar was nice and cooling with plenty of space however the all inclusive was confusing to start with as nothing was explained. But there are certain drinks that you had to pay for and everyone had to pay for all drinks between 11 and midnight. The only problem with the bar is the barmen favoured the French who would get served first regardless of if you were their first. But one complaint to the correct person and all was sorted.    The right people to talk to are Zac and Yassmine. Their English was good and they were very helpful and friendly. Zac spent most evening talking to me and my parents he had some drinks with us and played games with us too. He displayed a very great interest in learning all he could.    We found a treasure just outside the hotel. Turn left and walk around 20 meters and there is a small pond. In which lived dozens of terrapins. Who we feed each morning - hand fed - with fruit from breakfast. We also took the time to remove all the rubbish from the pond.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carol11287

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Danielle K wrote a review Jun 2019,20,Very disappointed,The hotel was clean and well looked after however the waiting and bar staff were so miserable and unfriendly it felt like asking for a drink for the group of 7 travelling was far too much and then to top it all off we each had money stolen from our rooms not a huge amount individually but enough to make us feel on edge and violated. The security and reception staff didn't seem to be bothered when we reported we had money stolen and didn't take us seriously until we threatened to involve the police. Yasmin and zachariah were very helpful and the only English speaking staff there to my knowledge and Salah behind the bar was the only member of staff to have a smile and excellent service throughout our stay.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Dev77 wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Girls holiday,This is my 3rd time in Marrakech this was a girls holiday and there was 7 of us. The hotel is clean and tidy. The food has a good selection and always something to eat. We found Yasmin and Zackariya had a very good understanding of English and could speak English very good.This helped as we found not many other people could and also the hotel was mainly French people on their holidays here. This didn‚Äôt really matter as we learnt to communicate and if we really couldn‚Äôt we found someone who could. The bar staff seemed grumpy and everything seemed too much trouble for them at times!. We found Salah was the only one who smiled all day and was happy to help at all times and he made sure we had what we needed. On our second day in the evening we all discovered we had had money stolen from us all and when we confronted the hotel reception about this matter we were dealt with in the most disgusting manner. We were fobbed off to come back in the morning by the security man who told us they would look at the cctv. There was no apology that this had happened in this hotel. When we came back to reception again in the morning to be told they haven‚Äôt looked at it yet and the security man will find us by 12pm. He came and found us to tell us the cctv only showed us going to our room and the cleaner ! We were then told if we wanted to inform the police it would be days before they would investigate and we were flying home the next morning. When asked what would happen to the cleaner he told us she will be sacked. The hotels manager never came and speak to us and no money compensated. The next morning when we were checking out the cleaner was still working at the hotel as she walked passed us and we were all shocked as she had taken our money and nothing had happened! So be aware carry your cash with you at all times.  On a positive note the pool is lovely and clean.

The people are amazing and so kind and care with us mainly the people that worked more with us in the reception Yasmine and Hayat and in the animation equipe Ahmed. They have so many animation for the kids and for everyone mainly dance and animation equipe was perfect and a excelent equipe.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Murray wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Great peaceful location,My wife and I recently stayed at Club Dar Atlas and was nicely surprised how lovely the hotel was and great value. The staff were friendly and welcoming and great service. There are several pools and a pool bar which served a good selection of drinks for all inclusive. As for the food breakfast was ok but lunch and dinners were perfect; a really nice selection for all.    Also the spa treatments were good albeit closer to UK prices but worth it.    Finally the hotel offers an hourly shuttle bus to the Medina for those game. Be prepared for a lot of aggressive sales and definitely steer clear of the snake charmers as they will want 20 Euros for them to put a snake around your neck they dont ask they just do it. That said if your game its pretty cool.    All in all I would come back to the same hotel for some April sunshine and great hotel.

Lovely large room nice Hotel the grounds are really lovely. Staff on the whole are very friendly the grounds Hotel and Rooms are kept very clean and well looked after. Fabulous weather around 30 degrees each day. We loved the quiet pool which was very clean not a leaf in sight. Food was very varied and good something for everyone you would have to be very fussy not to enjoy the restaurant. The all inclusive drinks were a bit restricted which is not something we have experienced before. The rose wine was like nail polish remover I think they should change it I switched to red which was ok.

Clean and basic with a warm shower and two single beds TV and fridge.    The hotel is very pleasant with a nice pool fantastic staff and decent food.    Each evening they put on a different menu (Spanish Italian etc) and whilst there is always the ""stock"" offerings these changes made the food feel different each evening .    The animation is decent although I should stress this is a predominantly french hotel. Most of the staff speak a decent level of English but the games and entertainment is in French. Worth considering if you plan on taking young kids and expect them to be entertained all day.    There is the odd bird in the dining hall small sparrow types who fly in via the open window this happens because the big doors are wide open during meal times.    There is very poor WiFi  outside of the main reception area it is limited however some might see this as a bonus if they want to disconnect from the world for a few days.    The hotel puts on a shuttle bus to the madina however these fill quickly. It's worth noting the hotel is about 20/25 min drive from the city.

Number one is the WIFI which was extremely slow during our stay and nonexistent in the rooms... and practically anywhere but the lobby and the cafe by the adult pool.

We debated whether to stay in a Riad in the city but were so happy with our choice to stay here. It was great value for money and the hotel is perfectly connected to the old town area with a shuttle or easy by taxi either for when you want to see the city. The hotel grounds are beautiful.    The staff were AMAZING! I can't praise them enough... The entertainment crew were brilliant especially 'Miggy'. Yassmin the customer service rep was absolutely lovely and so friendly too. Our room was perfect- a good size very clean and comfortable. The food wasn't gourmet fancy or anything but it was decent especially the new years buffet which exceeded our expectations. The variety with the food is somewhat limited but there was always something whether it was chicken fish pasta pizza etc.    We used this taxi driver for some tours. He was very honest and really nice his name was 'Boudali' and his number is 00212 (0) 668359384. He does tours for cheaper than the hotel ones or if even you just wanted him for an airport taxi he was lovely.    Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel...

When we arrived we were put in a very small room which was nowhere near big enough for 3 adults. They changed us to a much better room which was very nice.  The hotel and it's grounds are very nicely looked after and well maintained and the gardens are lovely.  Not so lovely was the food which was a mixed bag to say the least! The staff in the restaurant were generally very good and attentive but the food was normally only luke warm even as soon as they put it out. Worst bit about the restaurant was the large amount of small birds flying up to the food areas and eating it!  The staff were also a mixed bag there was a language barrier as the hotel seems geared towards French guests and some of the staff were lovely like in the restaurant bars and one very friendly lady in reception. The rest of the reception staff were not so friendly and helpful. We had a couple of issues that did not get dealt with very well.

The second room was nice but only had 2 outlets to use to charge phones ECT.    One thing that we noticed about staff was that if you didn't speak French or Arabic then your out of luck as 85% of the staff do not speak English so they wouldn't even speak to you.    The hotel was nice but didn't really have anything to do there unless you pay for a shuttle or taxi to go to the city. All of the safety information is written in French aswel as all the information in the hotel so again unless you can read it you will have no luck to know what to do or where to go.    The food was a bad point on the trip if you like your food then I wouldn't recommend eating here as there was not a lot of choose even for all inclusive and some drinks you even have to pay for for example Orange juice. The food was never hot but Luke warm so by the time you reached your table it was cold. All pastrys where dry and hard. But to make matters worse there are birds in the dining/buffet room that like to help them selves from the buffet so you would be lucky not to get something with beak holes.    So all in all we would not recommended staying here unless all your going to do is sleep and/or you speak french.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniaB690HX

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ian_Stowe wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Good for younger families in warm weather. Too far from town. Inefficient reception staff.,Stayed here as part of a two week tour of Morocco. It would be a good location for younger families in warmer weather. The place is well laid out with riad style buildings of two floors very nice gardens fairly spacious rooms two pools bar 3 restaurants tennis boules etc. We did not take the full board option as we wanted to visit the city frequently but we did eat in the buffet twice and the Ourika restaurant where we took the special sea food menu. The buffet had a large selection and different themes each night. However aside from local cuisine the food whilst reasonably good it bore little resemblance to the theme chosen on occasion - e.g. ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù looked and tasted like Moroccan. The Ourika meal was outstanding and both the waiter and chef efficient and courteous. These were the only two in the resort who really displayed professionalism: the front desk staff in particular were mostly young and very inefficient taking an age to do simple tasks. and making mistakes. We were also informed after the meal by the chef in the Ourika restaurant that the 25 euros we paid for our meal that included grilled prawns lobster and excellent desert was in fact just a supplement price for those on full board but there was NO option to order and pay for those not on full board. Hence our planned return for the deluxe meat menu was refused. When we arrived our room had clearly been used by a heavy smoker who refused to acknowledge the non-smoking rule and reeked of cigarettes. Having changed rooms twice we were happy - until the chill set in the next day and we found the A/C-heater did not work. It took five complaints over three days for something to happen and get heat.    Our tour was too rushed in the first week and we did not need 8 days in this place. With an age group in excess of an average of 60 in November with mixed weather and a location 15+ kms from the city it not the place to stay and would not be for a younger crowd without good and warmish weather.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Carqueiranne, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ian_Stowe

The other reps were nice enough but never came and said hello to myself and my partner all favoured French speakers.

Food was good a vast variety and something different every night....the bar wasn't all that the beer was served in small glasses so had to get 2 at a time and you only get 3/4 of a glass. Before booking we weren't aware that it was a French speaking hotel with very little English used thus was fine for me as I can get by with basic French but my husband can't speak or understand any so would of maybe chose a different hotel. The animation team work hard and never stop..they speak little English but not much but still try to have a conversation with you. Had a lovely week away but won't be returning in the future.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D254YLelaineh
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Sl8rate wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Mostly good,Apart from confusion over the name (in some brochures it's Club Madina) The Dar Atlas turned out to be a very nice place to stay especially if you speak French. We just about managed to make ourselves understood with the aid of Google Translate.  Of course the rooms needed updating however ours was clean and comfortable and everything worked. We thought the food was very good and the extra bonus of freshly made crepes and beignets in the afternoon by the pool bar was an unexpected treat.  We enjoyed the pool area and the extensive grounds. The staff tried to be helpful despite language difficulties and the Animation Crew were enthusiastic and hard working.  With only a 3 hour flight from London and great weather all in all we enjoyed our stay.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sl8rate
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Karen K wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Mixed opinions,Just returned from a week's holiday. Stayed in a standard room which was clean and comfortable however the bathroom could do with some updating. The public areas and gardens are very well maintained.  I looked for a hotel that specifically had a indoor pool if the weather was bad so was very disappointed that this was not included in the all inclusive package. The cost was higher than my local pool. There is plenty of food choices in the restaurant but it is very unorganised missing crockery utensils and cues.. Most of the the staff were very friendly and helpful however there was one bar person who was very rude and arrogant. He was of the view that it was his bar so unless you spoke in French you wouldn't get served.I could name him but I think the management know who he is. The entertainment staff tried their best but it is mainly done in French.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Redworth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenkY5106XU

Great food and spoiled for variety of choices. Lovely dry heat with no humidity or mosquitos. Great facilities and entertainment.

I took advantage of the hotels spa Hamman i came out feeling rejuvenated.    The hotel offered a complimentary shuttle service to Marrakech which was really easy to get on and off from the main town the souks are just beautiful.    I found that the hotel staff were mainly French speaking but you do find this all over Morocco- however this did not spoil my holidays in fact i felt it refreshing and authentic.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,spyder_steve wrote a review May 2018,40,More positive than negative,Firstly Morocco is 75% speaking French it‚Äôs one of those things!    Recommendations  - Get a taxi thru your operator for return trip to the airport; the huge queues thru customs is a joke. (Approx 2 hours). Taxi is direct from airport to hotel and takes approx 20mins.  - taking a couple of pens to fill out entry forms when landed recommend filling forms out before landing or you‚Äôll regret queuing at the airport customs!  - have printed documents ready as hotel and security (at the hotel barrier) will struggle to find your booking (don‚Äôt rely on holiday apps)  - If you‚Äôve booked excursions thats not linked to the hotel or complex then you‚Äôll need to wait outside of the barrier it‚Äôs approx 2 mins walk and is perfectly safe let security know at the barrier.  - Pillows are small ask for a top up  - Entertainment is in French but to be fair it‚Äôs easy to understand what‚Äôs going on just chill and enjoy or dive into restaurant at 7:30pm while the French are being entertained!!  - Plugs are type F (Get type E&F plugs and you‚Äôll be fine)  - WiFi is available but only in restaurant and swimming pool area.  - There‚Äôs another pool thats peaceful but it‚Äôs away from all the activities. A la cart√© has to be booked in advance at the restaurant itself (other side of hotel) but the menus are confusing as it lists things you may need to pay for - confusing!  - Has a relaxing Sisha bar (traditional Arabic hooka) that is completely free to use.  - We had trouble getting into room with keycard solution: put it in and out very quickly and the door unlocks.    Negatives  - The shower room floor is slightly HIGHER than main bathroom so prepare for plenty of floods from the shower! That goes into main room; Solution: put a towel near the step of shower and it soaks most of it up.. god knows why there isn‚Äôt a shower curtain!  - Huge confusion what they charge extra for at the bars freshly squeezed orange juice and ‚Äònamed‚Äô alcohol is chargeable look at the menus and it‚Äôs really easy to get confused what is inclusive and what isn‚Äôt don‚Äôt pay for any additions if your all-inclusive! Drinks Menu are in French (easy to work out what they are) they will try and sell you drinks that are chargeable.  - drinking Cups are small so expect to run back and forth quite a bit to the bar.  - This IS IMPORTANT: pre-paid MasterCard‚Äôs do NOT work at the at hotel‚Äôs cash machine this can cause problems as there is NO where else to take cash out Debit cards work fine.  - tui reps don‚Äôt have credit/debit card machines so excursions are very difficult to book unless you do it online (very expensive though.)  - TUI Rep‚Äôs are a waste of time she left us in real trouble coming back as we didn‚Äôt know what time we were being picked up she ignore calls and messages and didn‚Äôt put notices up regarding collection from hotel when we finally left she still hadn‚Äôt put notices up; TUI emergency helpline also declined to help. Pick up times are 3 hours before flying.  - Hotel does not keep reps numbers: this is a sad thing if you get into trouble or need help.    Positives  - Water and fruit is in your room ready upon arrival.  - hand/shower gel is in the bathroom and shower (same make as they use in premiere inn‚Äôs (aloe Vera)  - Hairdryer is included in bathroom  - English is limited but staff and entertainers do their very best to help the English; speak slowly and keep it simple and they will understand you.  - The meals are of a very very high standard - expect the continental sausages which look and taste like plastic! Not keen on the Spanish menu - chopped turkey with bones in fish lasagna mushed oliver inside rolls of bread...really?!  - Drinking Water comes in 1.5L bottles and is completely free.  - Resort is clean hygiene is fantastic. Meals are well above outstanding staff are brilliant pools are crystal clear but be warned: swimming pool water is cold!,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spyder_steve

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Lisajo1 wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Loved it,The hotel was beautiful and super clean the staff were friendly and couldn't do enough for us and the food was awesome! For the first time ever I can honestly say I enjoyed all the food from an all inclusive hotel My husband is super fussy and usually only eats pasta from an all inclusive this time was different and he enjoyed every single meal he had the food was cooked fresh in front of you and it was a different theme every night. Moroccan night was my favourite! The wine was lovely again something I don't usually drink at an all inclusive hotel (we put this down to the hotel being predominantly French) Bonus!!  We didn't arrive until later so the fresh fruit and water in our room on arrival was a welcome site - the oranges are awesome :)  We spent most of the time at the adult pool This was lovely the pool was clean and the walk albeit long was through the most beautiful of gardens. Only non alcoholic drinks are included at the adult pool (this did us a favour actually) We used the hotel bus to go into Marrakech had no problems There isn't much in English and my husband and I speak very limited French it would have been nice for some of the menus and information to be translated but we did not find this a problem we just had to use our common sense for most things and as we both have quite chatty jobs we thoroughly enjoyed the peace and quiet. We both had the hammam massage too from the hotel spa - highly recommended. The entertainment looked great and the animation team put a lot of effort in. We didn't understand much of what was going on but the French seemed to be having a great time to be fair we did do our research first and knew that all entertainment would be in French. A big thank you to all the staff at the Hotel for making us feel so welcome - We would certainly come back to this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisajo1
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Amy wrote a review Jun 2017,20,Not welcoming for British,"Hotel is fine food is great (in a typical Spanish style all inclusive cattle market kind of way) hotel clean enough staff working very hard and pool area nice but very busy and not enough umbrellas.  Although I would hate to be surrounded by vulgar ""brits abroad"" types it would be helpful if some of the signage and menus had an English translation rather than only French. All the staff and other guests spoke only French animation team did not speak to us after discovering we were English we could not take part in any form of entertainment as it was in only French. We made an effort to speak as much as we could though our French is limited so did not get much past the ""how are you's"".    The hotel was advertised as ""FREE WIFI"" though this only applied to the reception area and even then it was slow and patchy.    We did not use the shuttle bus spa or a la carte restaurant as we were not explained how to book only given a printed sheet allas all in French! We tried to ask a few things at reception but communication was extremely difficult. We spent over half the week out on tours using expensive taxis or pre-booked trips... the hotel being quite far from Marrakech so not exactly walking distance!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Sheils48 wrote a review May 2017,40,Hard working staff,The grounds of this hotel were beautiful with an avenue of rose bushes as you walked to your room. They were all immaculately maintained by the garden staff. The quiet pool was more to our liking and any children were quickly sent packing if they decided to use it!!!!! The rooms were plenty big enough with a shower / wash area and a separate toilet.. The restaurant was quite large and this made it a bit noisey at the busiest times. There was plenty of variety of food and it was always very well displayed but it wasn't always hot enough for our liking. There was usually a chef cooking fresh fish meat or burgers and at breakfast they cooked omelettes or fried eggs.,Date of stay: April 2017,,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheils48
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Billmarge wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Disappointed,I stayed a week as part of the tour I took with RSD Travel. The weeks stay was supposedly the 'free week in Marrakesh' which followed the weeks tour. This did not prove to be free neither was it in Marrakesh but 15 kilometres away.  It was not a hotel I would ever have chosen. The majority of guests were French families who did appear to be enjoying themselves but it was not for me. All animation was in French. Although the buffet food was acceptable and nicely presented we dined in what was a canteen. Unless you arrived early you did not have the paper place mat knife and fork and glass and had to go in search.  As a positive the gardens are magnificent. We arrived when all the roses were in perfect condition and the pathways were enchanting. The hotel is organised in riad formation I was in a ground floor room which was basic but neat tidy and kept clean but it was 320 paces away from reception bar and dining room and was a bit too far is you had left your book!  There is a shuttle bus which runs regularly into Marrakesh this has to be pre-booked in advance both ways and cost 20 dirham each way. Two pools are inviting although one is a family pool the other is for adults only.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bury, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billmarge
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Brian99993 wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Needs more maintenance,The hotel is used by a number of mass tourist operators with the result that the guests have different views on what is good. We came across a number of people who had to move to another room because of a number of issues with the air conditioning hygiene or faulty doors. We almost moved because the air conditioning stopped working with a block of ice missing my wife by a whisker. We were offered a new room but when we went to look at it the key did not work. It was so late at night that we decided to stay put and the next day the air con was fixed. The food seemed OK at the beginning of our week there but then got worse. There is an ice cream station but not all the time. The food is varied and the staff are friendly and try their best. The trouble is that the maintenance at the rest of the hotel is not up to standard. The rooms are comfortable with good television reception (including CNN). There is only washing gel and shampoo that is dispenses from a machine both at the wash basin and in the shower. The toilet is separate from the bathroom which is a useful feature. There are three pools one is an inside pool of around 12.5 metres.  The staff try their best at entertaining the guests and frankly at the price it is not too bad There is a shuttle bus service to Marrakech and a number of outside activities such as spending a night at the Berber camp in the Sahara. The all inclusive is slightly bizarre as it does include espresso coffee or fresh squeezed oranges. The oranges in Morocco are absolutely deliciously so peel them and continue savouring a wonderful fruit.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian99993

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ali0404 wrote a review Nov 2016,30,OK! But some issues,Visited in November 2016 with two sisters.  Room was ok a bit tired. Ground floor with a terrace overlooking pool bar/cafe.  Check in was a little difficult due to translation but hey being English we could try harder to learn some phrases...so I'll take responsibility for that!  Hotel mainly caters to the French (from France!) That comment was not a criticism)  Food was ok plenty of it but everything seemed to be lukewarm. We could not figure out how the service worked in the restaurant/buffet...we were told we couldn't have water then we could we never got any alcohol with our meal despite asking! It was very bizarre!  There didn't seem to be any consideration by other guests for queuing...(sorry not sorry I'm British we queue!!)  Couldn't get coffee after certain times which seemed a little odd to me!  Entertainment team were very friendly and always said hello and some even remembered we weren't French which I found quite nice...attention to detail.  There were some members of staff who went out of their way to help...some didn't!  We generally felt a little ostracised but that could be due to language barriers...see above comment!  Shuttle bus available for 20 dirhams (each way) you have to pre book both legs of the journey but it does make visiting Marrakesh a little easier.  Absolutely loved the madness of Marrakesh crossing a road is an achievement and we laughed so much (possibly in disbelief and relief at having made it).  Would recommend Marrakesh and the Moroccan's in general are charming but the hotel was a mixed bag some good some bad.

The morning came and we was greeted by one of the animation team touteef (apologises for spelling) and what a warm welcome he said not many English stayed at this hotel. Later in afternoon we was greeted by Assan of the animation team who English was outstanding and got the word around that we was English ( by now we understood there were not many of us). Fatimia another member of animation team came to say hello and asked if she could practice her English. In addition the animation team are all amazing and have their specialists no one need to feel isolated within the walls of the hotel. With games and workshops in the day to shows at night which are all professionally delivered. We once had dinner with the director who spoke about the hotel and morroco with such love and passion it was endearing. Our rep was amazing also only a phone call away if needed. The rooms clean and the food is amazing if you can't find something you like you are either very picky or enjoy to complain.  There is also a club in the hotel which wasn't very busy but went there a few times with French friends i had made. All in all after visiting many places in north Africa i can say Morocco as a country is need of a visit and although hotel seems to be im middle of nowhere it is a must. I have already booked to come back multiple times. Both on my own and with family again. This hotel is the french Thompson version so there will be majority French. Just let staff know you are English and you will be included.  Your holiday is what you make it.

At first a little bit concerned as it is well out of the city and nowhere within walking distance. Needn't had worried excellent shuttle bus to city centre.  Had read mixed reviews on here about the food. All I can say is if you can't find something you like then you must be a really picky eater.  When we arrived we soon found that we were 3 of the only 5 British in the hotel all the other guests were French. No problem the brilliant animation team soon made us feel welcome and special thanks to assan who translated the demonstrations for us. The entertainment was none stop and of a very high standard. The hotel director Sabir also went out of his way to ensure all staff practice their English.  There where more coming in as we left.  Will definitely return.

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ellie-Mae S wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Couldn't have been better!,After visiting this resort for a total of 5 nights we can honestly say this resort couldn't have been any better...  When we first arrived we was greeted by the manager of the resort and was told our bags would be delivered up to our room when it was ready (we arrived before the check-in time we was given however the room was ready within a speedy time of an hour). In the meantime we took advantage of the bar that was very close to reception and enjoyed the beverages whilst sat in the sun! We was then greeted by one of the animation team Hassan who impressed us with his English language skills! He in particular and the rest of the animation team made us feel very welcome and at home since we were one of the very few English families staying at the resort!  The food was honestly to die for! Each day the kitchen staff worked extremely hard to deliver a variety of dishes suitable for different palettes. There was a Buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner and on a nighttime the food sometimes had a theme linked to the entertainment (e.g. Morrocan Fiesta etc.)  As I have previously mentioned the animation team were outstanding not only on the evening but during the day too! They worked hard to encourage guests to take part in the daily tournaments including: volleyball tennis football and boules. The disco on an evening was wonderful with a mix of different music types some English and some French. The animation team also worked hard with the children of all ages having a mini-club and a teen club which kept everyone entertained!  Our room was very spacious and came with a balcony to look out on the wonderful view that surrounded us. The beds were comfortable and was decorated in traditional Morrocan throws and cushions. In addition to this it was only a short walk to the family pool and quiet pool and therefore could get to the sunbeds quicker!  Overall this resort made our trip to Marrakesh so enjoyable and I would recommend this resort to any family wanting to stay at an all-inclusive and have an amazing time. The only thing I do regret is not saying goodbye to Hassan and the animation team however hopefully we shall see them again on our next trip!

Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,alndi wrote a review Jul 2016,10,Marmara Dar Atlas,Arrived at the Hotel after a good flight and transfer. Eight people in our party but check in was very lengthy as the guy could not speak English. Porter took us to our rooms through lovely grounds. Lights were not working on the stairs to our block and the Porter just shook his head. The rooms were spacious with lovely white bedding and fluffy towels. However we had a ant infestation in our room so did my sister in law. Rang customer liaison but they put the phone down on us several times due to the language barrier!    The next morning we went to reception and they couldn't speak English. The bar staff and entertainment staff only spoke French and favoured the French guests like serving them first. We did complain but to no avail. The Manager promised that things would change but they didn't. No Thomson notice board so no idea about return pick ups. All signs in case of fire in French.    Food was ok but needed to be hotter. Gin vodka and wine was awful and no Martini on the all inclusive package. Drinks and food at the quiet bar also not covered on the all Inclusive but not mentioned on Thomson website.    Grounds and setting beautiful just a shame that Thomson Holidays don't care about there paying customers. Did write to them but there reply did not answer my question so I replied and there second reply was even worse! Still waiting for a sensible response from them.    Would definitely not recommend this Hotel or Thomsons in the future to anyone.    We were a party of eight but I would imagine a couple travelling g also e would feel very vulnerable.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alndi
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,71Paola2012 wrote a review May 2016,30,"Rooms outdated, poor cleaning service...but polite and afable customer service",We stayed three nights over here after a tedious welcoming in Casablanca airport and a long drive from there. We arrived pretty late (11pm) and our room was waiting for us (#915) We are a family of three and we had to let them know we needed one extra bed. Already there was a sofa bed. They came in around 10 min. always with a friendly approach. After leaving our luggage we went to the restaurant but unfortunately it had already closed at 22:30 (evening buffet) however they offered us to have a sandwich and fruit. Once again in the room we wanted to have a shower and I realised of the horrible mildew stains on the shower ceiling and in between the tiles... Once again I went to the reception to complain about this. I wanted to get another room or get it cleaned! Obviously it was abit late to get changed but sent immediately someone to cleaned thoroughly the ceiling and tiles. Next day I asked again to have it all cleaned and could smell the bleach everywhere.  In summary on photos looks very impressive but bear in mind that things do not work at a high level. Amazing staff but obviously they do what they can and you see clearly there is no investment on revamping the premises.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Santiago, Chile",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71Paola2012
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Karim B wrote a review May 2015,30,Good hotel for a small budget,Good hotel for a small budget. First marmara club experience unfortunately not convinced by the concept in comparison to Pullman / Meridien / Sofitel. Nevertheless good value for small budget. In Marrakech it seems possible to find better hotel especially on the buffet (little variety of food).  +++the place  --- the buffet entertainment bathroom bedding and no fridge,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimb300
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Kathi H wrote a review Dec 2014,30,Club dar Atlas,"This Marmara resort needs updating. The staff is friendly. The property is expansive with a lot of potential. the pools are inviting. The tennis courts look fine. There are activities for kids. The food selection is very varied and plentiful. The rooms need updating. The bathrooms are not well kept although they are clean. We had a flood in the room because of a missing panel in the shower which allowed the water to flow under the ""wall"" into the room. The tiles on the walls are slapped on with inconsistent grout. Rooms can be noisy since walls are thin. Many lights were out in the corridors making it difficult to see after dark. Too far from the center of Marrakech.",Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathiH662
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Eleanorann O wrote a review May 2014,40,Away from the noise and bustle of Marrakech,Clean attractive hotel with beautiful grounds about 15 kilometres from the centre of Marrakech. This might make it less than desirable for those who want to be constantly in the thick of things but we found it made a nice change returning to the hotel each evening. There is a navette which runs regularly between the hotel and the centre for 2‚Ç¨ each way the downside being that the last navette runs from the centre at 2015 which makes it a bit early if you want to savour the sights and sounds of Jemaa El Fna by night and you definitely should experience it by night.  The hotel has two pools the main one gets really noisy but there is a smaller and quieter one beside the spa area but you have to get there early to stake out a place.  The hotel caters almost exclusively to a French clientele and in the school holidays I can imagine it would be hell on earth for those who relish a quiet environment. When we went there it was fine and honestly the price in relation to quality makes it excellent value for money.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eleanoranno
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Olivier L wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Almost perfect!,Went last week to Dar Atlas hotel  through Marmara and had a very good time there. The rooms are very good swimming pool and entertainment first class! Just one thing could be improve is the restaurant; not it's bad but there is definitely some room for improvement considering how good the rest is. Will definitely come back if pass by Marrakesh again.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Twickenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/465olivierl
Valeria Dar Atlas Resort,Ian Millar wrote a review Aug 2013,40,Very good week,price vs quality you cannot complain. pick up from the airport was good. arrived late evening and they kept the restaurant open for us.  rooms: VERY clean our housekeeper was very nice. there is free wifi which works but bandwidth is very low. air conditioning was very good and the bathroom clean.    Restaurant and bar: overall good bit hit and miss on the quality but cannot complain. was never really overcrowded. only complaint was that the drinks were never really cold. you can go the bar and get bottles of water as you want. the beer is ok as well as the rose. lots of soft drinks for the kids.    the pool is large and was very nice. you need to get to the pool quite early to get a sun lounger. people leave their towels on them to reserve. reception open 24 hours.    excursions are organised. we did camel ride and moto cross. not too expensive but really hot.    overall a great week this is not 5* but you get what you pay for. no major complaints,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,lausanne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibmillar
