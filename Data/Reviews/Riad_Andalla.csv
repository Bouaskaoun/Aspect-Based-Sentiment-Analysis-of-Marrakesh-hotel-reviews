Riad Andalla,Logan B wrote a review Mar 22,50,Great place close to the square,Here's what I loved about it - It was right outside of the main square so it was an easy access point while shopping and doing other things near there. The staff was really courteous and nice and we really enjoyed them. My wife was looking for something that we couldn't seem to find at any shops and a staff member volunteered to run to a shop to pick it up for us. This was the kind of service we got there.    The breakfast was not the best we had but was decent.    The only negatives were that at night it could get a little noisy because of how close it was to the square. But we wore earplugs and were able to sleep just fine.    Overall a great experience and we would stay there again.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Herriman, Utah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loganb582
Riad Andalla,Mike K wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Great to be back!,"We were so happy to be back in Marrakech for our third stay at Riad Andalla. Slightly apprehensive partly due to Covid and partly due to the change of ownership of the Riad. We need not have worried - things are starting to thrive again in Marrakech and Riad Andalla continues to shine under Valerie's new management.    Our welcome was warm and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Karim deserves special mention for his fantastic English and his attention to detail. His smile is infectious and he really puts you at ease. He tells you ""this is your home now"" and that's exactly how we were made to feel.    All in all our trip was exactly as we have come to expect from Riad Andalla - pretty much perfect.",Date of stay: October 2021,,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeK105
Riad Andalla,Judith V wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Caring,Getting the help I needed…  Okay I can only agree with all the others:nice clean perfect location and superfriendly staff. Besides that: What made the difference for me is that I needed medication unexpectedly and while my husband could’nt find it or get it without prescription the owner (so sorry the name didn’t stick as I was pretty miserable) reassured me and called her own doctor who came to see me in the Riad (I was so happy I didn’t have to go out) and I got what I needed. Those are the things that make a huge difference. So grateful and now 2 days later back home healthy and well.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/238judithv
Riad Andalla,Gladys J wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Best Staff - Excellent Riad!!,This Riad is extremely nice and clean. The staff are amazing too! Lots of little sitting areas to sip tea in between sightseeing. Everything in the medina is with walking distance including the large square and easy to find your way around. This Riad has a great rooftop restaurant serving the best breakfast and dinners we had on our two week trip around Morocco. Best part is the friendly staff who really try hard to make your stay pleasant and give good advice on what to do and not do. To my husband and i this Riad was the perfect place for what we wanted to do in Marrakech.

Riad Andalla,Rachellally wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Wow!! What a team.,This trip made me realise how I love accommodation based on service. The whole Andalla team are incredible they go above and beyond at every moment. Beautiful morning smiles and welcomes. Booking anything we need and recommending the best with no request being too much. In 5days it felt like we were leaving a family!    The Riad is within a 2min walk to the square but it is peaceful. Fantastic restaurants very close by (we ate in every recommendation). The first night we had an evening meal on the Riad rooftop which was delicious and a must. Would recommend to all.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachellal2
Riad Andalla,Ricky O wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Riad Andalla is EXCELLENT!,Riad Andalla has an excellent location - just steps from Jmaa El Fnaa where everything happens - shopping dining entertainment etc. I stayed for 9 nights and felt that I could have stayed for another 9 nights. The room I stayed in (Salma) was wonderful and everything worked - AC Toilets comfortable bed clean safe. Most notable was how I was treated - like a valuable friend. Thanks to Pascal Valerie Jordi Laura and Karim. I felt like an honored guest all the time. It was pure joy to have known them. I will stay at Riad Andalla again and again.

Riad Andalla,Kolobezko wrote a review Jun 2022,50,"Location, location, location plus rooftop!",I stayed in Riad Andalla for 3 nights with my adult sons. Beware- there is Riad Andalla and Riad Andalla and Spa-- 2 different riads in Medina of Marrakesh which causes confusion for some.  Riad Andalla is lovely property 1 minute walk from Cafe France at Djeema El Fna square. It is little difficult to find but we asked proprietor of small store at the corner and he brought us there.  Location can't be beat. You are right there were all the action is but you close the door to riad-- and total peace and tranquility.  Riad has beautiful rooftop where they serve breakfast and dinner and it overlooks the square which is incredible.  Owners of the riad and all the people working there were lovely friendly and very helpful. Breakfast served is typical Moroccan- so very heavy on breads.  For our last dinner we ordered lamb tanjia-- typical dish for Marrakesh that is cooked in ashes for 6-7 hours. It was fantastic.  I would go back anytime and can only recommend this lovely place.,Date of stay: May 2022,,Boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kolobezko
Riad Andalla,.dvd wrote a review May 2022,30,Nice but not good enough,First we had a nice stay at this place and the people working there did their outmost to make us feel welcome.    On the down side.  First of all Riad Andalla is actually not a real riad as they don’t have an open air garden in the middle. Maybe that’s not such a big thing but we stayed in other riads with gardens and its for sure a different experience with flowers birds smells tranquility etc.    Other issues is that Andalla is that its situated a little far from the major activities if price is conceded. There where other / similar alternatives closer in the same price range.    Last issue we had was that the Wi-Fi was unstable. Not that its a big issue or unique for this place bit no less.    It seems that we didńt like the place but that not the case. The thing is that you can get more for less.    //Peter,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsafFDJDD

Riad Andalla,Rafael Fernandes wrote a review Jan 2020,50,The best Riad in Marrakech!,This place has by far surpassed my expectations.    The entire staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. Special mention goes to Karim William Moniem and Mustafa who made the time here much more pleasant.    The bedroom was very good with excellent heating was very quiet and had a very cozy bed.    The breakfast was amazing with lots of different (and delicious) bread as well as some sort of pancake with very good jam. They also had fresh orange juice which was awesome.

Riad Andalla,corsica411 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Tranquility in Marrakech,Uon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the owners and served mint tea as is the custom in Morocco. I haven't seen any other riads but this one was spacious comfortable and colorful. Our rooms were great. What we enjoyed most were the rooftop terrace from where you can see the range of mountains and also the large square Jemaa el-Fna. In fact we got a magnet which has the exact view of the square on it! The other thing we loved most was the location. It is a three minute stroll from the square yet when you are at the riad you do hear a sound. It is very peaceful. Everyone at Riad Andalla was very kind and helpful. We would definitely recommend it.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Exeter, NH",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corsica411
Riad Andalla,kenobi wrote a review Nov 2019,50,1001 nights tale :),Oh this riad is just amazing! Beautiful architecture. Just loved it so much couldnt get enough of it. The room was nice and big too. And the bathroom is wonderful with the tiled shower. The rooftop terrace was lovely. The breakfast was a bit boring almost the same every morning but that is not an issue. The guys who working there are very kind and helpful. They have good sense of humour too. Loved them all. The place is just a short walk to the main square. It is so close to it but still very quiet inside. Just barely heard the muezzin early in the morning :) One night there was a huge cat fight in the courtyard but you get that in Marrakesh :) I really recommend this place to everyone who travels there. Not the cheapest but it is truly beautiful.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Darwin, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenobimaster

The view over the Jama el Fna is incredible and even though it's so central your almost always alone there.  The rooms are cozy comfy and typical.    We really loved our stay there!

Riad Andalla,MJR wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Great location but....,Location is super! Kindness and availability of the staff is above average! Wonderful terrace and breakfast!  But..... rooms are far too small for 2 persons (less than 10 m2) and ours hardly had natural light! No room at all to keep your clothes or luggage even if you're staying only 4 days. Tiny bathroom (1 person at the time) and shower with very low water.  It was my 4th time in Marrakech always staying in riads and this was the one I liked less only due to room confort.

Riad Andalla,Zayedi wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Super convenient and clean Riad in the Medina,I really enjoyed the location and staff at Riad Andalla. The location was perfect for accessing the old city (Medina). We had the rooftop meal which was also great.  The bed was a little too hard/firm for my liking but I was able to get a good night's rest.Thank goodness their rooms were air-conditioned which made a huge difference in summer.  Overall I think this is a great choice for those wanting to explore the old city and be close to all the action and night bazaars.,Date of stay: August 2019,,KL,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zayedi

While it was a bit tricky to find it is actually perfectly situated with a nice view of Jemaa el-Fna square from the rooftop. Breakfast was included and served on the rooftop each morning and for an additional €20 you can have a 3 course home cooked meal for dinner. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the hosts were top notch! Be sure to ask them to book ground transportation for you if you are arriving by air.

But well hidden in a labyrinth of alleyways lays an Oasis. For my first time in Marrakech this was a perfect retreat and well worth the stay.    The staff is very nice and gives you full attention and help when you need. The breakfast was really nice and big served with a complimentary view of jemaa el-Fna at the roof terrace.    The rooms are beautiful decorated with Moroccan details and colors.    Close to the riad you will find a lot of restaurants shops and markets to keep you busy for some days.

Riad Andalla,kumack wrote a review Jun 2019,30,great staff poor room,Pros: Extraordinarily helpful and accommodating staff - could not have been more welcoming pleasant and diligently tried to resolve any issues. Great location near the market. Reasonable price. Very good food. Cons: Limited options for single rooms. The two singles I saw were directly off of the central lobby\courtyard seating areas with nothing but a door between your private bedroom and every person that opts for socializing on the comfy sofas and in my case  use it as a meeting point at 6:25AM as they embarked on their tour. Probably worth considering paying for a double room even if you're on your own. Also FYI the photos on the website are nicer than the actual place. And in general: I haven't stayed in a Riad before. It reminded me of something sort-of like a B&B. Again I had a single room. The room quality was rustic-don't expect anything like a western hotel. If I.based my rating solely on the room It would have been 1-star.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"St. Petersburg, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kumack
Riad Andalla,Bruno S wrote a review May 2019,50,The best Riad in Marrakech!,Our stay at Riad Andalla was absolutely wonderful!  We stayed 4 nights and from the moment of our arrival to the moment we left we truly felt at home! The approach of the owners and the Riad staff to the hospitality is completely different for much better than usual. From the moment we arrived we truly felt like family.  The Riad is very beautiful and its rooms are clean cared for and very quiet. Comfortable beds powerful air conditioning (which with the heat we had during our stay well over 40 degrees is a real gift) Moroccan decor even in the bathroom where the painted washbasin is a work of art.  It is a true oasis in the chaotic Medina. The view over the Jemaa El Fna Square is truly incredible and allows you to get to know the rhythm of the square by day and night without having to go to the confusion of the terraces of any café.  Breakfast and dinner are served with this spectacular view and the Koutubia Mosque and Atlas Mountains.  Breakfast is excellent. Varied with very good pastries and a freshly squeezed orange juice which is a delight. Dinner is well worth booking. The cook is a home cooking that is not found in any local restaurant! Strong and intense flavors of true Moroccan homemade cuisine. Absolutely delicious!  The staff at Riad Andalla offers the best conditions for local tours and tips for everything we need and want.  We just have to thank all the awesome host we had and we will definitely return to Marrakech and always to Riad Andalla! You are in our heart and in the great memories we have of the city!

Riad Andalla,Chris V wrote a review May 2019,50,"Caring, Kind, & Beyond Accommodating",The amenities and cleanliness are up to par with what the majority of the reviews have been saying. I came a little earlier and my room was already ready. Moreover its a PERFECT location -- extremely close to the action but far enough to have a peaceful calm rest from it all.    Everyone was extremely helpful --- not to mention of the employees who went ABOVE and BEYOND his job description by driving me and my luggage by motorbike to the airport after I had a mix-up with my flight times (due to Ramadan -- BE AWARE!) --- once he learned that I may be late for my flight without hesitation he set down my breakfast items ran down the Riad started his motorbike and off we went.

Riad Andalla,Taxi-Tino wrote a review Mar 2019,40,"Good place, great location, nice rooftop terrace with amazing view",I can recommend this place. I had a good stay. Got a room in the secondary building but found it to be good although it was missing many of the features that I got in my booking confirmation when I booked through a booking site (such as a work desk). Room was cozy and clean breakfast was good and the staff friendly. The view from the terrace is really good and the location of the riad is good. The nearby streets feel secure and has many good eats and you are minutes from the big square. It might be a bit hard to find the riad the first time if on your own but it's quite easy and few steps from Cafe France (actually just behind it but you need to turn a few times to find the house). Taxi from the airport was charged 15 Euro through the riad which is fair considering the waiting time and the comfort of having someone show you all the way (you still need to walk a bit though as the alleys are too narrow for cars). Not the cheapest of riads around but worth the price.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Odense, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taxi-Tino

The staff was friendly and welcoming. We had our first taste of delicious Moroccan mint tea here. Our rooms were beautiful clean and very comfortable. The roof top terrace was very nice and a peaceful place to enjoy Marrakesh and watch the market area. The view of the city and the Mosque was perfect. We had breakfast both mornings on the terrace. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. One night we made arrangements to have dinner on the terrace. The food and service were wonderful. The Riad is perfectly situated to enjoy Marrakesh and it is not difficult to find your way back after an outing to the market. When we were dropped off by our driver after leaving the airport we had to walk through the market area to get to the Riad. There was someone there to meet us and cart our luggage to the Riad.

Riad Andalla,saraihamburg wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Absolutely amazing Riad in the center,"I've stayed at the Riad Andalla with my mom and sister for about 10 days. A super friendly man picked up us at the airport and brought us to the Djemaa el Fna where we're picked up and lead to the Riad . The ride was about 20 minutes and great to crash a first look at the city.  The Road itself is absolutely gorgeous. It is a very beautiful place where you feel home from the first moment. Everywhere are little accessories pictures and flowers and you can find nice Moroccan furniture the relax.  On the one side the rooftop gives you a perfect view above the whole market place. On the other side you can see the impressive Atlas Mountains! We loved to recover from the hectic city during daytime and have seen beautiful sunsets in the evenings.  You can reach everything ""touristy"" within a short walk!  The whole staff was just amazing. They always had a good energy and helped us out in so many ways!  We booked a trip to Essaouira and to the Atlas Mountains. That was possible the evening/night before - thank you Andalla for being than uncomplicated! :)  The rooms have been petty quiet even that close to the marked you couldn't hear anything inside the sleeping rooms. The first night we had dinner at Andalla and ate Tajine. They've been the best ones we are at Marrakech! Yummy!    We will definitely come back to see the people again. It was just a perfect time and I recommend this place from my heart!

Riad Andalla,Chris D wrote a review Jan 2019,50,An amazing place,It's a little hard to find and the taxis can't get near it due to restricted traffic in Jemaa el Fnaa. The room was a little small but comfortable. And fair for the price.    It is the staff here which makes the Riad a special place. Abdul with his ready smile abundant energy is the embodiment of hospitality. Mureen Ahmed and Aziz who seem always to be there when you need them. The ready smiles of all the rest of the staff keep the feeling of warmth and hominess that you would hope to find in this type of accommodation. But here they take it to the next level. I have had the good fortune to stay in some amazing 5 star hotels around the world all of whom have had excellent hospitality. Not one of them can hold a candle to Riad Andalla.    It's not fancy.

Those evening meals felt like we were more like guests in a private home and someone's mom had made us a home-cooked wonderfulness. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The location was perfect.

When we arrived we were greeted with tea and the staff sat down with us for a half hour and explained best practices and where we should go. They were very helpful and accessible during our whole trip and gave us plenty of tips for our stay. The room was clean and decorated nicely and the location is conveniently near many of the main attractions. The breakfast is amazing (especially the corn bread) and more than enough to start the day. They also allowed us to leave our things there between stays which helped us immensely as we traveled into the desert.

We were given the upper room in the left riad which was clean and very well placed as the only room on this floor. The bed is very firm which is what we prefer. If they have availability ask for this room. It appears to have its own terrace area as well which is very nice.    The friendly attitude of all staff members - from cleaning to management - is remarkable. We even spend a day cooking with the staff and got a couple of tips for better couscous and chili sauce.

Just few steps from Place Jamaa el fnaa but in a very peaceful and safe small street so you can sleep very well!!! View from terrace on the roof is amazing because is right on the Place  it seems to touch it with your finger  The Riad and all the rooms are very well decorated  moroccon style very good size and impeccably clean. Beds are very comfortable .Breakfast is very very goodlots of choice high quality and abundant .You can have dinner at the Riad if you want( I higly recommend) as food is really tastefully. But what makes the difference with other Riads and makes it a little gem is the atmosphere you can breath in it you feel really at home!The owners Cristophe and Andrèe are really friendly as well as all the staff. They all are always ready to solve any problem or any curiosity and they will give you good suggestion about the city. Thank you Abdul for spices I will cook great tajine tonight thinking of you!!!

Riad Andalla,pebarnard wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Wonderful Service and Atmosphere,On the recommendation of a friend I booked Riad Andalla for three night stay in  Marrakesh. The property is literally a block from the Jamaa El Feena square and from the rooftop terrace you can see everything that’s going on down there without immersing yourself completely in the craziness of it. Can’t say enough about the excellent service that was given by each and every one of the staff members. While the decor and comfort of the Riad was top-notch it was outshone by the wonderful nature of the staff always happy and always willing to help. Abdul was very helpful in organising anything that you want to do. He organised for me to have a massage at their partner property which was undoubtably one of the best I’ve had. I was met nearby the Riyadh and transport to the airport was also organised without a hitch. The property office half board and the dinner is worth truly excellent.

Riad Andalla,Holly K wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Great location,I would have given the Riad a five star rating except that as a single female traveller the staff crossed a cultural and professional boundary by being too keen on forming relations which made it uncomfortable to want to return to the hotel each night.    Aside from this the hotel is well situated and close to all the action. The rooms and the entire venue is clean and serviced regularly. The air conditioning works well and is a welcome relief.    The view from the terrace is spectacular. You can see all the action of the vendors setting up shop as the sun sets behind the mosque.    I’m guessing this is the same as other riads but when others are speaking in the atrium the noise travels up into the rooms. Also to note is that the doors do not lock except with a bolt and you cannot lock your room when you leave.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,Melbourne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439hollyk

Riad Andalla,melbexplorer88 wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Amazing riad overlooking Jemaa el-Fna!,"Everyone goes to Marrakech to experience the buzz of activity in the medina - the intriguing mix of souks touters peddlers scooters animals and more all crammed into a disorientating maze. However it is precisely because of this that Riad Andalla really stands out. We stayed during a quiet period and only ever shared the riad with a handful of other guests and found it to be the perfect oasis to retreat to when everything outside became a little too much to handle.    We enjoyed the warm welcome the lovely mint tea the two relaxing inner courtyards (Riad Andalla occupies two buildings divided by a common footpath) and the tastefully decorated rooftop garden - the views over the Jemaa el-Fnaa were fantastic day and night and we never grew tired of having breakfast there every morning. Our room was equally interesting with lots of Moroccan elements built into its design. The air conditioning was powerful enough to keep the room cool (though we've been told that it's been an incredibly mild summer there) and the beds were comfortable. The shower had reasonable water pressure but it was evident that the plumbing can only handle so much - an average length shower can take an hour or two to drain. For those looking for hotel-style bathroom amenities you should reset your expectations. Unlike older reviews all of the rooms we saw could be padlocked for security.    The service was always friendly- Abdul seemed to be everywhere always ready to help book you a tour or point out some places of interest Mounim always polite thoughtful and happy to chat and Salua kind courteous and evidently a great cook as we thoroughly enjoyed the delicious (but comparatively pricey) tagine that was served (remember to book this ahead of time). Location wise the Jemaa el-Fna and the souks are both a 3 minute walk away and most of the major attractions (palaces and gardens) are all within walking distance.    Of course those who are less adventurous can stay in the new city. However we can't help but feel that it misses the point of being in Marrakech. So for those willing to experience staying in the medina we don't think it can get much better than Riad Andalla.    Some final notes: be aware that unless arriving very early in the morning there is no car access allowed around the Jemaa el-Fnaa (and the riad). Your best bet for navigating to the riad is to be dropped off as close to the square as possible near the Koutoubia mosque. There are two main paths near the mosque leading into the square - follow either head diagonally across the square to Cafe de France. On one side of the cafe is a street leading away from the square - follow that and turn into the first small open air alleyway on the right take the first right down that alleyway and walk to the end turn right and walk to the end again turn left and you will hit a metal gate - press the buzzer on the wall and someone from the riad will come and open the door for you. The journey down the alleyways only takes a few minutes but does feel long when you first attempt it. Try not to look too ""touristy"" as some locals will either (1) try to take you on a scenic journey and ask for a handsome sum at the end (2) tell you that the path is closed/for locals only/give some other conceivable excuse that will make you doubt yourself. Be confident and alert and you should be fine. For navigation the Maps.Me map is more accurate than Google Maps. As the roads are narrow give your GPS some time to triangulate before moving into the alleyways.",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melbexplorer88

Riad Andalla,Cynthia M wrote a review Aug 2018,50,A hidden gem in Marrakesh,I stayed in Andalla for three nights and it turns out to be a great choice. This is my first time traveling in Africa. I was somewhat anxious when I just arrived in Marrakesh especially I'm coming alone. However Andalla has given me the sense of safety I need. It's hidden in the quiet street near the square so no need to worry about the noise. I like the Moroccan style of the place. I like the great breakfast on the rooftop every morning. I like how close it is to the square so that I could simply come back to take a break whenever I found the heat outside unbearable. I also like how friendly and helpful the staffs are. The boss even took the time to help me print out my boarding pass which was a big help for me. Next time I'm coming back to Marrakesh I will definitely come back to Andalla.

Besides that the place is really beutiful and comfortable an actual quiet and fresh refuge in the middle of the busy Medina just a few meters from the El Fna square wich is very helpful since its near to almost everywhere a turist would like to go.

Riad Andalla,Evija A wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Traditional Style Riad Near Jemaa el-Fna,I had booked my stay at this riad for 2 nights to extend my tour through the country. My friend was staying at a different hotel however she came with me when I was checking in. It was slightly tricky to find the riad but once we did we both fell in love with it even after having been traveling through Morocco for a week. Everything looked and felt authentic and very beautiful to the smallest details. We were greeted with some tea and biscuits and some warm smiles. Once I saw my room I was even more impressed by the designs. However I had my suspicions that the roof terrace is going to surprise me even more. And it did! What a view all around it! And a great place to watch the empy square in morning seeing it getting busier in the afternoon and finally full of crowds at night. I even managed to see part of Berber culture festival which was amazing! Be aware though that you might hear a bit of the hustle and bustle from the square in your room too.  The hotel staff were truly friendly and helpful and always available for whatever you might need. Even if it is just a conversation in evening on the terrace while enjoying the fantastic views.  The breakfast was very good and delicious and rooms were cleaned every day.  I definitely recommend this riad and would love to return there myself!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221evijaa
Riad Andalla,DianaHV wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Excellent Value,This air-conditioned riad sits minutes from the main square. The decor is lovely the price is excellent the rooms and beds are comfortable and adorable. The owner that was managing when I was there (Abdul) is completely charming and helpful. Email correspondence before was prompt and complete. The only things I would change would be: more consideration from support staff in morning (or workers coming in too early?) being noisy breakfast of mainly different breads could be improved toiletries are minimal and cheap. These are little things that keep me from giving the best score but they are just little things!

Finding it the first time was a little harder than it should have been - the turn off the main street has a sign post but it is first right right left after that and they were not labelled.

Riad Andalla,PermanentWknd wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Ideal location but too noisy for us,Cons: Sound travels easily in this lively riad. We’ve preferred other places that managed to be in the midst of medina life yet retain a peaceful ambiance. Breakfasts are average. Rooms do not have locks and the front door is often left ajar. The riad spanned across the dead end of an alley which meant that staff wasn’t always in both sides of the guesthouse. Abdul the affable host said there are cameras everywhere and they’ve never had a theft since opening 10 years ago.    Pros: Location was ideally close (3min walk) to the Place Jemaa El Fna and the handy landmark Cafe de France where the taxis drop you off. Great rooftop terrace view over Place Jemaa El Fna to photograph both the morning calm and evening chaos. Meals are served from 8pm with a prearranged dining request. Wine is available onsite.

Riad Andalla,Married_Couple_Malta wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Best Location,We stayed 4 nights at Riad Andalla and we couldn't have chosen a better location than this. Room was nicely decorated somewhat dim and cold however. AC was a bit noisy but this is an old building after all. Hot water in bathroom was always available - keep the drains closed to keep out the smell of old plumbing. The staff are extremely welcoming friendly and helpful. Top marks go to breakfast on roof-top terrace the view of Jemaa el fna is awesome. A suggestion I would like to make is for management to put up a couple of signs in the leading streets to indicate the way to riad - being first-timers in Marrakech is was not easy for us to locate. Would recommend this accommodation.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Malta,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Married_Couple_Malta

Cons: our room was on a floor above the kitchen not in the main building and it was noisy; Wifi internet was not good in our room; little water in the shower (no way to wash my hair) and the smell in the bathroom; there’s no hairdryer (in the winter it is hard to wash your hair and go out).  Be aware about the taxi: what is combined via riad is a transfer from the airport to the riad. The taxi driver tried to let us near the riad just two minutes from the hotel. He wanted us walk alone to the front of the hotel no signs (just an initial one) no maps in our first time in Marrakech a tough task!

Riad Andalla,Lesli W wrote a review Jan 2018,50,An oasis just blocks from the square!,I've just returned from a whirlwind week in Morocco - one night at Riad Andalla 3 nights on a tour then another 3 nights at the riad. This was my first trip to Morocco and the first half I was travelling alone so I wanted a place I felt comfortable and that was close to the Jemaa el Fna and the souks before my companion met me later in the week.    Riad Andalla was terrific from the hospitality (warm welcomes and always smiling faces from Abdul and the staff) to the food (the best tagine we had the entire week!!!) to the tea to the decor (the stonework is lovely as well - the baths are all tadelakt) and the comfortable beds!! ...I'd definitely stay there again. And the location: you can't really get any closer to Jemaa el Fna without being in the middle of the square!    Christophe was super-responsive when I emailed him to make the reservations answering my barrage of questions without delay. He arranged the airport pickup (HIGHLY recommended as the riad is hard to find your first day) and my desert tour (the tour company needs to work on its communication and meal options but that's not Andalla's fault) so all I really needed to do was drop my bags and have fun...Christophe is a dear (as is Abdul) and you can tell they really love their jobs!    Riad Andalla is actually two buildings: the main riad and a smaller guest house/riad across the street. Both have roof decks but from Andalla proper the view of the square (and the Atlas mountains) is exceptional! Do make time to take in the views and the atmosphere up there as it is like an oasis - inside the riad it is so quiet you'd never know so much chaos was going on just a block away. Yes you can hear the street if the windows are open but that didn't bother us a bit.    I stayed in two different rooms: my first night was a double on the 1st floor (one flight up) and it was clean and quiet and had a small but nice bathroom. When I returned from the desert and met my friend we were in a room in the house across the street - a double on the 2nd floor (two flights up - quirky stone steps) with a really big bed (this was a must as C is ~190cm and Abdul made sure we were comfortable) and a lovely bath. It was cool at night and my only negative about the rooms was that the heating didn't quite reach where the bed was so I felt bad that I had to turn it up to 24.    This was a perfect place for us to stay and everyone on the staff went out of their way to meet our needs (big bed eggs and yogurt at breakfast a late dinner one night making change getting rid of a jerk who lead me to the riad and tried to extort money from me when I got lost...)    This isn't a luxury hotel so you won't find cute bath soap or fancy shampoo nor do they advertise to be anything but what they are: it's clean and safe and the staff works very hard to ensure you have a nice stay. The other guests seemed to have the same opinion.    There was a slight miscommunication on the day we were leaving - the marathon had snarled traffic and we should have left earlier for the airport - this caused some temporary stress (and necessitated walking part of the way) but no flights were missed.    A note about the tours: there seems to be only one company that operates group tours from Marrakech. If you're looking for a more personal experience or a less frenetic pace then I'd recommend working with Christophe to create a private or semi-private tour. The group tours are something of a racket shuttling tourists as quickly as possible from points A to B to C. It wasn't terrible but if I did it again I'd try a different option or drive myself.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrwBos

This was our first trip to Marrakesh and we chose this Riad because of its position - very close to the main square but off of the main streets.. We also wanted a roof terrace as we enjoy sitting with a glass of wine watching the sun go down. It was a very good choice.  What we didn't expect was the warmth of our welcome . Thank you Abdul Ahmed and the four wonderful ladies who laughed with us and tried really hard to make our stay comfortable and memorable. Moroccan hospitality at its best. We had two evening meals cooked to order by the ladies and they were the tastiest we ate all week.

We went with two of our friends on a weekend break.    None of us had been to Marrakesh before so we weren’t sure what to expect. A friend had recommended the Riad Andalla so we knew our accommodation would be ok.    When we got out of the taxi we were all a bit worried the narrow alleyways that we had to walk through to get to our Riad were a little worrying but when we arrived at the Andalla the welcome we received was lovely. The Andalla is a peaceful haven from the busy Souks filled with colour and sound!! Abdul was both welcoming and helpful nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was a colourful array of fruit bread pancakes just what’s needed before a trip to the souk (market) to haggle for any amount of trinkets leather goods scarves etc!!! a big thank you to Abdul and his team for making it So special ❤️,Date of stay: January 2018,,"Folkestone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/134SharonC
Riad Andalla,Deirdre wrote a review Jan 2018,50,"Amazing place, highly recommend",This place is great! Everything about it was perfect. The room and location.    Most of the tour groups that pick up in the Medina are at a restaurant practically around the corner.    The Riad offered paid meals if we were interested. The first night was so good that we at there every night. Real Moroccan food with a different menu every night. The best!!!    Abdul ran the place and helped us tremendously. He said they offered several trips for 50 Euros which is very inexpensive compared to tour companies but we’d couldn’t cancel our paid trip.    The owner Christophe was great too and suggested if we ever come back to book a room and optional tours directly through him for a lower price.

Riad Andalla,Nicole_shongololo wrote a review Jan 2018,50,"Great value, ideal location, fantastic warm hospitality",We spent five nights there over New Years with our grown sons. Riad Andalla is located right in the Medina (walled medieval city) a few minutes walk to the main square - Jemaa El-Fnaa. The riad consists of 2 small converted homes with central courtyards and rooftop terraces and decorated in typical beautiful Moroccan design with tiles fountains lanterns etc.    All the staff were amazing and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. A special thank you to Christophe André Abdelkader the young servers the ladies in the kitchen and everyone who made us feel as we were part of their family. Every day they went out of their way to go to the only gluten-free bakery in the city to make breakfast for our gluten-intolerant son. The delicious breakfast included freshly squeezed OJ pastries baguette yogurt 2 kinds of Moroccan pancakes with honey and jams. Dinner was very good too - tagines and other traditional Moroccan fare.    Rooms each have unique decorations and ours was spacious with a comfortable bed. Thank goodness they're heated (AC in summer) because December nights in Marrakech are cold. It was too bad the temperatures weren't high enough early in the morning to have breakfast on the terrace. At night we spent time up there to watch the activities in the main square.    Due to the location off small streets in the medina cars cannot drive to the door of the riad. You need to find a porter next to the main square with a cart to take your luggage. (It's part of the adventure!) When checking out Riad Andalla staff get a cart to take luggage for you.    The only recommendation is to book ground floor rooms if you have trouble with steep uneven stairs (remember it is the old medina).,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicole_shongololo

The rest of the staff especially Abdul were very helpful and always greeted you with a big smile. The rooms are good airconditioned and the bathrooms have amazing tiles. The breakfasts were good mainly bread jam and pastries orange juice and coffee and a couple of times Abdul served us outside hours to fit in with our days and travel plans.

Riad Andalla,Linh T wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Hidden gem,We found Riad Andalla for 2 night stays in Marrakech (Monday Friday only since we are staying Tues-Thurs in the desert) via Booking and TripAdvisor since the soaring reviews are hard not to trust. We arrange airport pickup and was brought back to the Riad easily. Here we were greeted by Abdoul (my apologies if I have your name wrong) and Chris who had nothing but bright smiles and charisma and hospitality at all times. We were given warm welcome and a pot of coffee on roof top before receiving the key to our room which was beautifully decorated had AC and nice bathroom. Riad Andalla is a guest-house with many floors and they have another building across from the original one with even bigger room and bathroom all top notch. We were given tips on navigating around town and a map and we had lovely homemade dinner in the lobby (since it was gonna rain on rooftop so :( ) and it was delicious and fulfilling! Finding our way back to the Riad from the main market isn't too hard but definitely you wanna watch around in the dark small alleys. They have breakfast early in the morning so that's also great! They let us leave after the first night to go on with our desert trip plan and come back for the last night before paying for both nights which to me never happened before! That says a lot about the low key atmosphere that our hosts and this great gem is!

Riad Andalla,Mamoun I wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Location Location Location,This hotel has a fantastic location near Jema Elfena. In fact you can see it from the roof or the terasse. The place is clean and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The owner made the impression of a friendly guy after a chat with him during the checkout. The only thing I’d find difficult is to spend a long vacation there. In my opinion it’s suitable for short trips. The reason for saying so is the lack of daylight in the room and there is no TV. Also I had the impression before arriving there that the place is more spacious after seeing its Fotos online. The breakfast is really nice but the range is limited to sweet pastries jam honey and cake. Nonetheless it was a great experience and big Thank to the team there.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamouni768

Riad Andalla,oliver c wrote a review Aug 2017,50,"Absolutely perfect, must visit",If you are visiting marrakech at any point then this is the riad you should stay at.  I can't recommend the place highly enough the location is perfect for access to the main square about a 30 second walk from the front door.  The riad itself is easy enough to find and inside is absolutely beautifully decorated and arranged the food that they cook is extremely tasty and the meals are very reasonably priced for the portion sizes but the best thing about the riad is the staff they can't do enough for youand this continues throughout the duration of your stay.  Every one of them is so kind and welcoming and pretty much make you feel as though you are part of a family. Anything that you need help with they will give you with a warm smile.  If I come to marrakech again this would be the only place I would stay as this week was the best customer service experience I have ever had.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/169oliverc
Riad Andalla,fabulous4rome wrote a review Jul 2017,50,"Exceptional stay, amazing hosts!",After time-consuming review of many riads (it was out first time in Morocco so we were a bit thorough in screening reviews) we opted for Andalla and it was an excellent choice. After booking we received great immediate feedback from the Christophe and he arranged the transport to riad which I strongly advice! He was absent from Riad but Abdoul Karim and ladies did marvelous job!!!  Location is splendid close to El Fna square view is gorgeous breakfast outstanding super clean Riad and truly memorable experience!  We felt well taken care of!  Abdoul organized day trips for us - all were good helped us with many useful suggestions - especially for shopping and bargaining :))  We could't recommend this Riad enough!!  Thank you for everything!    Our rooms were on first floor Fanida i Zouina. Rooms are inside oriented.  Just couple of observations:  Bathroom is separated with curtain.  As in many other riads there are no keys - you have inside and outside lock - meaning that when you are in room you can lock the room but outside lock has no real purpose - still do not be bothered at all we felt completely safe (there is always someone in the riad and it is locked you can't get in without buzzing first) and our belongings as well off course lock on your suitcase will probably ease the mind of those more cautious.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Belgrade, Serbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabulous4rome
Riad Andalla,Carolina R wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Best location and the perfect moroccan feel-like home place to stay,The best location to stay in Marrakech near Jemaa el Fna with a rooftop with an amazing view over it where we could enjoy dinner and a wonderful breakfast.  But this was not all about the location after walking through the narrow streets I was amazed once I cross the Riad Andalla door.  I found out the most warming reception of all with an amazing Moroccan decor that will dazzled me. All the details are carefully care the rooms are super comfortable and although it's located 2 min from the main square inside it is super quiet.  Recommend the traditional dinner and breakfast for sure!  Definitely the best place to stay and we could't find better hosts to have thanks guys!

Riad Andalla,burt s wrote a review Jun 2017,50,"A terrific place just half-a-""block"" from the Jemaa el Fna",Riad Andalla was one of he most enjoybable riads we stayed in in Morocco. Abdul & Kareem out hosts (Christophe is another) were more than kind always in good spirits. The location could not have been closer to the Jemaa el Fna--while remaining apart & super-quiet. And yes the rooftop terrace was special with a killer view of the plaza.  You will at first wonder about the winding alleyway to Andalla but it makes the riad even more alluring & serene after the festy Jemaa din.

Riad Andalla,Saloshni M wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Lovely stay at Riad Andalla,We spent four nights at the Riad in the second week of April. Hats off to Christophe Abdul Karim and the ladies for their service and hospitality. I had a room on the first floor (Laroubia) which was a fine size for one person. There are couches on the landing for you to lounge on if you wish. The bathroom was small but fine for me: nice shower. A curtain separates the bathroom from the bedroom.Great having the A/C to cool down the room. Please note that there are no locks on bedroom doors here. This was not a problem.    Breakfast consisted of a variety of breads and pastries with jam and honey. We asked for eggs yoghurt and cheese to be included and they were happy to oblige. Thank you for that. We ate dinner here on our first night. The Tajines were delicious. A lot for two people.    Great eating on the roof terrace with the views of the square. It does get hot in the morning so you might want to look for a spot with some shade when having breakfast.    The location is great to wander around the square and other tourist sights. Christophe and Abdul are ever ready to provide information. We took bus number 15 from the square to visit Jardin Marjorelle. We walked everywhere else.    We enjoyed our stay and readily recommend the Riad. Book directly with the Riad/Christophe. If you are a traveller with deep pockets then check out the newer property Riad Andalla Spa for an exclusive/upmarket option!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Durban, South Africa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saloshnim
Riad Andalla,Limbobski wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Good location and super friendly staff,The location is excellent. It is 3 minutes from the main square.    When you arrive it's a little strange to walk between the houses to find the riad. Seems complicated but it was easy to find after the 1st time :) I recommend ordering the transport from the riad as they will bring you directly to the riad. I can imagine it being very hard to find by yourself (as are most other riads as well). Most of the riads are located in between the buildings.    The staff was very nice and were really good to our 2 year old daughter which they called Nina :) (which is faroese for 'sit')    Breakfast is fine and the evening dinner was great :)    Keep up the good work!

Riad Andalla,Guidzi wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Inspiring place,The staff is really nice and helpful. They took their time to explain us everything we needed to know. They offered us a welcome tea. The room is spacious and comfortable. The AC worked perfectly. We had to go to the next house where they serve the breakfast. The next house is right in front of the one in which we were. The very nice breakfast is served at the terrace where you have a good view of the jemaa el efna square but sadly it's not the highest terrace. Even though we only stayed on night the price is really worth it. You won't find this place on your own because it's in a narrow street so forget about the GPS. We were close to the hotel so we asked for help and didn't pay for the help. The thing is i speak arabic so it helps a lot. You should ask a local and say right away that you won't pay them for their help.

The rooms are small but very pretty. I loved being so close to the square and the souks. Truly in the heart of everything. It's wonderful to hear the call to prayer in your rooms. However if you are a light sleeper make sure you bring ear plugs or download a sound machine app on your phone.. that helped me a lot.  The riad is very safe. There is no handle on the door so you have to be buzzed in to even get in to the riad. Strangers cannot just come in. Also one thing to note that surprised me was that the room doors do not lock.

The Riad feels like someone has welcomed you into their perfectly decorated private home.It's not high end or fancy but it's full of character. The rooms have traditional tiles and furniture and the bed is quite comfortable. The entire staff here treats you with genuine warmth and friendliness. I was here on a business trip to attend COP and one of the guys even offered me a ride on his motorbike on my first day which was appreciated as I hadn't orientated myself yet.    The rooftop is great too especially in the morning light with the music of the square emanating from below.    The only complaint I have is that the doors do not have locks.

Food in the Riad was excellent we loved having breakfast on the sun terrace and being able to watch the market come alive without being hassled. The room was lovely in fact everything was great and Christophe and his team couldn't be faulted. So friendly nothing was too much trouble.

That's what we felt in Riad Andalla Christophe is like an old friend in a friends reunion super friendly with a great sense of humor and he can make yourself feel at home he told us what to visit and good places to eat even draw us a map (awesome map ;) ).  At first look the entry to the riad is a little hard to find ( we're saved by the guy of the transfer (booked by Christophe too) to tell us the way but after that it's very easy to find  The dinner and the Breakfasts were great the room clean and climatized sometimes the wi-fi was poor in my room but not big deal (I was in the room in the terrace i loved it (next time i'm gonna ask the same room). and all the staff is AWESOME.  2/3 minutes from the jemaa el fna in the center of everything.

Riad Andalla,MissD787 wrote a review Sep 2016,50,"Fantastic Location, Great Service, Great Value...Amazing Stay!",Riad Andalla is approx. 25 minutes by taxi from the airport. You can get either the grand taxi which will cost 100 dirham or the petite taxi costs 70 dirham. Alternatively there is a coach which costs 30 dirham per person from outside the airport. Be aware taxis cannot take you all the way to the riad as it's located down a very narrow alleyway. There are also certain times that the taxis can drive into the square so during busy hours you will need to walk approx 10 minutes to get to the riad.    I chose this property because of it's location and it really doesn't disappoint. You are right in the centre if el fna square but secluded enough from all the hustle and bustle and all the chaos for a good night's rest.    I stayed in the moon room which was decorated all in blue. Room is small but comfortable. There is no door separating the bathroom to the bedroom or tv (but why would you want a tv when it's so beautiful outside?). It was a little dark but once you opened up the windows it was ok.    The best feature is the terrace. It's got an amazing view of the fna square and the mosque. You could spend hours relaxing there just watching people go by and watching the beautiful sunset. Breakfast is served there every morning which consisted of fruit pastry bread tea/coffee and preserves.    All the staff here are absolutely amazing! Really welcoming and friendly. I had great recommendations from Younes for local restaurants and nightlife. Abdul was also so helpful and helped in organising our tours. I would definitely recommend this property to anyone visiting Marrakech as it ticks all the boxes for location cleanliness hospitality service and a traditional Moroccan riad!,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissD787

The room was nicely decorated and had a couple of windows which helped to provide some natural light. The riad itself is in the perfect location with only being a 2 minute walk to Jemaa El Fnna. We had no issues with the wifi and the breakfast was more than enough to start the day. The owners were very helpful with giving directions and also recommended a lovely (and cheap) hammam called Isis.

Breakfast is served in the roof terrace with an excellent view of the square. The staff are friendly and extremely accommodating. Our flight left early yet the staff woke to ensure we had a good breakfast before we left. The only negative is the poor wifi.

Riad Andalla,Mary T wrote a review Aug 2016,30,Great for the price,My husband and I decided to splurge in another city on $200/night hotels so we opted to save a little money while in Marrakesh for 3 days since there were many low prices options.  For only $37/night it was very clean very well located with beautiful terrace and great view and most importantly everyone was very nice!  The cleaning staff reception and owner were all lovely.  Although I'm certain all the staff are trustworthy that there are no locks on the rooms or safes in the rooms did make me a little uncomfortable. You just never know and the staff although trustworthy certainly don't know all the guests. I figure its better to not tempt the devil! We locked out valuables in our suitcase but I would have liked a lock of some sort.  Also arrange the train/airport pickup from hotel for first day to make arrival easier as it's hard to find the riad at first.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryjustinet81

Riad Andalla,Elena wrote a review May 2016,50,Pure Moroccan experience - Simply perfect,My friends and I have just spent a long weekend in this beautiful jem in the heart of Marrakesh. We were five girls looking for beautiful places to visit good food good atmosphere and nights out. We had all of this. It has been a 360 degrees complete experience from any point of view.    The Riad is situated just 2 minutes from the main square in Marrakesh. All the main attractions of the city are at a walking distance from the Riad. If it is too hot for you you can grab a taxi and in 10 mins you'll be anywhere.    I have only positive comments about my experience as follows:    - The rooms are really lovely in their Moroccan interior design and architecture clean tidy and spacious.    - The Terrace where you'll have an amazing fresh daily made breakfast (and dinner if you book it!) faces the main square and you can decide whether to sit at the table or on an elegant lounge area. Go to the terrace to enjoy the beautiful and colourful sunsets Marrakesh offers. An extra point of beauty and atmosphere is during the first evenig pray (around sunset time).    - Food is simply perfect: we had filling wonderful breakfasts (fresh juices home made bakery jams honey Moroccan yogurt etc) and a sumptuous Moroccan dinner where I had the best tajine ever in 4 days in town! So book at least one dinner (I suggest to have it on the day you arrive) and you will not regret! If you are a fun of wine don't miss Moroccan white wine out because it is really good and resfreshing after a day under the sun!    - The staff: nothing to say apart from a big big thank you to Christophe first of all because he helped me in organising this trip and all the activities we did and provided us with maps and detailed info about what to do where to go and where not where to eat. Following all the other guys working there always available present helpful and happy to talk everytime we meet them! A special thank you to Abdul because we woke him up early in the morning and late in the night to let us in :)  A big hug to all the lovely ladies who looked after food and cleaning!    I think this is enough information for you to pick this homely place to spend a great time in Marrakesh!

The rooms had air con the place was a two min walk to the Jemaa del Fna. The staff were all very friendly nothing was too much trouble.Anything you need to book ie.massage Hammams camel ride or a belly dancing show this hotel are more than happy to book them for you.  The hotel is decorated beautiful there is a super roof top terrace. They can serve alcohol so at the end of the evening you can relax up there with a glass of wine last thing at night if you wish.  Our group of 6 friends all commented on how comfortable the beds were.  Also there's hi speed wifi in the bed rooms and down stairs in the reception areahowever didn't work on the roof terrace but as we had wine and great company didn't need time!

Riad Andalla,Jill v wrote a review May 2016,50,So close to the action but still distance from the crowds!,The most challenging for us was trying to orient ourselves after driving from Ait Ben Haddou to be able to find the close parking area. Christophe had been wonderful on email- very helpful but it was difficult. Nevertheless we figured it out and with the help of a cart man found our way to the Riad.    We were greeted with mint tea which was very welcome and refreshing! Being a group of four we had two rooms which was just great for us.The bathroom was- shall we say- intimate... But it was fine for us- nice hot water! Complimentary soaps etc.  It was a bit odd not to have locks on the doors but it caused no problems. We dropped off our things and made our way up to the terrace to see the action and then back down to join it!    We met Christophe after our dinner and he gave us a great recommendation for ice cream. He seemed to be a wealth of knowledge and was very flexible and open when it came time to pay our bill. We ended up paying in 2 currencies which was a very good way for us to use up our dirham.    Breakfast was served up on the roof terrace and was enormous with Moroccan pastries French pastries freshly squeezed orange juice a bowl of tangerines and Moroccan crepes.    It is a lovely place to stay- I would recommend it!

Riad Andalla,Mayank Agarwal wrote a review Feb 2016,30,"Near the Square & Friendly Staff, Budget place to stay in the Medina",This is the place to stay in Marrakech for a day or two but if you are in city for more days look at accommodation outside the Medina at GueIiz.    The Riad is in the Medina tucked away in the end of a narrow lane this keeps the noise away and you are still just 3 to 5 minutes walk away from the main square. The roof top has a decent view of the square the main tourist attractions of Marrakech are just 10 minutes walk away.    The basic rooms were small & bare the toilet was separated with just a curtain the bathroom accessories & towels provided were not of high quality. Initially was skeptical of the room but got use to it after the first day. One of the big plus of the room is the lighting they actually had bright lights all the other riads i had stayed at had only decor lights. By the way the doors have no lock first day we used our own padlock but on the advice of the management left it open for the next three days without any problem.    The breakfast was always good the quality & variety of breads was among the best we had in Morocco.    The staff were always friendly ready to help with advice in anyway they could. The only place i have booked at where we got emails from management before we arrived preparing us for our travel. Christophe the guy who speaks English in the Riadadvised us on a Spa & it was among the best massages i have ever had. Provided us with directions to the attractions & advice's on which ones to see. When i requested for a English guide arranged one at cheaper rates than others. Although to be frank the guide was among the most useless i have ever hired basic English & little knowledge. I hope Christophe reads this and avoids the particular guide in future.    I would recommend the Riad for a day or two as its located in the center of medina where you would end up spending those days anyways but know that the rooms are small & basic.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Tinsukia, India",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/703mayanka

The Riad is right off the Djema Al Fena square so you are in the heart of Marrakech in a prime location.    Rooms are small cosy and clean. The bedroom doors do not lock but it is safe to leave your belongings there I was there for 5 nights and did not once have a problem with belongings. Ask for a room with a window when you book.    Breakfasts are served on the roof and is wonderful. You overlook the square and can see the Atlas Mountains and Koutubia while enjoying a breakfast of fresh juice coffee fruit and bread/ pastries.    Yunus and Abdul Kader are wonderful managers always willing to help and offer advice. One morning I had overslept for my tour to the mountains Yunus came to knock on my door and asked the tour operator to pick up the other guests and return for me so that I wouldn't miss the tour.

Riad Andalla,josh-u_london wrote a review Feb 2016,50,A very pleasant stay,I must admit I was sceptical in staying at a RIAD I will probably incline towards a hotel experience but as my wife insisted on experiencing an authentic feel i reluctantly agreed. We stayed for 4 nights and to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed the stay the place is done beautifully and feels warm the rooms are clean has heating as most riads I read may not has a door to the bathroom you may laugh but a lot of Riads dont have doors on the bathroom. Its so close to the main square you just end up staying really late just soaking up the atmosphere not having to worry about a long walk back. The breakfast is nice on the roof not a super wide selection but ok. Noise from outside corridors may be problem in the morning but Riads are not meant to be sound proof and the shower pressure may be a little on the slow side.    You dont need to worry about dragging your luggage through the square either as an authorised taxi takes you pretty much right to the door steps.    Christophe and all the guys were so welcoming friendly and super helpful made my trip memorable even organised flowers and a personal card at my wifes request so I do thank them and look forward to visiting again soon.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josh-u_london

Location was great as its just a couple of minutes walk from the famous Jemaa El-Fnaa square. Christophe was very helpful with email correspondance even before arriving at the riad and while we were there he gave us lots of vital advice on places to visit and eat out he gave us a local map of the medina as well and showed us the routes to take so we dont get lost in the tiny streets and souks of the medina. Yunus the manager during the nights was very kind as well and gave us crockery and guided us to a nice cakeshop nearby so we could celebrate my birthday at midnight. Breakfasts on the roof top terrace were sumptuous with a spectacular views of Jemaa El-Fnaa and Abdul who used to serve the breakfast was so kind. Our room was very comfortable and we were allowed to leave our luggage after check out on the last day because our flight was at 8pm hence we had peace of mind to explore a bit more of Marrakech before coming back in the evening to collect our luggage. We would strongly recommend staying at Riad Andalla and would definitely come back again to stay on our next trip to Marrakech :),Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moon1s

Cons- nothing premium about the hotel we felt we overpaid for the rooms as we booked through one of the online website the rooms are old with no tv and hair dryer. Our room has no window for fresh air. Conclusion- No magic lamp in this old inn. A little tip- book directly with them and skip all online sites. That's what I call a good deal.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mun_akhtar
Riad Andalla,EstebanPrimero wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Best location, awesome service, caring owners",My wife and I recently stayed at Riad Andalla during the portion of our honeymoon in Marrakech. We arrived late at night due to a held up train but paid a few dirham to a local to help us find the riad. At first you'll probably need someone to show you where it is but as it is literally right off of the Djemma el F'na (the main square in the medina) once someone shows you the first time you'll easily find it again.    After some much needed rest in a beautifully blue-tiled room we awoke to an awesome breakfast of fresh squeezed orange juice coffee and breads/pasteries on the rooftop terrace. The view over the medina and the Djemma El Fna is second to none. The location is superb and allows you to easily access anything from restaurants souks cabs or anything else you may want to do in Marrakech.    Christophe the owner took time to give us a map and tell us about the medina and Marrakech in general. He gave us some good tips on what to see and do and even helped us set up a camel excursion for a very reasonable price. You can see that he has pride of ownership in his riad and he works with his staff to ensure customer service is excellent. Both of his employees Younes and Abdelkhader were kind and professional.    The riad itself has is excellently decorated and makes you feel very 'Moroccan'. Due to the location the pride of ownership the customer service and the views I would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Marrakech! Thanks to the team at Riad Andalla for our awesome stay!,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Moscow, Idaho",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EstebanPrimero
Riad Andalla,Ernesto M wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Best spot in Marrakesh with the best staff!!!,Unbeatable experience at the Riad Andalla. The rooms are comfortable clean and cozy. The location is excellent for getting to know the real Marrakesh. But above all the staff was extremely helpful kind and trustworthy. Definitely the best choice when visiting this city! Will be back!    When we arrived we were greeted by happy faces and were immediately made comfortable with some delicious mint tea at the reception. We were then showed to our rooms and advised where to go for the evening. During breakfast staff helped us plan our trip and even booked our tours to the Three Valleys and Essaouira both with a local company that took very good care of us at a very good price. For dinning they recommended the best places in town and made the reservations for us. They even helped us get around the market and gave us excellent advice to avoid getting ripped off by merchants. On the day of our departure they helped us clear a misunderstanding with our taxi company. When we arrived at the airport we noticed we had left our travel money behind and when we called the riad they helped us find it and sent it back to us!! (Thanks guys)    It is difficult selecting a hotel in Marrakesh and it can be stressful not being able to trust the people but with Andalla it was all good! Book it!    P.S. The food in the hotel is home-made make sure you dine there at least once!!!,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/663ernestom

Transport and other services at the Riad were exellent as well. Our room was the red one clean cosy and not very big no window but then we spent all day outdoors anyway.

Riad Andalla,John T wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Book it!,If you want a feel for life in the Medina Riad Andalla is the perfect choice. Reading the reviews below I see mentioned all the of good things we enjoyed. The great location right in the heart of things the beautiful and calm interior an oasis and the rooms each uniquely decorated with great taste and flair. The roof terrace is a dream floating above the square but somehow peaceful metres away less fortunate tourists haggle for seats on the much less pleasant cafe roof terraces. All of this at a very good value rate. But the best thing about Riad Andalla? Christophe and his crew with that rare mix of superb professionalism and genuine warmth. Abdul (the sweetest soul you could meet) presented us with a beautiful meal when we arrived probably the finest and most sumptuous we had in Marrakech. Christophe was never too far away and responded to our questions and requests with efficiency and good humour all of the staff provided excellent service but were never intrusive.    Riad Andalla is part of the Medina and this makes the trip to Marrakech a more complete travel experience. We met a few different travellers/tourists who were staying in the newer hotels outside the city walls. I guess they get keycards flatscreen TV and a minibar but they looked wistful when we told them where we were and most wished they had booked a Riad. They ought to have and they missed out. And which Riad to book?Riad Andalla of course!,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntX4935ES
Riad Andalla,Loskr wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Terrific Riad in Terrific Location,This Riad is right in the heart of Marrakech's medina just two minutes from the the main square Jemaa el Fna but is also incredibly tranquil and welcoming. Its best feature: a rooftop terrace overlooking the square where the owner Christophe and his excellent team serve up hearty breakfasts of pastries pancakes yoghurts and fresh fruit. The views here are fantastic. Service is attentive and friendly but never overbearing.  We ate one evening meal at the Riad. 20 euros a head more than in the restaurants and cafes around the square but far far better quality. The Riad staff served up fabulous fresh tagines and cous-cous in the tastefully decorated patio courtyard at the Riad's heart.  The Riad is up narrow alleys and would be hard (but not impossible) to find for the first time without a guide. We booked a ride from the airport with the Riad taking a lot of hassle out of the experience. This was 20 euros for four people and well worth the cost for peace of mind.  We stayed in an annex - a second Riad essentially - opposite the main base of the Andalla. Rooms were comfortable clean and had an authentic feel. There was no TV but why would you want to watch TV when you have Marrakech's ever entertaining main square on your doorstep?  Stairs were steep in both Andalla buildings. This I understand is typical of riads in the medina but anyone with children or anybody with mobility issues should take care.  Staff at Andalla were really helpful and welcomed us with mint tea and a really helpful orientation lesson in how to find your way around the medina and its fabulous sights. In short Andalla offered tremendous value and service for in our case 75 euros a night.,Date of stay: December 2015,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loskr
Riad Andalla,nzbrdly73 wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Outstanding service and establishment!,The only place to stay if you will be in Marrakech. Beautiful Riad with an amazing rooftop view of the main square that you can sit at in the evenings and enjoy the beautiful lights sights and sounds of the night market. They also serve breakfast on the roof to enjoy the morning sun and fresh air. It is located directly behind Cafe France on the corner of the main square and takes all but 3 minutes to get from the main square to the Riad. You will never be able to beat location of this Riad. The management is excellent as well. Christophe is AMAZING and takes the time to make sure that you have everything you need/want.    I would also like to personally note that should you choose to book excursions into the desert for camel trekking or ANYTHING else for that matter - Contact Christophe or the Riad and they can make all the arrangements for you. I made a HUGE mistake by booking my tours myself thru a company called Moroccan Nature Trail- and it was a COMPLETE nightmare! I chose that company because of the positive reviews it had on Trip Advisor- but it is NOTHING like they promise or describe. They are out to get your money while you get back VERY little for what you paid for. So book with Christophe at the Riad. I will do this next time I am back in Marrakech in April and will book my stay at this establishment again as well.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stuttgart, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzbrdly73
Riad Andalla,willmott4123 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,if in Marrakech you must stay here!,It was our first time in Marrakech and from the moment we arrived at the airport to the time we flew out again Christophe & his team made this a most memorable stay. The driver who collected us from the airport arranged by the Riad was so welcoming & friendly provided us with some local info & pointed out highlights during our trip into the Riad. When we set foot inside the Riad door it was like arriving home! We were greated with genuine smiles of happiness & made to feel immediately comfortable with a serving of delicious mint tea & biscuits. Never having experienced Riad style accommodation before we were not sure what to expect but definitely not disappointed. Our room was very comfortable & tastefully decorated. It was cleaned daily beds made & fresh towels... It's the small things that make your stay comfortable! The view from the terrace over the main square Drama el Fna was brilliant.. You could watch hear & enjoy all the happenings but be in a completely relaxed atmosphere! The terrace is also a fabulous social meeting place particularly at breakfast time to get chating to other travellers & hear their experiences. Christophe the owner makes each & every guest feel like part of his family. He provides excellent information on what to see and do where to eat & where to shop. He will arrange what ever type of tour/trip you want to do. For us it was a walking tour of the souks & a day trip out to the Atlas Mountains - both thoroughly enjoyable. I think what stands out the most about this accommodation is the team Christophe has selected to look after you during your stay. Lots of fun lots of laughs & nothing was ever a problem for them... Whether you wanted a tea or coffee on the terrace after a day out & about or an early morning pick up due to a flight change  they took care of everything & always happy to do so. A peaceful & tranquil place to stay with the added touch of wit & humour!

Rooms were clean tidy and nicely decorated and gave a great riad experience as they are based around an open atrium.

Riad Andalla,joopguy wrote a review Nov 2015,50,"A fanastically, brilliant break.",So - first time in Morocco. It's hard to find any Riad that has a below average rating in this city as it's always so busy. But I settled on Riad Andalla because of it's very close proximity to Djemma el-Fna square - thus giving me the capability to be fully immersed in all that Marrakesh had to offer for the 3 nights I was staying.    I loved the first impressions of Riad Andalla even before I arrived - all individually and tastefully decorated rooms which were all very different in their style.    Upon arrival I was warmly greeted even before I got to the door after the taxi the Riad had arranged kindly dropped me off close by. A pot of refreshing mint tea and some gorgeous small biscuits followed whilst I was given a welcome introduction some useful tips and some maps of the area - most useful and instant relaxation.    I was shown to my initial room which happened to be across the road at the Andalla Jdid part of the Riad. Unfortunately it was on the 3rd floor (roof) and up some very steep stairs. I wasn't comfortable being totally exposed on the roof so I immediately asked to be moved to another room.    That wasn't a problem - other rooms were available so I got the white and blue room (Kamar) on the 2nd floor of the main Riad for 2 nights followed by the room next to it for the last night - no hassle at all.    The breakfast on the room terrace was lovely (and so was the roof terrace even when breakfast wasn't being served) Great views of the Atlas Mountains Djemma el-Fna square and the Koutoubia Mosque. Not forgetting being able to soak up all the sounds from the calls to prayer drumming from the snake charmers and the hustle and bustle of it's business. Yet somehow you still notice the peace the roof terrace affords you - even at such close proximity. The breakfast changes every day. Sometimes it's a bit -bready' but not always.    Although Christophe was away Younes and the crew took great care of me - you are made to feel as though you are their only guest whether they are busy or not. there is no hustle or shouting or fuss in the Riad everyone communicates and it runs like clockwork. No disturbances nothing. Tea coffee can be provided any time of the day/evening for a small charge.    Riad Andalla also arranged for a guide at my request who guided me around the Medina and the main attractions for 7 hours on my 2nd day - another sign of their helpfulness before you even arrive.    In short - I am definitely coming back to Marrakesh - and I am definitely staying here again. It was absolutely one of my best city breaks the memories of Marrakesh and Riad Andalla will stay with me for a long time for all the right reasons.

Riad Andalla,Alina_Elia wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Central location and 5* customer care,Riad Andalla was the first Riad we stayed at and we had no idea what to expect. We have booked the taxi from the airport as Christoph suggested and this proved out to be a very good idea. Due to the huge ques at the passport control at the airport it took about 15 hours to get out. Despite all this our taxi was there waiting for us. We have initially reserved the small room at the ground floor but after the first night we have received a free upgrade. The breakfast on the terrace was also very good and every time we needed to leave earlier we were offered the breakfast at the time we needed to leave - even at 6.30 am instead of 8 am!  Christoph and his team took their time to help us organize our visit no only through Marrakech but even our whole tour in Morocco. We booked the 2 nights-3 days desert tour recommended by them and we had a very nice experience. We would definitely recommend it.  They also made restaurant reservations for us and bought the train and bus tickets that we needed - just like a 5* concierge.

Riad Andalla,DJShabz wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Great Riad with Moroccan culture,Why come to Marrakech? My wife and I decided it's to experience some Moroccan culture hence staying in a Riad as opposed to a typical hotel. With well over 1000 Riads across Marrakech it was hard to choose one especially to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. After so many excellent reviews on the Riad Andalla we are glad we made this choice.    Christophe and his team made my wife and I feel so welcome by organising airport transfers advising us on the tours they provided and recommendations for restaurants and spas.    The staff are all very warm and full of smiles and part of the fun was communicating in French and Arabic.    The Riad is well decorated with a homely design and authentic feel a lot of detail in a small space. Again another taste of culture we wanted from the mosaic tiles wooden window shutters the random artwork on the walls to the light shades and candle holders.    Our bed was nice and firm with clean sheets and towels daily. The rooms are basic with no TV and the wifi varies depending where you are in the Riad but we didn't come to Marrakech to watch TV or sit on our phones all day. The en suite shower/ toilet was always cleaned and the AC unit worked well.    Being ideally situated just off the main square it was away from the majority of the noise but you could still hear the snake charmers and the drummers from the square which went on most of the day not too much off an issue if you are out exploring as we were. Our daily 5am alarm came in the form of the first prayer of the day being so close to several mosques it was surprising at first. However we felt this added to the charm of the Riad and encompassed the cultural experience we were searching for. The sounds soon fade into the background. This also meant from the roof terrace you get an excellent view of Jemaa El Fna square especially at night enjoying a nice Moroccan tea. You can also catch the Atlas Mountains in the horizon too.    We had also prearranged for an evening meal before we had arrived where we shared a freshly prepared chicken and vegetable tagine over candlelight which was fantastic.    To conclude a lovely stay in a charming Riad with its quirky and wonderful staff it ticked all the boxes we were looking for on our trip to Marrakech. All the small personal touches made a big difference and If this is the style of holiday you are looking for I would highly recommend it.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJShabz
Riad Andalla,Martina Gandolfi wrote a review Oct 2015,50,THE PERFECT PLACE AT THE PERFECT TIME WITH THE PERFECT HOSPITALITY WELCOMING.,Willing to try the real Moroccan experience my friend and I decided to spend our two nights in Marrakech at this typical Riad.  As agreed by e-mail with Christophe a private taxi driver was waiting for us at the airport and with a warm smile he welcomed us to the city. He walked us to the Riad where Christophe and Abdelkader were waiting for us. The entrance of the Riad has revealed itself as a great surprise leaving us fascinated by the clear differences and peculiarities of the Moroccan culture. Impressed by the thousands details and objects in the hall we immediately felt like home. While waiting for our room we were offered to take a sit on the terrace and rizlan and rchida prepared a hot and intense mint tea for us accompanied by some crepes with butter and honey. All of a sudden Abdelkader showed up with a map of the city showing us all the interesting attractions and the typical experiences he strongly suggested to embark during our trip. We really appreciated the truly warmness of Moroccan hospitality and we shared with passion our desires and opinion.  As soon as the room was ready we took a decision about the places we wanted to go to and Christophe took care of all the reservations.  They recommended to try a Moroccan restaurant with local belly dance shows and music (dar essalam) and a wonderful and cheap hammam + massage center (Isis). Every time we came back at night younes greeted us with a friendly smile and asked us about our day. Such a pleasure to share and interact with the people of the Riad such a great feeling of comfort and ease.

Riad Andalla,travguy wrote a review Oct 2015,40,The bottom line,This property has had so many excellent reviews that I nearly did not bother to post but I think maybe a little more information about the property rather than the hospitality might help.  At first I was really concerned about the location - we arrived quite late and I felt somewhat inhibited about having to go down deserted alleys to get to the property but in fairness while we were there I had no concerns about security anywhere around the square.  Effectively this is a B&B with an evening meal option.  Unlike an hotel there are no 'extras' in the rooms ie no tv telephone hairdryer bath robes and only soap and a sachet of shampoo. As is traditional with a riad there are few external windows with most of the windows in the rooms overlooking the central court. There is however effective aircon. There is outside sitting space on the rooftop terrace. The accommodation is spread over 2 buildings with the 'annex' being across the alleyway - the wifi is not as good in this building.  I cannot improve on the favourable comments made elsewhere about the service ambiance and cleanliness.  If you are looking for a riad close to the real action this property would be excellent value and hard to beat.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leatherhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travguy

The Riad has a central location which is great for suoks and restaurants in the old city of Medina. Perfect place to get around and enjoy yourself and do your tours. Even enjoyed bartering in the end.    I recommend that you book a cab from the airport to the Riad. They will take you to the door in a bustling.

Riad Andalla,MrKSM wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A true Hidden Gem... What a Find!!,I Booked this Riad (a hotel in a traditional Moroccan Building) as i wanted somewhere near to the Magical Jemaa El fna and you honestly cant get any closer without being in the square itself!    I have truly unearthed a hidden gem which is very very good value for money. The Riad is a very short and safe walk from Jemaa El Fna. You are welcomed by the ever so nice and accommodating staff and nothing is too much for them.    The Riad itself is very well kept and the rooms very traditional Moroccan beats any standard hotel all day long. You truly do feel like you are in another world. The room was well equipped with a nice power showera/c and a great wifi signal.. that is all you need.    Breakfast on the terrace with a view of the square is priceless... and in the evening you can enjoy a lovingly prepared meal with the square lit up and its just magical.    The staff will bend over backwards for you and the owner Christophe is the Host with the most. He ever let me keep my luggage there after i had checked out and gave me a room to freshen up in before my late night flight.    He arranged door to door transfer from and to the airport for a very reasonable price and it was well worth it.    I have nothing bad I can say about my whole experience apart from the fact I had to leave...

The location was perfect the breakfasts were amazing the staff were friendly Christophe himself was especially helpful and a font of knowledge. The Riad itself was clean with a lovely and welcoming and homeley interior. As other have said - no lock on your door (a bolt from inside) but a small padlock would work. We never bothered and never felt unsafe.    I would advise anyone in Marrakech to stay at Andalla,Date of stay: September 2015,,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207steveni
Riad Andalla,Holiday_dek wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Beautiful riad,Chose this after reading all the reviews and decided to stay our 2 nights here! Hosts Christophe and Abdulla (hope i spelt it correctly) were very welcoming! And Abdulla was great at explaining the local area and activities- so good in fact we signed up to the 2 day desert trip there and then (something I wouldn't necessarily advise doing - it was a fab trip but see my review of Imzi tours for details)  We actually didn't stay in the Andalla but a riad just opposite which was very nice clean but had a terrible sewage smell emanating from the bathroom. After a few mind you got used to it but it wasn't nice.  On returning from our desert trip we stayed here again because it was convenient but we did ask to stay at Andalla which they accommodated. The room was fab and we enjoyed staying here much more than the apartment opposite.    Breakfasts were great! And the view from the roof terrace was beautiful!    It worked out a little more expensive than we anticipated with the 5% fee added for card payments...which we thought was excessive considering other riads we stayed at didn't.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holiday_dek
Riad Andalla,Eric C wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Best location in the Medina!,Excellent riad located right around the corner from the Jemaa el-Fnaa the rooftop terrace even overlooks part of the square. The room was small but comfy and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Abdullah helped sort out lost luggage with several calls to the airport and the owner Christophe called our desert tour to make sure they knew where to pick us up. We loved being so close to the big square with all its action at night and we weren't far (within walking distance) from the souks palaces and other landmarks of the medina. One small note the door to our room didn't have a lock (many riads are like this) but we were able to secure the door with a small baggage lock. It probably wasn't necessary to even lock the door we had no qualms about the staff it's just one of those things that makes you more comfortable. Beer and wine are available upon request (a pleasant surprise as alcohol can be hard to find in Morocco).

Riad has a perfect location with views from some rooms on main square and the roof terrace was a great extra. They serve breakfast on rooftop and you can have any meal there or just take a book order a beer or wine and have a time chilling in Morocco style sofas with umrbrellas. Nearly fell a sleep there for couple of times :)    Its location felt very safe and in short walking distance from main sites in medina. Rooms were clean well decorated and comfy.

Firstly the rooms were very clean and comfortable with excellent air conditioning I travelled with 2 other friends and we all had a good nights sleep here. Worth mentioning is the excellent roof terrace with views right over jemaa el fna which at night lights up the whole area. Lastly but most importantly are the staff who were absolutely great and made us feel so welcome that after we left to visit essaouira we decided to stay there again when we returned to Marrakesh a few days later.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7894URtomt

Riad Andalla,Camille M wrote a review Jul 2015,50,"Gorgeous, charming, beautiful rooms",I must confess after following our friend through the main square in Marrakech and asking for directions then being led through narrow winding walkways I had my doubts about the cleanliness and upkeep of our restaurant. However as soon as we stepped through the door my reservations fell away. The place was beautiful with a fountain in the middle of the lobby and couches with cushions. While we filled out our customs report the guy who checked us in brought us Moroccan mint tea and cookies–despite it being Ramadan. Our rooms were along the sides of the building and there was an open area in the middle that opened up to the sky. The rooms themselves were delightful clean and cozy not to mention beautiful. There was a rooftop area with tables and chairs that looked out onto the market where we had our included (and delicious) breakfast. The hotel staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the area giving recommendations for outings and eateries. The place they recommended for dinner was phenomenal and they even called ahead for us and placed a recommendation. A delightful charming experience.

As we arrived at the Riad we were kindly welcomed with a tray of freshly made Moroccan tea and a sit down with a staff member to tell us about the city things to do and answer any questions we had. Our room was absolutely amazing and beautiful. We were on the fourth floor the only room on this floor with a terrace which was practicaly ours. We spent hours on the roof enjoying the night breeze and sky on the couches. Breakfast served daily on the terrace whic overlooked the main square and Mosque. Absolulety beautiful view. One night we had a romantic dinner on the roof with delicious traditional moroccan cuisine and wine. Staff washed dirty laundry i had overnight at no charge. 100M from the main square food and shopping but completely cut off from the busy streets and sounds!

Riad Andalla,Gregg-Brussels wrote a review Jun 2015,50,"Still looking for the downside... Dont hesitate, go there!",My friends booked 2 rooms at the riad for my bachelor party.    We arrived very early with first flight from Paris. It really looked like the owner was waiting for us. Warm welcome a place to drop our luggage a few explanations on the house and hop direction the roof top for an unexpected breakfast.    The staff is great very helpful and friendly... Treat them well and you will feel like a king in the riad. They are really exceptional.    The rooms are cosy clean ( the ones at ground level slightly fresher yet all very comfortable and with effective air co so dont worry about the heat outside). We had booked 2 rooms but got a third one because there were tall guys in our group. That's the style of the house...    The restaurant is very very good (make sure to ask the veggie tagine and the morrocan salds). Actually the best food we had in the city. Make sure to book first thing in the morning as Abdel is going to the market fordinner in the morning and buys fresh products only in the right quantity (to ensure fresh products every day).    Did I mention already the terrass provides a unique view on the famous placej ama efna (sorry bad spelling)?

Both were truly perfect. Abundant breakfast on the roof (!) and a 2 minutes walk from the main square of the Medina and a step from all the little Medina roads to get to the Riad.

Riad Andalla,Anna A wrote a review May 2015,50,Lovely Riad with fantastic roof terrace,We arrived very late in the city and Christophe the owner had arranged for a taxi to pick us up. Upon getting here we did not have any local currency and Andre joint owner of the Riad gave us some local currency for our dinner and recommended a restaurant close by.    The next day Christophe talked us through how to stay safe on the streets and which areas to avoid at night. He also recommended various restaurants that we tried. Pepe Nero being the best!! Him and his lovely staff made us feel at home throughout our 7 day trip. We even enjoyed the roof terrace on the last day after we checked out.    Our room was the largest in the Riad with a good size bed. The room and the bath was very clean. The only downside of the room was that there was no window but we spent majority of our time on the roof overlooking the square. The breakfast was served promptly with fresh orange juice.    The location is great and 1 minute walk to the square and not far from the souks. We would stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832AnnaA832

Christophe your staff are a credit to you Abdul thank you for your help with directions bookings and where to shop. Thank you Christophe for arranging your driver to take us safely and in comfort an excellent journey up and over the Atlas Mountains to Ait Ben Hiddou and beyond. Breakfast was prompt fresh and nothing seemed too much trouble lovely sat on the terrace looking out across Marrakech the view across the square at night from the terrace is amazing.

We really enjoyed ourselves at Riad Andalla. The location is perfect: close to the Jemaa el- Fna Square and the souks. The service is also great: we feel at home.

Riad Andalla,Suzanne P wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Marrakech experience,A wonderful 4day break. All the arrangements pick up from airport trip to Ourika valley restaurant bookings directions to local attractions all ran smoothly thanks to the wonderful Christophe! A host with the most charming and courteous manner. This was also true of all staff who made our trip one of the best. Our triple room was delightful decorated in Moroccan style with an en-suite . The roof top terrace was wonderful allowing us to breakfast as the Jamma el Fna came to life and dine to the drums snake charmers and vibrancy of the square at night. Visitors would just need to be aware that the morning call to prayer takes a little getting use to and the stairs are quite steep but with suitable hand rails. Stepping in from the street really is entering an oasis of charm.

Riad Andalla,hannahm233 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Wonderful Riad and amazing staff,Riad Andalla is ideally located next to the Jamaa el Fna but is always quiet despite its close proximity to the square. It is beautifully decorated and looks distinctly more Moroccan than some other Riads. The rooms are great and breakfast was always delicious but what makes this Riad particularly special was the staff. Cristophe was so helpful helping us book a three day trip to the desert as well as a trip to Essaouira including booking a great hotel there for us. Nothing was too much trouble and he even took us to the coach ticket office because he thought it was quite hard to find. Having stayed in two other very nice riads in Marrakech I still feel that this is the best.

Riad Andalla,RachelJepps wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Fantastic Staff!,"Situated on the edge of Jamaa el Fna Riad Andalla is ideal if you enjoy being amongst the hussle and bussle of the market  souks and street life. The rooms are very comfortable and decorated in traditional Moroccan style with super king size beds and en suite bathrooms however what makes this place really stand out is the incredible staff all of whom speak French English and Arabic. Christophe is a super star host and will take the time to explain the high lights of Marrakech how to negotiate the market sellers and do's and don't of Moroccan culture. The staff are more than happy to make bookings and organise trips and take care of tipping porters and drivers on your behalf (included in the price). Christophe and his family truly enjoy their jobs and shine as ""people persons"" who enjoy helping and socialising with their guests. All have a great sense of humour too and it was very reassuring to have someone so happy to go to for advice or help when surrounded by a completely foreign culture.",Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelJepps
Riad Andalla,Glaswegians12 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,visit to marrakech,I would like to say thank you to Cristophe and his staff for making us so welcome. We stayed for 4 nights and were made to feel very much at home. From the guys serving and preparing our food to the girls who tidied the rooms we could not fault a thing. We were celebrating my sister's 60th birthday and she had the best time with advice from Cristophe this helped us immensely. The Riad is only a couple of minutes from the square - no chance of getting lost! The terrace has a lovely view over the square one way and the other to the snowy Atlas mountains. There is a great atmosphere on the terrace you can hear the music and drums from the square but once in your room it is quiet and peaceful - except when there is a call to prayer - but you soon get used to that. Air con was a great help. And bed was comfortable. Wi-Fi everywhere in the Riad - unbelievable! We ate here a couple of nights - food was excellent - love the crockery!  We would thoroughly recommend this Riad - try not to be temped to stay outside in one of the grander hotels - we tried and were bitterly disappointed!  One thing I would say is that if you take the trip to Ourika valley - be prepared for a climbing expedition! wear sensible shoes and make sure you are reasonably fit - it was hard work - but worth it for the views and the sense of achievement!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glaswegians12
Riad Andalla,Rosa F wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Nice Riad made perfect by staff,The location is absolutely perfect. A minute away from the square. The staff is amazing. We were travelling with our one-year-old son and they were all super kind with him and really helpful with us and everything we might need. We booked the airport transfer with them and they sent a car with a chair for the baby even though I had forgotten to ask for one. They also had a high chair and a crib for him. Breakfast was always nice (the bread was delicious) we had dinner twice at the Riad and it was also pretty good although you can find a few cheaper places really close at the square (Christophe will recommend you a few).  As a downside They should invest in bigger better towels. We had only three sometimes four middle sized towels for two adults and a baby. Also the crib needs a better mattress. The one it had was super thin and uncomfortable. I used the blankets they gave us (didn't need them in this time of the year) and folded them to put them under the sheets and the baby turned out to sleep pretty comfortably.  All in all it was a good stay made perfect by the quality of all the people working there.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Caceres, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9176RIrosaf

Riad Andalla,Julio C wrote a review Mar 2015,50,PFFFFFT!! Simply The Best!!!,"First let me say I was traveling with my two girls (16&22) and this was our last stop after three other Riads desert stays and nearly 2500kms of driving. Never did we feel unsafe or more welcomed then in all of Morocco and for sure Riad Andalla. It was in Marakesh that we finally understood the term ""welcome"". In the west we use the term in response to thank you. We finally understand that in Morocco this has a second and primary meaning of welcoming you to try and to experience Moroccan hospitality. This was for certain the case with Marakesh and Riad Andalla.    Christophe the owner and his ""family"" staff were spectacular.    This is a lovely Riad with terraces overlooking the main market and souks and with the Atlas Mountains as a backdrop for morning breakfast. It does not get better.    Each day's breakfast was better than the last and left you wanting for nothing to start your day walking through the thousands of shops and artisan manufacturers.    Christophe provided great recommendations for places to venture with personal guidance for restaurants and spas and even took this guy direct to the spa on the back of his moped when he realized I may be late. No one can beat this type of service.    The rest of the staff were very accommodating and always friendly.    Let me suggest little tips to make your journey easier.    First if you are driving yourself as we did you cannot drive up to the Riad. Don't even try. The best parking and completely safe is the 24 / 24 parking associated with the Koutoubia mosque in the medina. Look for the blue P parking sign that also says 24/24. Once parked walk through the mosque gardens through the main gate into the medina main square then follow Christophe's email instruction to the Riad. It's very simple with one notable exception. What many people in the west would call an alley or laneway are called streets. So keep Cafe France on your right then right at the first street alley right again right again right again and a left to the end.    Second tip. In the medina area and shops walk with a sense of direction even if your lost which is just part of the experience and learn to be firmer than usual about ""No thank you"". It's completely safe and to the point where my daughters went shopping on their own but you have to be firm about where you are going and when you don't want help or about buy anything. It's really that simple. Be firm but pleasant and most times some form of joke is the worst you'll get in response. Oh and download triposo or streets from tripadvisor. Big time works inside the markets all over Morocco.    This Riad was fun perfectly located and would repeat it in a heart beat if we went back to Marakesh. Enjoy.

Riad Andalla,am_mazzieri wrote a review Mar 2015,50,"Amazing place, maroccan experience par excellence!",Riad Andalla is located just behind the vibrant square Jeema El Fna in the Medina but very easy to find once you have been shown the route however I strongly advice to ask the owner of the Riad Christophe to organise transport from and to the airport their drivers are very reliable and I doubt we would have found the entrance on our own.  Although the Riad is adjacent to the busy square once inside the door it becomes a oasis of calm and relaxation. The tastefully decorated interiors and the characteristic layout of the Riad gave us that authenticity feel we were looking for. We undoubtedly felt we were in Marrakech. Breakfast is served on the fabulous terrace which look over the Square and from where you can admire the snowcapped atlas peaks Breakfast is a delicious mix of speciality breads and pancakes served with Jams fresh fruits and yogourts. What really made our stay special was the staff. All of the staff lead by Christophe made us feel at home. They remembered our names what we liked and adviced us accordingly. Service was flawless.

The interior is cosy and beautifully decorated with the ambiance of a typical moroccan house. Clean bright and fresh everywhere.The roof terrace is definitely a strong point of this riad - large comfortable seats and amazing views 24h a day.  Christophe made us feel welcomed and provided us with a map of the city some advice and recommendations for local reastaurants which turned out to be very nice.

Riad Andalla,centaur90 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,An absolutely briliant Riad!!!!!,Being an avid globetrotter I have visited well over 50 countries and stayed in a plethora of hotels hostels and guesthouses. Riad Andalla would unquestionably feature in the top 3 places I have stayed it. Words cannot truly describe the unforgettable experience we had at the Riad!  We were picked up promptly from the airport and taken to the Riad. We were given an extremely warm welcome at the door by Younnes who took our luggage and offered refreshments. He advised that Cristophe would be with us shortly to go through with the finer details of things.  Cristophe arrived in due course and advised us we had booked the cheapest room in the Riad however as the Riad was fairly quite he would upgrade us to a larger room at no extra charge. He then sat down with us and advised on a schedule of activities.  Cristophe along with Younnes are the best of hosts. Both have a uniquely innate ability of making you feel welcomed and at home. They are always available and on hand to help and any request is never too big for them. We were given significant advice on every aspect of our itinerary from places to visit to how much taxi fares should cost. Between them they must have spent 3-4 hours going over travel plans with us.  We arrived in the evening and wanted to go straight out. As we had no dirhams Cristophe gave us 400dhs to spend which we could then give back once we had exchanged our money. He told us which place would give us the best exchange rate. This kind of hospitality you don’t find in any other place. Normally the hotel exchange your money at a poor rate!  The Riad itself has a homely feel to it. The ladies Atika and co are always happy to help and have a smile regardless of the time of day. At night Younnes is the main man. He makes sure everyone is in at night and is always up for a little banter.  The hotel is perfectly placed and is literally a stone’s throw from Djemaa-el-Fna. From the roof terrace you have a clear view of the square the Koutoubia mosque and a beautiful backdrop displaying the snow-topped Atlas Mountains. Wifi is free and is available throughout the Riad with good connectivity speeds.  I will definitely be returning to this place again in the future! I cannot recommend the Riad and the staff highly enough.

We were spending our last night much closer to the Medinah in Riad Andalla. Greeted instantly by the two owners Christophe and Andre we instantly felt at home. We were sent up to the roof to enjoy some mint tea (the best I had in Morocco) on the roof and instructed that Christophe would be up to explain a bit about the area.  What a gentleman Christophe explained everything from how much things should and shouldn't cost how much to pay for taxi rides so we weren't ripped off and other vitally useful info such as where to eat.  The room was fantastic very traditional with all of the collars you would expect to see in Morocco. Very safe very friendly atmosphere and the staff couldn't do enough for you!  At night Younis comes to the Riad. The key guy when Christophe and Andre aren't around Younis will stay awake at night until everyone is back into the road as he has to answer the door he then is up to serve you a brilliant breakfast!  One night isn't really enough and we are already planning our next trip to see the guys!  A real nice touch is Christophe and Andre ask you to send a photo to them so they can put it up on their wall in the office. They really appreciate everyone who stays and to them it really is about welcoming people into their home.

Christopher is a great hosts who tries to share like a friend his love for this city and his experiences about this country. Follow all his suggestions and you will discover nice city views and you will eat great local food. The location is unbeatable just on top of the main square where everything goes on from sunrise until midnight. You can spend hours on their terraces looking at the square life and contemplating the city roofs the Koutoubia the Atlas mountains and the panorama. Every hour is different. The riad is very well furnished pleasantly warm in winter (not all riads are well heated) and with several comfortable corners tables couches and nice details.  I stayed 3 nights in Suite Bachahamou and 1 night in room Kamar and I found them bigger than in pictures. You can find more luxurious riads in town but no one will give the same atmosphere and for sure will not offer the same terrace city view.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bologna, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alenaca
Riad Andalla,Bktz wrote a review Jan 2015,50,A jewel in a jewel,It was my first time in Marrakesh and I have been astonished by the spectacular colors the sounds the tastes and the great atmosphere of the town. The Riad Andalla is a jewel in a jewel an intimate hideaway right in the heart of the town. The terrace offerers a terrific view of the town and the Jemaa el Fna. It is a perfect spot for morning breakfasts or lazy afternoons over Marrakesh roofs. The rest of the house has a great and romantic atmosphere with its colored and warm rooms has been definitely our moroccan home. Last (but not least) the owner is a perfect host. Always enthusiastic and friendly (as his gentle staff) helped us with tips recommendations and reservations for hammams and restaurants. We also enjoyed a real home-made moroccan dinner (upon request). Amazing.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rome, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bktz

The welcome was perfect including mint tea Christoph can not be a better host apart from his friendly attitude he gave us the best recomendations to visit eat and hammam.    The Riad is really nice authentic super clean and the staff really nice.    The rooms are a ok nice decoration enough for resting although a door in the bathroom instead of a courtain would have been nice...but it is Morroco style.    The terrace is beautifull and having breakfast every morning there is a great way of starting the day. some tea in the afternoon is really nice to to watch the mountains and the fna.

Overlooking the Djemma-al-Fna square and the Koutoubia Mosque situated between the souks to the north and the palaces to the south this is a great choice. Christophe and his friendly team are there to help whenever needed and provide a great breakfast full of Moroccan breads fruit and orange juice- served overlooking the square on the terrace. The riad itself is beautiful inside with lovely decorations and many places to relax comfortably both inside and outside on the lovely terrace.

Riad Andalla,kirsten wrote a review Nov 2014,50,"Amazing riad, excellent location, brilliant staff",When looking for a riad in marrakech you are spoilt for choice. The most important criteria is location charm and a friendly atmosphere. Riad Andalla has it all. We stayed for 3 nights and it was such a pleasure. Every time you step inside you get a warm greeting from Christophe or one of his staff the place is clean colourful safe with an awesome rooftop deck overlooking the Djemaa El Fna and the location rivals any riad in the medina. Nothing was too much trouble for Christophe who phoned around to make hamman and restaurant bookings to satisfy 4 demanding women and a Luuuuuucky man!

Riad Andalla,FalkovonAmeln wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Best place to be close to the action,I spent 5 nights at this excellent Riad after some other places left me always somewhat discontent. Of course the main point is the incredible location: From the roof terrace you have a bird´s eye view on Djemaa-el-Fna the Medina and the snow-capped High Atlas. Other people have to queue up in order to get a seat at some of the (mostly mediocre) restaurants facing the square - here you can have it anytime you like. Dinner at Riad Andalla is home-cooked by the invariably friendly staff you pay a bit more than at the tourist restaurants but the quality is beyond compare. We had a sumptuous vegetarian couscous (yummie...). Christophe and Andre are very helpful for all sorts of questions and tips. The rooms are bit smallish (like in other Riads it´s a historic building after all) but very good value for the price.

Riad Andalla,Mike K wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Perfect,"Having stayed in Marrakech before and fallen in love with the city as a couple we were keen to introduce our parents and my daughter to the delights of the city. We wanted to stay in the Medina in a traditional house and the Riad Andalla proved to be the perfect place. We booked based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews we had read on Tripadviser. Seven of us arrived at the door of the Riad Andalla and we were treated as honoured guests from the moment entered the courtyard. Christophe told us that we were to treat the riad as if we were staying in his home and the whole atmosphere created by Christophe Andre and his friendly team made us feel like we ""part of the family"".    The rooms are compact but beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The beds are comfortable and having air conditioning was a boon given the heat we encountered. The roof terrace is comfortable and stylishly furnished and offered fantastic views of the Jemaa El Fna square. Watching sunset behind the Koutoubia Mosque was a particular highlight.    Breakfast is traditional and delicious and the dinner we ate on the roof on our final night at Riad Andalla was exquisite.

Each room is unique comfortable and self-contained. The terrace is an oasis ideal for soaking up the sun or watching the awakening face of the city over breakfast. Nothing is too much for Christophe whether it be advice on the best place to have a henna tattoo the best exchange rate how to get to a particular attraction or arranging a farewell dinner on the terrace.

We had an amazing cake arrive at pepe nero to surprise the GF for her birthday thanks to his quiet word with the owner!    The Riad itself is in an excellent location I recommend the airport transfer for peace of mind as although the Riad 2 mins from the main square in the medina like most of marrakech you need to wind down a couple of side streets to get to it so the first time it would be tricky to find on foot.    Everything else was great comfortable bed clean rooms aircon wifi + large breakfast each day.    If you are looking for a few days to hit up the sites and souks this is perfect.

Christophe and Abdul were helpful in all our arrangements and I would definitely stay here again as it is perfect and convenient for Marrakech touring. Breakfast is typical for Morocco which is French style. Just pastry and cafe/teajuice. It was this was in all the places we stayed. You would need to ask if you want some fruit.

This is my family (from US) first trip to Africa and we stayed in 9 different Riad/hotel during our 15 day trip. This Riad definitely rose to the top for its superior service and hospitality. When we first arrived Christophe left a note/map for us when he was out with expecting our arrival. During the course our two day stay Christophe and his staff were extremely warm friendly and helpful on giving various suggestions regard to where to visit and eat. We were almost at the end of our trip and run out of clean clothes. Christophe’s staff offered to wash the clothes for us. The clothes were returned nicely folded and I was told the wash service was free - which is totally surprised while we're asked/expected to give service fees for almost everything during our Morocco trip. On the last morning my children wanted to do the last minute shopping before leaving so had to skip the breakfast. Christophe had his staff to wrap the breakfast for my children to eat on the road. The Riad's location is also great right next to Jemaa El Fna. From rooftop terrace you can see all the actions from the square while distancing enough to be away from the noise. The Riad was kept extremely clean and decorated nice even the rooms are small.    This is my first Tripadvisor review. I just feel the obligation to write a review for this top notch service Riad. I would highly recommend it to anybody visiting Marrakesh wanting to stay in a convenient location in the Medina and seeking for a superior Riad service.

They all remembered me from previous trips and made me feel so welcome it really felt like arriving home. Such genuinely nice people.  Considering I hadn't booked I was very lucky to get a room - I strongly advise booking as I can imagine they could easily be full with returning clients. This clearly speaks volumes.  You could search the web for hours but I'm positive you will not find better value for money (location decor terrace owners and staff - just totally lovely people). The riad is just the right size not too big that it's impersonal and not too small that you become a feature. The price is very competitive too and don't forget you can be served beer and wine if you want a total luxury in Morocco! The owners will be only too happy to help you achieve what you want from your stay with a wealth of knowledge and good sound advice. They can recommend and book trips restaurants places to visit etc and you can be sure they are not on a commission they just have your interest at heart.  This was my fourth visit and I really can't imagine staying anywhere else in Marrakech. The location is perfect just 2 minutes from the main square easy to find in a safe neighbourhood. The roof terrace has views over the main square with sofas and tables several areas so there's always space. The ground floor patio is also a pleasant tranquil area with fountain sofas and tables along with a more secluded sitting room. You can always find a corner if want a quiet moment. All the rooms are individual and really nicely decorated spotlessly clean with comfy beds with quality bedding. The place is silent at night so a good sleep is guaranteed.  Owners Christoph and Andre have poured their hearts and soles into this place and it shows. They clearly care about their guests and the riad as each time I return I notice new touches more art work new decorations and fittings new bedding etc. constantly updating and keeping the place in top condition. They are obviously not after making a fast buck but more interested in providing a quality stay for their guests.  Having travelled all over Morocco with a mixed bag of experiences arriving at Riad Andalla for me is a guaranteed pleasure - you'll always be well looked after safe and secure amongst genuinely lovely people.  Don't hesitate just book it.

Riad Andalla,kathywood wrote a review May 2014,50,Fabulous hidden gem,After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I booked the Riad Andalla for our stay in Marrakesh with my cousin. What a fabulous hidden gem and lived up to the fantastic reviews already put on trip advisor. You could not want a better place to stay and so close to the famous Djemma el Fna square (2 mins away - tucked down two small alleyways off the main walkway). You can see the square fully from the beautiful roof garden where we were welcomed with mint tea and biscuits. Christophe (the owner) made us feel very welcome and gave us good advice regarding places to eat etc. Its such a beautiful clean little riad with some gorgeous decorations and our room was very Moroccan comfortable - with air conditioning and en suite facilities. We eat in one of Christophe's recommended restaurants just on the square and the food was good and cheap. Breakfast was served on the roof garden - hot bread pancakes jams fresh orange juice tea etc. We found the staff very helpful. Marvellous place great price and highly recommended to everyone who wishes to visit Marrakesh.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Essex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathywood

Christophe and his staff are very kind friendly and ready to give you all the indications you need. We had a wonderful dinner on the terrace the evening of our arrival with a magnificient view of the Jamaa at the sunset.

Riad Andalla,Stuart C wrote a review May 2014,50,Super place to stay,Excellent location just off the Djemma el Fna although if you haven't checked their website beforehand you might find it tricky to find the exact lane to go down to find it. Once there we were warmly greeted by the owner who quickly showed us to our lovely air conditioned room. Do book the dinner there (20€ per person) if you do go as they serve up some wonderful local cuisine which is just divine. We were even treated to this up on the open balcony overlooking the Djemma in full atmospherical swing which was only amazing. Despite it being located so close to the markets the Riad is nice and quiet and has a very relaxed environment and the staff ensure they do everything they can to help you enjoy your stay.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80StuartC

After staying in Riad Andalla in 2011 the first thing I did was email Christophe and Andre to check availability... as wouldn't want to stay anywhere else! Apart from the fact the location is second to none you just feel so welcome the moment you arrive. I think one of my favourite places in the world is their terrace on a warm evening over-looking the hustle and bustle of Jamaa el Fna.

I had recommended the riad to my friends and all enjoyed it very much!  During this trip I had as well a business event with 57 people I had to organize the business dinners Andre had recommended 2 restaurants Pepe Nero and Dar Essalam and both were a great success.  Christophe arranged as well all the taxi transfers for the 57 seminar participants and the mini bus transfers for a trip to the Ourika Valley (we had booked a 1/2 day tour for 13 people with lunch at the Restaurant Au Bord de l'Eau).

Riad Andalla,Pbeatts wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Friendly Haven in a Chaotic City,My friend and I stayed here in February for 3 nights. Christophe was sooo helpful full of tips do's and dont's offerings of tours palces to go and things to do where to eat and where to drink (and that's no easy feat in this non-drinking City). The Riad itself is a welcome greeting after being amongst the hustle and bustle of this enigmatic City it provides a tranquil and calming influence and this is definitley needed to help relax and unwind. Whilst the proximity to the Square is fantastic it is also a negative especially if you are wanting to sleep before midnight this just isn't going to happen albeit if youre there for only a few nights its not too much of a nuisance. A trip to the Atlas Mountains is a must and can be done very cheap albeit you wil need cash for the added extras that arent mentioned. We would come back and stay here based on the impeccable attention to detail from the hosts! Simply awesome.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pbeatts

The other staff members are also very friendly & accommodating. A generous breakfast of bread pancakes pastries coffee & orange juice is served every morning which you can eat on the lovely roof terrace overlooking the square.

They speak perfect English which for non-speaking-french people like me is a real added value. They were keen to help and provide advices.  The Riad is clean confortable and stilish.

Riad Andalla,David M wrote a review Feb 2014,50,The place to stay,Having deliberated considerably whether to stay in a traditional Riad or a modern hotel thankfully we decided on this Riad. Conveniently located close to the Jemaa El Fna Square it was a lovely oasis in a busy part of the Marrakech old town.    From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome by the owner Christophe who is the friendliest landlord we have ever encountered over many years of travel. We felt like we had been invited into a family home and included as part of that family. He offered plenty of advice about local sightseeing and safety and was always happy to help and advise on anything we asked about.    This Riad is of traditional Moroccan style with colourful furnishings and decorations. It is spotlessly clean throughout and very comfortable. There is a delightful rooftop terrace overlooking the square (we understand the only Riad to have this) where breakfast is served and can be used at any other time for relaxation or a refreshing drink.    As already highlighted in other reviews the rooms are on the small side but completely adequate for a short stay. The showers were spacious with a powerful supply of hot water. We had been slightly worried after booking this Riad because we had heard that the rooms were not lockable from the outside however we left valuables including our passports unattended every day without any problem. Due to the way the property was managed and staffed we felt no reason for concern.    This is not a 5 star hotel it is a delightful Riad in the heart of Marrakech. If we ever return we would definitely stay at the Riad Andalla again.    This Riad is very difficult to find when you first arrive so we would strongly recommend that you ask Christophe to arrange your airport transfers.

It was are second time in Marrakech. The airport transfer was great (last time we where left stranded by are Riad). The Riad is excellently located all the staff are very nice it is very clean however the rooms were very small and there is a strong smell of sewage when you shower.    We did not eat in the Riad but I must say it always smelt of home cooking that I do regret not trying. We would never use a hotel in Marrakech as you would lose so much of the magic of a Riad and this place had plenty of it being well presented very traditional Moroccan style extremely homely to the staff who were so friendly and really did make us feel at home. The roof terrace is a great place to drink and relax and enjoy the amazing views.    Christophe and the staff gave us such a warm welcome and Christophe took his time to make sure we enjoyed our stay advising us on places to eat and visit - we did not receive this type of welcome on our first visit (at a different Riad) so this was especially appreciate especially if it is your first visit to Marrakech - thank you Christophe.

Riad Andalla,Jamie_sn1 wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Excellent,If you are going to stay in the heart of old Marrakech then this Riad is a must. Let's be clear here a Riad is not a five star hotel it's a Moroccan guesthouse. The Riad Andalla is particularly special because of the two most wonderful hosts Christophe and André they make you feel most welcome and are very informative in fact as a very well travelled person I have never been so informed in my life. All the staff working here are extremely friendly and aim to please at every possibility. We were a little concerned at first because there are no locks on any of the doors but do not let that put you off as we found out later this is very common in all Riads and everything is very safe. If I had to stay in a Riad again this one would definitely be top of my list.    Tips    1. If this is your first trip to Marrakech make sure the you arrange for the Riad to pick you up from the airport as it is impossible to find the first time.    2. Don't expect summer in January. Take a warm rain coat and good walking boots.    3. You will be a tourist so be savvy you will become a target so question everything and trust no one.

Riad Andalla,Bruno Felix wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Excellent riad, location and host",This riad is next to the main square Place Jemaa El Fna. From the terrace you can have a great view form the square. However being so near is still a quiet and peaceful place to stay. From the train station you can take a taxi to the square ( 30 dh ) or walk ( 30 min). To get there for the first time it´s necessary some help. Although it´s very near the square you have to enter some narrow streets not conventional. But when you enter the riad you will find a magic place. Beautiful and cosy. Christophe the owner is specially helpful and caring. He not only helped us with lots of tips about anything we needed but made us feel like home. For a real experience in Marrakesh forget the chain hotels in Ville Nouvelle stay in Riads. We strongly recommend this Riad it´s a touristic attraction itself.

Great tips from Christophe and André about the city place to visit and best advice about hammam and where to eat ever!  I'll return for sure and recommend it to everyone willing to experience a charming and warm city as Marrakech,Date of stay: November 2013,,"Lugano, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salima82
Riad Andalla,dlorena wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Wonderful!,We loved this place the location is perfect and even it's very close to the hustle of the Medina we had good quality sleeping.  Breakfasts in the terrace were remarkable the view is amazing!  Our room was very comfortable and tastefully decorated as was the rest of the Riad.  The owners and all the staff were so friendly and accommodating! I got sick in the middle of the trip and they were so kind to get me medicines and even prepare me special meals.  If we go back to Marrakech we will definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlorena
Riad Andalla,Sufu522 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Excellent Riad & Great Location,Terrific Riad with wonderful rooftop views of Djemaa el-Fnaa square. Christophe was amazingly helpful in providing information about the city where to go what to do and great restaurant suggestions. The staff was equally as amazing. They served breakfast on the rooftop terrace and if you wanted anything else they were happy to accommodate. With the location just off the square it was easy to stop back at the Riad to drop off purchases from the souks or just relax on the rooftop with drinks before dinner.    If this is your first time in Marrakesh I would recommend arranging airport service with Christophe since the Riad is slightly off the square and down a few alleys but after the first time it's easy to find on your own. Also make sure you have small change (coins) before you arrive to the square for tipping. Before you leave the airport buy a bottle of water or a snack so you have a variety of bills and coins. Even though you've paid for the transport service through the Riad the guide (not the taxi) will ask for a tip.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Grenoble, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sufu522

Riad Andalla,I A wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Loved this place,I stayed at the Riad Andalla in October 2013. You cannot get a better location. It is a haven after all the hussle and bussle of the Medina. The room was on the very very very small side. As a single traveller I felt it was samll  I cannot imagine two sharing that room (which is how it is set up). Nevertheless Christophe was amazingly helpful in providing information about the city where to go what to do how much to pay for a taxi. To be honest I only visited the places he reccommended. By mistake I ended up in a museum that wasn't part of his suggested places - it was a complete waste of time. I then decided to stick only to what Christophe reccommended and he was right. Every place was worth it. The staff at the Riad was incredibly friendly - there was always a lot of smiles. I loved my stay. As mentioned in other reviews this is not a 5* hotel and it doesn't need to be it doesn't want to be. It's really like a friend's house and that is what is great about it. The breakfast in the mornings was fantastic too.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/944ia

Now in October 2013 we returned and stayed for short 4 nights and it felt like coming home to friends!    The Riad does not claim to be a five star hotel but the service the atmosphere and the warmth of all the employees makes it better than in any five star hotel that is known to us.    The only thing we will do when we plan our next trip to Morocco is to ask Christophe for his always wonderful and extensive advise of how to fill our holiday - he will gladly give it even if it doesn't take place in Marrakesh the whole time. ;-)    Thanks to everyone for the wonderful time!

It's location its ambiance and the staff are a delight. We were so surprised by what greeted us when the door opened it's decor is tranquil warm and very inviting. This Riad has bags of character along with its owners. We were lucky to meet Christophe who made our stay so enjoyable. We had everything explained to us maps drawn and given lots if idea's for things to do. During the 3 days we visited Majorelle Gardens Marrakesh Museum Isis Spa Pepenero Restaurant and finished the trip off with an afternoon by the pool at La Maison des Oliviers.

Riad Andalla,Philadelphia_Collins wrote a review Oct 2013,50,"Excellent riad, excellent location",I stayed here for about 4 nights while visiting Marrakech. The riad is located right by the heart of the medina; jemaa el fnaa square. It was a perfect location for anyone who wants to spend the majority of their time in Marrakech in the medina. I can't say enough good things about the riad. The staff were all really friendly and helpful. The interior of the riad is beautiful. While we didn't get to meet Christophe one of his friends was running the riad in his absence. She was really nice as well gave helpful suggestions and helped us out a few times where our sub-par French failed us when trying to organize activities. Our room was beautiful with traditional tile work and plaster walls. Each room has an AC unit which worked well and quickly cooled the room. Also the rooftop terrasse provides an incredible view of the square and of Marrakech. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Marrakech.    In case anyone is thinking about doing an Ourika Valley excursion here's some notes on the experience (not reflected in my rating of the riad because it's done by a third party)  -We had a driver for the day. He picked us up on time and was a really friendly and knowledgeable guy who spoke great English.  -We stopped at a few locations on the way up the road to the cascades: a Berber house a pottery shop where they make pottery right there in front of you a place where they make argan oil and other herbal remedies that are all for sale lunch at one of the many restaurants that's in the river (food was great). We also stopped a few times to let us take pictures. At the places the driver took us we never felt pressure to buy things.  -We were paired up with a guide to take us up to the cascades. Unfortunately he wasn't the best. His English was pretty good but he wasn't particularly knowledgeable about the area or cascades (despite being from there). Also he complained about our tip size after doing a pretty average job (we were also told it was tip what you like).  -Be forewarned that during August the cascades are super rammed with local Moroccan tourists trying to escape the heat of Marrakech. This made the trip up and down slow due to traffic and the climb to the cascades a bit more treacherous due to crowding.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philadelphia_Collins

Riad Andalla,MattFromBeyond wrote a review Sep 2013,50,"Fantastic Location, Building and Staff",I stayed here with my (retired) parents in a Suite for just 2 nights and everything about the Riad was perfect especially at the price paid. The interior of the Riad and the rooms is beautiful and calming despite it being right next to Jemaa-el-Fna with a rooftop terrace that directly overlooks it and is also well shaded. Breakfast was simple but fresh and delicious. The staff are absolutely fantastic particularly the owner Christophe who really makes you feel like you are at a home away from home he is courteous and goes out his way to help out and provide useful advice. I needed assistance with rearranging a hire car and he did this without any hesitation or fuss.    If arriving late at night (we were after midnight) I would recommend the transfer service as though centrally located the Riad would be difficult to find for a first timer. It's down a few narrow lanes off a main lane that leads on to Jemaa-el-Fna square (50m) easy once you're there but the transfer service made it no stress.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,Christchurch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattFromBeyond

Riad Andalla,OliviaSimoneRussell wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Fantastic place to stay!,Riad Andalla is fantastic!    It is gorgeous inside absolutely beautiful and very Moroccan. Every floor is lovely and feels homely.    We stayed here for 4 nights. Our room was on the ground floor and we slept so well (there was no noise from outside the room even in the evenings). It was small but had everything you needed we had a really enjoyable stay and I would definitely go back!    The Riad is in such a perfect location – it is less than 2 minutes away from the main square of Marrakech yet perfectly quiet at night. All the best things to do in Marrakech are within 15 – 20 minutes walking distance. The Riad also felt very safe and there is always a staff member in the Riad. The small streets around the Riad also felt very safe and we are two quite small girls travelling alone.    The terrace where you eat breakfast is also beautifully furnished and just far enough from the main square that it is not noisy (but you can still see it and take photos).    Christophe arranged for us to do a couple of days trips (to Essaouria on the coast and to the mountains) and he recommended some restaurants for us to visit (lovely food! And I didn’t get sick from them at all they are safe places to eat). He also showed us on a map the best things to do in Morocco which made our holiday easy and enjoyable – he definitely showed us the best things to do. He also made us bookings at the most lovely spa in Marrakech! He Andre and the staff are all so friendly and helpful; it made the stay very easy. The service was excellent. Christophe (and everyone) are so friendly helpful and easy to get on with.    Christophe also arranged our transportation to and from the airport which was hassle free and had no problems.    This is brilliant value for a holiday in Marrakech! I would definitely go back and have recommended it to my parents.

Riad Andalla,craig2410 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Beautiful Friendly Traditional Moroccan Riad,On booking this riad we received an email immediately from the proprietors Andre and Christophe who offered us transportation to and fro our entry point into Marrakesh. As we were on a tour of the country we made our own way there; however when we arrived we found the place being run by their friend Sandrine. She was incredibly friendly helpful and easily interchanged between English and French; I speak French but my partner does not. She arranged early entry into the room as we arrived at 8:30AM and had their staff serve up a breakfast immediately. Along with Younis their night staff and general handyman and the ladies who worked during the day servicing the rooms we felt like part of a family and were treated accordingly. The riad is extremely secure in a city where crime is an issue indeed we left money and devices in our rooms without fear. The rooftop terrace provides a unique view over the main square and is a refuge of tranquility amongst the chaos of the medina.    Sandrine arranged an excellent excursion into the mountains and all her recommendations regarding places to go things to do and restaurants to eat at were spot on and should be followed!

The staff were waiting to greet us with the best mint tea and our family room was cool  beautifully clean and spacious. The smells sights and sounds of this riad make you relax immediately. The other guests I have met there are always delightful and Andre and Christoph make every effort to take time in helping all.  The weather was extremely hot so we relaxed on the terrace and watched the square come to life as the sun set. Big super clean towles and a fab shower refreshed us for our night in the square.

First of all I have to mention Christophe and Andre-- they were such wonderful hosts and it felt like you were visiting friends.Their staff also need to be mentioned they were great always helpful and happy to help you as well thank you thank you! After the hectic hours of traveling and the stress that goes with it it was great to arrive at the Riad with a warm smile. We were showed to our room and then offered some mint tea as a welcoming drink lovely touch. Christophe took the time to explain the area a little bit giving us some tips on where to eat what to visit and so on. The riad's location is ideal! You are literally 5 minutes away from the main Square which makes it so convenient after a long hot day in the souks to just come back and have a nice glass of wine on the roof terrace which was overlooking the square. The riad itself is lovely small but has everything you need and very cozy. You can tell that a lot of considerationtime and love was put into the decorations. The rooms were very clean and made everyday. When traveling it's always the people that make the place-- the place can be wonderful  but without the right hosts it's just not the same. Christophe and Andre are exceptional. We had two bags along with us that broke and we asked Christophe if he knew someone who could fix it.Right away he said yes took our bags and they were back and fixed within an hours time. Now that's great service! Thank you again so much if you are reading this. I have nothing negative to say about this place it's worth the money and I would go back there in a heartbeat.

Firstly Christophe is brilliant; charming welcoming and friendly. He really makes you feel at home.    The location is perfect just on the edge of the square so you can go from the cool quiet of the riad to the madness of life in Marrakech in no time. For me this was ideal; it was super hot and of course very busy so it was nice to be able to nip back to the riad cool down have a drink calm down....and then head back out again.    All of the staff were lovely from Christophe and Andre Younes (sorry about spelling!) who was a brilliant waiter and very friendly to the ladies maintaining the rooms which were always spotless.    We ate at the riad 1 night and the food was very good. A tasty 3 course meal with the option of wine also on the rooftop.    The staff are happy to advise you on where to eat what to see how much to expect to pay for things how to get to places but this does not impact on your own discovery of the city just enhances it.

The location is perfect really close do Djemaa El Fna (you can see it from their terrace which I understand is something unique for a riad in Marrakech) but not so much that the noise bothers you we slept like babies every night.

Location is spot on just close to Djemaa El Fna right at the center of the Medina. Some might argue and complain about the noise that comes from the streets at night but I think that's just part of the experience. The view from the terrace is incredible on of the best sunsets in Marrakech's and the terrace itself is a great place to chill out in the afternoon sipping a mint tea and resting the bones after a day in Souqs or just to enjoy breakfast (which is included) and getting ready for the day. The staff is extremely helpful and gave us a very warm welcoming. Christophe the owner and the guys (Andrea Younes did I get the names right?) were always available to help us out giving us information and all sorts of tips about restaurants places to visit transportation etc. that were essential for us to enjoy even more our trip to Marrakech.  You can book a transfer straight from the airport to the Riad we were also able to book a tour to Ourika Valley and visit the waterfalls with a driver and guide included during our stay.  The rooms are very clean and beautifully decorated (as the entire Riad by the way). We stayed at a kind of small one but there are bigger ones on the other floors and we really didn't mind the space as it was very confortable.  Totally recommend Riad Andalla specially for couples who seek a romantic escape.

Room was good though not very spacious. Didn't bother us though. Everything was clean. Food was excellent. Christophe the owner gave us good tips on where to go and eat with his handdrawn map which he must have drawn a 1000 times by now.. Prices were reasonable for a tourist hotspot I'd say.

Riad Andalla,Hayley B wrote a review May 2013,50,Brilliant stay at Riad Andalla,We have just returned from a 4 night stay at Riad Andalla and had a fantastic experience. The Riad is located in a superb spot just off the main square with a roof terrace that has spectacular views overlooking Jemma el Fna. Christophe and Andre and all of the staff at the Riad are very welcoming and friendly and make you feel right at home. We must also give a special mention to the cook as we had 2 dinners here and they were by far the best meals that we ate in our whole Moroccan trip (in particular the vegetable tangine which was perfect.)  We highly recommend staying here! Hayley,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HayleyB985

We need not have worried Christophe Andre and the team introduced us to the city of Marrakech in a gentle and helpful way drawing great maps on how to get around and explaining everything carefully. The team had a wealth of languages between them English French Spanish and maybe more - so we got great information thought out our stay. We laughter alot and enjoyed the lovely terrace sipping wine.

Riad Andalla,fin-travels wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Just fabulous... the best hosts ever!,We were delighted with our room which was quite magical in opulent textures of reds and gold. Having stayed in four different riads I can say that Riad Andalla had the most comfortable bed of all. But what really strikes you is the generosity and love for their guests bestowed by the hosts Christophe and Andre - you could not be made to feel more welcomed - it is as if you are the guests of your oldest and dearest friends who are absolutely thrilled to see you again and share in their delightful home. It is worth staying at least one night in this fabulous riad just to experience their kindness. In such a bustling and sometimes overwhelming city it is wonderful to have such friends at hand - you are made to feel that they would do anything for you to ensure your visit was perfect. We shall never forget them and their colourful riad. We must also mention Yunis who served us delicious mint tea and pastries on arrival and is a real asset and compliment to the staff who were all kind and welcoming.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Portsmouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fin-travels

Riad Andalla,maat1976 wrote a review Mar 2013,30,A solid riad,I'd love to give this riad a 3.5 but since I can't I'll give it a 3/5.    Christophe and crew are really great and communicate all the info you need. With all riads in Morocco get directions to where you are going or have someone come and meet you. We arranged a transfer from the airport with the riad and the driver was waiting as expected.    Because the riad is in the medina near the square you have to walk the last bit or have your bags taken by chariot.    The room was a bit dark (it was a blue one) but the shower was good the decor exotic and the staff were very attentive. There are no locks on any of the doors and no safes so if you have something very expensive you might want to leave it with Christophe. It did feel very safe though because there are always people about.    The thing that makes this place special are the owners. They give good information on the area and are always available to help. Breakfasts are good as well. On our final night with Riad Andalla a really lovely dinner was organized probably the best we had in Morocco.    I would recommend Riad Andalla in spite of its small imperfections.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maat1976
Riad Andalla,Smurfettey wrote a review Mar 2013,50,"Memorable stay in atmospheric, prime location",My boyfriend and I stayed here in late February for two nights. Christophe was very helpful and welcoming and the Riad is beautifully furnished and comfortable. We felt very at home and found Christophe exceedingly useful with tips for eating etc. What made the trip for us was the location of the Riad - it is so central and the roof terrace has a great view of the main square which is really special. It's lovely to be so close to such a buzzy area and breakfasting while watching the square wake up was a real treat. That said the Riad was calm and quiet and I had no trouble sleeping. Our room was fairly small and could get chilly (the heater didn't work but we didn't complain as it wasn't v cold) but happy to have a smaller room as we were so central and as Londoners we were used to it anyway. I would recommend the Riad to anyone who was visiting for a short stay as it means you are right in the action while very comfy and well looked after!,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smurfettey
Riad Andalla,Anon100001 wrote a review Mar 2013,20,Close to all sights but basic accomodation,Pros: People (Christophe Younis and Andre) were all great as well as all the staff and location - very central and close to all the main attractions. Cons: very very small damp room with a tiny bathroom and uncomfortable bed - quite cramped and the Riad is down a little alley (which did not feel safe at night). This is basic accommodation and you are paying the price for the location and hospitality.

Riad Andalla,Steve K wrote a review Mar 2013,50,It's like coming home,Trust the good reviews.  I've stayed here 3 times now and every time it gets better.  Christophe and Andre are the perfect hosts at the Riad every morning and evening more than willing to help with whatever you need - from shopping for slippers to arranging a trip to the Sahara. I followed their recommendation to Pepe Nero restaurant and have now dined there 4 times. The rest of the staff are very polite and helpful nothing too much trouble nice genuine people.  The location is so very easy from the main square and in a safe area. Absolutely perfect with the big bonus of a view over the square from the rooftop terrace. (watch the chaos with a glass of wine in your hand).  To try and give a balanced review I've racked my brains trying to think of a downside. The only downside I can think of is the rooms are a little small but considering your location in Marrakech and the view from the terrace it represents outstanding value for money. The downstairs patio and lounge are nice areas to relax in so you wouldn't want to be in your room anyway. Typical Riads have small bedrooms and this is a typical Marrakech Riad.  The quality of sleep is great no traffic or street noise at all. Always hot water. air con if you need it.  Really unless you want the 'marble palace' style riad don't hesitate to book this - It's super friendly helpful staff will really help you get whatever you want from your visit and it wont cost the earth.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveK250

I can only echo what the other favourable reviews have said. The Riad is excellently located and the rooftop terrace not only enjoys great views but is a comfortable and relaxing place to escape the medina. The rooms are cosy and really well decorated and the communal areas are very nicely done. Breakfasts are good (pancakes breads and the same great orange juice you can find in the Jemaa el fna). The recommedations and contacts for food and trips are also well worth listening too (we had a very enjoyable trip into the Atlas mountains). Best of all though are Christophe Andre Younis and the rest of the staff. They are always cheerful enthuiastic and welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they go the extra mile to make sure your stay is special. They also respond very quickly to email questions prior to our trip. In short they have done a fastastic job turning this Riad into a 'must stay' place in Marrakech and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others as we would stay here again the next time we visit this great city.

The welcome from the owners André and Christophe immediately made us feel at home as we stepped in from the winding alleyways into the Riad Andalla. Breakfast in the roof terrace was the ideal way to start the day in this hectic and fascinating city and our beautifully decorated room was just the place to relax and recover after a foray out into the streets.

Riad Andalla,sw6bear wrote a review Feb 2013,50,"As an introduction to North Africa, this will be hard to beat.",The adventure started when we lead by a local guide down the Rue de Banques off of Jemaa el Fna square we were taken through a winding left and right alleyway to the Riad Andalla. We were greeted cordially with big smiles from the staff and were escorted to the roof terrace. After being offered mint tea and local biscuits Christophe gave us a really informative insight to the 'does and do nots' of the local area Also good advice of the 'must sees' of the area on a short visit.    Our rooms were impeccable serviced daily and any request was never a problem. Staff were always on hand smiling and making our stay comfortable.    The breakfast terrace was superb as was the breakfast. Warm bread honey marmalade peach jam warming coffee all served with a truly heartfelt 'Bonjour' to start your day. The terrace was also perfect for a mid afternoon or early evening break with a nice glass of chilled wine served by the willing staff.    When you come out of the Derb (alleyway) you can turn left to go to the square or turn right which takes you directly into the souks and to the museums and palaces the location cannot be equalled. Sunset on the roof can only be described as 'Magical'    We will tell friends we will tell travellers we will remember. We will be back.

Also he asked if we will require any transfer - Man... I thought we will only get this in 5* star hotel!    When we reached the Riad we were welcomed by the friendly staff who offered us cookies & home made Moroccan Mint Tea. I need to really compliment that the decor of the place made us feels welcome and it was very cozy as though we are living as one big family. Please go to Christophe if you need excellent food & beverage venues and hamman.... (He will show you his fantastic map drawing skills ;p)    EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPING  The ladies tidied our rooms daily keeping it neat and clean.

Riad Andalla,sacolacicchi1 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Welcoming Riad,I booked this beautiful Riad online before visiting the wonderful and chaotic city of Marrakech with my boyfriend. I chose it because many reviews had said what an excellent location it was in how charming the staff were and how comfortable the Riad was. Booked in for two nights we ended up staying a total of four... The Riad is absolutely stunning complete with intricately detailed tiles authentic Moroccan furniture trinkets collected by the owners on the walls and a roof-terrace with views of the Atlas mountains and the Djemma el Fna - (excellent for drinking mint tea on after a hectic whizz around the Medina). All of the staff made us feel very welcome coming back in from bartering in the Souks eating rabbit tagines and sampling Moroccan wine at all hours of the day and night. We met the owners on our second say who gladly helped us out in sorting out an epic trip into the mountains for two days which was greatly appreciated and enjoyed. On our return we opted to stay for another two nights although this was not in our original plan(!) and we were upgraded from a very comfortable double bedroom to a glorious suite on the top floor which was very special. We had early flights on our last day and the delightful Johannes made us an early breakfast. All in all we had a really fantastic stay which really made our trip away one to remember and would highly recommend this Riad to other travellers looking for some luxury at a very good price in Marrakech.

So our introduction to the medina was following a cart through the mad traffic into the main square and into the alleyways to the Riad. A truly wonderful introduction to Marrakech and great fun!  Our first meal was at the riad proving to be one of the best of the holiday and good value. This has got to be the best way to start a trip to Marrakech.  The staff are really friendly the riad is really close to Jemaa el Fna - you can see it from the lovely rooftop - and the decor is authentic.

Christophe and Andre - and all of their staff - are simply delightful. So helpful and informative. I am a woman who was travelling on my own and and right before I was to depart on my trip was having second thoughts about going to such a country on my own. Christophe reassured me and gave me the best orientation immediately upon arrival. One of them was always available to answer any questions about what to do where to go etc as well as just interacting with guests.    The riad itself absolutely meets my criteria of what I look for in accommodation when travelling: small clean quiet and centrally located - with bonus marks for charm! Because the riad is small it was very easy to meet up and talk to other guests at breakfast (delicious!) served on the lovely balcony overlooking Djema-el-Fnaa. A dinner prepared by the riad staff is absolutely recommended.    Marrakesh is a fantastic destination and staying at the Riad Andalla was definitely one of the highlights of my trip.

Riad Andalla,Sarah M wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Perfect location for the Marrakech experience.,I had booked a long weekend stay at the Riad Andalla as a surprise 50th birthday for my partner. I had visited Marrakech 10 years ago and I wanted to show him the unique flavour and experience of Marrakech that had ‘wowed’ me all those years ago in the short time that we had. For this reason I wanted an authentic Moroccan Riad (rather than a hotel) with a view over the Djemaa el Fna Square at the heart of Marrakech where all the ‘action’ was. Riad Andalla ticked all of those boxes and more.    Communication with Christophe the proprietor was always prompt and efficient throughout the booking process and he was the perfect host when we arrived taking time to orientate us with maps and directions to places of interest and also advising on a variety of places to eat. This was valuable advice and in a chaotic city such a Marrakech really did put us at our ease and gave us the confidence to just get out there and enjoy it!    The Riad itself was completely charming and the staff always friendly and helpful. The rooms might be considered a little small in comparison to some European hotels but remember this is a Riad (guesthouse) in a fantastic location and we found it perfectly adequate for our needs. The linen and towels were very clean and we had terrific hot showers.    We ate on the roof top terrace for our first evening meal (complete with birthday candle!) and for breakfasts which were simple but delicious; bread pancakes and jams fresh orange juice and coffee. The closeness of the Riad to Djemaa el Fna was not just great for the views over the square from the roof top terrace but also on more than one occasion we were grateful to be able to nip back to our ’bolt hole’ to draw breath after the ‘souk experience’ before venturing out again.    In summary the combination of the ambiance the location and Chistophe’s hospitality made this the perfect weekend that I had hoped for and I would have no hesitation in recommending Riad Andalla to fellow travellers.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/null
Riad Andalla,Luis M wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Like staying at a friend's house!,After being to one too many impersonal big-chain hotels it was a wonderful change to stay at Riad Andalla. It was exactly what we wanted. More than the location which is amazing (1 block away from Djema-el-Fnaa squarea two minute walk) the very clean rooms and the affordable price what we liked the most about this riad was enjoying the company of Cristophe and Andre. For absolutely everything we wanted to do they either took care of it personally or gave us the best advice. We were a large party and had to do some last-minute changes to our reservation (add and extra bed take one night off) which they helped us with very diligently. Each morning Andre helped us shape our itinerary and gave us excellent dining tips. In such a hectic place as Marrakech having their orientation made our experience a million times better. DO NOT dare purchase anything without asking their opinion first. If Andre says you are being asked too much trust us you are. During our stay in Morocco we ate a lot of typical moroccan food (tagine couscous) but the best couscous definitly was Andre's.  Even though it is just near the main square once you make the first turn into a little alley that leads to the Riad it gets very quiet and so the rooms are very quiet (except very early in the morning the first call to prayer is very loudly heard). We stayed at suite Chems which was incredible. It's the one with more light of the rooms we saw. The beds are very comfortable and the everything is nice and clean.  Breakfast was served in the terrace. Even though it was very cold in the mornings you do get some sun and have a great view of the square were you can see all the action begin once again. The breakfast was very good also (coffee/ tea/ chocolate milk orange juice and two different types of bread which were different each day). We particularly loved the one that was like a vanilla spongecake and regretted later in the day not having eaten it all.

Riad Andalla,poser75 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,priceless kindness,Everything has been said already but two main things are very worth being  repeated. First the riad is absolutely nice clean and in an ideal position to  live the best of Marrakech. of course if you are ready to pay 3-4times as much  you might get more space or more luxurious rooms...but this is quite normal i  think. Everywhere!  Second thing: every person working in the riad is absolutely nice and super  kind. On top in a country where each time you ask a direction in the street 10  people try to bring you to their cousin or neighbour and to sell you something  at a crazy price the suggestions and recommendations Christophe gives you with  NO second interest allowing you to get the best out of a couple of days in  town are totally priceless!!!!,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,Torino,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poser75

Riad Andalla,THE LONDON LOUNGER wrote a review Jan 2013,20,Not that nice,I don't know why people have ranked this a 5. It's not a 5. The rooms are small old and dirty the food is OK the staff are nice. I would suggest that this is a hotel to stay in if you are on a tight budget. If you have more money spend it on the more luxurious places which maybe are not ranked as highly but are exceedingly superior to this place in terms service luxury cleanliness quiet and food.

Riad Andalla,Neil R wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Location is everything!,I've twice stayed in Riads in Marrakech - they have been lovely but difficult to get to and from. Riad Andalla is in a different ball game: tucked behind the Cafe De Paris 5 minutes from the Djemma down narrow but lit alleys. We stayed in a junior suite on the 1st floor - a long narrow room with double bed and a red divan. The bed was very comfy. There was no table but a closet - and the floor was carpetted. There was a good strong shower and a toilet behind a curtain. It had heating. There were no locks to the room or a safe - everything was on trust. There was a large communal area and seats on each floor. The Wifi was good but only worked downstairs. Breakfast was on the roof three stories up with brilliant views of the Square. Breakfast itself was average: the first day we were given deep fried donuts - my cholesterol count went through the roof just looking at them. On the other days there were Moroccan crepes. Great orange juice but weak coffee. We never ate in the Riad but did visit the expensive but lovely restaurant on the way to the Riad in the first alley. Overall a great place to stay but you are paying for the location,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NLR
Riad Andalla,Sitwat M wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Highly recommended,We stayed at Riad Andalla last October had an amazing experience. The staff was very hosbitable. Particularly Christoph's guidance helped us a lot in exploring the city. Breakfast that we used to hav on the rooftop is somthing we still talk about very often & miss. Christoph also helped us get the bus tickets that we needed to travel to another city which otherwise seemed to be a hassle as we had language issues while communicating with the local people who either speak Arabic or French.

The hospitality shown to us by the owners Christoph and Andrew and their staff was absolutely fantastic. We were made to feel so welcome they went out of their way to make us comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The accomodation was home from home. We had the most wonderful time because they looked after us so well. on arrival Christoph welcomed us and gave us lots of information regarding things to do and see and information on the local area. He booked a restaturant on our behhalf and arranged a guide to take us there and escort us back to Riad Andalla at the end of our evening. There was a lovely dinner provided by Christoph Andre and their staff on the night of Christmas eve for us and other guests. The food and service provided was first class. On arrival in Marrakech Taxis were arranged for us to be met and return to the airport Christoph even paid the taxi service direct so we did not have the hazzle it was just put onto our bill which made life easy. Before our arrival I communicated with Christoph by e-mail on several occasions regarding questions I need to ask. Christoph responded immediately with answers emphasizing that he is more than happy to help with any enquiries I have.

All throughout our stay we have been so well taken care of by Christoph and André the owners. They made sure we were picked up at the airport and once we reached the Riad they offered us a drink and a little snack while giving us very useful tips and advice about the city.  In the evening they arranged for a romantic dinner on the rooftop terrasse of the riad... and the food was absolutely de-li-cious! (sighs)  During the entire week they really went out of there way to make us feel at home and comfortable. They gave us maps of Marrakesh made bookings for us for the hamam as well as for some restaurants arranged a day trip to Urika Valley got us bus ticket for another trip to Essaouira... They even found some time to take me shopping in the souk!  I cannot imagine going back to Marrakech and not staying in this Riad.

Riad Andalla,jordanc962 wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Superb,My wife and I spent four nights at the excellent Riad Analla in November.    The riad arranged for a taxi driver to meet us in the arrivals lounge at the airport who then took us straight to the riad.    On arrival we were welcomed by Christophe and Andre. They provided a map of Marrakech and suggested tourist attractions restaurants bars a great spa and also provided travel advice. They were always on hand to help with anything we asked for. Firsthand knowledge is very useful when trying to make the most of trip to somewhere like Marrakech.    The Riad is in an excellent location literally a stones throw from Djemaa el Fna. The roof terrace is superb the ideal place to look over the square - sunset sunrise and at night. We enjoyed being in the tranquillity of the riad but still being able to enjoy the atmosphere of the square.    Thank you so much Christophe and Andre you made our trip to a very interesting city!

Riad Andalla,HayleyGoesOutOut wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Sanctuary from the square,If you are looking to stay close to all the action of Marrakech medina then I would highly recommend a stay at Riad Andalla. We were made to feel very welcome during our stay here from before we had even arrived!    Before we arrived we emailed Christophe the owner to ask for directions to the riad (although it is located next to the square the entrance was down a few alleyways) and we also made dinner reservations as well. Christophe replied promptly and was ready to greet us when we arrived at the riad. He provided us with mint tea on the rooftop terrace and gave us a map and told us some information of places to visit and recommended some restaurants to have lunch later that day.    Our room was one of the suites and had beautiful traditional decor and although the riad is on the square and you can hear the sounds of the snake charmers and drummers during the day there is no disturbance at night so we slept very well.    Dinner was served downstairs in the patio lounge by the fountain. It was a little too quiet for my liking but the food was pretty tasty. Breakfast was included in the price and served up on the rooftop terrace with views over the Djemma el fna square. The views from the terrace were what attracted us to this riad in particular and it was nice to see the action of the square from a viewpoint.    Although our stay at Riad Andalla was brief I would definitely recommend staying here!,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HayleyGoesOutOut

The staff we're very welcoming and treated us as guests in their home giving us freedom to roam and helping us with every aspect of our stay: places to eat things to do things to see and made our experience ideal. It's also within very short walking distance of a lot of other markets and a 10 minute (and very cheap) cab ride to the new town with all the modern less traditional things to do and see. The rooms are cosy and very traditional truly making you feel like you are a guest in someone's home the breakfast was nice and moroccan very accommodating allowing us to make requests for what we wanted.

The Riad is hosted by Christophe who makes the most to ensure a pleasant stay in a friendly atmosphere.  The view from the terrasse over the Djema al-Fna square is stunning but make sure you also spend a couple of hours on the square during the night where the square really comes alive with Berber music local trader and food stand.

It was the first time we had stayed at Riad Andalla but it certainly won't be our last! From the very minute we entered the Riad we were made to feel very welcome and at home. Our room was beautiful with wonderful decor as was the whole Riad. It was very clean. The staff were very friendly and helfpul and we felt really looked after during our stay. Christophe (the owner) was a real star recommending a fantastic romantic restaurant one night (even organising a table and a guide to the restaurant) and giving us lots of advice. He certainly made our stay a perfect one and we loved his humour. The Riad itself was in a brilliant location just a short walk from the main square and it was lovely to come back to the piece and quiet of the Riad and sit on the roof terrace (which had fantastic views) away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Marrakech is truly magical please do submerge in it's culture and get lost in its maze of souqs. But the most enchanting experience for us was our stay at the Riad Andalla. We are a couple accustomed to staying in big 4star hotels across Europe Asia and America. So imagine our pleasure when we arrived at the Andalla with its warm reception unique Moroccan decor pristine rooms and friendly attentive staff. Recommended to us by our good French friends who had stayed there previously our stay was truly magnificent. The French owners Christophe and Andre are excellent hilarious hosts and made our stay complete. Do trust their local knowledge and recommendations and u will not be disappointed! Make sure you have a home cooked evening meal at the Andalla and local wine on the roof top terrace with unrivalled views of the Djemaa Al Fna. We were romanced by this secluded candlelit encounter enjoying a truly fine evening with excellent food that typifies Moroccan cuisine. With 2 French owners how could you go wrong?! Seduced by the charm of the pristine Riad Andalla and the fantastic hospitality of Christophe Andre and their lovely staff we will definitely return in the near future.

Riad Andalla,LondonDarren21 wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Location excellent ...wonderfull hospitality...a real Gem...,Our first trip to Marrakesh we had a decision to either stay in a standard hotel outside the Medina or choose a riad in the medina for a more authentic experience. We took a risk and opted for a Riad in the Medina. Turned out there was no risk.  I have never felt more at home and relaxed than when staying in this Riad.....and to think it is located in the heart of one of the most intimidating cities in the World.  Just 50 meteres from the main square. We stayed in the Chems suit. We didn't experience any bad smells from the shower drain. With ears plugs I was not woke up by the early morning call from the Mosque.( and I am a light sleeper)...the power shower was great with hot water within seconds...the air con was a great plus ...the breakfast was fresh produce everyday..  the biggest asset you have in a stay at this Riad is its owner Christoph...to have an honest local spend 45 minutes with you covering all the highlights of the city for you and most importantly the pitfalls to avoid was simply invaluable...

Riad Andalla,stuart72 wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Fantastic place and would return again,My wife and I stayed at Riad Andalla for 3 nights and really enjoyed the stay. We were greeted by Christophe’s sister when we arrived late Sunday night who managed to get by on enough English but when Christophe arrived the next morning he was fab a big character with plenty of knowledge of places to visit and advice on prices to pay when haggling! He drew us a map of where things were and how to get there as the small alleyways are very confusing which we used and was spot on! (Thank you Christophe)  The actual Riad was excellently positioned behind the Café De France just off the main square (Djemaa el Fna) so easy to find once you knew the route! The décor inside was very tastefully done and our room (Bachahamou) was perfect with a very comfortable bed and fantastic shower so no complaints there.  We managed to see all the main attractions within the medina within our short stay even managed a horse and cart trip in the rain which was still very enjoyable. Everything inside the main walls is accessible on foot and is within walking distance of Djemaa el Fna but must admit we did get a couple of “petit” taxis when we got a bit lost back to the square and paid no more than 30dh each time even though they wanted more.  The only slight negative or improvement that we can say is the breakfast was very simple and something like fresh fruit would improve it but the freshly squeezed orange juice was excellent so overall marks would be 9/10 for Riad Andalla with breakfast losing it the one mark!  We would definitely recommend Riad Andalla to anyone who wanted to visit Marrakech and would definitely return ourselves.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Ipswich,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuart72

Riad Andalla,mark_SydNSW wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Good location in the Medina,I had a 3 night stay in a room on the ground floor opposite reception. It had a lower price than the upstairs rooms which cost about 50% more. I didn’t find any disadvantages with this room and if it is available I’d take it. (There is not a lot of activity through reception because it’s a small guesthouse with only ~8 rooms.)    The riad's location is right next to the Djemaa el-Fna which is good for the convenience and because it makes it easy to find the way back. It is on the same block as the Cafe de France a local landmark and a minaret which is the tallest building in the square is nearby.    I recommend using the riad’s transfer service especially if you arrive after dark – you have to go down a few alleys and without knowing what to look for it would be difficult to find the first time. (My transfer had an issue though. The car driver handed me over to a street porter and tried to get me to pay for it even though the riad's fee covers transfer to the riad's door.)    As soon as I arrived the owner (Christophe) drew me a mud map of how to find my way back to the Riad gave me a map of Marrakech and explained the layout of the Medina and the wider city and made some restaurant suggestions.    Breakfast is not a large meal but it is served on the rooftop terrace that overlooks the square and has a great view.

The location is just marvellous: Overlooking Jamaa el Fna we had the feeling of beeing ringside to a never-ending drama playing out in the square. To sit on the terrace with a cold beer looking at the sunset: You have to try it to belive the feeling. The only negative was the 5 o'clock (a.m.) prayer-call from a nearby minaret but this is something you have to live with in a muslim country. :-)  Our best to Christofe and Andre!!,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gusstav
Riad Andalla,Victoria L wrote a review Oct 2012,50,The best place for stay in Marrakech!,We've stay at Riad Andalla one month ago with two of my sisters and my brother-in-law. We had a really good time. Mohamed Christoph and all the team made us feel at home.  The food was excellent and served in that terrace with an unique view to the Jemaa el Fna priceless!  The location is perfect just two minutes walking from the square. It's just good to know that if you arrive by night traffic is closed in that area so your transfer will leave you like ten minutes walking distance but the driver can assist you finding a man to handle the luggage and help you finding your way to the Riad not a big deal.  We've also appreciate all the local information and tour booking they provide us.

Riad Andalla,alcami197 wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Madness of Marrakech,Stayed at Riad Andalla because it was near to the Jamaa el fna square and was the only one that overlooks the square Christophe was an excellent host and all his staff were excellentwhen we arrived he gave us a map and marked all the places of interest and recommended places to eat which were all good! The suks are a must ( go with a guide as you get to see a lot more) Dont eat in the Cafe France as a glass of mint tea and a small can of coke will cost you about £8:00! The cafe on the opposite corner Cafe Chez Chegrouni is good food is ok and reasonable prices If you are going to eat in the square of an evening then take Christophe's advise and eat in number 1 or 31 ( they are always crowded which is a good sign!) The ONLY negative thing that I can say is that there are a few Mosques close by and you get the wailing noises very very early in the morning which keeps you awake so I suggest you take some ear plugs and wear them when you go to sleep!!! I would definately recommend this Riad because of its location cost great host and friendly staff and I would certainly go back if I go back to Marrakech!

Riad Andalla,Peter Motson wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Lovely Riad BUT !!!,If you have the slightest difficulty walking as I do this is NOT the place for you. First of all if you arrive after 1.00pm the main square is closed to traffic so the nearest the taxi can take you from the airport is a good 15 minutes walk through overcrowded and very hot cobbled streets. The suitcases are transported in a barrow with you by a street porter. The Riad is NOT on the main square as claimed but down three cobbled and potholed alleyways about 5 minutes walk. The roof terrace does overlook the main square and provides good views of the activity day and evening.  The other problem is that the internal staircases are very steep and one has no handrail. The bedrooms are on the ground first and second floors with the roof terrace above that.  Continental Breakfast is served on the roof terrace but because of my walking problems they very helpfully provided for us on the ground floor.  The bedrooms are very small with no place even to unpack a suitcase and there is no door between the bedroom and bathroom/toilet just a curtain! You also have to remember to shut the shower drain plug or the room smells very strongly of drains!    Apart from all of the above I have to compliment Christophe and Andre on their warm welcome the information they gave us regarding sightseeing and eating out and the fact that Christophe accompanied us back to the main square with our suitcases when we left. Nothing was too much trouble for them and we would love to go back apart from the access problems.  If you have no problems with walking this is a great hotel for a holiday. I have no wish to spoil their record or ranking position but the purpose of Trip Advisor is to tell the truth !,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London.

Riad Andalla,Teresa S wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Wonderful hosts but we won't be back.,We stayed for 1 night in this riad. It is very close to Jemaa el Fna. The terrace has a view to the plaza but unless you have a good zoom lens you won't be able to take good pictures - best to go to Cafe Glacier for that.    The booking process was good - Christophe responds to emails quickly. When I found out later that the price for the room had gone down Christophe acknowledged that. Instead of a refund for the difference I just asked for transport to the Supratours bus station and it was no problem.    We booked Lalamira - it is a very small room and the bathroom is tiny! The wifi doesn't work well in the room. We left early the next day and arranged to get our breakfast at 7:00. This was the least amount of food we were served during our 2-week Morocco trip and the pancakes were cold and hard at the edges - like they had not thawed properly.    On the positive side Christophe Andre and Muhammad were very nice and the location is very convenient to the Jemaa el Fna. I had requested Christophe to purchase our Supratours ticket to Essaouira for us - he did make a reservation but we had to go to the ticket office to buy the tickets (we got better service in this regard at another riad). We stayed in a better riad in Marrakech after going back from Essaouira so would probably not go back to Riad Andalla.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scottsdale, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teresa1009
Riad Andalla,Gabbyoo wrote a review Oct 2012,50,the,I love this Riad. The booking is very systematic the staff is very nice and helpful the room is super nice and beautiful the terrace is very nice the location is too perfect (a very important point to be taken into account for a single female traveller when walking back to the Riad at night).    I stayed in this Riad for 5 nights I felt so safe after entering the Riad. I would not have to worry about the security of the room and my luggage all the staff in the Riad is taking very good care of the guests.    The owner of the Riad Christophe is so nice that he helped me to order the bus ticket to Essaouira in advance and offered many useful tips regarding eating sightseeing transport in Marrakech. The staff there are all very passionate and helpful.    I would definitely go back to this Riad when I visit Marrakech again and would recommend this Riad to anyone who wanna spend a holiday in Marrakech. Believe me the location of riad in the medina is a very important factor to be considered as you can get annoyed by people trying to talk to you or even follow you if you have to walk back to the Riad for a long way each night.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,Hong Kong,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabbyoo
Riad Andalla,Jennifer V wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Perfect place!,Bonjour! Riad Andalla adds to the enchantment of Marrakech. Words simply cannot express how much the staff made our stay in Marrakech a spectacular one. Not to mention the location! After a long day of exploring you can sit on the rooftop terrance sip tea and watch the splendors of Jemma el Fnaa unfold before you.  The staff was more than helpful with coordinating transportation trip ideas and food recommandations. My husband and I were impressed and completely satisfied.

Riad Andalla,CP Goh wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Beautiful Riad, Great Location!",I'm not sure this is the best Riad in the town but I can guarantee that you will like it! Simply beautiful Riad great hospitality from Christophe and Andre. It is difficult to locate the Riad for the first time as you need to make few turns in the narrow back street to reach this Riad. Don't get me wrong it is very close and took you just less than 2 minutes walk to reach the main square. I would suggest you to arrange a private car with the Riad to bring you from the airport to the Riad without any hassle in just 15 euro/trip. Many thanks to Younif for preparing the breakfast at 7 as we need to catch our earlier flight. The view from the terrace overlooking the square at evening is absolutely brilliant and awesome. I was surprised not many people on the terrace during evening. The only complained I have will be the weak Wifi connection and literally impossible to access inside the room. I would suggest Andalla to get another router/wifi on 2nd floors. It would be great if guests can access the internet from the terrace or inside the room. As for the smell from the drain hole inside the bathroom I guest this is the common issue in this area/old town. I don't have any issue just remember to close it after use it you will know what I mean when you stay there. The taxi fare from the square to the new town(shopping) is just 10 Dirham and 5/10 dirham tips for dining in restaurant is acceptable.

The rooms are authentically decorated with intricate beautiful features and decor and the ambience is of relaxation authenticity and a lovely family vibe.

Riad Andalla,criticadvisor wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Genuinely friendly in a not genuinely friendly city,"We want to extend our gratitute to Mohamed christophe and Andre for their help smiles and friendly attitude. You will find that most of the locals street locals that is are friendly for money. They can be nasty and really umpleasant pushing you to hire them as guides misguiding you to buy things you don't want and pretending to help you to find your way out of the Medina. When you here them telling you ""FERME or closed in english"" just ignore them.  Riad Andalla is a no frills Riad very well located and quite difficult to find the first time only.  First suggestion to the guys is to draw a simple map starting from CAFE DE FRANCE a landmark in Marrakech to the labyrint alleys that lead to the Riad. It is very simple once you have been at the Riad once.  Rooms are in three different floors they are small with two single beds or a double with a private bathroom and a curtain dividing the room and the bathroom which can be at times unconfortable for there are no windows to the outside and no extractor. So watch what you eat...All the rooms have wooden doors open to the courtyard and a curtain. You can actually have the doors open and the curtains closed for privacy. we found it completely safe. Breakfast is served from 8 to 10 but they will accomadate your needs in case of an early departure or if you sleep in. Coffee fresh orange juice bread and gem. A suggestion add some fresh fruits since they are all over Morrocco and are very good and inexpensive specially grapes and apples. Also I would see some croissants and occasionally some cheese. So Mohamed get in the oven and do some baking...  Mohamed the night watcher is always there when you need him with a big smile and very sincere and speak fluent english Cristhope will help you get around the city giving you maps and explain in details where to go also with very good english with a french accent and Andre gave us excellent recommendations for eating. All the places were a hit even though Andre does not speak english well he loves for the guests to speak to him in english so he can learn. Make sure you talk to him in English even if he says he doesn't understand. He is a charmer.  Riad Andalla was a pleasure full of excitment and fun.

Riad Andalla,335Catherine335 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Fantastic experience!,My husband and I stayed at the Riad as a treat for his 30th birthday. What a fantastic time we had! The staff were always extremely friendly and welcoming. Christophe and Andre were away on holiday while we were there but Sandrine who was watching over the riad also had excellent knowledge of the area and was only too happy to make reservations for us. For my husband's birthday Sandrine and the staff bought him a lovely card and present. They even arranged for a cake as a surprise in the restaurant we ate in that night.    Rooms are compact but beautifully decorated and cleaned every day. There was a good supply of hot water and we were provided with a fresh supply of towels daily. The air conditioning in August was a must! The location of the riad to the main square could not be beaten and the views from the terrace are just amazing. It is so lovely to just sit and read while watching the food markets set up for the evening. The mint tea served at the riad could not be beaten anywhere else we went in Marrakech!    Our absolute favourite days was a cooking class at 'Les ateliers lalla Fatima' which can be booked through the riad. Fatima took us and another couple out shopping for food and spices. We then went back to her house and cooked our tagines while been given various different breads cheeses and biscuits to try. A brilliant experience!

I am shocked to read the negative comment as she is complaining about our arrival. We had just arrived in the patio it wasn't late and we were not loud and the staff was patient and caring to help her feel better.

Riad Andalla,WorldTravelerHI wrote a review Sep 2012,10,"DO NOT STAY IN RIAD ANDALLA, Marrakech Medina",I'm a world traveler on my 2nd round-the-world trip and have visited 60 countries now. Despite the reason I booked Riad Andalla was because of the good/excellent reviews but everything was far from right for my stay and the worst experience I've ever had.    My Expedia reservation didn't specify which room I found myself checked in to the only ground floor unit which is between the kitchen and public area not far from the entrance. With the windows and door not 100% shut and facing in I could hear everything. The bathroom was stinky.    Then I went to the restaurant they recommended and vomited shortly after. I couldn't even stay in my own room to rest and/or wait for the next possible throw-up. Because the owners greeted and oriented the new guests right by my room in the public area. There is a rooftop terrace (which was highly reviewed) they could have easily invited the guests to go up to have their welcome mint tea and chat forever as there is no room right on that floor but they just had to talk outloud right by my room. They said it was only 7ish in the evening but they knew I was sick and had to rest in my room. They said it was only 30 min but there were at least two groups checked in since I told them that I was sick.    The worst part was when I expressed my problem they (mostly Christopher) showed no apology nor sympathy at all and as if it was my fault to book their Riad.    I'm so sorry about my own mistake but I want to make sure the world knows that DO NOT STAY IN RIAD ANADALLA in Marrakech Media.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Honolulu, Hawaii",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravelerHI
Riad Andalla,northbysudouest wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Excellent! No complaints whatsoever!,We stayed for 4 nights in the Riad Andalla which was friendly jolly and welcoming from the first minute. Our hosts Sandrine and her husband (not the owners of the Riad but their friends who were baby sitting the place during august) really were incredibly friendly indeed and the place was run more like a comfortable relaxed home rather than a formal intimidating hotel. On our arrival they explained the local enviroment to us asking what we were interested in seeing so they could advise us on what to do. After 15 minutes of Sandrine explaining the map to us we were ready to go and explore with recommendations on the best places to eat and the sites to see. Our stay was very cosy with the rooms communal areas and terrace being kept impecably clean. The terrace itself had a fantastic view of the Jamal al Fnaa while being high up enough to retain a calm escape from the bustle down below. Breakfast was deliciousfresh and varied with juices jams and local breads to keep us going in the heat and often with Sandrine and her husband popping up to say hello and check that we were ok. On my birthday I was even surprised by a lovely birthday gift from Sandrine which was a really nice thoughtful touch!  Brahim and his wife (who also worked in the Riad) were also incredibly welcoming agreeing to show us how to cook a local speciality (my husband is a chef so wanted a lesson) in the Riad kitchen first taking us to the butcher demostrating the cooking process then taking us to the local hamman for our tangier (Marrakesh stew made in a ceramic pot) to be cooked in the ashes of the hamman fire.  We then came back to the Riad to discover that a place had been set for us on a table on the terrace ready for us to eat our creation! Again a very thoughtful and appreciated touch!  All in all a very pleasant stay and a Riad that I would heartily recommend for its hospitality and kindness.  Ooh and you can even get a beer or a bottle of wine on the terrace if you are missing that kind of thing!

Christophe and Andre are the ultimate hosts funny easygoing generous welcoming and will look after you anyway they can. Christophe was fantastic with his recommendations booking hot air balloons Hammam's and cooking classes. He was also very helpful via email prior to travel to organise our stay. Andre speaks very little english however with my limited french italian laughter and wild hand waving we communicated perfectly. The location of this Riad is sensational. So close to Place Jemaa el Fna sights and great food. When we arrived I thought ""Oh goodness where are we going"" as the square is closed to traffic after 3pm. Therefore you walk to the Riad with a man carrying your bags in a cart you wind through some very small lanes but fear not you do arrive safety. Be aware of this if you book the driver from the airport after 3pm. After navigating the lanes a few times I almost felt like a local. I travelled through these lanes by myself at night and never questioned my safety. The rooftop terrace is a quiet oasis away from the ""craziness"" that is Marrekech. The Riad is 3 levels I stayed in ""Chems"" a room on level 2. The room was large clean air conditioned and had windows to the square. My friends stayed underneath me in ""Bachahamou"" and did not have any windows. The bathroom was perfect (love the shower head!) just make sure you close the shower drain after use as the smell is a little disturbing (I was told this on check in!) Valuables where safe in the Riad so much so I never locked my door the whole time I was there. The breakfast in the morning was sensational and the staff of the Riad where awesome. There is no lift in the Riad however the stairs are easy to navigate even with 2 bags full of the wonders of Marrekech.

Riad Andalla,Michael L wrote a review Jul 2012,50,***ideal location*** wonderful hospitality and advice,When I'm planning to visit a place I haven't seen firsthand I wonder about different definitions of good locations. I can't overstate how ideal this location is in Marrakech. You're going to want to stay near Place Jemaa el Fna since that's the heart of the Medina and worth visiting over and over. However you're going to want to have a place to retreat to when you need some down time a place where you can get away from the noise and high energy.    Riad Andalla is absolutely perfect -- its about 50 meters into a little neighborhood. It takes about 90 seconds to walk down to the square but the Riad itself is beautiful quiet and a perfect home base.    Christophe and Andre were absolutely wonderful hosts. We sat down with Christophe to ask questions and get some info on what to see and do. All of his insights were absolutely spot on. He's got the eye of a seasoned traveler the honesty of a good friend and the knowledge of an informed local. Every time we'd see them they took great interest in how things were going and helping us out with anything we needed. We had incredible and personalized advice and we truly appreciated it.

Our time in Morocco included a visit to Essaoiura; on our return to Riad Andalla Andre gave us the best welcome back ; wanting to know all about our trip and providing more tips for our last night in Marrakech.    On a practical note both of the two rooms we stayed in were clean and extremely well appointed providing everything we needed. The roof terrace was truly lovely with amazing views over the square - perfect for gazing over at breakfast (just right to set us up for the day) or for time out with a coffee in the afternoon.    All in all we had a really fantastic time at Riad Andalla it really was a home from home and definitely hope to return!,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenM1983
Riad Andalla,ACohen96 wrote a review May 2012,50,Friendly and central,"We came in on May 19 2012 for 4 nights scattered in our 10 days in Marrakech. We took the transfer (15euros) to the riad because the riad is in the alleys we didnt want to waste time getting lost on the first day but its actually easy to find. If you want to save 15 euros for the tansfer: take taxi to the jemma el fna (deal about 100 dirhams) ask to be dropped in front on cafe de france if they cant do it (impossible in afternoon) walk all the way to cafe de france from the horse carriages where they will drop you. Cafe de france is big has roof terreaces red coca cola shades u cant miss it. From taxi/horse carriage its not even 5 minutes walk. Once to cafe de france on the jemma el fna turn right at the black ""pepe nero"" sign ( the sign is at eye level between restaurant chegrouni and cafe de france cannot miss it) not even one minute later turn to your right into the alley BEFORE the shop ""brins d'orient"" in the alley you will see a restaurant sign you are on the right way take the first to your right again at the end there is a door #17 with an arrow to the right follow the arrow to your right at the end of the alley there is a brown door with a small inscription ""REAL"" turn left and you are there its a dead end take the door on your left handside there in a brass hand on top of the wood door written Riad Andalla. From the cafe de france to the riad it takes 2 minutes if you walk normally and u just saved a few euros: that much more to spend in the souks or to eat on the jemma.    The riad is very homey nothing luxurious but you feel welcomed with Christophe and André 2 frenchmen holding the riad. We thought their service was excellent. For the price you get to have free breakfast a roof terrasse right over jemma el fna close to cafe de france which is good because all the drivers from our excursions asked us to wait for them there for pick up early in the morning. There are no curfiew the doorman stays at the door to make sure you are back before he closes the door. The ladies of the riad are very pleasant and the cook is very nice also.    We had total 3 different rooms during our stay all of them simple basic no tv no phone no windows to the outside world but we didnt need it: theres a cool roof terrace with plenty of space to chill out. We had air conditioning which seemed to be set at 28 degres it felt more like a fan but we slepts well we were so tired the beds were confortable we had hot water. There was a smell in thebathroom in one of our rooms i believe its because of the way they built the houses there. Nothing major but we could have done without. The riad was clean it felt safe: we left all our luggage and our purchases there while away for 2 days at a time to go to the desert and to essaouira.    Riad Andalla is a great spot for marrakech close to everything. No mistakes staying here. We loved it.    Un grand MERCI Christophe André et toute votre equipe: Adbou Saaida Atika Jmiya & Ibrahim.

Riad Andalla,Brit C wrote a review May 2012,50,Best Service and Location!,"Myself my husband and two of our friends booked a trip to Marrakesh knowing nothing about it. We picked Riad Andalla because of it's proximity to the Djemma el Fna and the good reviews. We were not disappointed - not for a moment. From the easy pick-up at the airport (highly recommended) to the rooftop view overlooking the market; from the comfy bed to the AMAZING service - Christophe and Andre treated us like not just guests but friends . They imparted all their knowledge to us: from where to go swimming to where to get a good shave (from ""the barbier"") to where to eat dinner (Pepe Nero!!) and which Hammam to try (couldn't get in cause it was so busy but looked gorgeous - Les Bains de Marrakesh). Their numerous recommendations took the guesswork out of planning our days and left us with plenty of time to explore the many wonders of the city. Our favorite part of everyday was coming back to our air-conditioned rooms taking a luxurious shower and sipping drinks on the terrace while watching the sunset over the Medina. I knew nothing of Marrakesh before I arrived but feel like I had the trip of a lifetime in no small part to the Christophe Andre and their lovely staff.

Riad Andalla,maureen g wrote a review May 2012,40,Top Staff and Location,Everyone at the riad was exceptionally helpful and welcoming. Abdul was particularly superb always available to assist us and very hard working. As other reviewers have noted the location near the main square couldn't be better. Breakfast is included and is simple coffee and bread.  We ate at the riad the first night and it was OK.

Riad Andalla,Ilkleygirl wrote a review May 2012,50,AMAZING!,I searched on TA for a small Riad to stay for a 4 night stay and finally decided on Riad Andalla. So pleased I choose this place - its amazing.  From booking last October to then the stay at the end of April then departing after 4 nights - everything was superb. Christophe and his team are great hosts. Helped us from start to finish. Its a must to ask for a pick up from the airport - you would never find it by your self! All the little streets and alley ways are a mystery!  Christophe welcomed us with mint tea and also then gave us details of places to eat and more importantly places NOT to eat! Stall no1 in the market was superb and very cheap.  A car and driver took us to the Atlas Mountains for the day which was good fun and well organised.  Abdul (the night porter) was great at his job and always smiled and greeted us with a friendly face. His mint tea is amazing!  The views from the roof terrace across to Djemma el Fna are to die for.

Very friendly very helpful and we felt very much at home. We also had a meal here one evening which was fantastic - highly recommend it. We also arranged via reception for a driver to take us out to the Atlas mountains and this was at a reasonable price and a great english speaking guide who was very pfofessional.

Riad Andalla,kayak_girl_8 wrote a review May 2012,50,"Fantastic location, beautiful building and superb host!",Several things make Riad Andalla so amazing.  Firstly it is ideally located 5 minutes walk from the Djemma el Fna in the Medina. It's really handy to be so close to the action and there are a lot of things to see and do (including the souks) within a very short walk. There is a little bit of noise in some rooms from the square so take earplugs if you're a light sleeper. We were also woken at 04.15 every day by the call to prayer from the mosques though I imagine this would be the case at any place in the Medina. The Riad also felt very safe; you have to knock to enter and the staff will let you in.  Secondly the building itself is beautiful. The central courtyard (ground floor) is lovely with lots of little areas to sit in. The bedrooms are spacious very clean and comfy and beautifully decorated. My group had four rooms in total - large group - and all were individually decorated and a bit special! Most importantly the roof terrace is AMAZING! It looks right out onto the Djemma el Fna and it's fascinating to sit up there at breakfast and dusk to watch the character of the square changing.  Last but not least is the personal touch and extraordinary welcome from the owner Christophe and all of his staff. When we arrived (very early before our rooms were ready) we were given mint tea and biscuits on the roof terrace and Christophe gave us the lowdown on Marrakech. He recommended restaurants (good ones and ones to avoid) told us about good places to visit how much taxis should cost how to barter in the souks where to get a good hammam etc etc. He also booked us a restaurant one night and a hammam the next day (Isis - very good). Nothing was too much trouble for him and his staff and the advice he gave us really gave our trip a special edge.  I'd go back there in a flash and have been recommending Riad Andalla to all of my friends.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayak_girl_8
Riad Andalla,alexfrance0 wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Wonderful Riad,This was our first trip to Marrakech but we were made to feel completely at ease in a new culture. Christophe (the owner) organised transfers from the airport to the Riad which helped as we wouldn't have found it without help! We were welcomed with mint tea and cookies on the roof terrace and our luggage taken to our room. Christophe talked us through the places to visit provided us with maps and told us the best/safest routes so we wouldn't get lost. He also told us rough price guides that we should haggle to so we didn't pay over the odds.    We ordered a meal for the first night so we didn't have to worry about finding a place to eat and it was by far the best meal we had in Marrakech. I would thoroughly recommend eating at least once in the Riad it is a truly wonderful experience on the rooftop. Christophe also recommends other good places to eat for all price ranges despite them serving food at the Riad and offers to book tables for you.    The room was spotless and we had no problems whatsoever (make sure you put the plug down after showers like they say). We had a little trouble with the wifi at first but once we found the right place to sit it worked fine! Breakfast on the roof terrace each morning was magical and Abdul (the night porter) couldn't have done any more to help - despite the language barrier. The Riad was in a perfect location for visiting ALL of Marrakech and we would absolutely return! I would recommend it to everyone.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexfrance0
Riad Andalla,aelfred wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Great Riad with a warm welcome,This was such an amazing place to stay on our first visit to Marrakech. Christophe organised a taxi from the airport then a guide (with a barrow for our luggage) to lead us to the riad. We would never have found it on our own! However it is in a really good position close to Djemaa al-anfa and all the sights of the Medina. The view from the beautifully furnished terrace of the square and the snow capped Atlas mountains to the south is hypnotic. We spent a long time just gazing at it all in amazement. Christophe's advice about how to get around what to see and what to avoid was invaluable and meant we made the most of our visit. Breakfast on the terrace served by the charming Abdul was delicious and varied a little each day. We also had dinner at the riad on our first night and that was very good too. Our room was prettily decorated but was a tad small for us and all our stuff so when I return I would try to book a slightly bigger one. As others have said all the team were cheery and helpful - we really felt at home.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aelfred
Riad Andalla,giddygal19 wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Excellent place to stay!,The location of this riad is excellent. its very close to the main square and has a lovely roof top terrace where they serve a great free breakfast. While you are eating breakfast you can watch the merchants setting up for the day. At night the view of the square is amazing! Its also very close to the beginning of the souks. You must try the fresh orange juice in the square it is amazing! The raid is tucked away from the main road so you have to navigate a few small street/alleys to get there. We arranged transportation with Christophe to pick us up at the airport and they took us all the way to the riad which was excellent because I dont know if i would have found the place on our own. Christophe and the staff are fantastic and welcomed us with amazing mint tea. He answered all our questions and was very helpful. The staff were always smiling and although there are no real locks on the rooms i never felt unsafe. You have to buzz into the riad to be let in which is a nice safety feature. Its very quiet relaxing and beautiful. There was always pleanty of hot water and our 3 person suite was amazing (90 Euros/night). When we checked out Christophe give each of us a nice thank you metal bookmark which was a nice surprise.

Riad Andalla,Byroenius wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Truly a Gem,I could not find any faults about this Riad. Location wise it is absolutely just a stone throw away from Djemaa al-afna . And like the other reviews about the staff here they are truly a very admirable team. Always friendly and dependable. I must thank Christophe for having such a great staff as well as being a wonderful host. I enjoyed staying at this Riad. I never felt like a tourist because Christophe made us very comfortable and the place always inviting and quiet amidst the chaotic daily life outside the Riad. The Riad is beautifully decorated with a wonderful roof top terrace over looking the square... Magnificent view at night and day time as the Medina and the square come to life.

It was a great spot for breakfast and even better for the dinner we had the first night and it was the best chicken tajine we had during our entire stay! Christophe and his team were excellent giving some really good suggestions for places to eat hamam and other useful tips (such as how much to pay for taxis). The rooms themselves are small (as is the nature of the type of accomodtion) however we were not expecting the type of accomodation you may get in a large hotel outside of the medina we preferred the more authentic marrakechi experience.

Riad Andalla,ishan81 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Thank you trip advisor :),So I went to Marrakesh to propose to my girlfriend ( she said yes by the way so is now technically my fiancée ) . I had planned to go the Atlas mountains but before wanted to show her the hustle and bustle of the heart of Marrakesh . After reading reviews on here I chose the Andalla and boy was it the best choice I made. My job means I travel all around the world and I have stayed in a lot of hotels and I can pretty much afford to say anywhere I want. If you are looking for a Hilton or a marriot this is not it . This is far better. It’s a taste of an authentic Moroccan experience. First of all to get to the Riad you go through these winding side streets . ( our driver from the airport  arranged by the riad knew exactly where to take us ) . Felt like i was in an Indiana Jones movie . When we got to the hotel we were greeted by the owner Christoph. He was really friendly and made the place feel like home straight away. The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated . Again this isnt a Hilton so no TV or marble floor but it was clean and very chic and more than I hoped for. Christoph and Abdulla were great they knew all the best / safe places to eat and go. Walking with Christoph in the main square was like walking with a celeb . Everyone stopped to shake his hand or give him a cheeky salute. I definitely felt like I was connected. But the Pièce de résistance ( see my French is getting better Christoph :)) was the roof Terrace that over looked the Djemaâ el Fna: The view is breath-taking and gives the opportunity to take a step back and people watch without being in the mix. ( Check out pics on the website it actually looks like the photo ) . Breakfast was great up on the terrace and the crepes and mint tea was amazing. ( Abdul the night watcher  made the best Mint tea I had in Marrakesh all week .. he had a special recipe only he knew . It was really addictive a must try if you stay there. ) All in all I would go back in a heart beat. We both missed the banter views and hospitality we received at the Andalla after we left. If you have read this far down my review. My last bit of advice is to you is book now you won’t regret it . It’s my best find on Trip advisor so far. Thanks again Christoph and the rest of the staff for a trip we won’t ever forget.

Riad Andalla,MrsGorgeous wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Absolutely Fabulous,"The Riad Andalla is perfectly situated in the heart of the Medina just moments from the Djema El Fna. The terrace has an amazing view of the square which changes as the day goes on into night and the square turns into a open air restaurant where you can eat very well for very little money.  The Andalla is immaculate - clean and fresh - the staff very helpful and accommodating but Christophe and Andre are the most delightful owners of the little piece of heaven amid the madness that is Marrakesh!!!  We were made to feel so welcomed when we arrived and felt like we had know them for ever. Both me and my friend fell in love with them both. Their personality's and attention to detail and willingness to make your stay as easy as possible is truly something that is rare - especially in tourism!  There are no keys at the Andalla so the responsibility of that ""ol chestnut of who has and where are the keys"" etc. It really is a home from home.  Nothing is too much trouble all staff are kind and caring and very friendly.  I am going to be 50 this year and I have to say the stairs were not a problem for me and I found the rooms delightful in fact the whole place is full of lovely trinkets and artifacts something to please the eye without being over the top . The bathrooms are finished in the traditional style of Tadklact which is used in the Hammams it stops the steam to penetrate the walls and cause damp. It is a beautiful traditional and silky finish that is also easy to keep clean The toilets do not smell but on the whole the drainage system in Marrakesh is a bit smelly so it is important to pop the shower plug down with your foot when finished to prevent any whiff!!!!!!!!  You can eat at the Andalla traditional Tajine and Couscous etc - breakfast is simple and nice and served with a lovely welcome. There are many lovely restaurants that Christoph will point you in the right direction or organize reservations.

And for all our outings into de medina it was the best. The riad is well managed both the owners and all the staff are extremely nice and helpful. By far the best feature is the roof terrace where they serve breakfast and you could just lounge there all day under the sun reading a book and being very very happy. The rooms are ok but some are very small I guess for the price one can't ask for more really. Had a little hazzle with their arraged transport because at pickup it arrived late and bringing us to the airport made us walk unnecessarily too long dragging our bags.

I didn't have much time to get plan my trip before leaving but it was never an issue as Christophe and his team were attentive to my booking requests always prompt to respond and helped make all the arrangements for pick-up upon arrival in Marrakech dinner preparation day trips spa reservations etc. It's a place that makes you feel like home away form home: people welcome you with wide smiles call you by your name sit down with you to ask how your day was and will help you figure out how to have the most amazing time in Marrakech no matter what you want to do. In fact Christophe and/or his team will personally sit down with each new guest to give them a run down of Marrakech help you figure out the good places to check out help book excursions spas restaurants and anything else. It's family. I ended up getting a cold/flu while there and Christophe and his team promptly offered me hot tea and medicine. The place is smack dab in the middle of the action but when you enter the Riad it's peace and quiet. Rooms are on the smaller side but a very artfully decorated and give you a homely cozy feel. This place attracts good wholesome people who often spend their evenings hanging out in the lounge area sharing stories of the day's travels.

Riad Andalla,tsylee wrote a review Feb 2012,50,If Carlsberg made Riads...,We have just returned from a wonderful trip to Marrakech that was made extra special by Christophe and his wonderful team at Riad Andalla - they were like a second family to us. We especially appreciated Christophe's orientation chat and advice on sight-seeing and safe places to eat. As other reviews have already stated the Riad is fabulously located just moments off the square and within easy reach of just about everything but what makes it extra special is the care and attention that Christophe Andre and their team lavish on their guests without being intrusive.    We fully intend to return to Marrakech and will definitely book at Riad Andalla again.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jersey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsylee

Riad Andalla,Wildlifewatcher wrote a review Feb 2012,50,The view from the terrace is wonderful,This is my second trip to Marrakesh and I did not hesitate to book Riad Andalla again. You do compromise on the space and comfort in the rooms for the terrace and its views but it is well worth it. I also know if it had the same room standards as some of the other Riads combined with the view then I would not be able to afford it.    The roof terrace is fantastic. To sit and watch the square is very special. However my favourite time is watching the sun come up over the mountains and the first light hitting the square as it comes to life. For me this is simply magic. Follow this by one of the best breakfast we have received in Morocco and there is simply no better way to start the day.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wildlifewatcher
Riad Andalla,SeetheWorld62 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,The Riad Andalla--Our Home Away from Home,What a wonderful experience! The Riad Andalla run by the delightful knowledgeable and personable Christophe and Andre (with wonderful help from Abdul and the staff) is located a short walk from the Jemaa El Fna. It is as others have noted amazingly quiet and tranquil--a wonderful respite from the mayhem and adventure that is the Souk and the Square (replete with snake charmers with flutes--and cobras food stalls and zillions of people).The rooms common area and terrace are beautifully appointed with Moroccan paintings painted doors pottery rugs furniture and antiques giving an authentic ambience. But practically speaking the location is superb the breakfasts are delciious there was always lots of hot water and we received wonderful suggestions and help for our itinerary in Marrakech--including restaurant suggestions a cooking class the best hammam in town a trip with car and driver to the Atlas mountains best museums and sights a glass of wine when we wanted one and a tasty tagine in the Riad one evening after a tiring day trouping all over town. We hope we have the opportunity to be in Marrakech again--and to stay at the Riad Andalla. We liked Christophe and Andre so much we invited them to visit us! About us: we travel all over the world for business--and pleasure--so we think we're good at recognizing great people and great places to stay. The Riad Andalla makes our list! Lots of languages are spoken well here and they will arrange for transportation from the airport (recommended for first time visitors to get your bearings).,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bay Area, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeetheWorld62

Riad Andalla,TraveldaWorldb4Idie wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Close to the action but far enough away!,We booked the Riad from the recommendations on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed.  Christophe is an absolute star!  He was our travel agent and PA the whole time we were there. Nothing was too much trouble for him and he gives you his mobile number!!    We arrived Christmas Eve having traversed the main square and it's madness to the lovely calm of Riad Andella.    The room was lovely - compact but with everything we needed.    The Roof Terrace - just perfect. A great view of the main square. You can listen and absorb the atmosphere from the comfort of the terrace. Breakfast also served here which was just what was needed to start your day off.    The restuarant recommendations by Christophe are spot on. Listen to him! Pepe Nero = no 1.    All the staff are lovely and friendly even if we had a little language barrier with no French!!    You will no be disappointed. It ticks every box!

Not only is the place beautiful it is absolutely spotlessly clean - I would challenge anybody to find a speck of dust!  Perhaps Andalla's biggest asset however is Christophe and his fantastic team.

Riad Andalla,jrt007007 wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Like a home from home,"If you like the idea of a riad where you effectively have your own space within a community or maybe even a family.. then you will love this peaceful tranquil and welcoming place within two minutes walk of the craziness of the Jamaal El Fna square offering a great counterbalance to it.    Christophe and Andre are two of lifes animated characters and could not have been more friendly and helpful. Being used to travelling for business myself and my special companion found a great deal of pleasure in the human contact that a riad brings instead of the impersonal ""service"" offered by so many chain hotels. Christophe takes a great deal of time with every guest to make sure they get all they can from Marrakech and the surrounding areas..I recommend you take him up on his suggestions as we did and were certainly not disappointed.    Found the Andalla through tripadvisor and am happy to report that it lives up to the positive reviews of the users...Well priced spotlessly clean and a great team.

Riad Andalla,kayvanjouza wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Riad Andalla December 2011,The Riad Andalla is a beautiful hotel ideally located for the square Djema el Fna. Even though it is located close to the square it is in a quiet place and as soon as you enter the establishment you feel a sense of tranquil and serenity which lets you rest from the hustle and bustle of this busy square.  The hotel is wonderfully decorated in a typical Morrocon style and the view of the square from the terrasse is absolutely stunning.  But as it is always said it is the people that make a place and this is very true of the Riad Andalla. Christophe and Andre along with their staff member are all very welcoming and very friendly.

Riad Andalla,clarkUtvik wrote a review Dec 2011,50,"My second time, and its even better",This was the second time I visited the Riad Andalla and it just gets better and better.    The only challenge is to actually get booked a room. The owners and hosts André and Christophe has become very popular with their lovely welcoming place of residence very close to the great and famous place Jamaa El Fna.    I feel at home and are looked upon as an Arab prince.    Breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace or inside with the other guests. The atmosphere and Christophe André creates is special in a particular country. Here you are safe and this is your home in Marrakech.    I recommend this place to anyone going to Morocco.

Riad Andalla,Sandra L wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Heart of the Medina,Location Location Location....    If the Djemaa el Fna is the heart of Marrakech then Riad Andalla is where you can feel the pulse. We observed the Djeema from the roof terrace of the Andalla then within minutes were down in the square immersed in the atmosphere the food stalls the souks the entertainers. Then when the craziness of the Djeema became overwhelming we retreated to the sanctuary and sanity of the Andalla ;-).    Like a wave life in the Djeema started at a gradual pace in the morning gained momentum during the day and rose to a crescendo every night. The opportunity to observe the morning call to prayer from the roof terrace was surreal.    Accomodation is comfortable and immaculately clean service excellent and friendly and breakfast on the roof terrace was exquisite. A selection of good-value authentic moroccan food stalls/cafes/restaurants were recommended by Christophe and Andre. They also arranged a trip to the Oulrika Valley where the scenery was eye-poppingly gorgeous.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Jersey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandral775

Breakfast normally served on the roof terrace which has excellent views of the square was served inside in the beautiful courtyard in the centre if the RIad whilst we stayed as it was a little wet and cold.    What really made this Riad stand out though was the friendly and thoughtful service that we received throughout our stay. Christophe & Andre who own the Riad gave some great recommendations and were happy to book restaurants and spas for us. They were more than accommodating with any requests and we even received an upgrade after returning for our final night from a three day trip to the Atlas Mountains and Dessert. We were well looked after in the evenings by Abdul who made us some amazing Berber tea one night.

Despite being so close to the stalls and souks it was a peacefull clean classy place that was well above our expectations. Christophe and his team couldn't have been more helpfull and welcoming. After a day wandering around Marrakech we decided to get adventourous and headed to the desert mountains and coast and the Riad organised all of this at very reasonable rates. It was a home from home. Any time we wanted a drink or anything at all it was no problem. It relaay added to our holiday and I couldn't recommend it highly enough.

The owner Christophe and his staff are very welcoming and service minded. They really make you feel at home from the moment you enter the riad.  At the arrival you get all the information needed routines at the riad places to goto taxi fares.  The location is excellent with a view over both Jamaa al Fna and the Atlas mountains.

Riad Andalla,TheRealEngineer wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Great stay but not for everyone!,"Let me start off by explaining why the RIad Andalla is not for everyone!    If you are the kind of person who thinks that a holiday is about flying off somewhere ""exotic sounding"" but you don't really care where as you just spend your time sunbathing by the pool then the Riad Andalla is not for you!    If your ideal holiday is an ""all you can eat and drink resort"" so you can get drunk every night then the Riad Andalla is not for you!    If your ideal holiday accomodation is an identikit hotel chain where you wake up and could be in Marrakech Montreal Manchester or Milan you guessed it the Riad Andalla is not for you!    On a slightly more serious note a Riad is a traditional Moroccan house which means no lifts so if you are someone with reduced mobility then you may struggle here. They do have a ground floor room and I am sure the staff would bring your breakfast to the ground floor but part of the attraction here is the view from the roof terrace.    Christophe and his team at the Riad Andalla are fantastic. When we checked in he drew us a map of the area (the Riad entrance is on a back street - but never felt dangerous in any way) and suggested a number of things to see and do the only let down for me was one of the restaurant suggestions which as you can see here on Tripadvisor    http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d1119599-Reviews-Dar_Essalam-Marrakech.html    has shall we say mixed reviews - if I have time I will add my review of the restaurant.    In all our time nothing was too much trouble for the staff and when was the last time you stayed in a hotel and the owner gave you his mobile phone number in case of problems?    If I had to be a tiny bit picky then the rooms could have used some extra storage space. Also the wi-fi was a bit slow and sometimes stopped working (if that sort of thing is important to you).    Apart from the fantastic staff the highlight for me was the afore mentioned roof terrace. Sitting up there having breakfast or watching the sun go down over the Jamaa el Fna amazing!    Overall really enjoyed our stay and would gladly return in the future.",Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheRealEngineer

Marrakech is a frantic busy city and it was great to have this fabulous retreat to go back to. The location is perfect! So close to Jma el Fnaa without being in the thick of it.

Christophe met with us and ran through a couple of key things to see which was a real help as we only had a few days to fit everything in. The hammam and restaurants he recommended were both top notch and very reasonable for what you got.    The location of the riad is brilliant. A few minutes from the square with the souks and all the restaurants you could need on your doorstep.

Riad Andalla,Oxfordrichard wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Lushiously outstanding,A truly magical place that's simply head-and-shoulders above anything else on offer. The big difference with Andalla is this - the magic is not only in the Riad's atmospheric physical beauty the sumptuous sexy rooms it's serenity-infused roof terrace or its lush decor. It's more than that - it's in the people who own run and clearly. love Andalla.    Christophe and Andre don't just own Andalla - they nurture it as a place that they genuinely want others to experience and enjoy. You can feel their laid back enthusiasm all over the Riad and they genuinely make you feel like you're experience is important to them. It's far more than just 'having a happy customer' with them - you sense it's deeply personally important to them that you enjoy your stay. This shows through in every single aspect of service style and effort at Riad Andalla.    And after all that there's still one more gem in Andalla's crown that comes to life in the evening. Abdul who is the night custodian at the Riad is charismatic honest funny and as warm a host as you could wish to meet. Nothing is too much.    Riad Andalla is the kind of place with standards that makes other hoteliers jealous. And rightly so it's outstanding.    If you went to Marrakesh and hated detested and loathed Marrakesh itself but stayed in Andalla it'd still be one of your favourite holidays ever.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Oxford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oxfordrichard

It is a beautifully decorated traditional Riad situated within 2 minutes walk of the main square (Jemaa el Fna) at the heart of Marrakech old town and 5 mins from the Souks. From the rooftop terrace the view is truly spectacular.    Christophe was an excellent host (even from initial emails regarding arrivals times and sorting out airport transfer) - nothing was too much trouble. He was brilliant at pointing out places to go and how to get there and we will never forgot his map drawing skills! The rest of his staff were just as inviting and there is a special mention for Abdul who was there to great us at the door at any time day or night! (No keys are provided you literally knock to be let in).    The rooms themselves are small but were adequate as we were only in there to sleep and wash! They are also fully air conditioned which was a must in the september heat.    Breakfast was home made and usually served on the terrace except when there is bad weather. It is all pastries breads and preserves of all kinds of fruit (orange fig prune . . . .) freshly squeezed orange juice tea or coffee.    Overall - highly recommended to anyone wishing to experience the true heart of Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rode Heath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stinny13
Riad Andalla,Jock-75London wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Tres Bon!,Great Riad very centrally located and only a short walk to the market. All of the staff are fantastic with a special mention for Christophe (owner) and Abdul who could not be more welcoming. Rooms are very comfortable and have AC (very useful). Christophe will also arrange for you to be picked up from the airport (even if dont ask and he doesn't tell you - keep an eye out for a board with your name on as I missed it).

Riad Andalla,Ron M wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Worthy of more,Many features make the Riad Andalla worthy of a higher placing amongst the Marrakech B&Bs.    Firstly there's Cristophe and Andre - better caring hosts (throughout my stay) I have yet to meet on my travels. Their input is personal without being intrusive and all guests are treated equally. From the arranged pick-up at the airport and escort to the Riad to the warmest friendliest welcome .... to sound advice regarding the Souks and restaurant recommendations based on local knowledge - not that the Riad's dinners are bad at all - far from it! Thank you Jamila.    The rooms are small comfortable and sooo clean thanks to the team of ladies. Thank you Jamiaa Ouria and Atika. But special mention is reserved for Abdul the overnight minder who is a real star. He has little English it seems but matched with my bad French - we had amazing 'conversation'. I was especially grateful for his escort through the derbs for a 0500hr rendezvous.    By no means last there is the location - hidden behind cafes on the Jemaa el Fna with a superb rooftop terrace overlooking all the action from breakfast to sunset and dinner - a truly magnificent ever-changing spectacle. I am not aware of another like it.    Come stay and enjoy!,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Dunfermline, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SrRonaldo

Extremely friendly and homely...will definitely return.,We stayed in Riad Andalla for 7 nights and by far it's been the best place I've stayed at whilst on holiday.  The staff are extremely friendly and always eager to help and make your stay comfortable. The owner Christophe was amazing...never met anyone so genuine and helpful! As we got there we were greeted with biscuits and mint tea on the terrace by Abdul (staff-incredibly friendly). Christophe throughout the 7 days was really helpful. He helped us plan our time there...gave us recommendations of what places to visit where to eat and what to see and directed us by drawing out maps...like I said really helpful and genuine! Our stay was extremely comfortable and homely the riad captured the culture if Marrakech and made out stay more worthwhile! The views from the terrace of djemma el fna was amazing. Would definitely recommend this riad to everyone...I will definitely be returning.

Riad Andalla,AIDA0888 wrote a review Jul 2011,50,Great quiet oasis,We loved everything about this Riad from its great location to the great hospitability of its owners and staff. Riad is located on the main square but the entrance is from the back alleys which is great because it is close to all the action yet peaceful enough. Terrace is great too whether for breakfasts in the morning or for relaxing in the evening while watching listening and smelling the main square everyday fiesta. Rooms are not too big but they have high ceilings and are beautifully decorated. In this Riad you don’t get a key for a room or the main entrance and you don’t need it because you feel like at home anyway. One night we left a purse on the terrace with all our money credit cards passports and other valuables and Abdu the night watchman returned it in 5 minutes. This is something you probably wouldn’t experience in a big hotel or even in some other Riads we have stayed in Morocco. Christophe and Andre (the owners) were there for us every day to help us with anything we needed (Getting around the city Restaurant reservation taxi reservation luggage storage etc.) and they are a great example of professional entrepreneurs who care about their guests and the whole service in their Riad.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zagreb, Croatia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AIDA0888

Riad Andalla,sweeth wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Riad Andalla- a great place for all!,We stayed at Riad Andalla for 5 nights in room Zouak (downstairs). Being two females we were concerned about the safety in Marrakech but please be assured that the Riad and surrounding area is VERY safe!    The Riad is situated 2 minutes away from the main square souks and is around 10-15 minute walk maximum away from sights.    The Breakfast at the Riad is simple with crepes/cake lovely fruit jams and refreshing orange juice.    We would like to say a very big thank you to Abdou (night watchman) who spoke very little English but we were still able to understand him. He was very helpful and we enjoyed his company and stories. Abdou also serves breakfast in the morning. The owner Christophe gave us a detailed insight on the first morning about eating places and directions which was useful! The girls at the Riad are very cheerful and you can always hear them talking laughing and smiling which is at times great to see and hear.    Free wifi is available at the Riad but at times can be slow so therefore one needs to be patient. However it works and is handy.    Overall we had a very pleasant stay at this family home. I didn't feel like i was miles away from London and Riad Andalla makes people feel very welcome and safe.

Riad Andalla,Ell06 wrote a review May 2011,50,Would definitely recommend to friends,"We had a great experience in Riad Andalla. Christophe the owner was very welcoming and helpful as were all the team who worked hard to maintain a fantastic ambiance. It was an adventure to find the Riad but once we arrived we were greeted with a mint tea and cookies.    The room was clean and the Riad itself was spacious and beautifully decorated. The terrace had an amazing view of the central square ""Jam El Fna"" which was entertaining to watch as the sun went down.    We didn't try the evening cuisine offered by the Riad but we did enjoy the traditional Moroccan breakfast served by Abdul.    Riad Andalla is a traditional Moroccan house that has an interior courtyard running through the core of the building. A cute little water fountain sits at the base of the courtyard it's purpose to catch rain water which may occasionally fall. (I'm British and unfortunately brought a bit of the Mancunian rain with me during our stay!). Due to the nature of a Riad and the central courtyard shared by all windows I would recommend that those individuals who are hyper sensitive to outside noise or louder groups choose a less traditional environment.    I have already recommended this accommodation to a colleague at work and would certainly book the same Riad again :-)",Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brianconnet, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ell06
Riad Andalla,FarawaydreamsLondon wrote a review May 2011,50,Amazing stay at Marrakech!,We spent 6 days in Marrakech and stayed at Riad Andalla just off the main square of Jamaal ef Na. Amazing  fantastic are the words we use to describe our stay. My husband and I travelled with my mum who is registered blind and has mobility issues - despite having no lift within the traditional riad my mum really enjoyed her stay. This was because of the incredible warmth and generosity that Christophe Andre Abdou and everyone at Riad Andalla showed us. Nothing was too much for them from directing us to fantastic sweet shops to getting an electrician in to change the bulb fitting in my mum’s room so she could have more light in her room! Besides the service its location and style made our journey even more rewarding. Beautifully decorated (which only reflected Christophe and Andre’s exquisite taste) it is 2 minutes from the main square close to everything and the only hotel which overlooked the square. We really miss the leisurely breakfast on the gorgeous roof garden and the hospitality that was shown to us made a simple breakfast into something very special. We love Morocco and Marrakech because of the cuisine the people the rich culture and history and the gorgeous scenery and now we have one more reason to go back to Marrakech.

Christophe the owner was very helpful and recommeneded palces to see in our short time there. The Riad has amazing views of the square and although it is noisy outside in the Riad we barely heard a thing! Even sitting on the roof terrace was calm and peaceful. Talking of the roof terrace what a perfect place to have breakfast each morning! Views one side of the market square turn around and you have the Atlas mountains! It was made extra special for us when my boyfriend proposed to me!  The rooms were small but perfectly formed! All themed in their own way. The staff were very helpful although Christophe was the only one who spoke English. Saying that we still managed to have an informative conversation with Abdul the night guy with his limited English and our limited French!  The only thing I would say is if you choose to stay in this or any other Riad make sure you get them to meet you in the square to show you where the Riad is. Marrakech is a maze of side streets and alleyways and you will never find the Riad on your own.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Beccles, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happychick1980
Riad Andalla,JMcC83F wrote a review Apr 2011,50,Friendly and welcoming - ideal location - great quality at a reasonable price,We stayed for three nights in April and had a fantastic time. Christophe and Andre were absolutely charming and the perfect hosts the staff were all very friendly and the service was superb. We particularly enjoyed practising our French which gave rise to a few laughs! It was a very smooth transfer from airport to riad and we would definitely recommend arranging this in advance. We greatly appreciated our excellent dinner on the roof terrace on our first evening and enjoyed our breakfasts there every morning (although my husband would have preferred croissants to pancakes!) Our room was very attractively decorated but we found the bed a bit hard (although some people might prefer that). After breakfast on our first morning Christophe gave us advice on how to get the best out of our stay in Marrakech where to go taxi fares etc and gave us some excellent recommendations for restaurants. You would never guess that he must do this for new guests every morning! For our return to the airport he even took the time to escort us through the square to our taxi. We were very upset to hear the dreadful news about the bomb in the square today and hope that this will not discourage anyone from visiting this fascinating and exciting city and staying in this friendly and welcoming riad.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMcC83F
Riad Andalla,IanMcCallum50 wrote a review Apr 2011,50,An experiance,An ideal location for discovering the centre of Marrakesh the Riad Andalla can be no more than a 100yds from the World famous place Jemaa elfna the rooftop garden has a wonderful view across the square especially at night. Christophe and Andre were perfect hosts they made us more than welcome and their humor and willingness to assist was far more than I and my wife expected. Christophe set time aside to point out places of interest and where and where not to visit which was very useful he also gave us his contact number if we need assistance when out and about thankfully this never arose.    The Riad Andalla is beautifully furnished inside our room (suite) although smaller than expected more than made up for size with its comfort and decor the shower was one of the best once you got a hang of the taps but remember to put the plug down when finished as like Andre explained the Marrakesh drainage system does not exactly smell of flowers.    I would recommend a meal at the Riad on your first night just as we did on the rooftop (weather Permitting). The food was fresh and very tasty and if you are a wine drinker you'll be pleasantly surprised by the local Moroccan white and Rose    One thing I must do is mention the staff employed at the Riad Abdou Attika Houria and Jamila. They are so polite and courteous forever have a smile on their faces and you genuinely feel that they enjoyed serving you.    The only criticism I would have of the Riad is that when we stayed there were also a group of middle aged women staying and because of the way that the Riad is built meant that when they were talking (and singing at 3:00am in the morning) you heard everything however this discomfort was only for two nights but I wouldn't recommend groups but it is ideal for couples.    When in the Medina be aware that there are no bars serving alcohol near the square where you can sit and watch the world go by but there are many serving coffee and the Moroccan specialty of mint tea (just couldn't get the grasp of this) however there is one alcohol serving bar called Kozybar which has a sun roof overlooking the Palais El Badiî and is well worth a visit for Lunch especially on a warm sunny day.    Marrakesh what did I think ? well once I had got over constant harassment in the Souks of the horse and carriage drivers the taxi drivers and the fella’s with strange hats in the square I did enjoy myself. My wife loved it and what I did notice was the number of young/middle aged woman visitors enjoying themselves and findingthe environment perfectly safe.    Two words of warning don't accept what you think is a friendly free guide around the tannery there will be a price at the end. In my case I knocked him down from £10 to £2.

Without any doubt the highlight of our trip was Riad Andalla. The location is second to none being incredibly central to the Djemma al Fna Square – which after a day of shopping in the Souks is so very appreciated. The roof terrace is an oasis of calm and beauty atop the dust and hustle and bustle of Marrakesh and a real sun trap. Christophe and Andre the proprietors became true friends and were fantastic in every respect providing hairdryers and even weighing scales for us to check our luggage weight for the return journey. A special mention has to go to Abdou who despite having limited English managed to communicate perfectly and really looked after us. Each of the rooms have their own very distinct style and personality and it was such a beautiful place to stay that I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone visiting Marrakech.

If you do end up at Riad Andalla ask Christophe to help you with a day trip to the Atlas Mountains. He will sort you with your own driver and a guide takes you up to some awesome mountain ranges and waterfalls ... some treks are a littel adventurous ... be careful!!    Its been a few months in writing this review ... but still miss Andalla the breakfasts on the roof in the sun! And most of all Marrakesh.

Riad Andalla,Riccardo2002 wrote a review Feb 2011,50,A Real Gem in Marrakech,Firstly I have to say that I choose Riad Andalla for the great Location just few minutes away from Plaza Jemaa El Fna.  It has a great terrace and Christophe Andrea and all their staff are really nice and great.  I felt at Home because they make you feel at home away from home.  Definitely I will suggest them for other stays and hope to be there again.

Riad Andalla,Luiz Fernando Niquet wrote a review Jan 2011,50,"Very beautiful Riad, with excellent location.",This is a very beautiful Riad very nicely decorated and with a perfect location just a couple of minutes from the square. This central location makes Riad Andalla a great place to rest after few hours of wandering around in crazy Marrakesh. Despite beeing just close to Djema El-Fna the Riad is not easy to find in the first time so it may be worth to arrange a pick-up from the airport or from the entrance of the medina. But after the first time it becomes easy to find your way to and from the square.    The place is very clean and well kept and the service is great and friendly especially from Abdul who was always willing to help despite the difficulties in communication because we spoke almost no french at all. Chistopher the owner is also very helpful and speaks English with helped us a lot. On the first day he gave us a map of the city and some tips about where to eat what to do and see which made things easier for our first time visit to the city.    The Riad has a lovely terrace where we had our breakfast. The view of Djema El-Fna was priceless. The breakfast was good if a bit simple (maybe some eggs yogurt or cereals would make it more filling).    The Riad is very calm and quiet and we had very quiet nights. In that aspect the Riad surprised me very positively because I was a bit worried about the noises from the medina and the prayer calls. We slept very well and did not hear anything during the nights.    The Riad offers free wi-fi internet which is very usefull. We had some trouble getting a connection from our room and had to go to the lobby to use the internet where it usually worked better even though sometimes we experienced some instability.    The price we paid for a double (EU$70) was a bit high for the Moroccan standarts but Riads are usually kind of expensive especially in Marrakesh and the service was indeed very personal and efficient. At the end it was worth the extra-expense and the Riad turned out to be one of the warmest memories of our 16-days Moroccan trip.    I certantly recommend this place and if one day I return to Marrakesh will definetly stay here again.,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luizniquet
Riad Andalla,KaterinaR-B wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Perfect location,A perfectly well placed Riad. 5' from the Jamaa El Fnaa Square yet very quiet. Everything to see in Marrakesh is wakable from there. The owners are very helpful with their local advice. The Riad is immaculate cleaned every day. Eating breakfast on the terrace overlooking the Square is unique; so is having their home cooked dinner at night and overlooking the Square full of life as it only happens in Marrakesh. A unique experience. Perfect destination for a long weekend.

Riad Andalla,Bluebirdfan wrote a review Dec 2010,50,Great stay and a magical time in Marrakech,This was my 3rd visit to Marrakech and I have previously stayed in lower rated accommodation but as we were staying for 4 nights we decided to pay a little more and I saw the reviews of Riad Andalla on Tripadvisor - all the previous reviewers were very complimentary and they were very right - this is definitely a great place to stay.  Most importantly is the friendly welcome you get from Christophe and his partner Andre - two ex-pat French men who own and run the place. They were really friendly and helpful and they have some great staff working for them including Adbul (the night porter). All the other staff who prepare breakfast and the rooms were always smiling and friendly. It really was a happy place to stay which is nice.  Rooms - the Riad has 8 rooms and we had one of their smaller rooms with ensuite facilities but it was very tastefully decorated it had hanging space and the bathroom always had hot water. We didn't spend much time in the room because the Riad has a lovely shaded terrace overlooking the main square and lots of other areas where you can just chill out and get away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.  Location - it is just behind the Cafe de France in the main square so is perfectly located although it does take a little time to find the first time as the Medina is full of alleyways but after first time we had no problems finding it again. The main square is only 2 or 3 minutes away.  Help & Advice - although we had previously visited Marrakech we got some great advice and recommendations from Christophe of places to eat and visit. All his suggestions were spot on. We also got him to organise a private excursion to the Ourika Valley which was very good. We could have done it cheaper by joining a group mini bus excursion but the driver Christophe arranged spoke great english and was very friendly and made it a great trip - many thanks to Adil our driver & guide for a great day.  Marrakech is either a place you love or hate - like most places in the Muslim world you get woken early by the call to prayer and some of the streets in the old city are dirty and grubby and you always get people trying to sell you stuff in the souks but Marrakech is a magical place and when we go back again we will be contacting the Riad Andalla as it is very welcoming and friendly place - definitely somewhere we would like stay again.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shinjuku 3 Chome, Japan",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bluebirdfan
Riad Andalla,sprussell wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Great place to stay in Marrakech.,"First time in Marrakech. Some points to ponder:  1. Don't think you can show up and find a Riad. The alleyways are a nightmare to navitgate on your own especially if carrying bags. It is only fun once you get settled in.  2. Don't show up without the riad's phone number and knowing how to dial in a foreign country.  3. This hotel has a website with a good map; hotels.com does not. I paid for this mistake.  Points on the riad:  1. The riad was great once we found it (again our fault). The rooms were simple but clean and comfortable with heat and AC.  2. The food was simple and carb-focused but delicious and sufficient (especially if you plan on sampling food in d'Jema al-Fna...which you should).  3. The location was great once you found it. It took about 3 minutes to get to the square once you left.  4. After immersing yourself in the market all day and inevitably being overwhelmed it is great to sit on the roof drink a beer (though they only have one kind) and relax.  5. The ambiance staff and owners were great and create a wonderful atmosphere.  6. Don't let a cab driver drop you off at a random gate he convinces you is ""just down the road"" from the riad. See above but you will never find it.  I will stay here again when we go back; great value location and ambiance.

Riad Andalla,clarkUtvik wrote a review Nov 2010,50,Your home in Marrakech,Are you going to Marrakesh for the first time or know the city as your pocket; RIAD ANDALLA is the place we recommend as your home.    Order:  We (four friends) studied Tripadviser for hours to find an accommodation that matched our criteria for a residence in Marrakech. RIAD ANDALLA was our choice.  As a first impression the owners' response was quick and gave us the feeling of being in professional hands. At arrival at Marrakech Airport we were picked up by the riads car which we certainly recommend for a price that is included in the bill at the RIAD. No hassle with a price for the driver; which is always nice to get a smooth start at arrivals.    The reception;  The reception at the RIAD was Royal with lovely tea and laughter. Christopher and André (the French owners) was very helpful with the order of tables in restaurants finding good Hamam and find the right rental firm that gave us the security you need in a situation with a car etc. The atmosphere was cozy and we felt right at home. They are super friendly without having to sit on your lap and get too close. After five minutes we felt safe and did not think that there was equipment valuables and other for $ 10000 slap in the room with no lock.    Localities;  Christophe and André have taken care of the authentic Arab style in the four-storey house. There are different rooms and I enjoyed probably the best suites with more space. There were comfortable beds and duvets that rarely experienced in the country with blankets to be first. I have a little dust allergy but did not notice it particularly. There was good pressure in the shower BUT remember to close the hatch strange smell from the pipes.    Location:  The largest values of staying in RIAD ANDALLA the location and the amazing rooftop view over Jemaal Fna Square. It gives a kick (eye candy) at breakfast and not least for the dinner with a atmosphere that you miss when you get home. (The RIAD) it's easy to find when you manage to locate the Café France and which corner to turn to the right. The stress and pace of the streets is totally absent in the RIAD is quiet as in a church and the perfect place to read or even write a book.    Food;  The first evening Christopher fixed a table for us at the French restaurant Kanyama was a great experience. Sunday made the Arab girls at RIAD food that was delicious. Recommended. Eating food on the roof was in a class by itself. One evening we will never forget. Just do it!    In summary:  Riad Andalla has a perfect location the price is competitive the staff is great the lovely food in the roof terrace in an entirely separate class the place has no bargain kings that sucks up money and I can with my hand on heart recommend the place for you and yours. But book early; it was quickly becomes full. Next time Chris & André!!,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Oslo, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clarkUtvik

From providing us with recommendations of places to eat and visit what to pay for taxi rides and where not to venture after dark was all very helpful.

Riad Andalla,Bagette wrote a review Oct 2010,40,"Wonderful, cute little place!","I stayed in Riad Andalla late Sept/early Oct 2010. Riad Andalla is an excellent but not perfect wonderful little place! Why isn't it perfect? As a solo traveler I was given the smallest room. It was cute but not very spacious. I used the second single bed to hold my luggage but if I had been traveling with someone I have no idea where we would have put our things. Also the room was dark (I like lots of light especially when I'm trying to get ready) the water pressure in the bathroom was nearly non-existent and the bed was very hard for my ""princess and the pea"" tastes.    Other than those relatively minor things (most of which I actually expected) Riad Andalla is wonderful! The location is absolutely perfect! Getting there the first time is confusing but once you figure it out it is relatively simple: literally a two minute walk or less from Djemma el Fna. You can see the terrace from the Square; it is just behind Cafe de France. ... The staff are very kind and welcoming though Andre seems to be the only one to speak much english. The breakfasts are absolutely yummy and both the terrace and courtyard/lobby areas are beautiful. And the wi-fi is definitely a nice touch! Gave me the opportunity to update friends and family on my adventures which was definitely appreciated.    All in all I highly recommend Riad Andalla. Just don't expect a 5 star quality bed! :-) ...

The taxi dropped us off on the edge of Djemaa el Fna we were greeted by a little old man & his cart he took us through the square down a couple of back alleys to our Riad. I must say we did wonder where we were going it was around 7pm so it was buzzing with activity a little crazy but exciting!! On entering the Riad we were amazed tastefully decorated very authentic cosy I could go on & on! The rooms are on the small side but we didn't spend much time in them.We'd pre-booked a meal on the rooftop terrace which was delish and fab views of the Djemaa el Fna.Christophe is the perfect host always on hand with a smile advice anddespite what he thinks extremely good English ;-) Andre Abdhool & the ladies make up the rest of the 'family' that we felt part of.

Riad Andalla is located in an excellent location with quick and safe access to Djemna El Fna. When returning from a day or evening of exploring the last thing you want is to take another 20 or 30 minute walk to your riad - Andalla is truly minutes off the square. When you do get to Andalla you'll find yourself in a wonderful serene and beautiful place. The lobby rooms and terrace have wonderful ambiance.

Second even though located so close to the hustle and bustle the Riad is extremely quiet and peaceful.    Finally and perhaps most importantly is how impressive and friendly the staff is: if you stay here you will get to know Christophe André Abdou Attika Houria and Jamila. They will let you be if you like but they are also always cheerful and smiling and willing to give you any help you need.    I do not speak a word of French: I speak English and Spanish. Christophe speaks very good English. The rest of the staff and I had some humorous moments trying to communicate with one another. I had mint tea every evening with Abdou. Breakfast on the roof every morning was a great experience. Christophe was very good about giving me instructions on how to find my way around the Medina (NOT an easy thing!!!).    I hope to go back to Marrakesh some day and I would definitely stay here and I would definitely recommend this place to others.

We booked a taxi through the Riad on arrival and are so glad we did the driver takes you right to the door (can't bring the car right in so have to walk right into the centre!) there is no way that you would be able to find it alone! on arriving Christophe spent some time with us and went through best places to eat and suggestions of where to go which was fab. Christophe and his team make you feel so welcome and nothing is too much for them.  Christophe even reserved us seats on the bus to Essaouria.  We had our evening meal on the roof terrace on the first night - and although it seemed expensive it was by far the nicest meal we had whilst we were in Marrakesh. and the views just make the whole experience magical.  My Only quarm was that the rooms were so small but you're right in the centre so its to be expected!  The roof terrace is lovely when we were tired from walking around we would just chill upstairs with a book and you feel like you're in your own bubble whilst everything is going on down in the square.

Riad Andalla,PSkinner83 wrote a review Aug 2010,40,Amazing view,We ended our 2 week trip of Morocco in Marakech and stayed 2 nights at Riad Andalla. Our favourite part of our stay was sitting on the gorgeous roof terrace at night whilst watching the goings on in the main square. Our room was fine typically dark being a Moroccan riad but we had no door on our bathroom although whilst out on the first day they did hang a curtain for us. The drains smelled which is fairly typical of traditional Moroccan houses it seems. The only thing we found a little strange was that you could not lock your bedroom door from the outside and there was occassionally non-guest and non-staff people in the riad probably business contacts of the owners so we did find that slightly uncomfortable. Overall though it was a pleasant place to stay although I would never return to Marakech again as I found it a very stressful experience despite being used to the Moroccan culture. I think the mopeds that run around the small market streets should be banned!

Things that I didn't enjoy:  i) The accommodations are... ""rustic"". Our room had a smell that we thought came from the sewer but in hindsight I think it was the air conditioner - there was likely mould or something that caused it to smell.  ii) The pictures are deceiving - the rooms are very small.  iii) The bathrooms are very old and the room that we were in didn't have a door to the bedroom.  iv) The walk from the square into the Riad appears unsafe... I'm sure it's okay but my wife was scared the entire time and I can't imagine a group of women being comfortable.    All in all it was a decent experience highlighted by the people. I'm more of a 5-star hotel person who decided to do something out of the norm. We ended up spending a lot of time at Hotel Les Jardins de la Koutoubia at the pool (for a fee) which was excellent.

Riad Andalla,theflyingfish wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Perfect riad in superb location,Riad Andalla review    We arrived through the maze of narrow crumbling alleys that lead to Riad Andalla in torrential rain helped with our luggage by Christophe and his staff who met us at the taxi on the other side of Djemaa el Fna - a walking distance of about 600metres. Inside the calm and colourful Riad was a warm welcome. We were instantly offered mint tea in the cosy sitting area whilst we admired the authentic Moroccan style of the superbly restored Riad.  Upstairs the bedrooms were small beautifully decorated and well-appointed with comfortable beds air-conditioning (used as heating in winter) and en-suite shower room.  There is a roof terrace where breakfast is served on nice days which has views of Djemaa el Fna and the Atlas Mountains in the distance. Breakfast usually consisting of plentiful crepes bread jam honey cake and coffee is very good.  The level of service was excellent except one hiccup where we had booked and confirmed restaurant meal on the first night but it never happened. Abdul - who is a member of staff who is seems always to be there from serving breakfast to last thing at night - took us to a nearby restaurant instead. He was very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. It helps if you can speak a little French though as he doesn't have much English. Christophe the proprietor speaks English and will arrange trips and give advice about what to see. He arranged a private taxi tour for us through the Ourika valley to the village of Setti Fatma just inside the Toubkal national Park which I can recommend.  The location of the Riad is superb in the centre of the Medina a couple of minutes walk from the bustling Djemaa el Fna with food stalls restaurants snake charmers musicians and storytellers and close to the Souks Koutoubia and Mouassine Mosques and Madrassa Ben Youssef. The narrow alleyways are perfectly safe but it would be difficult to find the Riad on your own the first time so I would recommend taking the taxi transfer offered by the Riad.  If you want to try to reach the Riad yourself take a Taxi and ask for Hotel Ali (taxis are not allowed any closer in the Medina). Find your way to Djemaa el Fna square and look for Cafe de Paris at one end then take the street down the side of the Cafe. After about 75m take the alley on the right then take first right off this alley. Go to the end and turn right again at the T-junction then left and Riad Andalla is on the left.  Overall Riad Andalla was a superb and atmospheric place to stay with friendly staff and in an ideal location for exploring the Medina of Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theflyingfish

At Marrakech airport (after changing some money) a driver took us directly to the hotel where we were shown up to the beautiful roof terrace by Abdul for some mint tea and biscuits.  Christophe then showed us a map of what not to miss in Marrakech we were only there for 3 days which to be honest was enough time to get a real feel of the city!  You must book the dinner it's fab and visit Le Jardin Majorelle which Yves Saint Laurent loved it's really beautiful.  Ask Christophe for local tips he is a great source of info!

Riad Andalla,Fabregasuk wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Superb value in the middle of the action - and the best meal I've had in Morroco,The Riad is about as close to the main square Djemaa el Fna as possible and yet once inside you would never know it. It is literally one minute away and therefore in the heart of the Medina and moments away from the Souks but inside it is a peaceful tranquil environment.    I would describe this Riad as 'happy'. According to its owners it was (beautifully) restored over a period of three months less than 2 years ago after they bought it from a local family. The staff members are incredibly polite - full of smiles- and very happy to help. This is customer service unprecedented in Morocco and a far cry from the glum miserable service I experienced in the Riad Saba last year. A quick word on that Riad. The owners were so incompetent that when they replied to my review of their Riad they got me mixed up with another guest who had had a bad experience there! They started writing about me being refused breakfast because I had been late to the table. Actually I was well within time but was offered only bread. My friend - who looks Moroccan - went up an hour later and got the full works from the same miserable maid who had not been bothered to do anything for me! The owners of Saba should pay a visit to Andalla and find out how good manners and a happy staff will make for an excellent guest experience.    Back to the Andalla: the roof terrace is great for people watching and offers a fantastic view of the action especially at night. I was up there for an evening meal which was the best I have had in Morocco. It was four courses beautifully presented served with smiles and great pride by the staff. As a veggie I had tipped off the Riad in advance of my requirements and they provided me with the meal with no problem at all. It was delicious.    It is a small Riad - very narrow but not at all cramped. Their website accurately shows the size of the bedrooms - so what you see on their site is what you get. Mine was excellent - a very comfortable bed a good shower and a very beautiful wash bowl in the bathroom. It also benefitted from superb air conditioning an essential in Morocco.    The owners are highly professional and very friendly. They will use their local knowledge to help you and are very accommodating. They run a very good operation so it is little wonder that the place gets consistently high scores on Trip Advisor.    I would not only recommend this Riad to anyone on a budget - it is incredibly good value - but also to those who might be thinking about staying in a more expensive Riad or a hotel. Some of the rooms are not the biggest but you don't go to Morocco to stay in a room. Here you get a great atmosphere friendly and polite service help when you need it a superb view from the roof and delicious food.,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabregasuk
Riad Andalla,Noel1947 wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Superb touch of real hospitality,"During my stay in Marrakech I stayed at the Riad Andalla. From the beginning I could tell that I had chosen the right place. The rooftop terrace has superb view over the Jeema el Fna. Five star hospitality and food. The owners Andre and Christophe really looked after me in a friendly and charming way and gave sound and helpful advice. My room Kamar which as Abdou explained means 1000 moons was atmospheric beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Location could not have been better literally 1 minute from the square and souks and within walking distance to all the main sights. Abdou and other staff who prepared excellent meals were great. I still dream of the zucchini soup I had the first evening the grilled aubergines layered with cheese the various ""tangines"" the fruit salad as desert etc. all prepared in a wonderful manner and served with great care and a superb touch of real hospitality.",Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Lochristi, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noel1947
Riad Andalla,Fifteen_15_Cornwall wrote a review Jun 2010,40,Perfect location,We stayed here for two nights at the end of our 10 days in Morocco. We had been staying in Essaouira on the coast which is quite chilled and very slow paced in comparison to the madness of Marrakech! Fortunately Riad Andalla is quiet and peaceful despite being minutes from the place djemaa el fna which is hustling and bustling at all times of day. Christophe and Andre are very welcoming with a lot of local knowledge. We ate a delicious dinner on the terrace on our first night with amazing views of the square. The staff are very friendly and were incredibly welcoming to our 15 month old daughter nothing was too much trouble.,Date of stay: June 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fifteen_15_Cornwall

Our luggage was put in our room and we went straight onto the terrace to have our meal. It overlooked the main Jemaa el Fna square with all it's amazing activity as good a view as any you will find around the square. Location could not have been better literally 1 minute from the square and souks and within walking distance to all the main sights.

Riad Andalla,epst20 wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Brilliant from start to finish!,We had a wonderful time in Marrakech with thanks to Riad Andalla. We stayed for 4 nights and even before we arrived the service we received was very professional. We asked lots of questions via email and Christophe was always prompt in replying to us in English as we don't speak French. On the night of our arrival we booked the airport transfer and dinner which we highly recommend! The riad is located literally next to the main square but would still be hard to find if you didn't know where you were going. Dinner was excellent very good value and so much food! It made a great first night having dinner with the atmosphere and view of the square just below us. Our room was kept clean and tidy for us each day and the staff are most helpful. Abdul and the rest of the team are very friendly even if we had a language barrier but Abdul did his best to explain the local customs to us! Christophe and Andre were both very helpful. Christophe gave us many suggestions of places to visit and places to eat. He also organised a day trip for us out in the Ourika valley with a private driver and guide which was brilliant. All in all a most excellent riad and one we would highly recommend.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridgeshire, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epst20

Riad Andalla,Offtheeatentrack wrote a review May 2010,50,WOW!!!!,This was our first trip to Marrakech. It will not be our last. When we do come back we will be going back 'home' to Riad Andalla.  The pre arrival communication with Christophe was pleasant and very proffesional. Putting us at ease even before our arrival.  When we did arrive in Marrakech our transfer was waiting with a smile and a sign with our name and the name of the Riad. After changing some money we took the taxi to Andalla. Amazed by the hustle and bustle of the city we arrived at the door it was opened by the very smiley Abdu who welcomed us like old friends. The Riad is breathtaking an oasis of calm and beauty right in the middle of the busy medina. I heard my name being called from another floor in a swarthy french tone. Christophe! From start to finish he and Andre are the highlight of the property and it is an great property. He showed us up to the stunning terrace with postcard views over the Djeema el Fna. A mint tea and some homemade buiscuits and we were home.  Christophe took time to show us a map and reccomend a place to eat on the first night. He then went through all the best places to visit.  I cannot say enough about the people behind this Riad. Christophe and Andre are the best of hosts. Always a cheeky smile and time for a chat.  We booked a table on the terrace to have supper on the second night. What can I say Bravo Andre! Bravo! Fresh local food cooked with finesse and passion. A great treat.  I have been in the hotel business for 20 years now and am rarely blown away. This place and the people deserve great success.  Do not look any further book it now!  We will return 'home' soon.

The rooms and communal areas were spotless - really really clean. The roof terrace was not only a good resting place but also provides one of the best roof terrace views of the Medina. The location was great about a minute's walk from the Medina the rooms were well decorated and very comfortable. My husband and I didn't just feel like we were staying with good hosts we actually felt like part of their family. Christophe the owner took amazing care of us even when my husband fell ill towards the end of the holiday he was caring and helpful. I really felt like I wasn't alone.

Riad Andalla,LondonFroggy wrote a review May 2010,50,Loved it!,What else can I add to all the excellent reviews that this riad has had since its opening?  Staying in this riad was the best part of our holidays in Morocco: great location (you can walk everywhere) great view over the Place Jemaa El Fna and a peaceful environment which you need after the hustle and bustle of the Red City! And what shall I say about the food - I would recommend that you have dinner on the terrasse with the Place Jemaa El Fna as a background.  It was so different from the usual holidays when you stay anonymous in a hotel: this is more like staying at a friend's place.

This is a comfortable Riad where you are made to feel at home. Support staff are extremely courteous and care also about the guests. Being so close to Place Jemaa El Fna was great. We could walk almost everywhere. In the evening we had the spectacular view of the Place from the rooftop. Andre's cooking is to be savoured. The meals we ate here were excellent.

Riad Andalla,Wildlifewatcher wrote a review Apr 2010,30,Great terrace and staff,The owner says this is not a hotel it is a home with guests – which we like.    Like any home it has its wonderful people which are the staff. So helpful and cheerful even though we did not have a common language.    Also like any home it can have its problems. The taxi we booked to collect us from the airport was not there. We waited and waited and waited. We rang the Riad but there was no reply. Eventually we decided we did not want to haggle for a taxi and so got on the bus and asked to be put off at the main square. When we got out we rang the Riad again as we did not have a clue how to get there from the square. They answered but no one spoke English and so we could not make them understand. We then found a German guide (we speak German) and asked him to explain in French to the Riad where we were. He did and they told us to wait there and they would come and get us. It turned out we were only 2 minutes away but it was not a route anyone would have found for the first time on their own. All quite stressful and we were glad to have arrived. On the up side it should have been 15 euro for the taxi but it only cost 5 euro for the bus and tip. I don’t really understand why the Riad does not recommend the bus as it was very fast and clean and all they have to do is then pop round the corner to collect the guests.    We were taken to the roof terrace – which is fantastic – and enjoyed some mint tea. We were then taken to the room. The room was very small with a curtained off area behind which was the shower and toilet. Unfortunately within 10 minutes of being in the room water started pouring through the ceiling. We ran downstairs and by pointing we managed to make them understand the problem. They came and mobbed it up. Within half an hour the same thing happened again. The room was beginning to smell and our things were getting wet. Water started pouring down again and the owner eventually arrived and said that a man was on his way to fix it. We went out and when we got back we went in search of the owner – the only person to speak English – to find out if it was safe to go to sleep. He was talking and talking to someone else and just took no notice of me standing there. Eventually I interrupted and he said in a most off hand way “of course”.    We then tried to go to bed and needed to turn the air conditioning on as it was hot and smelt bad from all the water. The controls did not work. We found him again and he gave us a different set of controls saying he jammed them as some people turned the air conditioning up and down all the time. This seemed very odd. But we had controls that worked and so forgot about it. The working controls vanished the next day and so we were left with air conditioning that just turned on (very noisy) or off.    We did not receive the welcome talk that others mentioned and it would have been helpful.    We were not complaining about all the issues on the first day but it felt like we were being avoided by the owner in case we did. After a few days he finally started to speak to us and he was very nice. I don’t think I would want to rely on him if there was a big problem.    The rooms are small and the toilets are close to the bed and just behind a curtain. The rooms do not have locks there is no safe or fire alarms or any of the normal things you might expect. There was not any water in the room for cleaning your teeth and you cannot use the tap water. We did not mind any of these things but I do think it would have been helpful to know them in advance.    We loved the staff and the roof terrace. Even when we checked out we did not get an apology from the only English speaking person for the taxi and water incidents it was as if they never happened. A simple acknowledgement and sorry would have gone a long way. I had not intended to post a review but I received an e-mail asking me to do so.,Date of stay: March 2010,,"Lyme Regis, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wildlifewatcher

The room and indeed the whole Riad was unique in its beauty and comfort very clean.  The views from the roof terrace over Jemaa El Fna (the square) and the Atlas Mountains in the distance are magnificent. Everything in Marrakech is accessible on foot from this Riad especially the Souks.  It was a special birthday while we were there Christophe arranged (unknown to us at the time) a surprise at Dar Essalam a very good restaurant.

Riad Andalla,Elizabeth W wrote a review Mar 2010,50,A hidden gem,I booked this riad based on the tripadvisor reviews and it certainly lived up to everything we had been told. It is well worth having the pickup from the airport as finding this place in the dark would not have been easy! Christophe and Andre were lovely and nothing was too much trouble from booking our coach dinners and with lots of helpful tips our stay in Marrakech was trouble free. The location is superb and being able to sit on the terrace and watch the Place Djemaâ el Fna coming alive in the morning was fantastic. We were right in the heart of Marrakech but so quiet!

Riad Andalla,seenhotelsinvolume wrote a review Feb 2010,50,loved it,Christophe & André were absolutely professional from my first encounter with them via email. I knew exactly whether or not they had space for me to stay the night and in fact it happened that they had space only one night of the four I asked for (probably because everyone also wants to stay here :) ) but everything was very clear. They even put together a contract for me which both parties signed and I felt secure about the entire reservation. Especially given the fact that I was going to Marrakech alone as a girl this reassured me. I felt I could count on Christophe (whom i had mainly been corresponding with) in terms of answering my questions prior to even arriving.    The Riad itself is wonderful! It's very well located and very close to la place Djema El-Fna! That said I would definitely book a taxi to get you there from the airport if it is your first time in Marrakech - only because it is not evident to find unless you receive some help. Once there however you feel like you are in a little Oasis. All staff is very friendly and the owners are as well - very willing to help with any questions you may have and to offer any help ! I definitely felt at home despite the fact that home is far away in San Francisco!    Last but not least the reason I had booked this Riad to begin with was because of the terrace overlooking Djema El-Fna - the pictures you see online which seem to be taken from the terrace are real. The view is definitely gorgeous both in the morning for a coffee with cute heart shaped cookies or in the evening. Definitely worth staying at the Riad for this only - you can enjoy the square with a bit of retreat from your own Riad!    I highly recommend this Riad!

Riad Andalla,gavinjsain wrote a review Feb 2010,10,"Mimicking, Mocking Maniac.","I booked to stay at this Riad on Laterooms.com & received a confirmation via email. Then I received a confusing email from the riad saying ""I refer to your request that day and I regret to inform you that I'm not busy at Riad Andalla according to your dates"". After many more confusing emails and phone calls to both the Riad and Laterooms.com I could still not establish if I actually had a room at the Riad. On the day of check in I received an email from Christophe informing me that he had secured me a room in an annex. I arrived at the Riad still not certain that I had a room. Christophe opened the door and immediately was rude to me ""oh it is you"" no apology was given for the mix up. He then proceeded to mock me and mimic me repeating the last words that I had said in a silly French way. I could not believe his behaviour.  The accommodation he had secured was at the Riad Abad across the lane we were taken there and told we could use the services of both Riads.  Every time we interacted with Christophe he would mimicked me I asked him to stop but he would not. I found it so juvenile and unprofessional. Upon checking out it continued until I demanded that he stop and I got in a argument with him. I am confused as to why this man played this game with me.    The Riad Andalla looked beautiful. The rooftop terrace had an amazing view overlooking the medina. From all accounts here it is a great place to stay. For some reason Christophe either took a big like or dislike to me and played these childish school yard games.    I am glad that we ended up staying at Riad Abad across the lane.

Après avoir beaucoup plus de courriels et d'appels téléphoniques à confusion à la fois au Riad et Laterooms.com je pouvais encore mettre en place pas si j'ai eu une chambre au Riad. Le jour de check-in j'ai reçu un courriel de Christophe m'informant qu'il avait à me procurer une chambre dans une annexe. Je suis arrivé au Riad toujours pas certain que j'avais une chambre. Christophe a ouvert la porte et immédiatement a été rude pour moi ""oh c'est vous"" aucune excuse n'a été donnée pour le mélanger. Il s'est ensuite rendu à se moquer de moi et moi imiter de répéter les dernières paroles que j'avais dit à la française stupide. Je ne pouvais pas croire que son comportement.  Le logement qu'il avait obtenu était à la Abad Riad travers de la voie nous avons été là-bas et dit que nous pouvions utiliser les services des deux Riads.  Chaque fois que nous avons interagi avec Christophe il me imité je lui ai demandé d'arrêter mais il ne voulait pas. Je l'ai trouvé si mineur et non professionnelle. Au départ il a continué jusqu'à ce que j'ai exigé qu'il cesse et j'ai obtenu dans une discussion avec lui. Je ne comprends pas pourquoi cet homme a joué à ce jeu avec moi.    Le Andalla Riad était belle. La terrasse sur le toit avait une vue incroyable vue sur la médina. De tous les comptes ici c'est un grand endroit pour rester.

Riad Andalla,Litro_K wrote a review Feb 2010,50,Unreservedly Welcoming and Well-Located,We adored our two nights at the Riad Andalla. When booking our dealings with Christophe one of the owners were always friendly and positive but it wasn't until our arrival that we realised how welcoming he and all the riad's staff would be.    Firstly we would recommend the taxi transfer to the riad from the airport if it is your first visit. The riad is very close to the Place Jemaa el Fna but would still be difficult to find even for a seasoned traveller. Our driver Amin(?) was courteous and pleasant and helped us with our bags to the door giving us helpful directions to remember our way.    As soon as we stepped inside Christophe welcomed us heartily deciphered that we could speak a kind of Franglais and tailored his speech accordingly. The bags were left downstairs and we were shown upstairs to the beautiful terrace which is in prime position overlooking the main square.    The terrace is certainly the riad's most exceptional feature. From this vantage point you can see snow-capped Atlas mountains palm trees lots of other rooftop terraces cafes and restaurants and Moroccans going about their daily business. At night the Koutobia is lit up like a beacon in front of you and you become privy to the sights sounds and smells of the many food stalls and the entertainment on the square.    We were welcomed with coffee and some handmade sweets which were to become favourites whilst in Marrakech. Abdul the riad's right-hand man served us and was so friendly we felt at home immediately. Christophe then bounded up to present us with a map and help us get our bearings. He pointed out major sights and attractions gave us tips on what to see in our time there and also gave some excellent eating recommendations. These were: of the night-time food stalls No.1 (Chez Aicha) is excellent and cheap and the terrace restaurant at Chegrouni on the main square is also very highly recommended. We took his advice and were extremely glad we did returning twice to Chez Aicha.    Our room Lamira (meaning 'The Princess' Abdul told us with a wry smile) was small but very clean and comfortable. It had air conditioning/ heating which was useful at night (we found that leaving this on also helped to drown out the dawn call to prayer which could be heard each morning around 5am).    Breakfast was excellent with fresh bread jams and great coffee. The best part was the Moroccan crêpes or pancakes made fresh and served to us warm. And the views? To die for.    One last thing that was very appreciated was that when the Mister needed a shave and realised he'd forgotten his razor one word in passing to Christophe was all it took to have him escorting us down the road to his local barber. The wet shave there was close and quick and the barber on Christophe's recommendation only accepted what we wanted to give him as payment. That was an extra touch that no other hotel or riad we've encountered would have supplied.    We could see why Christophe quit one of the world's most beautiful cities (Paris) to live here and why his associate André joined him from Corsica. They have a good thing here - it was a pleasure to be part of it for a couple of days and we wished we'd stayed longer.,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Santa Ana, Costa Rica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Litro_K
Riad Andalla,GAH2343 wrote a review Jan 2010,50,An Oasis in Marrakech,Riad Andalla was a great choice for us. We are experienced travelers from the US visiting Morocco for the first time. We arrived tired from a hard week of business in Europe. The Riad Andalla was our first stop in Morocco and the last place before we returned home. Between we spent about 10 days circumnavigating the country in a rented car. Riad Andalla is a lovely place; comfortable quiet fine and well arranged. We made a mistake in not eating in the hotel when we arrived. We only realized the magnitude of this error on our last night when we took our farewell meal in the hotel - fine food and accommodation. Christophe provided great service too. Our inbound flight was delayed by a mechanical problem so we arrived 24 hours late and without baggage. Christophe helped us sort things and adjusted to the situation as it unfolded. We were met as promised and carried to the hotel. Christophe and Andrè were steady sources of insight and fun.

Riad Andalla,SamBoleyn wrote a review Jan 2010,50,"Beautiful, Clean, Friendly Owners",My boyfriend and I had an amazing weekend at the Riad Andalla. The owners Christophe and André made us feel welcome as if we were their personal guests. They were also so helpful and full of advice about Marrakech. The riad is very well located only 2 minutes from Jamâa El Fna in a labyrinth of little streets of the medina. It's charming and accessible and once you're there you can't hear the buzzling noise from the market. The rooms are on the smaller side but they are beautifully decorated and very very clean. The terrasse is the most amazing feature with an amazing view on the market place as well as the Koutoubia and the snowy mountains of the Atlas.

Riad Andalla,SPG-Aficionado wrote a review Jan 2010,50,"A very warm, welcoming place",This little Riad provides affordable accomodation just steps away from the Place Jamaa El Fna (where all the action happens) while still maintaining a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Owner Christophe a French expat who seems to have embraced the Moroccan way of life makes you feel at home in this 7-room recently renovated guest house. We enjoyed the beautiful terrace overlooking Jamma El Fna over breakfast - a priceless exprerience. Rooms may be on the small side but they feel intimate and the common areas always bustle with guests and the chatty owner. Overall a very warm place that we highly recommend to anyone visiting Marrakesh.,Date of stay: January 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bishop, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPG-Aficionado

The accomodations were great clean comfortable and ideal for a short stay.

We staid at Riad Andalla for three nights in November 2009. The Riad is in a typical design of Morocco everything clean and very tasteful. Our room was small but very nice. From the roofterrace you have a superb view over the Jeema El Fna and the Koutoubia Mosk.  The hosts Christophe and André as well as the faktotum Abdullah made our stay perfect.

Riad Andalla,Katalin007 wrote a review Dec 2009,50,All you need is Riad Andalla:-),There are several things that make Riad Andalla outstanding:  1. Beautiful hosts and staff. On our very first night we arrived late to the Riad. As soon as we entered we were lead to the terrace where the Owners (Christophe and Andre) and some other guests were chilling with a drink. They welcomed us and made us feel home straight away. From the following morning we had the impression as if we were in a house of a friend. All the staff were kind friendly and very helpful. The breakfast on the terrace was also great.  2. Perfect location/perfect view. It is located just next door to the Jemma el Fna with a terrace overlooking to the market. Even though it can be enjoyable getting lost in the Medina you probably do not always want to wonder around for hours to find your hotel. Riad Andalla has a very easy access.  3.Nice decoration/clean rooms/comfortable bed.  4. Competitive price.  If we go to Marrakesh next year we will stay in Riad Andalla again!

The real plus of this Riad are:  a) a terrace with an amazing view on the Jemaa El Fna Place probably one of the best in Marrakech where a delicious breakfast is served. Dinner on demand (very good too!)  b) Cristophe and André the owners that really open the Riad as a friend house for their guests and always available to advice you on what to do and to see.

Nothing is too much trouble. 2 mins walk from Jama El Fna    The hotel was full when we booked but arranged for a room for us in another riad opposite - Riad Abad. This Riad was not a good experience - the staff treated us as if we were an inconvenience and tried to move us to stay in a room off the dining room that had no privacy and had wet plaster on the walls. The breakfast was inedible and the coffee horrible and bitter.

Riad Andalla,soukaholic wrote a review Nov 2009,50,Our PERFECT Marrakech Holiday,"We cannot praise the hospitality of Andre & Christophe enough.  As soon as we arrived at the Riad we were made to feel that their beautiful home was ours to share.  It was obvious that they had employed their staff very carefully as all the staff were very obliging & friendly providing genuine & efficient service at all times.  As previously mentioned the rooms are cosy. We had the suite on the top floor with a view of the Koutoubia which was very comfortable & I would recommend.  The Riad was spotlessly clean & the breakfast was a good start to the day(especially as it was served on the roof terrace overlooking the Djemna el fna square).The location was fantastic (literally 2 mins from the square) you really couldn't wish for better.  The object of our trip was mainly shopping & relaxation & this riad provided the perfect base for both with the souks on our doorstep(we could even pop back to use our own toilet & drop our shopping off) & back out again for more shopping.  Two of our party had 1hr massages at the riad for 30 euros each and they were both really pleased with them.  We enjoyed a lovely meal at the Riad on our first night which was up on the roof terrace with that fabulous view we see on all the postcards. The sounds & smells of the square all added to the ambience even the call of the muezzin at 5.30 in the morning didn't make me grumpy.  To sum up we all loved every minute of our time at the Riad & Thank all the staff for their hard work which was always carried out with a smile. A special thankyou must go to Abdul who tended our every need (even accompanying me to a cabinet maker to arrange for an armoire to be made for me) And on the same note A Big thankyou to Christophe who accompanied me to the shipping agent to arrange transportation back to the UK. Christophe speaks great English & obviously his native French so made a very useful interpreter. Although Andre's English was not so good we still managed to communicate & could feel his genuine warmth.  We have been to Marrakech 4 times now & this experience was by far the best. We came back yesterday & I am already looking for flights for Feb 2010.  The Riad was as a previous reviewer said ""PERFECT FOR US"".  What we wanted from the riad was:-  LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!  THE VIEW  Comfort Cleanliness & good food & friendly service  What did we get?  ALL OF THE ABOVE & NEW FRIENDS IN MARRAKECH.  We will definately return to Marrakech & Riad-Andalla.  Merci.",Date of stay: November 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soukaholic
Riad Andalla,Lucja L wrote a review Nov 2009,50,Rock the Kasbah in this magical spot,What a brilliant location overlooking the Djamaa El Fna so close you can touch it!  On arrival Christophe met us from our taxi from the airport and took us to the Riad which we would highly recommend arranging as trying to find the Riad without Christophe for the first time would be a nightmare! Christophe's english is great which made it easier for us but next time we stay definitely French for us (lessons are booked!)  Lovely mint tea and little sweet treats on arrival are a nice touch on the terrace. The service from Christophe and indeed everyone at the Riad was first class. A scrummy breakfast served on the terrace each morning watching Marrakech wake up is a wonderful way to start the day. The rooms are clean and tidy comfortable bed with plenty of hot water for showers. The air con was a blessing during the night as we found we had to keep the door and window closed as the noise outside from the sqare and various people making their way around the alleys around the Riad was just too much otherwise. Some other reviews have mentioned being awoken from the sounds of the mosque in the early hours and indeed you do hear this but this is all part of the charm of being in Morrocoo and found it quite a soothing and relaxing sound not a disturbance at all. The Terrace is amazing to chill out at sunset and watch the square really come to life with all the sounds and smells before heading out yourself to get into the thick of it all.  In the medina itself alcohol is not available openly at a lot of places. We found 2 spots close by Kosy Bar which is in the old Jewish quarter and is a funky superbly laid out bar (service is pretty rude but with the great views and a chilled beer/wine you can get past that!) bit pricey in comparison to other food and drink in Marrakech but not expensive by UK standards at £15 for a bottle of the cheapest wine and about £4 for a beer. For a cheaper alternative (but lacking in the decor comforts and atmosphere) is Grand Hotel Tazi which is literally around the corner from the Riad. Handy spot for that cold beer to quench your thirst without the frills! Just under £3 for a beer and wine was about £7 for 2 glasses (in a mni bottle). They also have a terrace upstairs bit run down but a bit nicer than the bar area because you are outside and can soak up the action.  Tried out a hammam close by which was absolutely immaculate friendly staff very clean and safe gorgeous facility and the massage at the end was amazing. Didi Spa is on Rue Prince my Rachid one of the streets coming off the square. I paid 250 dirhams (about £20) for a hammam and 1hr long massage and was worth every penny!  For a great Tagine and eating traditionally for lunch time try Chez Bahia on Riad Zitoune El Kdim which is another street leading off the square. The tagine pots are cooking away on display out the front so you can't miss it. Great food and service (you can try the Pastilla here as well). No awards for plush design but it is clean and tidy and well worth the visit (Cheap as chips too 100 dirhams for the 2 of us for lunch so just under £10.

Christophe and team were very gracious and caring hosts. The rooms were clean beds comfortable showers good and hot with good drainage. The rooftop terrace was comfortable and had a stunning view of the Djeema el Fna. Decor throughout was lovely and obviously placed with thought and care. My favorite aspect of the riad was that it was very cozy and full of life. The guests and staff mingled and had conversations throughout the riad so we never felt lonely or isolated.

Riad Andalla,adwebb wrote a review Sep 2009,50,A perfect retreat in the heart of Marrakech,It is very rare that we write a review of our hotel and believe me we have stayed in many places all over the globe!  Yes we have rated this gorgeous Riad as 'Perfect' and the word perfect can be often over used but in this example it deserves this title. Yet it is important to remember that it was perfect for us and perfect for the purpose of our visit to the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.    Location - You cannot find a better location for a weeks visit to Marrakech. Naturally you visit such a place for it's atmosphere and scattering of intersting locations and markets and this cannot fit the bill any better. It has simply stunning views for it's roof top lounge/dining area and although a 2min walk when you first arrive you soon realise after a couple of days that you are very lucky.    Hotel/Rooms - Beautiful decor a calm amongst the storm of Marrakech. It is clear that the owners have invested time and effort into the presentation of this Riad. Our rooms were attended to daily with fresh towels and a quick tidy. We opted for a standard room as the small saving would allow us to spend more in Marrakech and more often than not we would be out and about. If you prefer a bit more leg room and space to manuvre then i would recommend the small upgrade in price. VERY clean and wonderful staff.    Hosts - Well what can we say about the delightful Christophe & Andre the French owners of the Riad. Christophe speaks excellent English and helped us settle well and was very welcoming during our time Andre speaks little English but this does not stop him from being a charming presence. Christophe often went out of his way to help us in our pursuit of gifts and advice! A special mention must go to Abdul a true Morrocan gentleman who works at the hotel a great character!    When we do return to Morroco we will certainly check into this welcoming Riad this time with a better grasp on the French language!,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adwebb

Location is perfect the heart of the city by the main square but also the riad is an oasis of calm where a good night's sleep is always had. French owners Christophe and Andre were simply the best. They were helpful in every way -- organising a trip to the Atlas mountains transfer to and from the airport and even a massage! The decor inside the riad is also superb with attention given to the smallest detail.    Enjoying a wonderful breakfast on the terrace was great but the evening meal overlooking the main square was something to remember for a long long time. So beautiful and romantic! Final point the local staff were superb. Special mention to Abdul who catered for our every need and was simply the nicest and friendliest chap you are ever likely to meet.

Riad Andalla,Clamshell-Worthing wrote a review Sep 2009,50,Fantastic and so friendly,The Riad has been beautifully renovated by the owners Christophe and Andre and offers charming and comfortable accommodation in a traditional setting. The tranquil roof terrace gives stunning views over the main square the Djemaa el Fna which is no more than a 2 minute walk away. The location in the centre of the Medina means the souks and sights are all within easy walking distance.    Christophe and André are very friendly and go out of their way to make you welcome whatever time you arrive or leave! We had a very short stay and they patiently helped us plan an itinerary which made the most of our limited time in Marrakech. Christophe speaks English but equally André is brilliant at adapting his French to suit the ability of the guest and so is easy to understand even with a fairly rudimentary grasp of French.    The staff at the Riad are also very friendly and helpful. As other reviews recommend eat dinner there at least once the cook is very talented and innovative and will take account of any particular food likes or dislikes you may have. The quality of the cooking is outstanding – it’s not good home cooking it is high quality restaurant standard. The Riad has a massage room and they can arrange for an excellent visiting masseur/se it’s a good way to relax after a hard day’s tourism!    We would recommend taking up their offer to arrange a taxi to meet you from the airport and take you to the Riad as although it is very central the Medina is such a maze when you first arrive it is difficult to get your bearings; if you are arriving at night we would say this is essential.    As some others have said the rooms are not very big but it’s a riad and anyway how much room do you need to sleep? The rooms are en-suite beautifully & thoughtfully decorated and you have the use of the whole house including the “lounge” on the ground floor and the fabulous terrace. It was also spotlessly clean.    We were getting a bit fed up with tourism but Christophe & André have changed that. Riad Andalla is all about treating you as a guest and enabling you to make the most of your stay it’s superb and we’d happily go back tomorrow!,Date of stay: September 2009,,Worthing UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clamshell-Worthing

Christophe and Andre as well as the staff did a wonderful job in making us feel welcome always in a very good mood and interested in helping us out concerning restaurants/things to do and so on (despite our somewhat broken French). The breakfast was delicious and the rooms were cozy and clean. And the roof terrace right behind the Cafe de France...what a treat! We spent hours just on the terrace looking over the Jemma el Fna - a view that you can otherwise just get from the restaurants around the market place.  After weeks of looking for a Riad in Marrakech we could never really decide on one because there was always something missing. Either we did not like the location or the way it looked or the price.

This riad is amazing for many reasons:  1- it is located in THE place to be in the Medina especially if it's your first time to Marrakech (but it's no wonder that people keep coming back to it).  2- the rooms are comfortable and decorated with great local style (like the rest of the house)... and the Riad has a beautiful terrace.  3- Last but not least the staff really take it seriously when it comes to making you feel at home. Christophe et André have the declared policy that their Riad is a guest house therefore you are a guest and not just a customer (as a matter of fact they live there).  Do not hesitate just go there and see it with your own eyes.,Date of stay: June 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Santiago, Chile",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoChile80
Riad Andalla,taipanlalo wrote a review Jun 2009,50,Jewel of Marrakech,We stayed ay Riad Andalla for 4 nights. You can't find better hosts than Christophe and Andre! Our flight came in 4 hours late and Christophe recommended that we be picked-up by private taxi since it was our first trip to Marrakech. It was almost midnite when we arrived at the medina Jemaa El Fna and because the medina was closed to traffic after 5pm the taxi driver took us on foot across the square and through the maze of narrow alleys to the front door of Riad Andalla and Andre was there to meet us! Although it was a tad scary at every turn into dimly lit alleys leading to the Riad Andre's warm welcome erased all fears while Abdou the night guard promptly made mint tea to settle our anxieties. It was like showing up at a friend's house - we chatted for a while we in broken French and Andre in broken English but we understood each other perfectly. He finally showed us to our room which had 2 single beds a shower toilet and air-conditioning. By normal hotel standards it was a small room but this is a riad - the charm and ambience of the Moroccan house outweighed the closed quarters. It was adequate. Breakfast awaits us on the rooftop patio with freshly squeezed orange juice coffee bread hot crepes and preserves.    Christophe and Andre are a wealth of information on Marrakech. All you have to do is to ask! I had the privilege to tag along with Christophe and Andre to their weekly hammam (bathhouse) - an abrasive yet soothing treat for the newly initiated as well as the seasoned spa enthusiasts. Make sure your stay includes a weekend and you will also enjoy an excellent reasonably priced hour-long massage by a Moroccan couple who are good friends of Christophe and Andre.    But what made me want to write this review is what Christophe and Andre did to make our stay in Morocco so welcoming and memorable! We had planned to be in Essaouira on the coast for 2 nights and was hoping to come back to Riad Andalla for a night before our flight leaving for Paris the next day. Christophe and Andre were going to Corsica on vacation and had actually planned to close the riad for the entire week after we left for Essaouira. Having learned of our intended plans they suggested that we come back to Riad Andalla even though they will be gone and made arrangements for Abdou to open the door for us when we arrive back from Essaouira and be picked up by private taxi the following morning to the airport. We had the whole riad to ourselves and requested only coffee and juice for breakfast which Abdou promptly prepared. What an end to a wonderful stay in Marrakech and Riad Andalla made it so much more enjoyable! We would stay at Riad Andalla again when we visit Marrakech in the future - Christophe and Andre are like our friends and Riad Andalla is indeed the Jewel of Marrakech!    And one more thing we did not get to try at Riad Andalla. While we were there we keep hearing about Raja's excellent cooking but we didn't have enough nights there to try! I am sure we will when we find ourselves at the Andalla again!,Date of stay: June 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fremont, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taipanlalo
Riad Andalla,Nora134 wrote a review Jun 2009,50,A home far from home,This riad is definitely a hidden treasure inside Marrakech's medina ; the two hosts Andre and Christophe are so friendly you instantly feel at home and the quality of both the rooms and the dinner (Raja is an amazing cook!) have nothing to envy to the best hotels in town...  Christophe and Andre know so many tips (what to visit where to eat even where to shave !) that made our stay unique and unforgettable.  I strongly recommend this riad to whoever wants to live a wonderful marrakchi experience !,Date of stay: June 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,paris,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nora134
Riad Andalla,LJ1978 wrote a review May 2009,40,Warm welcome,This rias is situated on a very central location. In the city imagine you're on the roof terrace in an oasis with the sound of the city at the background. The owners provide a warm welcome and the staff is super friendly and hospitable.  We recommend this lovely riad!,Date of stay: May 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Netherlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJ1978
Riad Andalla,alexoproiu wrote a review May 2009,50,"Good friends, great riad!",We have spent six nights at Riad Andalla on our 3rd trip to Marrakech and this so far was the best experience for two guys with a BIG interest in photography: the riad is located very close to the Jemaa elFna which means you can see the square from the terrace and you can also see the Atlas Mountains on the other side! Perfect!    The rooms are clean traditional and very cozy (althoug a bit small like in all riads) and the staff quite nice and helpful. The two guys running the place Cristophe and Andre are friendly and optimistic always taking care of us and helping me with my French (spoken not written unfortunately!). Andre even stayed up until 3 in the morning to wait for us at the riad after our bus back from Zagora changed schedule welcoming us with our room thank you again!    All in all out of the four riads I've been to in the last two and a half years Andalla was the best and really gives me no reason to search for different accomodations next time around.,Date of stay: April 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Bucharest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexoproiu
