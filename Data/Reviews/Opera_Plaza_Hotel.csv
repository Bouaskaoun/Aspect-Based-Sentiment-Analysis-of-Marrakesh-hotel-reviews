Opera Plaza Hotel,nataliem962019 wrote a review Mar 16,40,Great location to explore Marrakesh,Stayed here for 3 nights. Really nice hotel with great location! The only disappointment we had was that we paid extra for a pool view. However on arrival we noticed there were building works being done to the pool so this wasn’t accessible and we were not informed and instead had a view of a building site :( However we did book through booking.com so not entirely hotels fault.    Pros:  Big spacey rooms  Breakfast - good variety and fresh juices are lovely  Nice spacious bathroom  Nice restaurant / sitting area outside (if the pool was done)  Mini fridge with drinks available to purchase  Room service available (we did this after a long day trip and it got to our room within 20 minutes!)    Cons:  Uncomfortable bed - mattress was very firm which I guess is down to personal preference but this really hurt my back and my sleep was awful during our stay.  Air con (room too hot- was a notice on the wall stating air con does not come on until 30th April so we spent every night waking up sweating)    Recommendations:  Check the hotels pool is open prior to booking !  Request a room away from the bowling alley (we were 3 floors up and could still just about hear it until late)  Day trip to Aït Benhaddou and Ouarzazate  The jemaa el fna market (take bag that you can close and don’t take valuable belongings if you don’t have to and HAGGLE!)  The parc Lalla hasna right by the market is a great place to sit and cool down in the shade  And taxis!!! try and agree a price before your trip otherwise they’re going to charge a fortune. We got charged 200dh for a 5 minute drive which is equivalent to £18 for us!! Shocking.  Exchange money a bit at a time as the exchange rates aren’t great and you could lose out a lot by doing it all at the airport. Lots of places in Marrakesh to exchange money- train station next door to hotel does it.  Restaurant called bagatelle was lovely! French menu but you could make out what a lot of it was (it was also about 15 min walk).    Overall be confident! As we found we were being done over for prices pretty much everywhere shops/ taxis etc. Don’t be afraid to say no or to haggle ! :),Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nataliem962019
Opera Plaza Hotel,lara wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Convenient Location,Stayed as part of large tour group. The Hotel is around a couple of miles or 10 minute taxi drive of the main square. On a busy junction so as a pedestrian bit nerve wracking crossing the roads at Zebras when the drivers mainly ignore the green man. Just follow the locals as they seem to have the confidence to cross the roads at will. Money change and ATM available at railway station which is a 5 minute walk of hotel    Positives for the hotel were clean comfortable good choice of food for both breakfast and dinner.    Negatives - hotel check in process for a large group is just ridiculous. Took 2 hours to get room. Reception wanted all the visa information before issuing a room key. Reception could have obviated this by taking in the passports and guests collecting at a later stage. Done a number of tours and this was the worst check in process I have to deal with. In the dining room it took along time to clear tables and bar service was very slow. Checkout for a large group is also painful as every mini- bar has to be checked individually on the morning of departure    Customer Service was below par for what is supposed to be a 4 star hotel and hence the rating,Date of stay: January 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drakus10

Opera Plaza Hotel,Mohit wrote a review Jan 2023,20,Okayish hotel with zero customer service,We had booked a room for 2 adults and 2 kids. They provided me with a double bed and a single bed. They also gave stuff for 3 people e.g. 3 towels. Initially they even refused to provide a 4th towel but after a while they agreed to give it - imagine! Though we received 4th towel 2nd night after asking them 4 times and complaining manager about this.    Staff (especially reception) is very poor. No one would ever smile or greet. I havent seen any other hotel with such indifferent staff.    Hotel is ok - not a 4 star. Breakfast was decent and some of the kitchen staff was quite nice.    Not worth the money you pay.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellermohit1
Opera Plaza Hotel,Manuel G wrote a review Jan 2023,40,An outstanding accomodation outside the Medina.,A very good four star international hotel less than 10 minutes drive from the Medina with a very convenient private parking just aside the hotel.  Extremely large and well designed room facing the internal swimming pool court so not noisy at all.  Luxurious breakfast mixing international and local food several made to order.  I strongly suggest this hotel if you are looking for an international accomodation outside the Medina.,Date of stay: December 2022,,"Pavia, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4018FFmanuelg
Opera Plaza Hotel,GF_Gavin wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Good up-market hotel,Up-market well-run hotel situated in a good area of Marrakech close to the railway station. Room was large with a comfortable bed the air-conditioning worked well nice balcony overlooking the inner courtyard gardens and pool. Thankfully all the hotel rooms seem to overlook the courtyard rather than the busy streets outside. Room was spotlessly clean. Bathroom was huge with a bath and a big walk-in shower. The room alo had a safe and a mini-bar so well-equipped.  Restaurant food was good buffet style with plenty of choice. More staff in the restaurant would have been good though as ordering drinks was a slow process.  The restaurant by the pool was good too and service always very helpful and efficient. The pool was good with staff always on hand for safety and keeping everything neat and tidy and clean.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Coggeshall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GF_Gavin
Opera Plaza Hotel,Vik K wrote a review Dec 2022,40,Recommend,Very nice property deserving of 4 stars and it’s solid hotels.com rating. Great breakfast with freshly made omelettes and fresh orange juice. Pool area and common spaces are very stylish. Rooms were clean and comfortable with good size bathrooms.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Ashley W wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Fine hotel in a quieter area of Marrakech.,We stayed for five nights as a party of 40 on an organised tour with breakfast and dinner. Great selection of food cooked in a local style for both breakfast and dinner. Room was large clean good facilities large bed & good quality bedding Bathroom was excellent with clean thick towels changed on request. Short transfer from the airport and located in a modern area of the city amongst high end hotels. 40 minute walk to the main square along leafy boulevards or taxi easily available. Pool was open but cold at this time of year. Friendly and efficient staff. A great hotel if you want to be in a quieter area of the city.,Date of stay: November 2022,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleywU3151QN
Opera Plaza Hotel,Marise D wrote a review Nov 2022,10,Do not recommend,This was one of the worst experiences at a hotel that we have had.  Our check in was delayed for 2 hours because the front desk manager claimed that the tour company had not confirmed the room. 5 of the rooms were able to check in.    Front Desk Manager was rude and dismissive and needs training in customer service. He has a surly attitude and did not bother to apologize for his obvious mistake with our booking.    Our key card got deactivated 1 day into our stay when we came back after a tiring day. The front desks manager blamed us for demagnetising the key.  The second key sitting in the slot by the door suffered the same fate. The manager did not take accountability for this.  5 out of the 6 rooms in our tour group suffered the same issue with their key cards. From other reviews I can see that this is an ongoing issue that has not been rectified.    Our shower got flooded and our tour CEO came over to take care of it for us. From other reviews I can see that this is an ongoing issue.    Food was mediocre wait staff making omelettes at breakfast were lackluster and unfriendly and carried on conversations amongst themselves as they were serving customers.  There were a few friendly wait staff whom we tipped handsomely for their customer care.  The bell captains were eager to please and helpful.    Will not recommend this hotel after the bad taste that the bad treatment by the front office manager and upkeep issues.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119marised
Opera Plaza Hotel,Customer744 wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Terrible customer service!,Poor customer service! The ladies at reception are actually rude! They chat with each other in Arabic while they are checking customers in and hardly look at you.    The toilet in our room did not flush properly (if you poop pray that you will be able to flush it)!    Also they recommended we use a tour guide via their connection who cost us 800 dirhams for 4hrs. The guide had a heavy accent and we were not able to understand 33% of what he said even though we asked for an English speaking guide. This guide spent 20% of the time on his phone and spoke with several people in the souks while we were paying him for his service.  Shame on the hotel - they refused to tell us which company the guide is working for. Are they cutting deals with guides?    The breakfast was good with plenty of coffee breads pastries and traditional Moroccan msemen (square roti).    Our bathroom was dirty at check in - see photos.    I will not stay here again even though it is located near the train station in the new section of Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Customer744
Opera Plaza Hotel,Ejrev wrote a review Oct 2022,30,First Time Visit,Booked a 3 bed room in September hotel is in a good location. Overall the hotel was good with a wide selection of breakfast options the fresh juices including beetroot and orange juice were great and the breakfast staff were polite. Please do keep milk next to the tea station as we had to go outside next to the cereal to get milk.  The rooms are clean however the bathroom was a total let down. The toilet had plumbing issues all week and did not flush even though they came to fix. It was all rusty inside and brown rotten which needs total replacing. We had to flush several times for the waste to go but still did not work which wasted a lot of time. (There are no bidets in the toilets) The bath was way too high which is not good for anyone.    One other thing is that they didn't place sufficient toiletries for each of us and when asked they came after a very long time. Room service and waiting times needs Improving as it is currently very very slow.    In terms of housekeeping they made a good effort but please don't touch or throw away things that are kept on the bedside which is not appropriate as all rubbish would be on the floor or in the bin. Rooms were not vacuumed every day either. Also there were no face tissues slippers or tea making facilities which isn't great for a 4 star as we were expecting this.    WiFi is free however at the balcony area there was no connection (city view)    Staff are very polite apart from a few that let's the hotel down as when we first walked in they just stared at us and we did not receive a warm welcome. First impressions count! Also the lady receptionist opened up the first passport and said we don't have a booking when she should first ask who's name it is under. Maybe she needs further training.    Overall it is a good hotel but with the above tweaks it will be fabulous.    Thank you.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ejrev

Opera Plaza Hotel,Mohammed wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Excellent!!!,Fantastic hotel!! (see pictures). Staff were very warm & welcoming. Special mention to Jawad Lamia & Khaoula they went over & above to help make our stay comfortable. Always got a polite greeting whenever we walked past.  Breakfast was very good with something for everyone. Rooms were clean tidy & odour free. Room service & fresh change of towels daily.  The Red Hotel isn't closed but rather sharing the same entrance as The Opera Plaza Hotel (It's a much nicer & grande entrance). The Hotel is situated in the modern part of Marrakech a perfect & lively location with everything within 10/15mins walking distance. Overall 10/10. I would definitely recommend.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshahzad_187
Opera Plaza Hotel,TORN1 wrote a review Sep 2022,30,Great breakfast and nice pool!,Stayed on a tour. Nice and clean pool. Great location. Breaky was great.  Did laundry at the hotel. Felt a little screwed over as we checked off the quantity boxes for clothing articles as well as checked off folded. Well they came back nicely pressed on hangers. When I saw the bill it was almost twice the price as  Not only did we pay for  Washing but we also paid for pressing of clothes too.    Also the deposit for pool towels isn’t convenient for guests especially when not informed on check in.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TORN1
Opera Plaza Hotel,Man-from-CFL wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Good modern hotel opposite the train station,Stayed for three nights whilst in Marrakech for business; the Opera Plaza is in the same building as the Red Hotel. The bedroom seemed slightly larger than that of the Red Hotel and the bathroom was huge with both a bath and huge powerful walk-in shower. The bed was comfortable and the air-con excellent (especially as it was up to 50˚C outside). The room had a good-sized balcony with views over the pool; the pool was excellent with plenty of sun loungers available.    Breakfast was served by the pool with more choice than at the Red Hotel; including omelettes cooked to order. Most of the restaurants in the hotel were closed again apart from the pool bar / restaurant which provides good light meals (pizza pasta etc.) there are however a number of good local restaurants nearby. The hotel is located in the new city (some distance from the old part of Marrakech) opposite the train Station (for Casablanca and the north) and coach station (for Agadir and the south) and a 15 minute cab ride from the airport making it a good location for onward travel within Morocco.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Man-from-CFL
Opera Plaza Hotel,Jimmy Mir wrote a review Aug 2022,40,One of the best hotels in town (Best location),Firstly i would like to say that all the people working here from the security to the people cleaning your rooms are very friendly and service minded. They are always just a moment away if you need anything. We stayed in this hotel for 21 nights and had a terrific time.    The only reason i am giving them 4 out of 5 is our last day. The pool-guy found poo in the pool most probably a kid who did that.  The pool-guy removed the poo with a big stick and threw it away. It was in the water for maybe 45-50 minutes before someone notified him. I am not blaming the hotel for that. They do not have control over this situation.    BUT what they in fact have control over is the outcome they did not tell people to get out of the pool after finding out. I understand that it was 1 hour left till 19:00 (when they close the pool) but when you have had poo floating in the pool that can cause e-coli hepatitis a giardia or crypto paraside and there are a lot of people in the pool including small kids i believe they could have made a better decision.    I did let the reception know as well after finding out and told them about the potential consequenses because there were several kids still swimming in the water. I also told her that i am going to throw all of the swim wear me and my son was using and most probably the towels and shirts we used when going back to the room. (Worth 400-600 dhm).    Maybe the pool-guy or the receptionist did not have any say or authourity to close the pool that is why the leadership should have routines in place for incidents like these. They could have closed the pool and offered the guests who were in the water free cleaning of all the clothes or something like that.    Either way apart from this incident we loved the hotel. The location is one of the best you can find in Marrakech it is right beside the main train station that can get you to Casa blanca Agadir Tanjier and so much more. The supratours main busstation is also just a block away. There is a guy right outside the hotel that can help you find taxi he is a real one and will even bargain for you :)    The cleaning staff were always so helpful and did more than expected. The buffet and the staff in the restaurant were always smiling and worked hard to please the guests. The breakfast was amazing fresh fruit veggies and moroccan specialties. Thanks to this hotel we fell in love with the area.We loved the area around the hotel so much that we are buying an apartment just a block away from the hotel.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Ant P wrote a review Jul 2022,30,Not bad; just not great.,Almost immediately on boarding the transfer to the hotel the TUI rep was hassling me to book trips. These were more expensive than than in the TUI app. Not what you need really having just landed though I subsequently managed to avoid him.    The hotel is OK; not dismally bad just an unusual combination of the mediocre and the irritating. Room was basic but not bad. The air conditioning worked well. Generally clean but quite tired looking decor. Room service often didn’t turn up so on a couple of days the room wasn’t cleaned. Not a big deal really but not great either.    I was looking forward to the Havanita wine and cigar bar advertised. Disappointing that it is permanently closed - this should not be advertised if not available. Melkis the traditional Moroccan restaurant actually has the same menu as the pool bar so there’s no real difference of experience other than you’re indoors. Pool bar very expensive for the basics like soft drinks. Other restaurants advertised in reception were not open. If you want to eat definitely go out of the hotel; Dameh is good and worth trying.    Pool areas is nice and well laid out.    TUI app is useful but clunky and not intuitive. Electronic boarding passes are there if you look for them but confusingly the app says they’re not available.    Overall not a bad place to spend a week but too many niggles to make it a memorable experience. Would not return to the Opera Plaza as there are too many alternatives.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bedford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntPerks
Opera Plaza Hotel,simjenk wrote a review Jul 2022,40,A solid hotel - but keep in mind what kind of Marrakech visit you want!,"I stayed one night in the Opera Plaza Hotel after a 9-day journey across Morocco with my family. Coming from the desert it was nice to spend a night in a more luxury hotel for a night to refresh and recharge.    The staff were very pleasant to deal with and let us check out one hour late at 1 pm. After that we stored our bags in the baggage room which was convenient until we had to leave to go to our next destination.    The buffet breakfast may have had the most variety of any hotel I stayed at in Morocco (lots of bread fruit meats omelette bar).    One thing to keep in mind though: the hotel is in the Nouvelle ville portion of Marrakech so you don't get the atmospheric ""medina"" vibe. Some people may like that but if you'd rather experience a more traditional Marrakech it's best to book one of the riads in the old city instead.    Note if you're taking the train: The hotel is right next to the Marrakech train station.",Date of stay: July 2022,,Ottawa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simjenk

Opera Plaza Hotel,Alice Fabbrica wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Wonderful hotel in Marrakech!,I stayed at the Opera Plaza Hotel with my boyfriend and we had a great time!  The hotel is wonderful it is located in the new zone of Marrakech which is a modern and very quiet area. For us the hotel is a real oasis of relaxation in which to rest away from the hustle and bustle of the Moroccan city.  The structure is modern and minimal the internal areas are very particular well cared for and everything tidy and very clean!  Inside the structure there is a large internal courtyard in which there is a large swimming pool very suggestive and around it deckchairs and sunbeds.  We stayed in a suite number 416 super spacious modern and with a terrace overlooking the pool… truly enchanting!  The hotel staff is very kind and careful to individual customer needs.  The breakfast is very tasty there are many different choices and is served in the pool area so the atmosphere is very pleasant and relaxing.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Sbounty wrote a review May 2022,10,My Discrimination Experience,I arrived to this hotel for my second stay the night receptionist dated 20/2/20222 was unprofessional which I have noticed during check-in time he was using his mobile phone sitting with casual jacket we have not been welcomed nor eye contact and when I talked to him he interrupt me that mean very rude and not polite. We did not have attention for all these but when we went to sleep after a long business working day we woke up from very loud noise came from one of room I reported it to this night mare night receptionist and security went to find out from where noise came from but unfortunately was no noise at all at same floor after few minutes we have heard same loud noise table or chairs pushed on the floor than we discovered the noise came from the ceiling means from top floor on our room I went to make sure about it and heard guests talked lough loudly and loud volume of tv I went back to reception to report the matter but unfortunately the night receptionist became upset angry bullying and aggressive because we should not tell him his job and we are just dreaming as long as security confirmed there is no noise from same floor but in reality was from next floor on the top of our room. The night receptionist used his body language very rude shouting on us told to us F*****CK off if we continue complaint to him again smacked some documents on reception's desk he pointed us his finger on our faces and warning us like we were criminals the security requested us to forget what happened and go back to our room to calm down this night mare of night receptionist We asked for night manager but unfortunately was not duty manager or night manager incharge rather than few night staff we felt unfairly treated discriminated verbally abused and harassed . We went outside around 2:30 am for a small walk and get some fresh air after little time we went back to our room and we stayed aweak till morning early for our departure flight. Breakfast buffet was not good enough plenty of staff around but unfortunately were busy to talk to each other part of our dishes taken from table without asked when we went to bring drinks.  Formal complaint emailed and sent to Front Office Manager but unfortunately he did not response to our complaint since february 2022 till now we have forwarded this matter to reservation manager but again we were ignored and we understood that the problem from management and affected all staff nobody care so we paid money to received extremely bad and dangerous behaviour that our lives was in risk after what happened so this hotel is very very very danger to stay and I wont recommend anyone to stay otherwise any problem nobody will listen or help or even solve it plus the danger if you complaint.  However this matter forwarded to booking.com management for fully investigation and hopefully will sort it as soon as possible otherwise we may take a legal case against booking.com for not provide safety of its customers.,Date of stay: February 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sbounty

Opera Plaza Hotel,M B wrote a review Mar 2022,20,"Adequate, charming hotel—avoid food beyond breakfast",The hotel is clean friendly and very convenient if you are taking a train. The decor is a bit dated but charming. The room I was in had a stained carpet but I believe some rooms have tile floors. There is music playing in the poolside courtyard but the double glass door made it not bothersome. The rooms are very spacious and I had decent wifi in my room close to the elevator.  The breakfast is fine and pleasant by the pool. However I advise not ordering food during the day. I experienced my only case of food poisoning in Morocco over many years from a lunchtime tagine there. (From searching previous reviews I think I am not the only one.) There are many good restaurants not far from here so I would advise eating out instead.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiriamBale
Opera Plaza Hotel,Kaajal G wrote a review Mar 2022,10,Disappointing!,Having read the reviews I was so excited to stay at Opera however our stay was disappointing due to the lack of customer service and basic essentials needed in a room not being there.    The room didn’t have a kettle or iron. I requested a couple of things to be ironed which came out further creased. Of course I complained and had to request that I wasn’t paying for the service. No apology or compensation.    When we checked in we weren’t told the basics about things to do at the hotel where things were and about city tax. They didn’t have a printed map to show us main points of interest. When we asked questions just felt like we were hassling the reception staff. Also each time we had approached the staff they would finish their conversation before acknowledging us many times walking off to return a minute or 2 later.    Drinks by the pool 2 doubles and a mixer £35 - that’s more than a posh bar in london!    When we walked down to breakfast daily..the crep maker eggs lady and traditional bread maker all looked at me up and down. Yes I’m a female and yes I wear shorts/dresses in 15-17 degrees .. but there was no need for them to communicate in the Moroccan language about what I was wearing or look at me up and down. Simply rude.    I personally would not recommend!,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaajalg

Opera Plaza Hotel,GreekNomad wrote a review Jan 2022,50,An excellent choice!,This place had it all. Perfectly trained staff great restaurants one of the cleanest pools a rich fresh breakfast and spacious clean rooms with a large comfortable beds. The noise from the Avenues can be an issue to some but the double balcony doors help a lot although not really soundproof. What I enjoyed the most is that there was a resort-like flair in a hotel that's right across the train station and that's something I've never experienced before. The politeness of the staff was something I really appreciated whereas the special day trip packages arranged by the reception was exaclty what I needed for such a rather short stay. I would gladly return!,Date of stay: October 2021,,"Athens, Greece",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreekNomad
Opera Plaza Hotel,florenceMinnesota wrote a review Nov 2021,50,3 week Moroccan Holiday,Well into our 3 week journey we finally have a breather in Marrakech. This is a huge complex got lost a few times plus the energy saving lights can be a bit unnerving walking back to the room alone at night.  Huge room balcony facing the pool area and sitting area. Balcony was great for HH as it was sheltered a bit from any wind and sun.  Bathroom is large getting in and out of the shower was a challenge tho.  This was a nice change of pace from the smaller riads but felt a bit too large for us.  Breakfast was outdoors in the pool area and good selection.  Found a liquor store under a mile walk down the blvd so we had our own wine at night.  Marrakech is a beautiful city the Menara fountain light show is worth taking in mall not so much.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Smeera M wrote a review Nov 2021,50,First visit to Marrakech,Loved this hotel stayed in room 514 (only problem was it was facing the main road and the road was extremely busy and noisy)the rooms were beautiful and everything was spot on. The decor throughout the hotel was up to date nothing ripped or torn.  Breakfast by the pool was just a beautiful experience was very quiet as we went in October off peak time.  The hotel is very close to amenities the train station was a 2 minute walk which had KFC and McDonald's on site.  The hotel staff are very friendly we went in October and the AC in the rooms is turned off from 1st October however as it was 37 degrees we requested for the AC be turned on whilst we were there the reception staff said they would speak to management and in the meantime they gave us a fan for the night the next morning we came back from breakfast and our AC was on.

The hotel confirmed us necessary rooms: 1x DBL and 4 x TWINS. On arrival the receptionist gave us DBL rooms with tiny extra beds. When we started to complain he said that our agent booked for us this kind of accommodation. That was not the truth as we had correct confirmation from the hotel. Finally the receptionist said that he can do nothing and we have no choice but to sleep in the rooms he gave us. No apologies. No compliments from the hotel. NOTHING. We came here for vacations we booked comfortable accommodation and we paid for it. Because of this hotel the mood is spoiled. We should sleep on terrible beds.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Phil R wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Enjoyable Stay,When we booked our 5 night stay we requested a room with balcony overlooking the pool as we thought those overlooking the street would be noisy. What we had not allowed for was the constant music (?) from the poolside cafe/bar which at times was really loud. We were fortunate that our stay coincided with a particularly warm spell and as the hotel's air conditioning was switched off until April we had to have the balcony doors open to cool the room. This of course made the noise even more obtrusive. The room itself was a good size and clean although the carpet was getting towards its sell by date. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a good size and had a fixed shower over the bath. Climbing in and out of the bath was not the easiest for those of us past the first flush of youth. A niggle was that the magnifying mirror on a stalk was set too high for it to be of use to a lady of average stature. The staff were generally excellent being friendly and helpful particularly in the Rossini restaurant. There was a wide choice of dishes hot & cold for both breakfast and dinner which you served yourself although help was always available if needed. The hotel offered a gym and bars. Unfortunately the poolside drinks service in the late afternoon was sparse to non-existent. Overall an enjoyable stay despite the noise!,Date of stay: March 2020,,Driffield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilR648

We also ate freshly cooked pizza at Bella Italia - not part of the UK chain - which was very pleasant. If you want a cheap tasty lunch turn right out of the hotel and take the next right. The 3 little cafes there are where the locals eat. We did and it was fine.    Rooms are fine of a decent size and quite well equipped with toiletries hair dryer and safe. The bed was firm but comfortable. However the over bath shower was not easy to get in to and the shower was a narrow jet of water.    The hotel is roughly square with a central courtyard with a pool. It is at a very busy junction opposite the railway station. If you are in a room facing the road as we were the traffic is noisy 24/7.

Well this hotel was advertised to have wifi services in the room but it seems that is not applicable to the room we got.  The first night i went to the lobby and mentioned that there was an issue with the wi fi on our room the guy in the front desk explained the they have multiple networks available and that we should be able to connect to anyone of those networks and that i should be able to use the same password. I try at the lobby and it works so i head back to the room but unsuccessfully try for an hour before i give up.  Next day when we come back from doing some shopping i went again to the lobby and stated that the internet issue was in the room. The woman at the front desk told me not to worry that they will send the it guy to check. I got to my room and organize all the shopping in our luggage so I estimate about 40 minutes but nothing about the it guy. I decide to try again to connect but none of the networks worked.  I decide to call and they told me again that the will call the it guy to go and check. At this point the longer i wait for the internet the longer i will have to stay awake to check my emails so even if we are in vacation mode is getting a bit annoying .  At this point half an hour have pass and i have done nothing but try to connect. I did got connected for about 2 minutes which was enough for me to be able to read a couple emails and start writing an urgent reply which unfortunately i was not able to send since i got disconnected again. So i decided to call again this time the same woman answer and i try to explain that i have being waiting for an hour and a half and no-one has show up to this she told me pretty much to hang up so she can call the it guy and the she would call me back right away. Guess what half an hour later i am still waiting for that call and at that point i am just to tired to check my email so i called back to let her know that i could keep waiting any longer and that i would be going to bed so she can forget sending anyone to my room. She was then rude and told me that they have already check and that it’s working. Well i check once again and still nothing. I work on IT so i know a bit about networks so i am sure it work near the router but is not strong enough to work in my room period. Bottom line If you need wi fi my advise is to find another hotel or you will end up having as much fun as i have with this one.  Btw the hotel is nice but i would never use it for business or even vacation.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bangkok, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124mariluzs

Our room faced the pool where the hotel played loud music until after midnight even on weeknights. The room had two sliding patio doors - one inside the other. I would imagine to help buffer the sound from the pool area. However the music was so loud the double patio doors did not help much. To make matters worse the room did not have air con during the time of year we were visiting. Our room was like an oven. To open the doors meant we had an abnormal noise level in our room.

Breakfast is first class absolutely spoilt for choice; cooked continental traditional Moroccan pastries soup (!) and a range of freshly squeezed juices - and for evenings the in house Italian restaurant was one of the best of its kind I've eaten in pizzas second to none. There is also a small Moroccan restaurant 'Melkis' on site too which was very good cosy and atmospheric.The Havianita Bar downstairs is lovely for a hotel bar its pretty authentic and reasonably priced too - as is room service. The centre of the new town with contemporary shops (H&M Starbucks KFC etc and the Eden shopping centre with a Carrefour in the basement - for alcohol purchase if you fancy) and cafes is an easy 10 minute walk a further 15 mins (easy and pleasant along a boulevard with benches and parks) takes you to the old town and souks.We found the location ideal for us not too central but near enough everything you need.

Opera Plaza Hotel,todfest wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Management responded well,We requested two singles but our first room had a superking sized bed and a child sized put u up bed. Not surprisingly neither of us volunteered for the child sized bed so we asked for a change and was immediately moved to a fabulous huge room - 306.    The hotel is well kept and clean. Lovely pool area and many indoor seating areas. Live music some nights too. Luxurious bathrooms but showers are within a broad rimmed bath unit which can be precarious to get in and out of. Bath mats are needed.    The dining room can be packed at times as bus tours use the hotel but staff are helpful and keep the food topped up well - cutlery top up can be an issue at times.    We ate at the pool and at the adjacent Moroccan restaurant and the food was really great both times but the time waiting for each course was ridiculously long despite the restaurant being quiet. By 11pm we were getting too tired to even eat dessert and left for bed. We did discuss this with management who responded very well.    The Italian cafe on the corner is great for a snack - and the service was very fast.    There’s a tiny shop just around the corner - turn right at the hotel door - perfect for topping up water supplies and I was told there is an off licence in the road right behind the hotel.    There is also a shopping mall a good walk down the main road.

After two sleepless nights due to the traffic noise I asked for a room change. I was given a much nicer room overlooking the pool area with a proper sized balcony that had a table and chairs. 3 other people from my group also requested room changes for the same reason and were given pool view rooms. Most of the staff were pleasant and helpful. The evening meal was a buffet and the food generally was very basic and repetitive with the same food being served every night. On busy nights the staff seemed overwhelmed and unable to keep up with replenishing the dishes and clearing tables which we did ourselves on more than one occasion. It is a nice well situated hotel that would seriously benefit from better menu planning and more or better trained waiting staff.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Polegate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtraveller2312

Opera Plaza Hotel,cathyd wrote a review Oct 2019,40,3 night stay,Our tour group spent 3 nights here. We were in room 319. Room was fine and we had a balcony overlooking the pool.    Breakfast was really good. Be sure to try the fresh squeezed orange juice the made to order eggs and the fresh doughnuts or cronuts as I call them...doughnuts made with croissant dough and deep fried. yum!!    Once it gets dark the room floor lights work on motion detectors. Kind of disconcerting when you walk out of your room and go to the elevator since it was dark until almost 7am in the mornings.    Pool was very nice but chilly. They do have pool towels but they are hidden behind a door.    Be aware that after 1 Oct the hotel turns off the a/c. Our room was very uncomfortable most of the day and night because of this. The sun just blazed into the room. The hotel sent someone up and said they turned the air on but the temp only went down a few degrees. Did not get a good nights sleep.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Jekyll Island, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathyd
Opera Plaza Hotel,M Hussain wrote a review Sep 2019,10,AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!,I’m not one to leave bad reviews this is the first bad review I’ve ever had to leave.  Where do I start. I decided to stay at this hotel as from the images the rooms looked spacious and clean. When we arrived we realised the rooms were tired and in need of tlc. The safe in the room didn’t work and reception decided to replace it for us. We decided to leave our valuables in the safe as you hear stories of stuff going missing in the room. THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE! on our first night someone with access to our room and with the master key to the safe decided to pay us a visit whilst we were out. The safe was accessed and all of our holiday money of £700 was taken. We noticed the following morning and went straight to reception and spoke to the manager. I believe his name was Zahid. He showed no compassion whatsoever and told us he will look into it. We asked him to call the police and he told us he wouldn’t and we would have to go to the police station. We decided to do this on principle but on reflection would avoid this as we had to spend 4-5 hours at the police station only for them to write a report and give us a reference number. The hotel clearly know who has access to a master key for the safe and also should know who accessed the room from the key card. At no point did they seem concerned and reading previous reviews this is not the first time this has happened. In summary I would advise everyone to AVOID this hotel. The staff can’t be trusted and the customer service is appalling.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Murty915
Opera Plaza Hotel,Ansar H wrote a review Sep 2019,10,Thieves at the hotel,Considering this is my first review on a hotel it surely isn’t a positive one. If there was a minus rating available i would surely select it.    There are many things i can say about this hotel such as rude staff unclean rooms bad management but the reason for my review is based on the theft of mine and my room mates money (£700 to be precise).    This money wasn’t stolen from our bedside table or money left on the bed it was stolen from the room safe! The one place you believe all your belongings would be secure. We had an issue with our safe upon check-in and it had to be swapped only for the hotel to go and take the money anyway.    When making a complaint to management the manager had such a bad attitude and had no sympathy or reconciliation towards the the matter. We were simply told that he will do his part and we should complain the police. He made us feel like he was the victim and started to question friends we have in other rooms of the hotel.    Would not stay in such a deceiving place and if you really want to make your moneys worth this isn’t the place!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ahussain88

Opera Plaza Hotel,Ainfrance wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Good Hotel but be careful,We had originally booked into the sister hotel the Red Hotel and upgraded(?) to this hotel. Check in was fine the room very good big nice balcony good aircon. The pool was good also. We did actually say we might come back for a few days to stay there again for longer as we were only ther for one night on this visit.  However after check out the door man (tall bald man) asked us if we wanted a taxi to the airport and got us one. He then told us it would be 150 dhrs and to give him the money which we did. Then he went behind the back of the car with our luggage and gave almost secretively what I thought was 150 dhr to the taxi driver. Talking to the driver on the way to the airport he said he was given 100 dhrs so the doorman had taken 50 dhrs for himself. It is not a very good image for the hotel that a staff member is basically stealing from guests. I know it is not a lot of money but how many times does he do this per day? I did privately contact the hotel to let them know but they have not bothered to reply hence the reason I've put this on here. And also to warn other guests to be aware of this.  Shame really as otherwise the hotel is very nice indeed.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Chalais, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ainfrance
Opera Plaza Hotel,Bethany E wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Faultless,Me and my family had an early flight which arrived in Marrakech for 10:30 . When we got to the hotel we were pleasantly surprised to find out that our rooms were ready.    Every member of the staff that I encountered at this hotel were extremley friendly and helpful.    Don't worry if you run out of dirhams during your stay. The hotel has a currency exchange service. I advise you to do this early in the morning as by mid afternoon they're low on cash.If you are exchanging pounds  they only exchange notes and not coins.    The neighbouring hotel - 'Red hotel' also offers the same currency exchange service. The red hotel is easily accessible via the Opera plaza as guests share the same pool facilities.    Lifeguards are on hand to assist moving umbrellas to keep you in the shade.    Despite all the positives there was one downfall - which was breakfast. There could be a bit more of a variety. They offer fresh options including ; eggs and pancakes however Pancakes are pre made in batches of around 25 - thus are cold and taste like rubber.    The hotel is in a great location. There's a 24 hour shop just to the left of the hotel. There's also other snack shops if you decide to cross the manic Marrakech streets.    Bella Italia and an bowling alley are directly next to the hotel. There's also a Burger King and McDonalds located a minute walk away.    On the same side of the Opera plaza hotel about a 15 minute walk to the right of the hotel you will find a shopping mall with a variety of restaurants. The red route tour bus stop is also on the way to the mall    To note - a bottle of water at the hotel is 35 dirhams. At the local shop I was able to get 5 bottles of water for this price. You may want to stock up on water and just ask for an ice bucket from bar staff to save you a bit of cash.    Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. We had a room view facing the main Marrakech street. I have read reviews stating that rooms facing the street are noisy however  I didn't find that this was the case.    At the pool they offer a variety of brunch options. I highly recommend the pizza.    If you are looking to go out in Marrakech and require a taxi. Just tell security at the hotel front door and they'll call over a taxi for you.    Overall  I had an enjoyable stay at The Opera Plaza and highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethanyedwards1996

Opera Plaza Hotel,JetTech33 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Wonderful Stay, Over the Top Staff",Spent two nights at the Opera Plaza mid-August. The concierge and check-in staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our bags found their way up to our room quickly.    The room was larger than expected and had a nice patio. Beautiful views of the boulevard and palm trees. When picking a room however I highly recommend requesting a pool view room as the Moroccans are quite gratuitous with the use of their car horns. Our room faced a very street and round-about and there is constant honking. Only negative really was the a/c was a bit weak. Room was fresh but we would have like it colder especially after a full day touring in 42C weather.    The breakfast was the best of our two week trip. Full on breakfast with plenty of options (minus the bacon) made to order omelettes fresh squeezed orange juice fruit yogurts tons of pastry and bread options. All served pool-side. Beautiful setting.    Pool was very large swim-up tables for tapas and drinks. Son loved spending time at the pool they had inflatable pool toys to lounge on.    Hotel is a good 40 min walk to the Medina. We took a cab just too hot to walk EXTRA miles. Absolutely PERFECT location if you’re taking the ONCF train. 15 seconds walk across the street. Lots of really good restaurants within a 15min walk.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Michael S wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Very Satisfying Short Stay at Opera Plaza,We were in Marrakech for just a day as we flew there and then took a train the next day to Fes. We were looking for a nice comfortable hotel that was convenient to the train station. The Opera Plaza fit our plan perfectly. It is literally across the street from the train station. We reserved a room to accommodate three adults. The online listing indicated this would include three twin beds. The actual accommodations were better than we expected - two of the beds were close to what we would consider a double or full size bed the third was more of a twin size but easily fit an adult. All three were very comfortable. The room was more than adequate in size and was clean and nicely decorated. They had a modern bathroom with an excellent shower. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and cooperative. The hotel provides WiFi which worked quite well even when we had multiple devices connected. While there are a number of restaurants in the area we were tired from travel so had an afternoon snack and later dinner at the hotel restaurant which proved to be very very good. They have a variety of both traditional Moroccan foods and western style offerings. We went for the Moroccan menu and it proved to be a good initiation to some of traditional dishes. The hotel clearly caters to western tourists so the restaurant does offer a variety of wines beers and other adult beverages. The hotel also has a very nice outdoor pool. Aside from its convenience for train travel the Opera Plaza's location is reasonably good for getting to attractions in Marrakech. It is a little over a mile from the Medina two of us walked there with no problem the third took a short taxi ride. Finally I would note that once we made a reservation the hotel contacted us to ask if we wanted to arrange a car pickup at the airport. While the fee is a little more than a taxi we thought it was worthwhile as newcomers to the country.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Arlington, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikey412014
Opera Plaza Hotel,BobBl1950 wrote a review Jun 2019,40,First trip to Marrakesh,Traveled to Opera Plaza Hotel on a trip organised by Riviera Travel for Solo Travellers. Hotel was clean and room was on second floor which overlooked the pool. Sufficient coat hangers for one person but you would have had to double up if you were there as a couple. Little concerned that the safe was neither fixed to wall or floor but “loose” in a cupboard. Hotel was quiet but presume this was due to it being Ramadan. Was able to purchase drinks at the pool bar. Ate evening meal outside on first couple of days but there was a good breeze and unfortunately the food cooled fairly quickly. Ate for the rest of the stay inside the restaurant which was much better. Breakfast buffet had good choice and eggs were prepared as required.  Pool was clean as well as being quite deep in places  you could exchange pool towels on a daily basis. There were plenty of loungers.  Had two particularly interesting days out one to Essaouira on the coast and another into the Atlas Mountains both of which provided a complete contrast to the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh. You could walk to the main square from the hotel in about 40 minutes but with little shade.You could exchange Sterling at the hotel reception as well as the railway station just across the road both offering very similar rates of exchange. You could purchase bottles of water from shops close to hotel at very good prices.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobBl1950

Opera Plaza Hotel,chewee wrote a review May 2019,40,Good place to stay,This hotel is next to a train station where you can exchange your currency with better rate than in UK. It is walking distance to the posh hotel La Mamounia if it is not too hot to walk. One can reach most places by taxi for around 40 Dirhams which is less than £4. However you have to agree with the price first before you get in the taxi. La Mamounia opens its beautiful big garden to the public between 11 to 3 pm every day. La Maison Arabe is another beautiful hotel with restaurant where they serve good food at reasonable price. The souks El Bahia Palace and Majorelle Garden are worth a visit. We missed the museum of the garden because it only opens after 10 but our tour left by then. The hotel has a spa which I tried a full body massage at reasonable price. The pool is either too hot to swim during mid day or too cold in the late afternoon. This is in May. May be different in other time. Food in the bar next to the pool is good. Evening meal is buffet serving a big variety of food and are quite good. The down side is during dinner they do not provide drinks. Not even water so one have to buy bottle water let alone wine and other soft drinks. No tea or coffee either. Breakfast was good with good variety. They cook you omelette fresh with fillings of your choice. Rooms are spacious and clean.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Lock_jennifer wrote a review May 2019,40,Ok hotel,Was a bit skeptical after reading mixed reviews but we booked for our last two nights in Marrakesh as we needed a change from a riad in the chaos of the old town.    Pleasantly surprised. Room was spacious although bathroom a little dated and bath was high to step over for shower. Breakfast was very good and pool area was spacious.    Book a room with balcony and pool view otherwise you’ll be facing the road and guess it could be noisy.    As per a previous review the process for getting a towel for the pool is extreme - you give a 200dh per towel deposit to reception (this is when we discovered there is a second reception for a different hotel see below) who give you a card. You then exchange this card for a towel with the attendant pool side. Having read a review i took cash down to the pool to do this but can appreciate it would be annoying to have to go back to your room (or worse to a cash point) as there is no note in room and no-one tells you on checkin.    Red hotel also appears to be the same hotel- there is a second reception on the other side of the building. Looks like all rooms were the same so be with checking if any cheaper to book with them (their reception area felt slightly less impressive).    Checkin and checkout was efficient. They were also happy to print our boarding passes for us. Would suggest leaving enough time to checkout however as they will check the mini-bar in room which was done very efficiently however they only have 1 person on the desk (which proved slightly annoying when our room key card failed the day before and we had to queue to get a new one).    We paid £69 a night for 2people which we were happy with for a last minute weekend booking at the start of May. Had we paid much more we would have been more critical of the elements that felt a little dated.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Whaddon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lock_jennifer
Opera Plaza Hotel,hughkevilldavies wrote a review May 2019,40,A week in Marrakech,Our room was spacious and had just about everything one could want except for coat hooks. It looked out over the large central courtyard and had a balcony with table and chairs. Double sliding windows kept the noise of parties and children out very effectively but I don't think I would have wanted a room on the outside of the hotel looking over the very busy arterial roads on which it was located. Food was plentiful and varied but not always best quality. However we ate well enough. Staff with the odd exception were cheerful efficient and helpful. We really liked the bar/lounge area with plenty of comfortable seating. I thought the hotel's main disadvantage was that it was just a bit more than comfortable walking distance from the Medina and main touristy sights though taxis were cheap and numerous. In conclusion we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. It was a shame that just prior to leaving we were accosted by a staff member and accused of not paying our bill which we had settled a couple of hours earlier. They took a bit of convincing even though I was able to produce the receipt they had given me.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Jie H wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Upscale hotel in a fairly convenient location,I was reading some of the 1 star reviews and was concerned but I personally had no issue. Room was incredibly clean and luxurious. The hallway was a little dark and the elevator foyer area was often dark (it took a while for the lights to switch on) but it was no big deal. There are plenty of restaurants within the hotel including breakfast in the morning and many more restaurants a few blocks away as well. Inside there is also a cigar lounge area with live music.    Its close enough to the sight seeing tourist Medina area where the square and mosques are - probably 20 minutes or less of walking. Also within a few minutes walking distance are many beautiful and tranquil parks.    The front desk was also helpful. For example I got a SIM card at the airport but it only had data but was unable to make cards. They told me where to go to add minutes (at the shop in the train station next door) so I could make calls.    My only complaint which is echoed in other reviews is that the wifi is very flaky.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Suhail A wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Average Hotel ...,Not as good as the reviews I read before booking this hotel  There is no complimentary water which is a complete deal breaker as all the other hotels I stayed would provide water and then top it up in the evenings.  No slippers (but that's my high expectation I suppose) - water pressure good BUT the shower will go hot and cold randomly i.e. when it goes cold step back because it will get really hot for a few seconds and almost scorch you - very inconsistent.  Reception desk very small - doesn't really feel like a hotel lobby.  They also have a light saving mode in all corridors - so you have to find buttons on walls to light up the hallways this is a complete pain and a bit weird tbh.  You have to pay £17 (Approx) deposit per pool towel - mmmm not sure about that one either?  GOOD things - like all of Morrocco the staff and hospitality are wonderful.  The pool area is probably the best thing about this hotel - however it is not heated and is well chilly (probably fine in the height of summer though)! but very nice to relax in this area.  Cleanliness is good and the ambience too.  Breakfast - just above average but enough to start your day.  Generally an okay hotel in the new area of Marrakech - fairly close to malls and restaurants etc  I'd like to thank all staff but afraid I won't see them again as I wouldn't return.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suisui888

Wanted to point out that if you stay here be careful with your belongings as some of the staff are dishonest as others reviewing this hotel have found already.    My experience...upon checkout we delibrately left a brand new fake pair of addidas trainers behind in the room as they were only bought for the holiday and so we didn't want to take them back to London. In my rush to checkout i forgot my designer pescription glasses on the table.    I went back to the room 30 minutes after checkout and the room had been emptied and i was told nothing had been found not glasses and not even thosy shiny new trainers....    After an hour of arguing with the manager and staff the best excuse they had was that my friends had taken all those items by mistake and wouldn't accept that their own staff had stolen anything valuable left in the room... ofcourse my friends had not!    In addition first time i have seen staff lock away your suitcases in a room post checkout until your flight but not give you any proof to which bag belongs to you....lack of security controls is clearly evident.

Our room was relaxing and very spacious the bed was massive and really comfortable and the bathroom lovely. All spotlessly clean. The pool area was outstanding and beautifully lit up at night. The sun loungers were the most comfortable we’ve ever used. The food was absolutely excellent with lovely local breads cheese fruit dates etc as well as eggs etc for breakfast and fantastic evening meal with delicious pastries to finish with. Staff could not be faulted and were without exception very helpful friendly charming and professional. Quite puzzled to read other people’s negative comments.    Only two criticisms - one was the interminable loop of piped music all day. I seriously considered earplugs we were out much of the day but relaxing by the pool it was a bit of a pain to hear the same old Muzak over and over. For us the hotel was located a bit far out of the centre. If you were only going out on guided trips this wouldn’t be an issue but for more independent travellers it’s a fair old walk into town. But these are minor points really and overall we would highly recommend.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephfromlondon_10
Opera Plaza Hotel,Jon W wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Great service and location,Thanks go to all the staff and managers at Opera Plaza Hotel who made our week in Marrakesh so enjoyable - Reception were also very helpful.  The spacious and very comfortable hotel had a good selection of restaurants all serving great food. The bar area is very comfortable and has live music each evening and the pool has plenty of space and seating. There is no surcharge for room service.  The hotel is very clean and well maintained although a little tired in some of the upper corridors.  It is located within less than 10 minutes taxi ride to the Médina and provided a quiet oasis away from the noise and bustle.  In terms of taxis negotiate before getting in and haggle a price - should be about 20MAD.  We’d happily return to this hotel again.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Thirsk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/732jonw

Opera Plaza Hotel,AislingF1994 wrote a review Jan 2019,10,AVOID AVOID AVOID !,Stayed in Opera plaza last summer with my boyfriend. I was so excited to visit Morocco but unfortunately this hotel ruined our entire experience.  I will begin with a positive as to be fair the:  •rooms were clean  •the decor and facilities were nice    Negatives  •horrendously rude staff in particular the female receptionist (completely unhelpful judgemental and horrid) and the doorman (who chased us out of the hotel over a bath towel which had a bit of make up on it left feeling embarrassed and furious from reading other reviews this seems to be a hobby of his so top tip don’t use towels in bathrooms in order to avoid the embarrassment) These people are supposed to be ambassadors of the hotel a friendly face to trust and speak to whilst in a new country in reality there are everything but!! They seriously need to learn some hospitality management!!!  •I suspect I received food poisoning from making the mistake of eating from the breakfast buffet. Was sick for 2 of my 7 days in Marrakech because of it. Food is left uncovered in high heat birds are free to pick away from the bread table ladies making pancakes and handling raw eggs are not wearing gloves the list is endless..    Please please don’t waste your money on this hotel. There are far nicer places to visit and people to meet in the world than those in Opera Plaza!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Waterford, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AislingF1994
Opera Plaza Hotel,CoastToCoast1988 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Amazing country + amazing hotel = Amazing holiday,As a family of 3 including a 15 month old baby it took us a while to decide on where to stay in Marrakech we eventually decided on Hotel Opera Plaza and it never disappointed us. The hotel and bedrooms have a beatiful build which combines cultural Morroco with a modern luxury feel. We were blown away with the choice and service at breakfast our favourite was the freshly prepared omlette/Fried egg and crepe cooked right in front of you and served fresh and hot. The pool area is very beautiful and gives you the feeling of being in a luxurious environment which you can spend hours relaxing in. And lastly the location was very impressive with the major train stain menara mall and menara gardens all walking distance    I'd like to mention a special thank you to Abdullilah one of the restaurant managers who took the time to welcome us make us laugh and ensure we had an amazing experience.    Also Jelaal in the restaurant area was a joy to be around always a friendly smile and good conversation    Lastly the team that maintains the grounds you would see them every morning paying attention to the garden areas to keep it immaculate and the house keeping ladies who were super friendly and warm people.    We hope to return to Marrakech and woudn't consider staying anywhere other than Hotel Opera Plaza.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoastToCoast1988

Opera Plaza Hotel,Tobias R wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Clean hotel with a very friendly staff,We have stayed there 4 nights. For the really fair and cheap price we payed we are happy with the hotel. The rooms are already a bit older but everything is clean. The cleaners are all very friendly to us and also the reception they made our bookings for some trips we had and also reservations for the restaurants we have been. The bar is small but nice and we had even some live music there. The breakfast was good and in the price included. Only things negative was a not working credit card terminal on check-out so we had to pay cash (happened also in other hotels in morocco). Another thing but no really that bad was the breakfst wasn't really ready on the day we had a trip. Another morning they had some things missing when we came after 9 am. All in all it's a good hotel for a fair price and I really would recommend this hotel to others especially because of the central position in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rapperswil, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobi19852017
Opera Plaza Hotel,sais wrote a review Dec 2018,10,Stay away!,Stay away from this hotel. It is not worth the price and certainly not a 4 star hotel. The only good thing is the location. There is no wifi even though they advertise this.  The hotel is really old and badly maintained everything in the room is falling apart. The staff are very rude especially the lady on reception she was speaking about customers in front of them with her colleagues in their language. They need to get sent on customer service training.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Wahab Y wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Excellent!!!,We travelled to Morocco for the first time for our anniversary and booked the opera plaza hotel. Its only about 10 mins from airport and everything is nearby for example the jama al fana square McDonalds kfc shisha cafes and many more restaurants within walking distance. The hotel itself was exceptional and we could not fault it at all. Very clean and helpful staff aswell accommodating all our needs with no issues at all. We only had breakfast with our booking and even so we enjoyed it every morning. They would make fresh omelettes with whatever topping you want and a host of food trust me for the price the best hotel around.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wahaby2017
Opera Plaza Hotel,jerryg364 wrote a review Dec 2018,10,Avoid this dump,The hotel is located on the train station plaza not the opera house plaza which is a block away. That means lots of noise and low-end restaurants etc. They are saving the world by turning off A/C in early fall even though the temp was hitting 78-80 while I was there. Had to sleep with sliding balcony doors open. They also scrimp on lighting in the rooms and the hallways require that you turn on lights from dimly glowing switches. Inconvenient as well as unsafe. Part of breakfast buffet is served in near-total darkness. Amenities are virtually nonexistent as is Wi-Fi and courtesy from staff. The property is poorly maintained and so hard up for revenue that they pulled me off our tour bus and tried to charge me for a small hand towel I had blotted blood on when I cut my leg on their cheaply made furniture.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Norman P wrote a review Dec 2018,30,A lot of let-downs,It didn’t bode well when the lift here got stuck just after we arrived and several people had to jump out with their luggage from its half exposed door.    The main problem with this hotel is the restaurant which is self-service. Breakfast is a chaotic bunfight and there are continual problems with plates bowls and spoons running out. The buffet area is at one end of a long room so a long walk is repeatedly required to obtain the next course or whatever. At dinner food was often cold (including the soup) – which was not helped by having to use cold plates.    Personally I found the bed too hard so didn’t sleep well. But getting into the room was a problem in itself because the credit-card type door key didn’t work much of the time and I had to take ours back 3 times to be re-programmed.    The wi-fi was another thing that worked only intermittently and slowly and one frequently just gave up.    The hotel was a long walk or a taxi ride from the main square of Marrakesh so its position isn’t great.    Having said all that it was clean and had a lovely pool which our balcony overlooked.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormanP389

Breakfast - not much too inspire I’m afraid but okay that said even though we were on b&b we still ate breakfast over the road at Grand Central Cafe a couple of times.  The daily housekeeping failed to remove teapots/cups/wine glasses at any point so they remained in situ for days and gradually increased in number.

The people of the hotel are nice and are willen to help you with almost everything.  Siham and Mohamed of the reception helped us with almost all the activities that we have booked via the hotel. They also gave good options for places to go out in the evening.  The breakfast is good and has a good variation. You can even choose what you want in your eggs. The hotel is clean and the rooms are nice.  One day there was a problem with the airconditioning and straight away they made an effort to fix it or else they would have gotten us a other room.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Matthew D wrote a review Jun 2018,50,A lovely hotel,We arrived at the hotel late in the evening and was warmly welcomed by the staff. We had no hassle with check-in and our porter took our luggage to our room. We found the hotel to be very clean from the room to the pool to the restaurant.  We were fortunate to have a pool view with balcony which was lovely to sit out on during the evenings. The music from the poolside normally stopped around 11:30 pm but did not bother us in the slightest.  The location of the hotel is in the 'New Town' area and around a 45-minute flat walk to the Medina. You are across the road from the train station where we (if we had time) would have took a train to Fez.  Like previously said our room was clean and spacious with a large and very comfortable bed. There was a flat screen TV with a couple English speaking channels we manly caught up with BBC worldwide news and CNN. Like other reviews the bathroom is lovely but the bath does have tall sides and can be difficult to get in and out of. I struggled and I'm a little under average height. Our only 'complaint' which was just personal preference was there was no coffee making facilities in our room. We understood why but for us we really missed having our coffee in bed before heading down to grab breakfast. There is however a fridge stocked with water soft drinks and beers. We did use the minibar on several occasions and unlike other reviewers we paid our bill at the end of the stay with no problems.  The pool area was our favourite aspect of the hotel. It is busiest during the day where people use the many sun loungers to get a tan. In the evening there are live Moroccan acts on to give it a lovely holiday feel which either having some food or a quiet beer. While we were there at night the pool area was quiet and we had the luxury of having the full attention of the staff. On our first night we decided to try and have the buffet. At 200dh this was expensive compared to other places in Morocco yet for me personally I love that the staff talked to me about the Moroccan food its history (and at the time) its links with Ramadan. The staff made sure our individual needs were met (I have a severe fish allergy) in a very polite and professional manner. The breakfasts were good with a variety of pastries hams cheeses and made to order omelettes and scrambled eggs... and chicken nuggets and potato.  They have facilities to change your pounds/euros/dollars into dirham when often changed pounds in dirham and was a much better exchange rate than at Gatwick airport.  On the day of departure they sorted everything out quickly and efficiently. They arranged a taxi to take us to the airport later that day and put our luggage in a luggage room while we went out shopping.

It's in a great location if your needling public transport as it's across the road from the bus station where Superatours buses depart and the train station  The only thing I disliked was the lighting in the hallways it's very very dark in fact it's there are no lights on in the hallways you have to push the light switches as you get on to the hallway to get any light  I also had a massage / Hamman treatment at the hotels spa which was very nice  All the staff that I spoke to were lovely and very polite  Breakfast was good you could have omelette made to order and there was a wide selection of food  The only thing I didn't like was that the coffee cups were those silly little expresso cups so you had to keep going up for more coffee all the time,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlearoseB
Opera Plaza Hotel,b11lrs wrote a review May 2018,40,A lovely hotel in a good location,Before travelling to Marrakech I read the reviews on this site and thought this is very much a marmite hotel you either like it or you hate it. We loved it it is in a good location next door to the station sadly no Marrakech Express opposite the Opera House and probably a 25 minute walk to the Medina.  Check in was easy and speedy though you will need your passport with the immigration number stamped in it for the records. The check in staff were very friendly and although I had read a couple of reviews that said the doorman was officious I found him to be great for the whole five days.  We were in room 525 top floor with a view down onto the swimming pool. A good size room with a safe and king size bed. The bathroom has a bath and shower enclosed. My wife found it difficult getting in and out of the bath as the width is about 9 inches to get across. There are toiletries the water is as hot as you want and there is a bidet.  Downstairs you will find a large foyer leading to bars and the swimming pool area. From the foyer there are stairs leading to a small art gallery with a magnificent window overlooking the Opera House. This is generally open in the evening.  On the first day we had lunch by the pool they do a good pizza here for 80 dirham about £6. There is a local beer called Casablanca and this is 5% by volume or you could pay more for Heiniken.  The pool is not heated but a large size and once you are in the body soon adjusts to the temperature. The hotel has free wifi and depends on where you are as to how strong it is.  I read a review about the lights not working in the corridors and not being fixed. Whoever wrote this did not notice the button outside almost every room in the corridor that turns the light on a timer! It made me chuckle thinking of this person getting really annoyed because they had not worked out the system.  So what is the down side and why did I not give it 5 stars? Well we eat each evening in The Rossini Restaurant next to the pool. This is a buffet style eatery and the food changes every day to a degree and is also very tasty. Sadly the staff do not seem to understand how to take an order for drink from more than one person and forget an order that they have taken. This was not one evening but every one. If you stay longer than a day you either decide not to have anything or get in quick speak to the server and either hand them the wine you want or keep reminding them.  In summary though this hotel is well worth a stay the rooms are good many have balconies even the ones that face the road. Treat the staff as you would want to be treated and they will look after you. Remember you are on holiday or having a break and do not get upset if things are not being done as quickly as you may want.,Date of stay: May 2018,,"Sleaford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b11lrs
Opera Plaza Hotel,Jas B wrote a review May 2018,10,Worst holiday EVER,My husband and I stayed at this hotel toward the start of May and we had an absolutely terrible experience. We travel a lot and have both good and bad experiences across the world but nothing compares to the stay at this hotel.    We ate only at the hotel and we both became very unwell upon our return home. It appears we caught food poisoning which for me proves how unclean the hotel it is. The food was horrible terrible quality and clearly there’s a lack of hygiene and decent cooking given how ill we both were. Food choice was very limited too.    The hotel itself is dirty in need or renovation and uplifting. It is absolutely NOT a four star property.    The staff are unhelpful rude and ignorant. Check in and check out was painful they’re dismissive when you request anything even an iron. They never respond to any requests. The worst thing is they take £30 deposit to hire a towel for a day let towel. What a ridiculous amount of money to hold for a towel!

Opera Plaza Hotel,karl786 wrote a review May 2018,10,*** Do not Trust your booking with this Hotel ***,**** Steer clear of this hotel ****    I had a ‘guaranteed’ booking with this hotel in May 2018 through booking.com with a confirmation number and email.    I had booked the room 8 weeks prior to our stay at a very reasonable rate.    Ahead of our stay I was already in Marrakech and had we left our luggage with opera plaza 3 days before; so they were expecting us.    We arrived for check-in in the evening at approx 9pm.    We were told in no uncertain terms that our booking had been cancelled and that there was no room available for us; and that there was nothing they can do.    So much for the ‘booking guarantee’.    There was another couple with a young baby who suffered the same fate as us and were in tears.    The arrogance of the manager was quite shocking. He simply left at the end of the shift without notifying us and without handing the problem over to a colleague.    I was told that an attempt to take payment was made but was declined but when I checked with the bank they confirmed they they had not seen any attempted transaction.    We received no assistance from the hotel other than a very mediocre alternative hotel nearby.    All decent hotels were unavailable or extremely expensive.    I will never use this hotel again and I would highly recommend that you avoid it.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karl786
Opera Plaza Hotel,ZNKRS wrote a review May 2018,20,Serious Improvements Required,Stayed at this property with friends for a long weekend. To summarise the hotel has potential but the staff and basics let it down tremendously! The hotel is situated pretty central so access to main areas is not too far away. The hotel itself is presented well however If you are expecting any sort of service or help from the hotel staff then you will be let down. Throughout the 3 days there was nothing but rudeness from the extremely unhelpful staff that are employed at this property. Upon arrival the check in process was slow all 8 of us were required to fill in forms with the only 1 pen that was at the hotel. The lifts are extremely small and don’t expect any of the staff to give their guests priority to take a lift as they are always rushing to get in first themselves. The room itself is nice. We had a triple room which consisted of 2 double beds and 1 single. The room was clean however was missing some basics. No kettle for tea coffee and more importantly no iron! The hotel according to reception only has one iron across the entire property. During the evenings the lights seem to go off and you can find yourself walking down hallways in pitch black! The breakfast was ok had asked for brown bread on one occasion and I received a look like I had asked the waiter for gold. Continuing on service when we asked the receptionist (I believe her name was F Chinbou) for the use of an iron she started speaking extremely rudely about us in French (thinking we didn’t understand) to her colleague right in front of us! Maybe you want to be careful who you speak about as some of your guests do understand French! Regardless of all of this the award for best service for this hotel goes to Hicham the doorman. I have stayed at a number of hotels around the world but never come across someone so rude and power hungry. I think the cape this gentleman wears has gone to his head and he feels he can speak to people and treat people as he feels fit. The manner in which he greats and speaks is simply horrendous. As mentioned the hotel is good but unfortunately the staff let this place down. If you’re in the hospitality business my recommendation would be to train your staff to be helpful and polite to guests not rude stuck up and obnoxious. On the plus side the spa and pool area is pleasant. If you don’t care about the service then not a bad hotel to stay at however in my opinion and that of 7 others - Serious improvements required!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZNKRS
Opera Plaza Hotel,Michael C wrote a review May 2018,50,Excellent hotel in ideal position for Mdina and railway station,This modern hotel has clean well decorated and comfortable rooms with an excellent maid service to keep them in top condition. The public rooms too are clean and comfortable in a modern style. The swimming pool is in the centre of the complex in what would probably be called 'the atrium'. In March the water was cold! The restaurant serves mostly buffet meals with a good choice of both local and international dishes. There is also a quite extensive wine list. Food and service are good. The hotel is well situated with the Mdina a short taxi or electric bus ride away. Walking to the old city takes about 20 minutes. The railway station is next to the hotel for those who wish to see more of Morocco.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Michael N wrote a review May 2018,40,A lovely hotel,We recently stayed at this hotel with a tour group and were impressed with most things. Our room which overlooked the pool was very spacious as was the bathroom which had a walk in shower. It was beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The cleanliness of the hotel was something else with the balconies windows and the area around the swimming pool being thoroughly washed every day. The only downside was the music playing most of the time on the poolside which was a bit too loud and just got a bit tiresome.    The Opera Plaza has three main restaurants which are International Moroccan & Italian. Whilst we didn't go to the Moroccan the Italian restaurant was very good. The International restaurant had a good breakfast buffet and whilst that in the evening was good the main courses were not brilliant. The desserts though were to die for. The restaurant on the side of the pool is also worth going to.    Their bar in the evenings can be very smokey and is not pleasant to walk through en route to the restaurant. You can however walk to it outside which is much better.    The hotel is just across the road from the station and is about a mile from the Medina. Tour buses stop a couple of hundred yards down the road.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Ruislip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelN629
Opera Plaza Hotel,Miguel Pires wrote a review May 2018,50,The Greatest Hotel EVER!,This was my 1st time in Morocco and I started my trip in Marrakech! Before my trip I was looking for a nice hotel not crazy expensive close to the city centre and a place I could feel relaxed after the long walking day's discovery the city!  The hotel that comes through on booking.com search was The Opera Plaza and I have to say I'm so glad I booked this hotel!  The hotel's amazing beauty the staff was superb (thanks Gabe the receptionist for all the help and amazing customer service u provide on our arrival) the breakfast delicious and the room so comfortable and cosy! I admit was probably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  A few things about the hotel location:  • I didn't take any taxi (apart from the airport to the hotel) any of the days in Marrakech. From the hotel to the city centre it's about 20/25min walking;  • Around the hotel you will find really good restaurants just have a look here on trip advisor and the best ones will pop up.  • A little advice download the Google Maps offline for Marrakech really easy for you move around.  Another great thing it's that the best bus station to travel inside Marocco it's like 4min walking from the hotel. If you want to move around Marocco but don't want to rent a car it's easy just get a bus from Supratours!  I spend 4 days in Marrakech and 5 in Agadir was the perfect match for the crazy atmosphere of Marrakech and the sunny beach in Agadir.  And I'm sure if I come back to Marrakech I will stay at Hotel Opera Plaza!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miguelcpires
Opera Plaza Hotel,MrDeelio wrote a review May 2018,20,"Standard, nothing special",Stayed here for a long weekend. My advice.. look for something else and only book this if you have no other choice.  Opera Plaza is in a good location it’s close to some shopping areas 15 minutes from the market and close by is a train station restaurants etc. But my chance of staying here again is probably like the size of their lifts very small!!  I'm all for saving energy and looking after mother earth but please can someone buy some lighting for the corridors! It's a dark and eerie walk to your rooms watch out for the walls!!  Clean rooms & comfortable beds but be warned they lack some basic necessities not just things you need for a vacation but even for everyday life! No kettle teas coffees and no iron! Thanks opera plaza for letting me walk around Marrakech in un-ironed clothing! Apparently there is only 1 iron in the whole hotel which means we are forced to use their laundry services. We were also accused of keeping the iron on one occasion and not returning it. So overall we were a bunch of thieves in creased up clothing (thumbs up Opera Plaza) - oh and the hotel balcony is off limits. We were not allowed to eat outside food smoke or let alone breathe as the management and stuck up doorman (hicham) interrupted our stay.  Never have I stayed at a hotel where the staff were so unfriendly. The miserable receptionists were so rude and hardly cracked a smile. When asking for change or use of the iron etc they snapped and mumbled in french to their colleagues about us whilst we stood there.  The pool area was nice and the spa facilities & treatments were acceptable. But that was about the only positive things I can mention. It's a real shame as this hotel as so much potential.  Maybe a quick night or two stay with family is fine for here but if you want to have an enjoyable stay with friends - might be better to look elsewhere as they will watch you like hawks and ensure you have a unpleasant stay.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrDeelio
Opera Plaza Hotel,Silverwanderer44 wrote a review Apr 2018,30,Not for those wanting peace and quiet,Just returned home after five nights at this hotel. We arrived late in the evening after a delayed flight. No local currency as one can't get it out of the country. So when we wanted to get a drink to have with the buffet that was waiting for us we were unable to do so as we didn't at that stage have our room numbers. One member of staff followed one of our group round the place until she actually was able to provide a room number. However for me the main criticism was the noise. During the day and up to about 10.30 pm there was music blaring out in the internal courtyard. Much as I like Charles Aznavour I would suggest that they purchase some more CDs... It went off only to be replaced by loud - very very loud - music from the adjoining hotel/bar which went on until about 1.15 every night. It pounded through the walls on the side of the hotel where I was trying to sleep. Ringing down to reception worked the first night - but not after that. If you value your sleep - don't stay here.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silverwanderer44

The hotel is clean and staff are very helpful and the language isnt a barrier. The country speaks French Arabic & English.  Reviews claimed breakfast was inconsistent it was varied and delicious: I mean who had exactly the same breakfast everyday??  Rooms are spacious and also very clean we had a pool facing room 4th floor as did the other room. We didnt spend our days in the hotel but we saw a few people around the pool which again was very clean.  In the mornings the birds singing were quite calming actually.  In regards to taxis please be careful only take yellow taxis when out as they are licensed other locals will try to get you to use them but if anything was to happento you its better to have an insured driver (they drive crazy by the way)  The hotel is located about 5-10 min drive from main sq and you can haggle a price. Dont pay No more than 50DH (13dh to a £) and haggle everything!!  If you wany excursions they have many local ppl claiming they can help but again ask the hotel and they have legit companys who can help  We didn't eat at the hotel however we found an amazing resturant called Azar not far from the hotel which is very fairly priced with beautiful food and atmosphere.  Airport is 15-20mins away  Only negative is they didn't clean our room during our 4 day stay we mentioned it to reception but they didn't come so we just asked for fresh towels instead.  It didn't bother us really but its the principal if that makes sense.  Hope it helps.

Opera Plaza Hotel,CasaSulo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,A wonderful dawn chorus,We stayed here two nights on a tour of Morocco and it was described by our tour operator as ‘four star’ we have discovered there is a BIG difference between them all. The Opera Plaza could easily move up the scale four star plus.  We arrived mid-afternoon and were given room 324 – spacious large comfortable bed soft decoration balcony with table and chairs which we made use of in the early evening listening to the birds competing with the disco music – we think the birds won. There were plenty of output socket large cupboard which doubled up as a disk and a well-stocked fridge. Free Wi-Fi but the promised TV listings did not materialise and we only received Moroccan channels. Not a problem. Just an observation. The bathroom was modern and well-lit with good mirrors and an excellent shower. In the morning (we are early risers) the dawn chorus was to us wonderful. We ate breakfast outside by the pool and the food was well presented and extremely tasty both hot and cold. We didn’t try the other restaurants in the evening preferring to go local and there were many local restaurants for tagines etc. both to the left and the right down side roads and all with very reasonable “Moroccan” prices.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CasaSulo

Breakfast was good with a variety of fruit vegtables bread and pastry. A plus for making omlets and a type of pancake on demand.

I had previously stayed here with the Mrs and this time round it was just as good.    The hotel itself is very nice and has a very nice smell every time you walk into the lobby.  We arrived at 3pm and check in was no problem at all. We was in our rooms within 5 minutes of arriving. The room was spotless and we had good views of the pool and the main road in the 2nd room.  We only used the hotel to really chill together and sleep at night so I cant really comment on breakfast or dinner at this hotel on this visit.    Location wise it is perfect with a bowling alley and pool table downstairs an Italian restaurant next door and the train station across the road as well as the theatre royal.    The train station also has a Mc Donalds KFC and banks for your money exchange so I found this ideal. There is also a plaza 15 minutes walk in the opposite direction with a few nice upmarket restaurants. We had dinner at chillies and it was gorgeous. I would definitely recommend it. It also has a Carrefour in there if you fancy abit of shopping.    The guard at the front of the hotel is very helpful and will call for a cab if you need one hold the door open for you and help you with your suitcases.    The only downside is that there is a 'no food from outside' policy which was abit of a bummer.

The evening started out nice we were welcomed into this nice and cosy locker room. Where we were told to change clothes and slip into our bathrobes. We got some pretty used flipflops and we had an argument about who was gonna choose the dirtier flop (my girlfriend won the clean ones).    We were guided to the showers where we got our hammas treatment (we wasn't exactly sure what we paid for but 500 dirhams is 500 dirhams if you know what im saying). It started with showers then we got some green looking gooey on our bodies (which was nice) then she guided us too a steam sauna where we chilled for what seemed like an eternity. We were actually there for about ten minutes but we had to keep the door open because it was so hot inside. Finally the spa lady came back and saved us we ran from the door so she wouldn't see that we had actually chilled with the door open because of the heat. She didn't suspect a thing plan went perfect.    Then two spa ladies basically scrubbed us down until we were out of skin but it was really really nice.    After that we got guided into the massage room where they gave us really good massages. We were there for 45 minutes and after the argan oil massage they wrapped us up in towels. So we were laying there with towels on our bodies and our faces and left us alone for about ten minutes. After that the mani pedi lady came and took my girlfriend with her. I was still laying there and was waiting for orders if i could take the towel off my face and leave the room. I swear to god if i have to listen to one more zen-cricket sound effect i'll literally have to end my life.    I was there for 45 minutes and no-one came looking for me. Finally someone opened the door and was a little bit shocked because there were two new people standing there and looking confused about why there was a half naked man wrapped in three hotel towels.    I finally got the courage to get up and leave and passed my girlfriend getting a mani pedi. This is her experience:    ""So i was guided out of the room and into another room where i had two spa-ladies that did a mani and pedi on me at the same time. Because of the argan oil massage (really good) the nail polish had some problems with drying. The entire time i was sitting with them they were talking in arabic (which was not a problem) they seemed really nice and every time the argument between them got heated they would turn around to me and say: ""Beautiful nails"".    On the way back to the hotel room (which was another hotel please read review on red hotel) my pedicure rubbed off on the lobby walls by accident. I feel really bad about this but i feel really bad about not getting time enough to dry them off aswell. You win some and you lose some i guess. My nails look horrible right now all smooched off on the sheets.""    Summary: All in all was a very good experience. Even though it seems we didn't like the service we actually loved it. Waiting alone in a dark room with zen cricket sounds on loop and super slippery one size flipflops makes it so we can't give this five star rating. But it was very good.    - Joe Winkleton and Big Bertha",Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeWinkleton
Opera Plaza Hotel,dskid wrote a review Dec 2017,40,One of the best hotels we stayed at in Morocco,We had a large room with three beds though we only needed one. Unlike most hotel rooms in Morocco this one had a smoke detector though there was no indication that it was working. The room did have an evacuation plan posted on the room door so that's something. We had a balcony with a table and two chair overlooking the pool and atrium. The floor of the room was carpeted. The room had a small table with two chairs. I don't think this is a good business hotel as there is no place to use as a desk. The bathroom was pretty good though it had no Kleenex. It did have a towel warmer thick towels (no wash cloths) and shampoo but no conditioner. There was not a lot of room around the sink and that's a big negative for me. The make-up mirror could not be held in place so was worthless. Surprisingly there was no coffee/tea service and no electric kettle.    Thanks for reading.

Opera Plaza Hotel,ClassPED wrote a review Dec 2017,10,Poor Food Hygiene- BEWARE,As part of a Collette Morocco Tour our group was lodged at the Opera Plaza in Marrakech. The hotel was located in a very nice area of the city it had nicely appointed rooms and the hotel staff was generally very accommodating.  Now for the one and by far the greatest concern: Food preparation and hygiene.  I was wittiness to the person preparing our omelets doing so without any gloves while also handling raw eggs. This same person having raw egg on their hand thereafter picked up just cooked crepes to then give to another guest. The raw egg then dripped onto this prepared crepes as well. It was then given to this unsuspecting hotel guest. As I then walked past this egg station another person was at the buffet area touching almost every roll on the table with his bare fingers checking to see if they were soft or not (no gloves worn). No wonder persons on our tour were ill if this were in any other country I believe the health department would have shut them down.  Warning: get your act together and improve your food handling.

Opera Plaza Hotel,ajee2010 wrote a review Dec 2017,50,"best hotel in my four different visits, here's why and comparison",I have been to Marrakech 4 times stayed at the Parc Ryad with family Jardin koutabia (5 star-ish) and a ryad.  I would say the Parc Ryad was perfect for family on a low budget but it was miles away from the city centre or Jama el fana however that didn't bother us.  Jardin koutabia was great but very expensive so stayed as bill was shared.  Opera Plaza sits in the middle of those two I would be able to stay with the family as it's affordable has a great pool and food is excellent (in regards to value for money). Both our rooms had balconies at the same price one was larger and better layout so ask or view before settling for one if possible. Rooms had a safe fridge and good clean bedding. There is good entertainment its centrally located so easy to get around and the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful.  We had two rooms one of them had an issue with a bed but was sorted nothing to complain about or knock off stars. When you go on holiday relax chill out and stop getting annoyed at little things. I hate the reviews where people complain about little things when they clearly haven't paid 5star prices.  Opera Plaza ticked all the boxes and will probably be the first place I check for prices and availability next time I visit.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajee2010

Opera Plaza Hotel,Extraordinary699020 wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Great visit,Stayed here for a week at the end of September with our two adult daughters.  Rooms were spacious and clean and breakfast was great with the option of eating poolside.  The hotel is in a great location about a five minute taxi ride to the main square ( 50 dirhams seemed to be the going rate and 70 at night )  Staff all friendly helpful and polite even when confronted by some incredibly rude and arrogant guest.  Morrocco has a different culture and way of life which should be respected. we found everyone incredibly helpful it's also well worth befriending big Hisham the doorman and concierge  throughout our visit he helped with taxis tours and general advice.  The square and souks are 100 miles per hour  but once you learn how to handle the hustle and bustle and don't feel obliged to answer everyone that approaches you ( just avoid eye contact a polite no and ignoring them isn't found to be offensive ) then Marrakesh is a hugely diverse exciting and evocative city ..... love it,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Coalburn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary699020

Opera Plaza Hotel,DairyKing1 wrote a review Oct 2017,10,Avoid Avoid Avoid!,"Went here with my family for a week and it was the most horrendous hotel experience. The pictures their website and various reviews had us looking forward to staying here but it didn't live up to what we had hoped. We overheard several complaints being made at the reception when we were checking in and we should have known then that this hotel was the wrong decision.    Some of the staff were extremely rude and demeaning they tried to charge us for things we hadn't taken from the mini bar the food was absolutely horrendous the pool closes early and has a burkini ban and the WiFi was excruciatingly slow to use. We even had to beg for a kettle to use in our room to warm the baby's milk and on several occasions they had us waiting hours for simple necessity's like spoons and bowls to feed the baby (one staff member told us they didn't have any dessert spoons - really?!).    Breakfast buffet was included and things would be left out for hours i.e. cheese until it dried up (in the heat) and bread would be left uncovered poolside free to be walked all over by birds. Barely anything edible....we even paid £25pp for a dinner buffet which was bland and dried up. We even made complaints and were given a run around by staff until we spoke to the head chef who was unable to remedy the situation. To make matters worse no outside food was allowed which is extremely hard with young kids and it being Ramadan (few restaurants were closed).    It wouldn't be fair to not include some pros; being location was decent next to train station and easy access to cabs. Some of them have the tendency to rip you off so if you find a fair priced one stay with them for the duration of your trip. We had two rooms a triple and double and they were both spacious and the beds were comfortable. They also had a bowling alley next door which is fairly priced for some wholesome family fun (would definitely recommend).    The hotel basically lacked a 'family friendly' atmosphere and was all business their way to solving their costumers disputes was basically ""If you don't like it tough!"" which was unfortunate as the hotel definitely has potential. If you want a well rounded vacation please pick another hotel. And if the hotel sees this then please actively make an effort to change a few things and realise the importance of your customers and their basic needs.",Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DairyKing1

Opera Plaza Hotel,Londoner20177 wrote a review Oct 2017,10,Bring your earplugs,"The wifi connection in the room was very slow. The wifi will connect and disconnect frequently. The pages will take long time to load. I raised this with reception staff on multiple occasions and was informed ""IT is looking into it"". The Problem remained for duration of our stay.    We had a room with an 'Opera view'. This was effectively facing a very busy main road. The sound of constant horning became a norm even with balcony door closed. The road was always busy- Strongly advisable to bring earplugs if you wish to stay in the rooms with Opera view. Even when you open the balcony door at 5am you can hear the constant traffic & horning. Definitely not recommend for sleepers sensitive to noise. Those who can sleep irrespective of how much traffic noise is around them will still need earplugs as the traffic is never-ending.    The pricing In the hotel seemed to be more expensive then shopping in central London. To give an example small water bottle will cost 25 Dirham in the hotel when the shop outside will cost 3.5 dirhams. Quad bike excursion organised via hotel was quoted as 500 dirhams which will be part of a large group- however looking outside the hotel a private quad bike excursion (where you don't have to be part of a large group) for 3 people cost 400 dirhams.    Room had a balcony with table and chairs which we can supposedly sit on and enjoy the 'Opera view'- Problematic when all you hear is constant horning; busy traffic and not to add the oil smell.    On a plus note the triple room was spacious. Two double beds and one single. There was enough space between the beds and large movement area in the room. Storage was plenty with a large mirror in the room.    Also The room cleaning service was efficient- after leaving on the first day we informed the hotel that the room can be cleaned and when we came back within an hour it was cleaned. The maintenance service was also efficient- complained about sink drainage and it fixed within few minutes of informing reception.",Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londoner20177

The breakfast was excellent with additional extra touches like the fresh omelettes and pancakes. The choice was very decent. The pool is very clean with many comfy sun beds. The room 220 we stayed inn had excellent pool view. The room itself was very modern with large shower area and storage space with TV and balcony. The room was cleaned everyday by the staff towels bed sheets changed. The staff all speak very good English especially front of house who are very helpful and friendly. I would like to thank all the staff especially the girl from their bookings who sorted this excellent room out on my request.  Look no further hotel is located in nice location you can get around all of marakech very easily from here. I found a large supermarket if you walk out of the hotel turn left down the first road where the station it's 10 min walk but it has everything and it is very cheap. Also a decent place to eat near the hotel was on the same road before the large supermarket opposite the supra tours bus station has red shop front modern looking clean place the food was very nice and very good value.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zee6666

When I spoke to reception and asked for a different room they looked at me as if I was mad!  The food at breakfast was dreadful with very little choice. The bar was comfortable but staff were not friendly and everything seemed like an effort to them. The bottles of beer had rust around the bottle tops!  The pool area was quite nice but the service was shocking at the pool bar and restaurant. I have a salad that tasted sour due to the lettuce being past the sell by date.  We had to beg for towels and if we were lucky we would get them before we headed to the bar/ restaurant for a spot of lunch!  The bedrooms and bathrooms were shocking! Very tired and basic.

They said that one of the tours started at 9 am that is why we wanted to wake up at 8 am but the phone was ringing at 7.45 : ’The car is here’ so we hurried and I forgot to put my gold earrings into the safe. When we came back to the hotel my earrings disappeared. We notified the receptionists but they did not do anything. After 2 days we asked them again and finally one of the receptionists called the housemaids: ’she said she did not find anything’. We checked the room at least 5 times so it was obvious that somebody had stolen them. In case of an other tour offered by the hotel the pricing method of the tour guide was outrageous since he wanted us to pay three times more than the previously indicated price so we finally refused to take the tour although we paid the transfer to Atlas and the lunch. The recepcionist told us that the manager would talk to the tour organizer agency but we didn't get any feedback on it.

Opera Plaza Hotel,bengal_tigress wrote a review May 2017,30,"Good location, average hotel and could do with improvement",This is an average hotel and I don't feel it's 4 star worthy. I would say it's a top end 3 star at best. It's pleasant looking from the outside and has small lovely pool which gets a lot of sun. Our rooms were facing the roads. On the first night we got there we were greeted by a friendly staff member. The door man is very helpful and friendly. Other staff were also friendly but there were quite a few who weren't really interested in helping at all and at times could be rude.    It's possible to walk to the Jemaa El Fnaa from here although we always took a cab as you'd have to walk in the heat for about 20 minutes. We never managed a metered taxi so always had to pay above the price. The doorman would normally help with this to ensure it wasn't excessive although the price he negotiated for us was always above the price had it been metered however we appreciated the fact that he did help.    We had breakfast included in ours. It was a very average buffet breakfast (nothing special but nothing to complain about either) although I did like the fact there was a person making omelettes daily. Would have been better if they had more options. Get there early as it does get packed quickly.    Pros:  - Good location  - Rooms were a very decent size safe was good  - Free wifi although you can only do very basic things with it like check email etc. Anything more than that and it won't work and was slow!  - Some friendly staff (the breakfast manager was wonderful he helped us immensely in explaining to staff who do not speak English).  - They had a good spa room where we used the hammam and I felt so refreshed from it. The lady did a wonderful job scrubbing my back. I also had a facial which was very good. I would certainly recommend the hammam and facial but not the rest (see below in cons). It was easy to get an appointment.    Cons:  - The carpets were stained and dirty and although pleasant looking at reception and from the outside as you go up it's actually quite out of date and looks dirty.  - Whilst I'd recommend the hammam and the facial unfortunately the remainder services that we used (massage and manicure/pedicure) were mediocre at best. The massage was just so hard and the lady doing the manicure was very impatient and stroppy and the nail polish came off straight away.  - We didn't realise we needed to bring a towel with us to the spa as although they had towels available they wouldn't allow you to take the towel back upstairs and then bring it back down to them. You must change whilst there so remember to take a towel with you.  - The bed was so hard to the point it gave me a backache. And I'm someone who actually enjoys a firm bed!  - Room cleaning wasn't great. It was below average. We often ran out of toilet tissue and it would take ages to get a replacement which was so frustrating as when the room cleaning had taken place they should have seen there was hardly any tissue and given an extra roll especially as it was evident there were three people in the room. Our duvet covers were also not changed daily.  - We had a room of three single beds. 2 were decent size and 1 was for a small kid. Given it was 3 adults it would have been great if the beds were all the same size especially given the room was big enough and could accommodate it.  - On the day we were leaving at checkout they sent someone upstairs who was rummaging around the room to make sure we hadn't taken any of the towels. I appreciate they need their towels and we had no intention of taking it but it made us feel so uncomfortable of them doing this especially when they were rummaging through the room and panicking since one of the towels was on the bed and blended with the duvet.  - At times the person at reception would be busy on the phone and despite us requiring help would not get off and it was clear it was a personal call not a customer calling. On the day we were checking out the person who needed to check us out (and there's only one person at the desk) was busy having a casual conversation with someone else. She could see we were waiting but did nothing to attempt to serve us and almost made us late.    I would say this hotel is only worth staying at if you're on a budget. It's not worth anymore than £50 a night (per room not per person). (And I am being generous here!)    Would I come back to say? Only if I couldn't find something better then probably yes. Saying that I am returning to Marrakech in July and although Opera Plaza was an option we have chosen to stay at a different 4 star hotel who has similar reviews to Opera Plaza but was cheaper in price.    Would I recommend it? If you're looking for a real 4 star hotel then no as it is not 4 star quality. If you're happy with 3 stars or below then yes. Don't get me wrong it's an average hotel but it really needs some major improvement to be considered 4 stars (in terms of service and quality and just general maintenance).,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bengal_tigress

Opera Plaza Hotel,BibigulDoha wrote a review May 2017,40,Good location & Comfortable room,We arrived from Rabat. It was a big group of 25 persons. Our group leaders / organisers went to the Reception while we waited in the spacious cool lobby.  Our luggage was wheeled in rapidly. We got our allotted rooms and got our luggage marked and left for upstairs. The luggage followed in a while as there were many of us and only 2 persons handling it.  The rooms were big with comfortable beds 2 arm chairs with a table between and a big desk and chair.    The only thing missing and disappointing was the lack of an Ironing table and iron. It has become a standard feature all over the world but not so in Morocco. This being the third hotel we stayed in since the beginning of our visit to the country.    The breakfast was great loved the variety enjoyed freshly made eggs in the morning with loads of fruit and other goodies.  Enjoyed the live music one evening in the bar. Requested a couple of songs and the singers did a good job.

Opera Plaza Hotel,redeco wrote a review Apr 2017,50,"Clean, Comfortable, Nice Location",Such varied opinions in reviews regarding this hotel! I wonder why because my experience was superb.    The hotel is conveniently located in New Town across from the Opera House and just near the Train Station - and not very far from the medina. The clean modern structure has small but very fast elevators a beautiful pool multiple dining rooms and restaurants to choose from and a hopping bar scene. I tried Bella Italia Restaurant - very good pizza but glacial service - very slow. I'll do a separate review on this place.    I was assigned to room 104 a moderate-sized room with a furnished balcony overlooking the pool. Décor is quietly elegant with carved hardwood headboard on the king bed nice desk area small upholstered tub chair and night stands to match. Color scheme is brown/beige and quite comfortable. Lighting is soft yet adequate for reading. Very good lighting in the bathroom. Sleep quality is quite good; bed is comfortable.    The bathroom is reached via a small hall/dressing area with good shelving a safe and adequate hanging space and luggage rack. The bath itself was charming and tiled with polished limestone blocks. A large vanity/sink to match; good lighting; blow drier; fluffy white towels; and the usual assortment of soaps and lotions. Toilet is in a room adjacent to the bath/shower.    The breakfast area is very comfortable with lots of good choices. There is an omelet chef and a pancake maker just outside by the pool Both are outstanding. I liked the breads and cakes particularly the sliced panetone which was very fresh. The cheeses olives with harissa and spicy beef sausages are quite good.    A musician plays in the lobby/reception area in the early evening - a nice touch. I'd stay here again.

I did the booking with months before on Booking.com. My travel to Marrakech it was with a motorcycle and on the day that i arrived the hotel cancelled my booking at 18:30pm!!! After trying contact me without sucess at 15h pm!! They said that it was for troubles on my credit card?! I arrived really tired to the hotel at 19:00pm and the staff it was not very nice.. After 2 days there when i check out they showed me a almost 100Eur bill from the bar with things that i do not consumed! And a lady who gave me the wrong bill was rude and did not apologize for the mistake. They have no metods to guarantee that nobody will put their bills in your room number! And if you asked for a new key for the room they will gave you without guarantee that it is really yours!

You must try the Malawi and chefs also made fresh omelettes ! In the evenings we were offered free tea to take to our rooms. Throughly enjoyed the stay.  Only one point to make the pool was so cold!

Opera Plaza Hotel,Joule79 wrote a review Apr 2017,20,Ok hotel with a couple huge flaws,We came to this hotel at the end of our Morocco trip mainly because I needed a modern more European experience and because it is really close to the supratour station where the bus arrives from the desert. Hotel is nice and clean and rooms have an ok size. It has a minor annoyance and a huge flaw though:  The lights in the halls are timed and turned off most of the time which is really ok but they don't have movement sensors so when you go out of the room you have to navigate in pitch dark to find a light switch. This coupled with the fact that taking the room key will instantly mean all the lights in the room will go out makes it annoying but not a huge issue.  The huge issue is heating and air conditioning. We came in April which is hot in Marrakesh. They divide the year in two parts and consider April winter. The HVAC system will only provide heating in winter so your room is absurdly warm. The hotel is in a really busy intersection even at 4am so you are left with two choices: don't sleep because you after boiling it don't sleep because of the noise (and be warm anyway but bearable). In the end we chose the noice and were happy it was only one night.  We spent nights in old riads aubergues and even the middle of the desert and by far this was the worst most uncomfortable night of all of them. Stay somewhere else.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joule79
Opera Plaza Hotel,LeylaAw wrote a review Mar 2017,20,Below expected,Stayed in this hotel with my family. Rooms were average size compared to the amount of money we paid. Staff at reception appeared rude and not very friendly slightly ignorant.  The hotel can't even provide basics for free like an iron or bottle of water compared to other hotels in Morocco!!!  Our ceiling in the bathroom kept on leaking everyday as there are no covers to the shower and all the water spills on the floor.    The tall big security man dressed in traditional Moroccan clothes is a bit patronizing and rude would speak to us only in French even though we only spoke English. Also told us to get his taxi to the airport for 100dh when we only paid 50dh with off the road taxi.    Breakfast was great Ok same stuff everyday no fresh juice.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Karan H wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Typical Marrakech Hotel.,Just across the street from the delightful train station quiet in the hotel otherwise on a busy road junction. Rooms are large very clean and very dark in furniture and lack of daylight. The pool is surrounded by the blocks of hotel rooms and the facilities are all shared by the Red Hotel so breakfast and swimming became noisy and crowded. Wi-fi in the hotel is useless but works in the sister hotel lobby. Food was not good in the hotel but thank goodness for the wonderful Bella Napoli next door saving us from starving.  Although booked in for 7 days we left after three days for the reasons above and found another hotel in another district of Marrakech. Reception and foyer staff were lovely. Polite spoke English and were helpful. Would'nt stay here again.

Opera Plaza Hotel,timirmalde64 wrote a review Mar 2017,40,Good Hotel for location,The location of the hotel was good in the new city and very close proximity to railway station and opposite the Royal Opera. The staff were friendly & courteous. The hotel was clean and tidy. The rooms were clean and bed was good (we like our bed not too soft) as we had a child and got either a queen or king size. The lighting in the room can be a bit better as there are fewer lights. The hot breakfast was good as being vegetarian there was good choice but not enough cereals to choose from. The hotel stated that there would be wifi but was disappointed as none in the rooms only available in the reception area. The lights in the hotel hallway near the rooms are saver so only switches on when you switch on the lights so at night can be pitch dark when you come out of your room. They should have sensor lights so as soon as one is out in the hallway the lights should come on.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timirmalde64
Opera Plaza Hotel,lowlight6 wrote a review Mar 2017,40,Pleasant suprise,We arrived somewhat apprehensive as there are several negative reviews about Morocco and Marrakech and it is a very different environment to what many Europeans are used to ! And it does appear that upon arrival at the airport that the reviews are true ! BUT if you remain fairly resilient when negotiating you will be fine !  Upon arrival after securing a 90d taxi for 4 from the airport the hotel is situated ideally for the station  various shopping centres and about 20 mins to the Medina .  Check in was a pleasant experience but there was no one to take us or our luggage to our rooms  the rooms are a good size well equipped with free safe  fridge  air con from May to Sept ( not very helpful on very hot days in March !! ) bath and shower .  Be aware our bed was exceedingly firm !!!  The room was cleaned every day and was spotless unlike the edge of the pool which needed some attention ( pool is NOT heated )  The staff are amazing very helpful and attentive and smart making the hotel feel very professional.  Breakfast was excellent with a huge range food and drink and a great start to the day !  Sun beds are more comfortable than the beds !! I don't understand the need for a £20 towel deposit !!  The pool bar and staff are a real gem ! With fresh food and cold drinks at a fairly reasonable price .  The huge downside of this hotel are the 3 overpriced restaurants serving poor quality food and this is from four people not just me ! We ate in 3 of the top 10 restaurants on trip advisor and all were either the same price or less than the hotel for far superior meals  it's a shame that the restaurants let this very good hotel down . The breakfast and pool bar is great !!  Bottom line we had a great stay and would return but definitely will have dinner out !!,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowlight6

Opera Plaza Hotel,Jayne S wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Just a few tips for you.,It was our first trip to Marrakech so we didn't know what to expect and learnt through trial and error.The hotel is on a very busy crossroad next to the railway station and is within walking distance of shops and sites to see.The traffic is crazy and very fast so keep your wits about you when crossing the road. Occationally there was a police officer there guiding traffic and it was a lot safer to cross when he was around. Ask for a map at reception as soon as you get there which will give you and idea of where you are in relation to everything. We got scammed one day by someone offering to guide us to the souks...beware they pretend they work at your hotel guide you to a destination then demand an awful lot of money. Also at the main square the ladies will ask you if you'd like a henna tattoo. Even if you say no they will grab your hand start drawing and once again demand money. I got out of it by saying I'm allergic to henna. The little bit they put on you will wash off easily when you get back to the hotel.  The hotel was spotless and the girls would change your towels daily if you wanted and offer more toiletries. Your bed would be changed when you wanted as well. We found all the staff to be pleasant and helpful.The breakfast had a good choice and catered for all tastes. No bacon for obvious reasons but the omelettes were freshly made to order and very tasty. Wifi was very poor at times but we didn't use it that often to miss having a good connection. We ate out most nights as the restaurants at the hotel were very expensive. My partner did use room service once the food was good but once again expensive.  I would definitely go back to Marrakech again and if I couldn't find a similar hotel would stay at Opera Plaza again.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cirencester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421jaynes

Faicel & Sid at reception was very helpful Yasin night security was so lovely and Hashim day security and Aplha were also amazing.  Mariana often did the hotels entertainment at night. It was a pleasure listening to her sing and we even got to perform on stage with her!  The hotel room was spotless! I am very picky about where I stay due to sanitation but Opera Plaza was so clean the bathroom facilities were fancy and worked perfectly.  I didn't use the spa as i found it slightly expensive. The gallery on the 1st floor was a wonderful place to visit.  The bowling alley was a nice affordable place to spend the evening.  The only down sides - The pool was being cleaned during our entire stay so we couldn't use it we chose this hotel specifically because of the pool so this was really disappointing. The breakfast although delicious was pretty basic (except for friday) we would have benefitted from a little more variety and a microwave to heat the food as it was not hot.  Overall Opera Plaza is an amazing hotel! It is located about 15-20mins by bus from the airport 1 minute walk away from the train station 15mins walk to Menara mall and 10min taxi ride to Jemaa El Fna.

The location is one of the best things about this hotel. 5 min cab ride from jama el Fana and a 10 min walk to centre of Gueliz. The pool area is nice with plenty of sun-beds for you to catch some on rays on. The reception has a beautiful smell that hits you as you enter the hotel.  If i'm going to be picky i'd say the dark corridors can be annoying because of the power saving light system they have in place. In the dark the light switches are difficult to locate.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Some Bloke W wrote a review Dec 2016,50,"Hotel, more like my second home !","I have been visiting the Opera Plaza for 4 years now. Not to long a flight from UK and in my line of work good internet so I can get away from the drizzle and grey skies of the UK and work.  The location of the hotel is great easy to walk into the town centre if you fancy a bit of Moroccan shopping without the excitement of the souk and Medina.  Right opposite the railway station perfect if you fancy a day in Casablanca only a 3 hour train journey but the luxury of a 50 metre walk to your hotel after that return at night no need for a taxi is a real luxury. Or even if you just want to pop over the road for a KFC !!!  Saying that the food at the Opera is great. Lamb chops and a bottle of Medallion in the pool restaurant is such a favourite of mine ( Id give it 6 out 5) that it is a must on every visit.  But the real reason I keep returning are the staff from the friendly ""Bonjour"" from everyone going about their day to day work from housekeeping reception to management. Everyone at Opera says hello and with a smile. Not the least Higham the man mountain who greets you at the door. If you have any doubts about a trip to Marrakech they will be quickly whisked away from a Higham greeting.  I haven't ever been in the Spa though my daughter assures me it is wonderful not so wonderful that a one off visit was enough. Apparently there is a lot more than just one afternoon of peace and quiet covers !!  So if I am not in the Spa where do i find myself well the bar of course. Run by the great Kamal a truly great host. Friendly when you want a chat efficient when you want a drink and always with that relaxed look of confidence when you just need to unwind on the first day.  Not surprising he can look relaxed he has a great team. It is quite simply one of  if not my favourite bar in the world.  Mind you I don't ask for much  a bottle or 2 of Heineken a glass or 3 of red wine wine and excellence.

Opera Plaza Hotel,essam A wrote a review Dec 2016,30,is just a good option,The first distinctive feature of the hotel is where it located in front of the main train station and with all the facilities you need are around from stores  restaurant and bars. The hotel is good enough as building very good staff with quick check-in and check out. the room is clean with balcony view on the swimming pool.The bed is comfortable but the curtain is very old and does not keep the room dim at the morning and afternoon (i.e. in case of one day you would like to rest in the day and keep the energy to the night). The breakfast is totally bad even the coffee they serve is awful. The Bowling bar down stairs is very nice place to hang out with friends and enjoy the drink and is open from 12.00 to mid night. Simply is good option if you find room with price limit between 70-80 euro for the standard double bed room and i think it does not worth more than this price.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/essama2013

When we arrived the male Receptionist advised us of some of the sights we should visit during our stay which we found very helpful plus the Tourist Information is within walking distance . We did a lot of walking instead of taking a taxi so that we could see more. All in all we had a lovely holiday.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shepherdswelld
Opera Plaza Hotel,EightMilesHigh wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Decent but many flaws.,The hotel is generally fine and in a decent location. However it lacked any of the magic I kind of expected from a Marrakech hotel.    The room itself was very spacious but the decor of both corridors and the room itself was extremely dated. Stained carpets and a smell of cigarettes in the room upon check-in did not help.    Really terrible WIFI ... despite calling several times to complain. Some evening I had no connection whatsoever.    During the evenings the restaurants by the pool insisted on burning these paraffin lamps which made a terrible smell. This meant that I had to keep the terrace doors closed during the evening even though I was up on the 5th floor.    Most of the staff were generally very kind and helpful. However some of them also did not seem to be willing to make an effort to help out with requests.    Will definitely be looking for something different the next time I visit.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Sliema, Malta",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EightMilesHigh

Opera Plaza Hotel,nmw27 wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Value and good location but many problems,This is a 3 start hotel at best hence the comments about value from other customers. Think of a 30 year old Novotel with stained carpets and brown marked grouting around the bathroom fixture and fittings. Wifi is next to useless when the Hotel is busy. The staff are helpful but there is a look in their eyes which tells you that most problems will not be fixed and they know it. Some money has been put into the ground floor reception/bars and restaurants but it is all to flatter to deceive. The food particularly breakfast is pretty dreadful. Stale bread old pre-cut fruit and packaged process meat. A single desperate overworked chef working on a single burner producing poor omelettes and bizarre pre-cracked fried eggs with a yoke but no white. Avoid rooms facing out at all costs because of the noise and pollution from the traffic. I was here part of a conference delegation but in truth this is the kind of Hotel I do everything to avoid when I have any choice in the matter.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmw27

Opera Plaza Hotel,soheel A wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Good location but has little problems,The Pro's - Good Location located next to the train station.  - MacDonalds & KFC located in the train station.  - Clean area.  - Plenty of taxi's around the hotel.  - 10 - 15 min drive from the Airport.  - 10 min drive to the Market.  - Bella Italia next door to the hotel.  - Bowling bar next door to the hotel.  - The hotel has family friendly feel to it.  - Great pool area.  - Shisha in the hotel pool area.  - Clean rooms & Bathrooms  - Friendly staff  - Private Hammam area. Worth the money.    The Con's  - WiFi is not great. i stayed on the 5th floor and it was quite poor. Although it was better by the pool area.  - Lighting in the Hallway. Recommendation that they should come on automatically instead of pressing a button on the wall to turn on lights in the corridors.  - No Iron in the hotel rooms. The service is not available  - Breakfast food was cold everyday.  - Local restaurants are expensive.  - Room renovation noise on the 5th floor and began work at 9 in the morning until i complained about it We were not informed about the works on the floor.  - There should be more people on the reception desk. Only person serving so many people at one time so waiting times were silly just hanging about in the reception.    The AC stopped working on the third day of my stay. The staff were so helpful that they moved us to another room. We had a balcony.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soheela

It is situated across the road from the main train station with caleches (horse drawn carriages)and taxis nearby so is quite convenient for sightseeing.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Liamo1965 wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Good location and rooms.,This was our second trip to Marrakesh and we previously stayed in a Riad in the Medina so this was a great improvement. This is a modern hotel with good facilities and we found the staff to be very friendly and most spoke good English. Our room was a good size with a very large bathroom and was only let down by a missing shower screen over the bath/shower which resulted in a soaking floor whenever we used the powerful shower.    The hotel has three restaurants (one doubles as a snack bar by the pool during the day) but also provides a nice ambience for evening meals. There is also a traditional Moroccan restaurant and another which provides a buffet style for a fixed price which is also the breakfast room. We only ate at the hotel on our first evening and chose to sit by the pool but chose to eat off the Moroccan menu. The service was good but the food was a bit disappointing as the starters (a sort of chicken pasty) had not been fully heated/cooked through and were basically frozen in the middle.    Breakfast was pretty good and provided the usual continental fair mostly cold meats salad and fruits but a good selection and something to please most people.    The gym is very limited and hardly worth the effort unless you want to pound the treadmill but I would suggest the roads around the hotel are a better option.    The bar was quite nicely decorated but was let down by the large TV screen and the projector constantly screening football highlights. A bit off putting when there was a live act playing.    As far as locations go this was a good choice we walked to the Medina on one occasion and this was around a 20 minute stroll. Taxis cost between 30-50 Dirhams (£3-£5) and for the more adventurous a tuk tuk cost us 50 Dirhams to get back from the Medina to the hotel.    Transfers from the hotel to the airport only take around 10 minutes and cost from around 100 - 150 Dirhams (£10-£15) depending on the size of the taxi. Beware when you arrive you will be approached by taxi touts who will try and steer you towards their taxis. Just ensure you get a price before you accept or get into a vehicle and you should be OK? The same applies whenever you get a taxi we were quoted some exorbitant prices but always managed to get a reasonable price with a bit of haggling. There are loads of taxis around and if you don't get the price you want just move on to another.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Liamo1965

Wifi available throughout the hotel. Large swimming pool which was clean however it was a little cold. Large seating area around the pool with attended service from the snack bar which had a large and varied menu. There are a number of restaurants within the hotel complex which catered to all tastes.  I had the best massage I have ever had at the beautiful spar this was reasonably priced.  The hotel is opposite the Opera house which has art exhibitions. The railway station is over the road and has a Bureaux de Change which has excellent rates of exchange. Taxies or horse drawn carriages are readily available to take you to the Medina or sightseeing.

There is free wifi but it is rather slow and coverage is not 100%. The restaurant food (buffet style) is very nice and tasty. the hotel is opposite the main rail station and very close to the modern shopping area and about 2km from the old part of town with the souks and general chaos.

Opera Plaza Hotel,kittykat014 wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Fab hotel,We stayed in September for 2 nights loved our stay.    The room is large luxurious&very comfortable.    The hotel it's self is large comfortable and well serviced with four restaurants.    There is a nice hammam which is very reasonable.    The area is nice definitely intended for adults relaxing.    I can't remember if there were families were there but I think it would be suited to well behaved kids who don't shout/splash.    There are about 5 restaurants within the hotel.    The staff are knowledge in Arabic English&French and really do look after you.    Entertainment is great when we were there they had a singer every night at the bar.    Breakfast was good for breakfast in Morocco. Probably basic by European standards but you could have what you wanted (eggs toast fruit cereals yogurt)    Location wise the hotel is close to the airport&train station.    There is a cash point 5 mins walk away if you turn right&there are shops&cafes close to the hotel.    It is 10 mins by taxi to the Medina&Jardin Marjorelle.    The Jardin Marjorelle is worth a visit entrance fee was about 70 dhs each (£5)    I would recommend this hotel for whether you intend to do site seeing or just relax as Taxis are cheap&it is in a nice modern area with plenty around.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Mr&MrsN wrote a review Oct 2016,30,Hotel was great just let down by the service on our trip :o(,Six female friends travelling from UK booked via Co-op Travel flew with Easyjet    Arrival to Marrakech    Arrived to a long wait to get through passport checks (approx. 40mins) You are given a form to complete on the plane and again on departure. Once through there are around four currency exchange kiosks. We all changed majority of our money here. Note they do give you notes of 200100 and barely any smaller currency. You can change at the hotel and other places in Marrakech as well which we found out later. The time it took in total from landing to getting outside the airport was just over one hour.    Transfer to hotel was pre booked and ready on our arrival. A minibus took us and dropped us first (one other passenger)    Check in    We arrived at the hotel just before midday. On arrival a man at the door created us and showed us to reception. From there it went a little downhill. The receptionist (female) wasn't very friendly and we encountered several times on our stay with the same attitude. We were each given forms to complete and our passports were copied. We were told our rooms would be ready from 2pm. We were also informed that on departure we would each need to pay a 'departure tax' which was 50diram per person for three nights. On checking our paperwork from the travel agent they hadn't said anything about this so we thought a little odd. Then we were kind of ignored. We had to ask what we could do with our luggage and we were shown a storage room to keep it. For the following two hours we explored the hotel and settled ourselves by the pool for drinks and snacks and had a lovely experience from the staff in the bar and restaurant.    Note - hotel has a sign up and door man to enforce the rules of not bringing food or drink into the hotel from outside places. We watched them take water bottles off guests who had returned from a day trip. They also have a metal detector on one of the doors?!?!?    We found majority of guests were French very little English but that never bothered us at all.    Rooms    We had two triple rooms both facing the opera house and road. The rooms we had provided double glazing so when the doors were shut and air con on you couldn't hear the noise. Once the doors were open you heard the hustle and bustle below.    Beds are a little on the hard side but the room we had was spacious for the three of us. Bathroom clean and excellent shower. Rooms just need a little TLC. Have mini bars with drinks and snacks along with the price list. Only five hangers but didn't bother asking for more.    Cleaning of the rooms was at strange times we ended up getting ready for an evening out and the rooms hadn't been made up. Also we used three bottles of water from the mini bar that were never restocked (more on this later)    There is a safe in the room... use it!    Hotel Amenities    There is one pool which is shared by the red hotel next door. Not massive and not lots of sun beds but there was one excellent pool boy who was a great help in the afternoons we lounged by the pool. he found us beds etc. Pool towels are available for a 200 dirham refundable deposit.    We ate in the Moroccan restaurant on the Friday night. Food was okay most of our party were not keen on what they had ordered lacking in taste. However the day menu around the pool was great club sandwiches Caesar salads etc went down a treat. Alcohol is available at the hotel and prices typical of a hotel at home.    Breakfast was included in our rate and was pleasant if not basic. Orange juice was more like watered down squash freshly cooked omelettes were the best thing available along with lots of pastries and cakes.    Location of the hotel is outside the medina but next to the train station. You can walk to the markets takes around 45mins but we didn't fancy doing this so a grand taxi was approx. 50diram and took all six of us. Finding taxis etc for the large number of us was tricky and when we asked at reception (our unfriendly lady) she said go outside and flag one down. Hmmmm not quite the service I would expect in a 5 star rated hotel?    We didn't book our trips via the hotel but with the rep who met us at the airport via the travel agents. We had no issues with the trips and thoroughly enjoyed them. We arranged with a taxi driver we met to take us to other tourist sites and the souks which he did and again we experienced no issues.    We did eat out and I will post separate reviews for those restaurants.    So your thinking well what went wrong it all sounds lovely. Here goes...    On checking out at 6.20am our room went first went through the bill paid for the three lots of departure tax and three bottles of water we had consumed from the mini bar. On payment we were then asked to come back to the desk (male receptionist) who then point blank accused us of drinking four more bottles of water and that we had to pay now. May I say right now that I had read the reviews of this hotel and was in fact waiting to see if the same situation was to happen to us. After a lengthy discussion with the receptionist I was asked to write a statement to confirm I hadn't drunk any other bottles than the ones I had paid for. I thought this offence and strange so I did so and photographed my statement and a copy with said receptionist as proof. Our frends from the second room come down to reception pay their departure taxes and the four bottles of water they had consumed from the minibar. After paying this we sit down to wait for our pick up transfer when the receptionist calls them over and accuses them of taking products from the mini bar and that they owe money. For 15 minutes we argued with two male members of staff from the hotel two of our party were extremely upset to be accused of doing something they didn't. One of the staff even turned round to them and said if they didn't pay it would be taken from their wages. We explained that money wasn't an issue for us that we had spent thousands of dirham around the pool in the restaurants and bars throughout our stay and if we had consumed drinks from the mini bar we would pay for them. After refusing to pay they eventually asked us to write another statement. I asked to see a manager and was told he didn't start work until 8am. This time I wrote more than a statement expressed our anger and disappointment of the accusations and put my contact email and number. To date (over a week later) I have not had a response. I can only presume no management saw the written statements.    This situation left us all feeling humiliated angry and disappointed which shouldn't have been the case whatsoever. Looking back at the morning actions we noticed that when you go down to check out the reception staff send someone to check the room and to see if anything is 'missing' or damage has been done.. Reading other reports guests have been accused of taking towels and staff have demanded money.    Would I recommend the hotel? No Would I go back? Sadly not. Majority of the staff are smiley friendly and will do anything to help you. Sadly the miserable lady and accusing man on reception ruined our experience. BUT do go to Marrakech and experience the wonders it has to offer... just maybe look to stay elsewhere.    I do wonder if this review will inspire the management team to contact me regarding our stay as I would very much like to hear their feedback.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Swanley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newing22

I am a Canadian caucasian women and was joined by my Moroccan husband. While the room and amenities were great we were treated very badly. The staff was rude to me and my husband. When we departed we were told a small towel was missing from the room. As if we had stolen it. I accepted to pay the 150 dirhams asked simply to be able to leave the place as we had a long drive to Merzouga ahead of us. But when they refused to provide a receipt for the amount paid I lost it. I spent 45 minutes trying to explain that this was simply not acceptable. I had a very unpleasant argument with the front desk employee and his managers and they never accepted to give me a receipt.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this hotel which is unfortunate as it is run by moroccans and I always like to support local owners as opposed to international chains. But I will never set foot in this place again.,Date of stay: November 2015,,"Montreal, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcdess

Opera Plaza Hotel,Riaz C wrote a review Aug 2016,30,NO BURKINA ALLOWED !,Stayed here on the recommendation of friends that came recently which included a Moroccan so thought it was going to be great place. In hindsight unmarried young lads have a different set of requirements.  But credit due where credit is due...  Locality wise great as decent enough walk to the mall 2 mins walk to a quick grab point in the lovely looking train station with McDonald's and KFC.  It's only max 50dhms/5 mins to the Square. And if you use Google maps whilst in the hotel to see where all the main tourist locations are they are all easy enough to get to and cheap enough if you don't need or want a tour guide.  The rooms where big enough clean but not well equipped. No ironing board no iron (I bought one from the supermarket in the mall for about 7£) as they want to charge you for pressing all items and no kettle. I really needed one for my sons milk so for days I had to go down with a flask for going out/night time etc and then on the 3rd day I bought it up I'd been promised one 3 x I was eventually provided one.  Breakfast was ok not a massive choice but in hindsight less to pig out on. Omlettes were lovely but being British I guess I missed a fry up 😆 especially one that would have been halal if so!  The pool was a bone of contention baby pool wasn't covered from direct light so we had to be mindful but the main thing is my wife couldn't wear her Burkina. She can wear one in the UK when she takes my son swimming with no issues but they make it clear you can't BUT ONLY UNTIL YOU ARE THERE!!! NO WHERE BEFORE WAS IT DISPLAYED ONLINE AND WAS A NASTY SHOCK FOR MY WIFE AS WHEN ON HOLIDAY YOU EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO USE A POOL!!!  Staff were kind and friendly.  All around value for me but the pool situation was a killer purely as this should be communicated online first so customers know not to book if any issue.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,St Albans,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/riazc2013

I was very satisfied with the service at the hotel if i remember correctly a lady called Seema (i think) had the most amazing service so friendly informative and genuine.  The hotel it self offers days trips and activities much cheaper than what you would find online so better off booking there.  The spa service was really good as well. Did enjoy the food but towards the last three days of my 1 week holiday it did seem to be a little repetitive.  Location is also good we walked 10 mins on either of the surrounding roads and we would be at any restaurants or shopping centers and etc.  Only issue i kind of had is the sudden upfront charge of £10/20 not a lot but was not informed of this beforehand so seemed a bit sudden.

The rooms were very spacious and some rooms had a pool view which I would recommend. One of the issues that we had was that our key card never seemed to work!    The hotel itself is in a good location with the rail station 2 minutes away and only 15 minutes drive from the airport. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around.    One of the things that I didn't like was that you couldn't bring in any food or drink from outside. Food I understand but they wouldn't even let you in with bottles of water!    The food at the hotel was ok but nothing special. I thought that breakfast was very limited and staying here for 4 days the breakfast was 'samey'.    This hotel is great if you want a clean place to sleep and shower but if you're looking for that 'extra' bit then you maybe disappointed.

Opera Plaza Hotel,pdrain wrote a review Aug 2016,40,Honeymoon,"We booked the opera plaza as our honeymoon destination and we can't fault our stay. All staff were friendly and helpful and had a smile at all times. Breakfast was great but maybe something else could be added if the hotel encounter more British guests in the future. The pool and poolside staff were great. The pools temperature helped cool down when the heat got too much (maybe it was the outside heat that kept the pool as nice as it was). Great location for shops and restaurants and bazaar and short trip to medina. Only little problems we encountered were:  our safe stopped working which was quickly rectified by the reception and maintenance  On a day we left our ""do not disturb"" sign on the outside of our door handle cleaners still cleaned our room  One of our key cards to our room only ever worked to open the door.  Silly little faults that led to us giving 4 stars. We would definitely come back though.

Opera Plaza Hotel,sunny12390 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Perfect Hotel!,The hotel was great. Pool was perfect with perfect temperature (especially at 47 degrees - the cool water was most welcome) breakfast great. Gym was ok - it had a few machines but could have done with an exercise mat and some weights. What stood out for us the most was the most hospitable manager ever Faisal Zahid who couldn't have been more helpful in guiding our way around Morocco Faisal spent time and effort to help and went onto give us his number should we encounter any problems. We ended up staying at the hotel for a few days before we left - again it was perfect. We stayed in a large room with 3 beds (a reasonable rate for the room was offered as we were returning guests). Rooms were clean and air con worked perfectly. Door handle to the bathroom door was a bit loose and once mentioned to reception was fixed within minutes.  The hotel and staff were wonderful. It was worth living out of the medina area away from the humdrum.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Aliya Z wrote a review Jul 2016,20,Room service is a joke,Checking in was easy and swift but it went downhill from there. When I called room service they hung up on me but when my husband called they were kind to him. From then on i had to make my husband call room service every time as they obviously didnt respect a woman on the other end of the line.No iron or kettle in the room so you have to use their room service. That wouldn't be a problem if it was any good.    The next 2 times we called up everything went fine. But the third time we called up on 2 different occasions with no answer. We went down to the front desk to ask for boiled water to drink but they sent us over to the bar who then also rejected our request telling us to call another extension number. We called that number and were told that water would be sent up asap. An hour later and we still haven't received any boiled water.

Opera Plaza Hotel,japtuner87 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Opera Plaza Hotel Marrakech,We were originally booked in the Red Hotel but were upgraded as the Red Hotel was closed during Ramadan. We had a fantastic stay in the Opera Plaza Hotel Marrakech. The hotel is located beside a major train station within walking distance of several shops shopping centres tourist attractions and only a short taxi journey from the medina / old town where a busy market takes place. The hotel has been finished in a modern Moroccan style and is very clean and well maintained. Our room was spacious with a large balcony overlooking the pool area where most nights live musicians would perform. The atmosphere of the hotel is relaxing and friendly and the staff are approachable happy to assist you and speak many languages. During our stay we got to know several of the staff including a local called Bouhali who was professional and friendly. Bouhali took the time to build rapport with the guests which enhanced the friendly and relaxing atmosphere in the hotel. He also offered us local knowledge on places to visit during our stay which enhanced our holiday.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Chas W wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Excellent in many ways (especially staff),"We actually booked a room at the Red Hotel which is apparently part of the same hotel complex but has an entrance on the intersecting street. The entrance to the Red Hotel was undergoing renovations (typical during Ramadan) and our reservation was automatically moved to the Opera Plaza Hotel. The Opera Plaza exceeded our expectations in many ways particularly at the off-season price we got through expedia.uk. The room was spacious and almost luxurious -- I say ""almost"" because (1) the air conditioning wasn't quite as powerful as we would have liked and (2) water ran out from under the shower door onto the bathroom floor. But the room as everywhere else in the hotel was immaculate. We were on the pool side which was very quiet. I suspect even the street-side rooms are quiet too as there are double glass doors onto the balcony. Especially notable were the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. We generally use French or basic Arabic in Morocco but at this hotel everyone including the servers in the breakfast room appears to speak very good English. As an example of the staff's competence I needed to change the SIM card in my phone and went to the reception desk to ask for a paper clip to put in the little hole that lets you access the card. The clerk who incidentally looked as if she could have been a contestant in the Miss Morocco competition saw my phone and asked in perfect English ""Oh do you need to change the SIM card?"" And she opened a drawer to retrieve not a paper clip but the little specialized tool that mobile phone repair shops use. I was pretty impressed. There was good acoustic music around the pool at night but they thoughtfully stopped at 11 p.m. sharp even though Ramadan festivities often go much later. Finally the breakfast was excellent -- many continental-style offerings as well as made-to-order omelettes and Moroccan ""pancakes"" (several varieties) plus fresh orange juice and decent coffee. We've already booked another reservation for our next trip to Marrakech.",Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179chasw
Opera Plaza Hotel,DrLesPsychology wrote a review Jun 2016,30,Decent hotel and lovely staff,We had booked into the Red Hotel (sister hotel next door which is cheaper) but that was being refurbished so we put in the Opera Plaza for the same money. We had been to the Red Hotel before and thought it was value for money but have to say we did miss the city view as watching people go about their everyday lives was fascinating. Breakfast was really good and a wide choice was offered - drinks are expensive at the hotel but that is probably normal. The staff are excellent and we had some great chats with them all. One niggle was that the owner's young son was rude and behaved arrogantly to the staff stood and stared at some guests staying in the hotel and we found this very unprofessional - a business is a business and should be treated as such.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Olney, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrLesPsychology

This is a 4* hotel and it just got downgraded to a 2* cos of certain staff working there asking for tips as part of their service- which is nothing. My friend has stayed in this hotel b4 and she never experienced anything like we did. So I'm very disappointed cos of this. The hotel should really downgrade to a lower *. The room we stayed in is at the side and when we come in at night the lighting is never on so we can never see where the key card is and have to rely on our mobile phone light to see which is awful and frustrating.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Akimoh wrote a review May 2016,30,Decent,"The hotel itself was clean and pleasant and most staff were helpful. Ali at the reception was the least helpful and a bit arrogant. So he definitely made our stay a little rubbish. Breakfast staff were great. Rooms were clean. Prices in the hotel for drinks are expensive as you would expect but there is wee shops round the corner to get drinks and bring them to the hotel etc. One major point to note is never book excursions through the hotel. Worst experience ever. The quad biking we were told would be an advanced course as we have been before but soon as we arrived we were told that we were only to follow the leader and no zig zags or skids or going fast which made the excursion pointless. Moreover however the people at the quad bike don't let you go back to the hotel until you pay them ""damages"" to the quads. There is nothing that you sign or anything to say that you have to pay and seemed extremely shady. We were charged for a broken light which didn't work in the first place and most of the quad bikes didn't even have the same lights attached. The tourists before us were cheated for the same thing but at a higher price. We told the people we would pay the hotel as that's how we booked it and didn't feel comfortable paying them for something we believe we didn't have to pay. They didn't accept this and wouldn't let us leave until we gave them money. Again the same happened to the tourists just before us. When we complained to the hotel this was apparently the first time this had happened which we knew was rubbish and they did nothing to help or accommodate us in this matter. Very big downside and something which will affect our hotel choice the next time we come back. If you only need to the hotel to chill out in and rest then this is it. But if you plan to do excursions and sightseeing i would book somewhere else. Oh and do not book red hotel as that even worse.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Miz99 wrote a review May 2016,10,Appalling Customer Service,I'll start with the positives as there aren't many:  a. Fairly close to the aiport  b. Adjacent to train/bus stations McDonald's and KFC    The negatives:  a. When we first arrived we had to take our bags ourselves to our room  b. The room itself was OK some the fixtures/fittings are not of a high spec so it's not exactly 4/5 star  c. The balcony was dirty  d. The air conditioning is ridiculous in the winter months you can only increase the heat and in the summer months only increase how cool the room is. If you want to decrease the heat in winter for example you cannot do this.  e. Bed was solid as a rock with the pillows far too big  f. You cannot bring food into the hotel I tried to bring food in from McDonalds and wasn't allowed - a ploy by the hotel to get you to eat in their overpriced restaurant or take items from the room minibar (A bottle of water was 25DH but 2 minute walk from the hotel is a shop that sells the exact same brand for 5DH)  g. Staff are rude when I questioned why I cannot bring in food I was repeatdly told is is hotel policy. OK I understand it's policy but WHY do you have that policy?  h. Asked for an Iron told there is no iron but they have a laundry service. Another ploy from hotel to get you to use their overpriced services.  i. On my booking I stated we needed a crib for our baby this wasn't given. Also phoned reception to ask for this but still didn't arrive  j. Swimming pool has a dress code. Women cannot wear a veiled type of outfit. It is quite common and being in a muslim country I thought this would be fine but no. No other hotel in both muslim and non-muslim countries that I have stayed in have prevented women from entering the pool is they do not show off their skin. These outfits are specially designed for women who do not want to show anything. Absolutely ridiculous!  k. WiFi is poor really poor.  l. At breakfast we asked for a high chair for our son and were told you take a seat and they would bring it over. Never arrived despite asking several times and each time told its coming. No apology for not fulfilling such a basic request    Probably more that I am missing off but as you can tell I will never stay at the Opera Plaza again and would never recommend it to anyone either.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miz99

I stayed on the first floor and it took me while to figure out which direction my room is as the directions are not indicated when you come out from the elevator or the stairs. It is not a big deal but it may be more convenient to have the direction added in particular the first time when you have lagguage. It was also interesting that i could not phone locally from the room. However the staff at the front desk were very kind to call a local number for me a couple of time.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Stef B wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Good Hotel,The hotel is in a great location just next to the train station and therefore close to the bus stations too (which I needed to use and that was one of the reasons why I chose this area). I've stayed at the hotel next door once (and many others in Marrakech) and I have to say that this was - by far - the best. I was surprised to find a fully stocked minibar in the room (in a Muslim country quite odd at least for my experience!) although very expensive. (Yes very expensive!). I am not giving 5 stars but 4 because although I enjoyed the hotel and my stay overall there were just a few minor things which made me take the one star off --- the staff were all good yes good but not great. The receptionist was fine but when I arrived (around midday I think) he did not really explain much or say much just that the room was not ready which I understood. I walked around for a bit came back around 1 30 and didn't dare to ask but at the same time another receptionist was checking in a couple and managed to sell them tours explain the whole city in three minutes and give more information than I suspect they actually wanted (as they could not understand each other - she was speaking English and they were speaking Spanish LOL) all of this happened whilst I was sitting and my room still did not seem to be ready then I approached the guy again (as the lady was still busy with the others maybe over half an hour later) and I was told it was ready. Fine thanks! I was a bit annoyed at being treated differently (I wouldn't have bought any tour or needed any information but nobody asked me either). However when I got to the room I was very pleased - so maybe the gentleman was having a bad moment earlier but then he gave me a lovely room so thanks then forgiven. I tried to call to thank (and to ask something) but nobody answered at many attempts .. so yes nice hotel great room OK service I think the staff in the restaurants were much more accommodating though just some work to be done in dealing with the guests - we are all worth some time!,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/586stefb

Opera Plaza Hotel,NewxGate wrote a review Mar 2016,40,View of the Opera,There are many good hotels in Marrakech but there were none of the hotel chains I normally would stay at. Looking through Trivago I found this hotel the reviews were quite good and the price was good.    I stayed two nights in a large corner room with two double beds that were quite comfortable the room was clean there was a balcony and a view on one side to the Theatre Royal (Opera) and a view toward the railway station on the other. The hotel is on a very busy intersection with traffic very heavy during the day. The room was sound proofed with double sliding doors onto the balcony. This cut down on the traffic noise but it seems impossible for drivers to go any distance without pressing the car horn.    The hotel has a nice pool and there are restaurants in the hotel and in the local area. If you are not very adventurous food wise there is also a KFC and a McDonalds in the station. The station has a few shops and you can get trains to Casablanca and beyond all the way to Tangiers. The departure board lists an airport train. This is the airport in Casablanca and not the local Marrakech airport.    My rate included buffet breakfast there was quite a lot to choose from but I was hesitant to try most of it for fear of an upset stomach so stayed with things like bread and cheese. Others have complained about the Wi-Fi yes it can be slow but I found it to be slowest during the evening which I guess is when most of the demand is for access. During that day it seemed a lot faster so if you need to do more than just check emails do it first thing. The hotel has a Very tall large man as the doorman. He tries to be very helpful but only speaks about three words of English but will try and help the best he can. Unless you are prepared to walk the only real way to get around is by Taxi. I’m told they're metered and maybe if you’re a local they might turn them on but as a tourist they will charge you as much as they can get away with so agree a price before you get in.    On the whole I would stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewxGate
Opera Plaza Hotel,Rajul_Alam wrote a review Mar 2016,40,It's like a five star hotel,When I visited to Marrakech on the first day I booked a hotel in Le Savoy Hotel (5 stars hotel). Outstanding service but overpriced facilities and room is not good as Opera Plaza where I stayed for three nights. The room's rate is half as Le Savoy's and room itself is much better. Bed is nice and comfy outstanding staff best location to stay in term of restaurants train station carre Eden shopping mall (20 minutes walk) and Koutoubia Mosque (40 minutes) walk. You might as well take a taxi to visit the mosque and Jemaa el-fnaa Square for 40 dirhams. Two things that I did not like about the Opera Plaza are: there aren't many choices to eat during the breakfast and the swimming pool is too cold! I was very brave to take a dip. Marrakech is the amazing place to visit and it's certainly won't be last time to visit Marrakech. Opera Plaza is the best place to stay for all types of travellers: solo couple elders and family. I will stay with Opera Plaza again when I travel with guest(s) to Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rajul_Alam

Opera Plaza Hotel,VBizDublin wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Nice Winter break,We stayed here with family for a short break in November. We frequently visit Morocco and decided to try this hotel this time. We weren't disappointed. The hotel is beautiful and staff in general were really nice and helpful with the exception of 1 lady in the restaurant for breakfast who was very aloof and seemed appalled that we had 2 small children in our group.    The rooms were beautiful and big enough for everyone's needs. The weather was lovely and the children insisted on using the pool the water was very cold but they persevered.    The only thing that is a slight negative is that the bar is themed but it means that the entertainment is the same thing every night. It was great the first night but by night 4 we were a little bored of it.    We would probably stay again for a short break but would probably be more inclined to stay at a more family friendly hotel next time.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VBizDublin

We thought of experiencing a hotel as well not just riads.    Very bad idea! After a long day on the road when we arrived at the hotel the bell boy/vallet didn't want to put up the barrier because our car was only a Hyundai too cheap for the hotel. Like really?! He asked us three times if we are absolutely sure we have a booking there. I found it deeply rude and unrespectful.    When we made a comment about it with the front desk the receptionist also rude started laughing and said ""Morocco is different!"". Not an apology no empathy nothing.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Mohammed A wrote a review Feb 2016,30,You get what you pay for!!,I opted for a pool view room which was really nice however very noisy at night as music played till early hours of the morning which wound me up after the 3rd night!!!    The room was nice and spacious. Bath was pretty standard (however did have a broken shower knob - but worked fine)    The hotel itself was very well looked after always smelling fresh. Staff cleaning every time you step out the room. Did not really go into the pool as it was quite cold but enjoyed soaking up the lovely sun temperatures during the day ranged from 19-26 degrees (surprised for that time of the year) however much cooler in the evening.    No FREE Water in the rooms - Shops were not far away and much cheaper than the hotel. Never had an issue with bringing it back however felt uncomfortable sneaking it in. On the first day noticed there was 1 bottle of water less in the mini fridge when we came to checking out it was on our bill (I was prepared to pay for it because I did not want the hassle of arguing) however my wife made the receptionist aware and he happily took that off the bill.    Opted for Bed and Breakfast - Disappointed by the breakfast as not much variety and exactly the same. could have been better.    Tried the SPA they had an offer on and paid like £40 each for a Hammam and Massage. Was fantastic!!!!! First time very very relaxing. We did it as a couple together could have been better if the girls spoke a bit of English to communicate what is happening how long it will last etc but overall very relaxing. Deffo reccomend to try this!    Never had any issue with the staff seemed very nice and pleasant always smiling. The doorman was okay too however I did ask for a taxi to the square and he flagged 1 down but did not get a fair price so left it went around the corner and found 1 ourself which was much cheaper!!

Staff are lovely super friendly and the service provided is really good. The hotel itself is very modern and very clean! You'll be impressed with the ventures within the hotel also the pool is lovely especially at night. Breakfast provided is very good! Much better than some hotels I have visted before. Suggestion I would make is to provide irons! Did not feel it was right to charge for ironing clothes I feel like this is one of the basics that should be available at a hotel of this level atleast. Another service I hope hotel improves on is the tours and excursions they offer very limited they could consider having a city tour on hand for those who are a first timer to Marrakech - but bear in mind they contact a local tour guide company to actually do this.

Opera Plaza Hotel,RuebenC wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Wonderful place,I stayed here for 4 nights with my cousin. It was the first trip to Morocco for both of us. We arrived and quickly checked in to our room. We did ask for a room with 2 singles but got a double bed and were told that they would be a given a room with 2 singles once there was one available but one never came up! Our balcony was tiny but the room itself was nice. The bathroom was gorgeous with a nice a shower and separate alcove for the toilet. There was free wifi in the hotel but it was so slow that I didn't bother to use it during the day. If you are an early riser like myself it tends to work quite well in the early hours. The pool was gorgeous nice and clean. Not cold at all as people have commented previously. The gym was basic - 2 treadmills 2 cross trainers 1 bike and one multifunctional weight machine. My only complaint was that the pool and gym did not open till 9am and both closed at 7pm. There were days where we had been out and wanted to take a nice dip by the pool in the evening but were unable to do so. It would make sense to have them both opened till 9pm.    The hotel is a good location for walking to the new town where the shopping centre is. It was roughly a 15 minute walk. We also walked to the old town (be sure to talk water if doing so as it took just under an hour) and got the bus back which was good.    The hotel does offer excursions but they are cheaper if you book with tour guides in town. We did this for a day trip to the waterfalls and it turned out to be an amazing day for a great price. We booked a half day camel ride with a local hotel and paid in advance only for no-one to show up! The Opera Plaza receptionist then booked us onto the same excursion for that afternoon which was nice. I asked the restaurant to make a birthday cake for cousin's birthday which they did for the equivalent of less than £10. We were half board and breakfast was the best part of the day. Fresh fruit pastries cereal cold meats cheeses etc. There is also a crepe station where a lady makes fresh traditional Moroccan crepes whilst you wait. Dinner was buffet style. It didn't tend to vary and was light on the meat. There was vegetable tagine but I never saw lamb tagine. The pool side bar was good for lunch and not expensive at all. There is also a Bella Italia restaurant in the hotel. The bowling alley was great fun the bar tender had a laugh with us. Just don't order the mojito - pure cucumber and mint! I had a great time and will definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: July 2015,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuebenC
Opera Plaza Hotel,Antonio_best wrote a review Jan 2016,20,"Not happy with ""related services""",We had a pleasant stay and we were going to leave a very good review. Two things changed my mind:  i) Day-tour at Ourika booked at reception: the place is worth the visit but if you wish to learn something or to know anything about what you see look somewhere else. There was no guiding at all nor explanation. The driver barely spoke (and when he had to only French very limited English).  ii) After check-out we asked to have a taxi to drive us to the Medina at a riad we had booked previously. They left us with a driver that finally showed to be not professional at all: he left us in the opposite side of the Medina (asking full fare for the ride even if the destination was not reached) with a bag-carrier that was appointed to walk us to our final destination (it took 25 minutes walking and we had to pay the bag-carrier of course).

Opera Plaza Hotel,George R wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Excellent 4-star hotel near the Opera-Theatre and Station,Hotel deserved its 4 stars. Located near to the railway station (but with no implications about the area that might apply in cities in Europe in fact La Gare is worth a visit in its own right!) Large rooms many if not all with balcony. Large bathroom free room safe mini-bar including Flag and other beer no tea/coffee making facilities high standard of housekeeping (except for some curious reason the hairdryer which was nasty).    Several restaurants associated with the hotel plus many in the locality. Hotel has its own good bar with wines and spirits and v. attentive service which will expect to be tipped. Central courtyard with swimming pool poolside service beautiful at dusk with twinkling lights. N.B. Book a room facing in to the pool not towards the outside and the Opera as the roads are amazingly busy and everyone seems to drive on their horn.    Although the address says Guéliz it’s a bit further out from what I’d consider to be Guéliz although only 5-10 minutes’ walk and you can walk through Parc Harti which is pleasant. However for visiting many of the sights you will be needing to take a taxi which is a bit of an effort re pricing. N.B. Hotel literature claims the taxis are metered but they aren’t. If you don’t like negotiating get the doorman to do it for you but don’t get in until you have the rate agreed (somewhere between 20 and 40dhs for a local trip during day). Sadly the bus touristique (a hop-on hop-off service) was not operating in Dec 2015 due I was told to “business problems”. I’d count out the local buses as they are always packed with locals although cheap at 4dhs a trip.    Breakfast is a buffet similar to what you might expect in a 4 star French hotel. Omelettes and pancakes cooked to order good breads patisserie cheeses fruit etc. Moroccan and Western beverages. Principal language is French although most staff can speak English also.    Hotel feels safe with high security. You are not expected to bring provisions purchased outside to your room this is considered improper.    If you want to avoid a taxi negotiation when you arrive at the airport you can take the bus – there’s only one! For a 30dhs ticket it takes you to central Marrakech round the Medina then out to the station (La Gare) where you can alight. If there’s several of you together a taxi probably will cost 100dhs but you might like driving a hard bargain! Always bargain with a smile.    I give the hotel overall 4 stars on TripAdvisor dropping one star simply because of location which for me could have been a little nearer to the Medina.

Located in the ""new town"" it is in the perfect location for a relaxing holiday but still close to the hustle of the old town.    We picked this hotel as we are travelling with our 15month old son and didn't want to stay in a riad right in the centre of Marrakech. This hotel is walking distance of a nice mall (Menara Mall) where you can get any essentials you might need if travelling with kids. Also about ten mins walk is a nice shopping area with all high street shops and many restaurants and cafes. The hotel is right next to the train station with direct trains to the airport. A taxi to the old town shouldn't cost more than 20dh.    The hotel itself is fantastic. Lovely staff who are very helpful. The only reason I haven't scored it 5/5 is due to the fact that there are no irons in the rooms (had to buy a travel one from the mall or pay the hotels prices for ironing!) and there's no kettle again purchased a travel one on our first day here. The breakfast buffet was nice varied selection. We had dinner in the hotel once but found it quite over priced and actually there are nicer places just a short walk from the hotel. It can get noisy at night even with the pool facing rooms as there is a disco most nights but it didn't cause us too much bother as our son isn't a light sleeper.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Richard H wrote a review Nov 2015,10,Terrible Stay,I am a 'Hotel Inspector' therefore I spend my time in a lot of hotels and my remit is very much public protection and quality of stay.    My review is based on my mini break experience (4 nights) and not on an official capacity.    Generally staff listen but do nothing to accommodate or rectify concerns or failures.    Hotel is averagely priced for the location and service provided.    Breakfast had limited choice for the price paid for it the concept of food temperature control wasn't great and the idea of personal hygiene very poor as I watched a member of staff sneeze over the bread and pastries! Even hot water seemed a difficult task to manage as the relied on naked flame to heat the urn which on many occasions they would forget to provide.    On my last night I suffered Food Poisoning which based on probability was caused by their poor practices.    High risk open food was being handled with little concept or understanding of basic sanitation (hand washing). This is of particular concern where older people and children are consuming potentially contaminated food.    The sliding cupboard door within the room did not open and close therefore every time you wanted to place clothes it was a real struggle despite raising at reception. The in room safe broken even when I raised this they said they would address and I was 'fobbed off' and told that I wasn't putting in the right number of digits despite following the instructions on the front. Secondly the safe wasn't secure and anyone could break into the room lift the safe and walk out with the contents intact!    The air conditioning didn't work apparently (and this was the excuse I was given) the air con is centrally controlled and it had undergone routine maintenance and was only blowing out warm air. Great if you are boiling at night!    You wouldn't book a hotel in a north African Country without air con!    On the Saturday and Monday night the Hotel decided to have a Cabaret where I was subjected to singing up until 04:00!! Totally unacceptable bearing in mind I was on the second floor it must of affected a good number of rooms.    Wifi was hit and miss more miss!    Again hotel management took a non-sympathetic approach to this and more or less laughed it off.    So in summary would never stay here again or recommend this hotel.

The bed was comfortable - i slept really well for the three nights there.  We had a balcony with a street view and at first I did prefer a pool view but this view was definitely much better - the theatre was directly opposite us and we can see the Atlas mountain and the sun rise!  Very clean - 5/5  Breakfast - dining area is really big; large selection of food (even an omelette bar outside) really tasty. Orange juice was a bit too sweet for me but the peach juice was nice there was also the mint tea so definitely have a taste of that.  The pool area is quiet and relaxing but it was a bit cold during our visit so didn't stay there as long as I hoped.  The bar lounge had a live jazz performance which was really cool.  You can book excursions here too and the staff who helped us was really nice - top tip definitely negotiate on the price (they are lovely and will give you a discount if asked) - we went on the atlas mountain excursion and was surprised about how many people paid for the full asking price.  As briefly mentioned above the staff are lovely and always have a smile on their faces and a greeting in hand. When we booked a minicab or taxi they would always ask us or the driver where we are going - nothing intrusive but I felt like they were doing this for our safety which I find very attentive.    The not so good aspects (and this is really nitpicking) were that my friends and I arrived early so our luggage was in the luggage room whilst they prepared our rooms and they didn't bring our luggage up - we had to go downstairs to fetch it ourselves (it's really ok it's just that we haven't experienced this before so just wanted to point this out) I would have liked to have a kettle and tissue (for make up and food etc) in the room. These are very minor points and wouldn't have affected the scoring however the only reason why it didn't get a 5/5 was the wifi issue. I have read the reviews here about the wifi prior booking so its a common issue and it was a problem for us as we wanted to contact home and do last minute research - we ended up going to the red hotel next door to use their wifi. This definitely needs to be sorted out.    Overall a very pleasant stay and one of the best hotels I have been in.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubyandamethyst

Opera Plaza Hotel,Seaside599390 wrote a review Nov 2015,30,My morocco experience!!!!!,I stayed at this hotel October 2015 with my family. There were 7 of us in total and we booked 3 rooms; a triple room and two double rooms. The day we arrived at the hotel it was almost midnight so everyone was very tired and hungry we were not helped with luggage or shown to our rooms as other reviews have stated the halls and corridors are pitch black so we all struggled to get to our rooms fumbling for a switch or something. In the end we gave up and decided to go back down and ask for someone to show us to our rooms. The reception staff did take us to our rooms and even gave us some dirham's for getting something to eat as everything was closed and we couldn't get our money converted. We managed to get something from the train station across the road which had a McDonald's open.  The rooms were very nice with big beds nice views no noise even though we were at the front side of hotel which had a very busy road the curtains were blackout ones so i could get up anytime and it would seem like it was still night time!!!!  The hotel was lovely with a calm atmosphere the smell in the hotel was really nice i think they used incense all over the hotel which smelled divine. And breakfast was nice they had alot of choice there was something for everyone. And the breakfast staff was very nice and friendly catering to everyone with ease very organised.  We did not book any excursions or have any meals or drinks from the hotel except breakfast which was included with price of room.  This hotel is in a very good location to local restaurants and train station buses there are lots of bars clubs bowling shopping centre something for everyone our kids loved everything we ate out at different places all were lovely. The hotel allows no food or drink from outside but we bought in some water as this was very stupid rule and kids needed constant water it was hot and there prices were way to much high to pay for all of us.  For the excursions we found two lovely guys round the corner outside to the right of hotel called Omar and Said who I can't praise them enough they made our holiday very special as we felt they treated us as family and advised us were to go and helped with shopping etc and there prices were very good value much cheaper about third of everyone else there. Here is there number if anyone wants to book them you wont be disappointed!!!! 00212639217354  The only reason i gave this hotel a 3 is because of what happened on our last day we were supposed to leave hotel at 11.10 am so before breakfast i went to enquire about checkout as i was worried about timing and as to how i was going to pay them city tax which apparently is payable by everyone staying in Marrakech. She said i could pay any way i wanted so i asked her what my bill was going to be to which she replied 924 dirham's so i asked if i could pay now as it would save time as i had a lot of other things to do as well i was told we had to all come out of rooms with our luggage and give room cards and then they would have to check all rooms and mini bars we didn't use the mini bar because we could find cheaper drinks outside for fraction of the price.  Anyway once we were all down they phoned someone to go around the rooms to do there checks which took 15 minutes the receptionist then told me the mini bars were all fine and not used but there was a problem as a hand towel was missing out of my husband and my room and i had to check my luggage!!! I told her that i had packed everything and i knew there was no towel in the suitcases then she got on phone another time and talked some more which we didn't know was what as she was speaking Arabic so we waited another 5 minutes by then our transport had arrived outside. After she got off the phone she called another male worker and said we need to check your luggage by that point i got very red faced as the reception was full of guests other staff and it was ridiculous as to why we would take a old hand towel in the first place but i still said OK they could check because i knew there was no towel in the bags because i had packed them myself. I had to unlock and open 4 suitcases and bags with personal belongings which was embarrassing and surprise surprise no towel in any of them. I was very upset as to the way they had handled the situation and treated us like some thief's and a dirty hand towel of all things!!! She did apologise and we left but i suppose in the end they were the ones with the shame as they did not find it in our luggage and only embarrassed themselves by acting in such a manner as to check peoples personal belongings.  Overall we had no complaints and were very happy but they had to spoil it at the last minute.  Please be careful if you book this place don't be fooled by the modern look of this hotel as some of management is clueless in good star hotel service.  And please use the taxi service mentioned they are nice friendly and affordable!!!,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside599390
Opera Plaza Hotel,Ian M wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Some parts good and some not so good,Very convenient location close to the railway station first impressions were very good. Lifts worked well and coped with the volume of traffic well. Room very pleasant but unfortunately no kettle black mark from me. Bath was difficult to get into as it was very deep and no grab rails in place. The outside pool area was lovely and although the water was a little chilly once in it was nice to find a large enough pool to actually swim in. Pool side cafe was really good fresh food and a nice outlook. However the Rossini restaurant left a lot to be desired. It was at times very crowded and noisy and on one occasion we were asked to hurry up and leave as they 'needed the table for other guests' Not what I would expect from a hotel of this type. The food was also a little disappointing very little choice.Always beautifully presented salad starter (More show than substance) or soup. Sometimes only two main protein main courseschicken tagine or fish tagine.Sorry on one occasion it was lamb or fish.The deserts were in fairness very good. Breakfast was fine coffee was very good and so were the fresh crepes,Date of stay: October 2015,,"Louth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/849IanM
Opera Plaza Hotel,Tazz wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Perfect stay,There's very little I would change about our four night stay here. Our room was huge - with two balconies - and any questions or issues we had were quickly responded.    Staff always ensured we had a taxi to hop straight into costing no more than 50 dirhams to the Old Town (cost of a 4+ people taxi). Most nights we were chaperoned to the restaurant doors too which was a lovely touch and made us feel very safe.    Breakfast was incredible and so was the service - everyone was exceptionally friendly and would do all they could to help you noticing what you'd need sometimes before even you did!,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tazzg2015
Opera Plaza Hotel,PeterBri wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Standard corporate hotel,We stayed here for two nights at the end of our holiday to Morrocco and found it to be very comfortable. The rooms were a very good size ith good furnishings nice bathrooms an although we had a room overlooking the busy main road we had little noise due to it being double insulated. Breakfasts and the service was good and it is conveniently located near both the train and main bus stations fortravelling to other parts of the country. There is a no. 5 bus from outside the entrance which takes you to the Katoubia mosque and Jemma El Fna square and the souks so a very convenient hotel for a short stay.  The only disappointment was the Hamam my wife booked as it wasn't as good as others she has had in Marrakech but this is only a small criticism. It is a good hotel that I would recommend,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Felton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterBri
Opera Plaza Hotel,cantwait4xmas wrote a review Oct 2015,40,comfortable and plesant stay,Stayed at this hotel for 5 days at the end of September with my partner.  Paid 100 dirham for taxi from the airport (started off at 250 so haggle). Arrived at 11am and was allocated a room straight away which was great as we thought we would have to wait until 3pm. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The AC worked well bed was comfortable but pillows very thick. Even after sleeping on just one I always woke with a sore neck. Plenty of wardrobe space (no iron available though) good safe little table area and chair (some welcome biscuits provided). Mini bar was a rip-off! Go to the local shop 5 mins away straight down the road or walk to Acima supermarket 10 mins away (turn left out of hotel). Bathroom has separate toilet in the back. Good powerful shower over the bathtub. Towels replaced every day. Heated towel rail which was good for drying stuff. TV had a couple English speaking channels and 2 good movie channels in the evening. We had a street view room on the 4th floor so had a great view directly opposite the theatre - It was great to watch the going-on's on the balcony.  Breakfast was good and I really enjoyed having fresh egg station and Moroccan pancake station which is unusual outside of all inclusive hotels. Breakfast was supposed to end at 10am but often saw people still arriving then and still able to get breakfast.  The pool was large and has plenty of loungers. They are very close to each other though so it was rather annoying to be happily sunbathing only to have someone move next to you and request a shade/umbrella thing to be put up covering the people next to them. Pool towel are available with 200 dirham per towel deposit.  Had lunch at the pool bar one day which was good and not too bad priced for the area. Drinks on the other hand were expensive at the pool. Can of coke - 30 dirham (11 dirham for a litre bottle at local shop). 500ml bottle of water - 20 dirham (4 dirham for a 1.5 litre at local shop). Ate a late dinner one evening in the Italian (after deciding the Moroccan restaurant had too little choice). It was an ok meal. We had better meals throughout the trip outside of the hotel. There is nothing going on in the evening. There is a bar and lounge but these were very quiet.  As a base you can’t go wrong with this hotel. Its 10 mins max in taxi to square and close to the shops restaurants etc. of Guilez and Hivernage. For taxis just go outside the hotel on the main street and flag one down. Barter on price and you shouldn’t ever pay more than 20-30 in the day. At night to club 555 theatro etc. it was more like 50-70. By the way clubs are expensive in Marrakech more or less same price as London.  Staff were friendly smiling and always said hello. Apart from that they left you alone. I would return as this is a nice hotel good location and great pool.  The Wi-Fi seriously needs addressing it was slow and barely worked.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Kayla S wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Beautiful place beautiful location with just a few negatives,Me and a friend stayed here for 5 nights in October.    Location - Perfect a short ride from the airport (do not pay more than 100 dirhams for this journey) and 10 mins to Medina square (which we would haggle down to 20 dirhams). We found cheap local restaurants round to the right of the hotel where two of us could eat and drink for a fraction of the price charged by the hotel.    Cleanliness - i can not fault how clean the rooms and areas of the hotel are    Room - On arrival we were there had been a complication with the room and would have to spend our first night in their partner hotel Red which is located in the next block. We were compensated with a free dinner buffet this mix up. Food was good however that was the only time we had dinner onsite due to the prices. Originally booking a street view were we given a twin room with a pool view which was amazing peaceful and quiet. The beds were comfy and showers were warm.    Day trips are offered and organized by the hotel such as camel rides Atlas mountain quad biking dessert trips ect where you are picked up and dropped directly back to the hotel.    NEGATIVES - and why i can only give four stars.    Wifi - it hardly works as many other reviews say this is correct and when it does it's extremely slow. Red hotel wifi however was excellent on the one night we stayed there.    You are banged from brining food purchased from outside the hotel in. A standard bottle of water is 25 Dirhams (almost £2). Go around the corner and its 3 dirhams (20p). On check out i was accused of taking a bottle of water from the mini bar in the room and charged. I tried to explain i had not and would not pay these silly prices for water here. However they had found an empty bottle which i had in my bag purchased elsewhere which was the same water they sell and was made to pay 25 dirhams. I was very annoyed by this!!    I do like to have a dip in the pool but unfortunately was far to cold for me however other keen swimmers did enjoy it.    Apart from these issues I would stay here again it is a great hotel in a great location. My best advice in Marrakech is haggle haggle haggle Especially in Medina they will charge you the tourist price haggle that down. Ouzoud waterfall is a must if you are physically fit to climb its beautiful. And check out club 555 and Theatro if you like to party ;),Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/851kaylas

The desert trip was amazing well worth ithowever it takes 12hours travel each way to get there. The receptionist told us it would take 5 hours by car...on our return we confronted her about the length of thejourney and she dismissed it with no apology.The sand buggies were a complete let down once we arrived at the buggy company they told us no buggies were available and our options were two quads or a camel ride we had already done a camel trip in the desertand quads weren't too appealing as we use them on a daily basis at home...given that we had travelled 45mins and our only other option was to wait around for an hour and a half we took the quads reluctantly it was good...but not what we had paid for. A simple phone to our hotel that morning to tell us would have allowed us to cancel. The bar and restaurant staff could not be any more fantastic.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Caroline_andy1 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Class hotel,This hotel is joined with another hotel called the red hotel and is situated opposite the train station in the new city.    The hotel is smart and very clean    From arriving in reception and throughout our stay we were treated to smiling faces and great service even down to the guy on the front door.    The hotel has several restaurants a Moroccan themed restaurant an international restaurant serving European dishes especially French it has a restaurant at the pool side selling snacks hamburgers and pizzas. It also has an Italian restaurant and a bowling alley.    All the fixtures and fittings furniture and designs are first rate and impeccably clean. Giving the hotel a very authentic feeling.    In the area there are some really nice street side restaurants which though they do not sell alcohol the food is good quality and very reasonable.    When coming out of the entrance and you turn left across the road to the lovely modern train station there are a couple of restaurants in the station also a McDonalds and kfc.    Along the street there are a few restaurants and even an Irish pub.    If you turn right out of the entrance you can walk along the road to the new shopping mall and Carrefour (approx. 10 mins)where again there are a range of restaurants both at the mall and at the side of the road.    You can get to the old town by taxi for about £2.00 just stand outside the hotel and the taxis will stop and ask you where you want to go.    Finally there is a tourist open top bus that passes the station about every half an hour. We went on this and it does a great tour around the new city and the old town with commentary. Cost us about £10.00 each really good.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Suhaibnajmi wrote a review Oct 2015,40,"Good location, good price, nice rooms, nice breakfast!",My friend booked the 2 of us into the Opera Plaza for 6 nights. We got the flights and hotel for under £300. I was expecting a cheap and cheerful it was cheap but was a lot nicer than expected - although did have some flaws.    Firstly the location was good your a £2 taxi ride from the main square with the markets. Literally across the road is the train station which is an amazing building in itself and has a KFC McDonald's and a newsagents for cigarettes snacks etc.    Hotel facilities - the hotel has WiFi which is quite poor connection isn't good and it was down for a full day whilst we were there. WiFi in bars and restaurants is a lot better. This bothered as when your out and about taking photos you want to be able to relax in your room and upload your photos and videos for your friends and family to see.    The hotel also has a gym if you can call it that! There are literally a couple of treadmills and cross trainers and one cable weights machine which was out of order during out stay however there is a brilliant gym about a 10min walk away (costs about £15 for a day pass!)    Apart from the WiFi and gym the rest of the hotel was brilliant. Very clean and modern the staff are pleasant and always greet you with a smile. The pool is brilliant and has its own bar with multiple sun loungers. The hotel also has a cigar lounge with live music every nights perfect for a relaxed evening.    The rooms and clean beds are comfortable with good en suites of good size and of course air conditioning.    The breakfast starts at 7am and finishes at 10am. We always managed to get breakfast which is good value for money. You have an omelette station multiple juices and breads along with olives meats cheeses croissants salad cereals and yoghurt. The also have a coffee machines which brews up lattes cappuccino espresso and other variations.    Overall the stay was good nothing major to complain about however please note on many holiday booking websites the hotel shows photos of a bowling alley this is not part of the hotel but is next door.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Hexy wrote a review Sep 2015,30,"So-so, neither special nor terrible","We have mixed feelings about this hotel because it certainly has a lot of amenities such as clean attractive rooms with balconies overlooking the magnificent pool and a generous buffet breakfast with a decent variety of choices including an omelette station. But: The free WiFi is a total catastrophy it never worked properly and on the rare occasions I could sign on it would take forever to do the simplest tasks. We did not like the bathroom at all due to the odd high wall at the entrance of the tub/shower. I am 5.3"" so it was impossible to step over it. Rather I had to sit down on the cold tiles and swivel around to climb in and out. Somehow not a fun way to take a shower. My husband did step over slipped and nearly fell. It also missed a hand-held shower attachment which I consider an absolute must for ladies with freshly styled hair. Only the bare minimum of towels was provided. The bed was uncomfortable (too hard). The overall service was inconsistent. For every friendly courteous employee there was an arrogant unhelpful one. Overall we felt that despite the hoopla of several doormen swim-up bar in-house restaurants pool-side breakfasts and scented lobby this hotel lacked charm and personality.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Greco1979 wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Bank holiday weekend,We spent three nights in Marrakech in the Opera Plaza hotel. It was a good value for money offer and we were generally satisfied. The position of the hotel is the the new area of the city and you will have to take a taxi when visiting the centre. On our first day we decided to walk to Medina but it took us 40min each way. It was not bad as the weather was pretty pleasant but we wouldn't do it every day.    The hotel lobby greets new guests with its modern design and beautiful spicy fragrance. The check in was quick although our room was not ready until 2pm. We were not offered to stay by the pool so we walked to the centre. We have been given wifi password which worked nearly everywhere in the hotel. Hotel pool towels are available for the deposit of 200 dirham.    The room was facing to the street which we preferred to the pool view. We found it more interesting to observe the busy street life and the view of the Opera house than looking at the pool after a whole day laying next to it. The room was perfectly sound proof but the traffic noise on the balcony could be a bit disturbing. There were also massive roadworks going on in front of the hotel so the view was a bit spoiled. The room was massive with two separate double beds plus one single bed. The use of safe was free of charge. Bathroom toiletries were rather scarce the towels were changed daily but some of them were worn out and should have been replaced. There was also some unpleasant smell coming out from the bathroom drains when doors were left open. One of the disappointments was the mini bar fridge which didn't work at all. We couldn't chill our water and had to buy cold drinks in the shop behind the corner which interfered with the hotel policy not to bring any food or drink from outside. We found it very limiting since the drinks in the hotel were very overpriced. There was Carrefour supermarket 20 minute walk from the hotel.    We went half board and we were very satisfied. Breakfast was the usual selection with something for everyone. We really enjoyed our last evening dinner when only traditional Marrocan food was served. Drinks had to be purchased separately and there was a service charge of 33 dirham for every purchase regardless of price. We only discovered this when we paid the final bill at the check out.    The pool and the gym opened at 9. There were enough sun beds music playing all the day. We would say that the clientele at the hotel was young French Dutch and English crowd and some German and English OAP.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Farnborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greco1979

A mixture of modernity and tradition the hotel is in a great location (approx 30 dirham taxi from the Jemaa El Fna square and Souks) and has great amenities for guests.    Pros:  -Great breakfast selection of hot and cold foods and omelettes cooked whilst you wait  -Fun pool area with swim up pool bar good menu and nice sun loungers. This is especially as there is no beach to go to.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Shama A wrote a review Aug 2015,40,Combining Modernity and Tradition,This is a lovely hotel. Friendly and spotlessly clean gleaming like a clinic. The lobby area is spacious and presents a modern uncluttered look. There is tasteful use of traditional design in lights and lamps. Most rooms seem to have balconies and ours faced the swimming pool. The bathroom was modern and functioned well. The wifi worked in the bedroom and lobby. We stayed for seven days and the breakfast was too predictable and unchanging. We had a bad start as the hotel had double booked and shunted us ( and some others) off on arrival at 7 pm or so to another hotel half a mile away and definitely not in the same class. We were promised this would be sorted next day and it was but the experience was unsettling and troubling as it happened immediately on arrival. Next morning we returned and were checked into opera plaza. The rest of the stay was most pleasant. staff made up for the bad beginning with their friendliness and responsiveness esp the reception. We used taxis and buses to reach the city centre but some folks walked to the medina about half an hour away.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Solihull, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252shamaa
Opera Plaza Hotel,jaenine2015 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,"A very good hotel, well situated when you want to see Marrakesh and surroundings!",I booked this hotel after advise since I'm partially handicapped. I went there as mother and daughter for 9 days and I can't imagine anything wrong to say about the hotel. We arrived at evening and Arib Tours came with an minibus to fetch us which costed only 15€from the airport. They forgot to add with the booking that my daughter preferred a room on the poolside. So the first night we had a room opposite the Opera with a beautiful vieuw on the Boulevard Mohammed VI and roundabout. Very broad nicely planted with palmtrees and flowers. What was so busy outside with traffic but nice to watchonce the double doors were closed you couldn't hear any sound. Next day when we came down for breakfast they asked us to keep the luggage a bit together and they installed us in a room with poolvieuw. We booked only breakfast so that we could go where we wanted. The breakfast was very good with more than enough choice inside or outside near the pool from 7/10h30! So time enough. For 50dh you could order anything in the room. There are 3 good restaurants Morrocoan Pizzeria and African/Asian buffet.  The afternoon you could drink for free mintthee in the lobby in Morrocoan style. Every evening there was life music in the bar where you coul eat all kind of snacks also near and in the pool! If there were not enough beds near the pool they brought immidiatly matrasses you can use a big towel against 250 dh deposit on the reception. They places parasols like you wanted. Indeed you can't swim in the muslimbathingsuit as also not in monokini! I thought of swimming in a sort of onepiece but but a special bathskirt over my batsuit to cover all my operation marks.  Everywere the place was spotless! Every day new bedsheets windows and terrace cleaned etc! Also the toilets lobby...there is a small shop with all kinds of emergency things but since the hotel in in Gueliz there are opposite in the stunning railwaystation fior example more shops a booth for magazines and papers just outside. On the poolside you had no idea being in the city. I was nicely helped with my rollator and oxygenequipment every time and always with a smile. The food in the Morrocoan restaurant was very nice even so in the Pizzeria on the first floor and corner where every evening there was also life music. The climate is perfect everywhere since it was 40° and more when we were there. It is close to Menara shopping centre and the Paris Hairdresser Desange was next door they gave my daughter a nice treatmentwashing and haircut for only 44€! Since we came on mixed cultural/pool it was a perfect place to pick up a caleche to visit the medina. He waited and went wherever I asked and I paid only 35dh for almost 5hours of use! As I wrote it is not far from the airport (never heard any plane in the hotelgarden) but also easy to take the roads to Asni ImlilOurika Essaouira. By train opposite a broad boulevard can take the train to Agadir Casablancaetc.  The hotel is in modern Arabian style. The price was more then worth! We had a pleasant time since every dream to visit Marrakesh could come out and we could feel day in day out the warmth and concern from the staff! Thanks for everything! For others have an equally nice stay!,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Veurne, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaenine2015
Opera Plaza Hotel,bubbus1 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Great Hotel Amazing staff,This was a great hotel and lived up to the previous tripadvisor reviews. The hotel was very clean an the staff always very friendly and willing to help. We went half board therefore was able to try the evening meal which was good and usually consisted of a one vegi one meat and a selection of desserts all very well presented. The location was also great once you got used to it it was one road straight down to the new mall that has opened up and takes around 10-15min walk and around 25 mins if you have children with you. It usually cost us around 50 Dirrhams on the first day to get a taxi to the souk which was around 30 minutes walk however we did manage to haggle it down to 30 on the following days. Personally we enjoyed the walk down to the souk and stopped off at the various cafes for ice cream and mint teas along the way.  Right across the road there is a train station where you can find a MacDonald's and a KFC as well as a couple of cafes for cakes/crepes/coffee. We had a road view and thought the noise would keep us up in fact the room was pretty well insulated and we slept very well indeed. The room itself was spotless with a very large bed and a balcony. It had a large flat screen TV with various channel but it did have a few american movies channel that you could understand also the wifi was actually pretty good i usually got around 2-4 Mbs on my Iphone 6.  The only Negative point I would have to say about this hotel is that absolutely nothing is free you don't get any complimentary water which we got in other hotels around Marrakech particularly when the temperature was averaging almost 45 degrees!!!!!. We also noted that with your evening meal there was also no drinks included and iam not talking about alcohol.....simply water was not offered. So if management does get to read this I would love to come back to your hotel but that would be a point to consider with guest who have paid alot to stay at your hotel.  Cost if drinks in the hotel is quite steep water being around 35 dirrhams (£2.50) considering if you walked out of the hotel and bought it from the stall outside which was around 10 meters away it would cost you 3.5 dirrhams(£0.25) !!!!!...... just a thought.  Finally other guest coming to this hotel should be aware that management does not allow drinks and food into the hotel from outside and may even check your bags. We also noted on 2 occasions that women particularly muslim women who wear the burkini to the pool were told they could not enter the pool only standard bikinis were allowed something about hygiene issue???? needless to say they wern't very happy as it is not something that is clearly advertised.  Overall very good hotel and would definitely stay there again.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bubbus1

We enjoyed the wide array of selections at the breakfast buffet. The swimming pool and surrounding patio are beautiful and relaxing - - though the water was too cold for us to swim. In some respects except for the concierge in native clothing and the delicious mint tea guests are served upon arrival this hotel could have been just about anywhere else in the world. Nothing wrong with that.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Emily wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Lovely stay,I stayed here for ten days with a friend and had an enjoyable time. The rooms are clean spacious and we enjoyed the view of the Theatre Royal. There is a busy road outside but this adds to the atmosphere and never disturbed our sleep. The pool area is beautiful (the water was a bit chilly) and never over crowded. Breakfast was okay but perhaps a bit more selection in the way of hot food and cereals/yoghurts would have improved it. The restaurants and pool bars are good quality but pricey compared to prices outside of the hotel. The evening entertainment set the tone for a relaxed drink by the pool. Avoid booking excursions from the hotel as they are more expensive than if you haggle in the Medina. Never pay more than 20 dihram for a taxi into the Medina/Al Fna Square although taxi drivers on the street and those organised by the hotel will try and charge anything up to 80 dhiram. I would recommend a long weekend in Marrakesh rather than ten days.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Bethan C wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Ten days in Marrakesh,Stayed here for ten days during Ramadan so it was fairly quiet. Pool is lovely hotel rooms spacious and very clean. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was so-so. The fresh fruit and pastries were good as was selection of hot drinks but it would benefit from improved cooked food and choice of cereal. Service was brilliant though. Gym was not very private or air conditioned. It's also very small but it did the job (most people don't go on holiday to spend a lot of time in the gym!). The hotel also had a really lovely smell to it in the lobby! Wifi was generally very good although I struggled to get connection in my room. We bumped into two cockroaches in our room but that is inevitable in this country and had nothing to do with the hotel's standards. There was one occasion where the water came out of our tap brown but again that sort of thing can't be helped and was easily remedied. The food is expensive by Moroccan standards but a good quality meal nonetheless and good compared to British prices. Alcohol was much the same with half a bottle of wine costing a minimum of what equates to £7-8. The staff were lovely but not good at recommending anything if there's nothing in it for them!!! We asked for recommendations for somewhere to go on my birthday evening but all they could recommend was their own overpriced excursion. This is quite typical though. Incidentally I would not recommend booking excursions through the hotel as you can find them much cheaper for the same thing by walking through and around the Medina. You also have the opportunity to haggle by doing it this way. Similarly don't let the hotel book your taxis for you! They ask you every time you leave whether you want a taxi and if you say yes they give you somebody that they clearly have connections with who will charge around 80 dirhams just to go to the Medina! This will seem reasonable to you as it is around £5-6 in GBP but it is a rip off by Moroccan standards!! Instead start walking along the road and before long numerous taxis will pull up beside you offering you a lift. They try to start anywhere between 30 to 40 dirhams to go to the Medina/Jemaa El Fnaa Square. You can haggle this right down!! We paid just ten dirhams for the one way trip during the day but it is reasonable to pay 15 or perhaps 20 but don't go above this!! Some taxi drivers won't accept ten but many do. Coming back in the evening expect to pay more because prices rise at night time but do not be fobbed off! Back to the hotel we never paid more than 20 dirhams even at night. The hotel is next to a very reasonably priced bowling alley which is good fun and has a lounge in the Red Hotel just around the corner which is nice and gets full during the evening. The water is expensive at the hotel costing I think 20dirhams for a small bottle. At surrounding shops and stalls the same thing is around 6 dirhams. I felt safe at this hotel which is within easy access of the main tourist areas and is certainly very good value for money. There is a tax to be paid at the end of your stay equating to about £1 per night so remember to factor this in. It is the same in most places and the hotel warns you of this upon arrival. There is also a very poorly advertised bus stop directly outside the hotel where you can jump on the double decker sightseeing bus which gives you headphones and a very dubious but enjoyable tour of the main highlights! The spa is also quite expensive. Try and go to a local hammam which gives you a longer massage etc. for a lot less money. The quality probably won't be as good though because the atmosphere etc of the hotel spa is lovely. They didn't speak good English and didn't offer us drinks or anything but we just had a 30 minute foot massage.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/470bethanc

The location is away from the main square timed it at a 35 minute walk Gueliz is straight down the road and is 15 minutes walk.Taxis are cheap and very easy to find however.  The rooms were very big. The twin we stayed in was two double beds desk 32"" tv with English movies and a desk with loads of floor space as well. We were luck enough to have a corner room so we had not one but two big balconies. The bathroom again was very nicely appointed and spacious with marble throughout. Facilities included bath with shower (excellent pressure and temperature) sink with large mirror toilet and a bidet.  The rest of the hotel is really nice and clean as well. The pool is lovely big enough to swim some lengths in and deep enough to jump in and mess around in. Nice swim up bar as well and it's cleaned thoroughly every night by the staff and I also witnessed them checking the chlorine levels too. Plenty of loungers with great amounts of sun in the day but in the early evening it gets into shade so it gets lovely and cool and is lovely to sit out in the evening and have a drink.  Only downside was the food in the hotel made my friend sick. We thought we'd play it safe and eat in the hotel to avoid being unwell backfired. My friend got sick shortly after eating dinner in the hotel and I found the jam on the breakfast buffet was mouldy on two consecutive days despite me giving it to the staff. It was in date by over a year which unfortunately means it was the storage conditions makes you worry about other things like the meat......

Opera Plaza Hotel,Simone M wrote a review Jun 2015,30,"comfortable stay, no thrills, staff unfriendly.",Good points:  This hotel is a good choice if you do not want to be in the heart of the Medina but is still close enough. Cabs to the medina cost about 30-50 dirums and the cab drive is about 10-15 mins (always haggle)    -Rooms are spacious and clean and include a mini bar and hairdryer.    -Hotel grounds are well maintained and the pool area is clean.    -You can change money at the hotel reception desk.    -WiFi was good.    -The food served at the restaurant close to the pool was very tasty and reasonably priced.    Bad points:    -The breakfast is very limited and repetitive. Nothing exciting at all. Limited hot food mainly pastries and fruit.    -The pool is freeeeezzziinggg cold.    -The safe in our room did not work and I had to call the reception desk 3 times before anyone came to fix it.    -The receptionist on the front desk would not change my money as it had the tiniest speck of oil on it. She said that the bank would not accept it because it was dirty. Instead we were told to go to a nearby Cambio which was a short walk away but still rather inconvenient.    -Throughout our stay none of the reception staff would smile at us or greet us when we walked through the lobby which i found very unwelcoming.    -When we were checking out of our hotel we were incorrectly charged for 2 red bulls from our mini bar. When I told the receptionist that we did not take 2 red bulls we were quizzed about it. Which was just annoying as we had not questioned any other item on our tab and they should of just taken our word for it. This in a way ended our trip on a bit of a sour note.    -I found my beds to be very hard which made my sleep very uncomfortable throughout my stay .    -Despite using the shower screen in the bathroom whilst showering water still covered the floor and trailed underneath the bathroom door. This meant that we had to put towels down whilst we were showering to absorb the water.

The room was modern extremely clean (cleaned daily) spacious and airy. We had a balcony facing the opera and would highly recommend staying at this side of the hotel as we had views to the busy street below and across to the opera house. Although we had read reviews saying that this side of the hotel would be noisy we heard no noise whatsoever. We stayed on the fourth floor and had amazing views of the whole city.    The hotel is about 20mins walking to the medina or 20dirham (€2) in a taxi. All the taxi drivers and door men from the hotel WILL try and and charge you upwards of 50dirham so you need to haggle and be prepared to walk away from a bad deal.    Also be aware that a taxi to/from the airport from the hotel should cost you between 55 and 70 dirham.    The hotel offers a free breakfast the variety is huge and the quality is great. No complaints here.    Although we had read reviews saying that we were not allowed to bring outside food to our hotel room we never had a problem as we snuck it in in bags or under scarves.    The receptionists were extremely friendly advising us on where to go what to see teaching us the customs of Ramadan and even printing out our boarding passes for us.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Hanagh wrote a review Jun 2015,50,The most amazing holiday and hotel,I cannot recommend this hotel enough I stayed four nights and it was one of the best hotels ever! My partner and I felt so lucky to have found this hotel among so many others! It was so cheap and I cannot even believe how much we paid for how great it was! The photos don't even do it justice during the day and night the whole hotel was beautiful there honestly isn't one fault! There was some building work going on by the pool area but it didn't bother us at all and when we weren't out exploring we were only at the pool a short time! On the first night we got mint shisha and sat at the pool bar again amazing staff and amazing atmosphere with the live singers! On the second night we decided to eat in the pool and it wasn't far our favourite restaurant!! We were greeted every time we entered the lobby and doors were opened for us waiters brought drinks to our loungers and even people had their dinner delivered to their loungers! If you are considering this hotel it was honestly the best get away ever and I was in Orlando two months ago which says a lot...    We booked an excursion through the reception to go quad biking through the palmerie which was the greatest part of our trip! We went for around two hours and was picked up from the hotel and dropped back off! We also stopped at a village in the middle of the desert where there were only around 5 huts where we were given mint tea! It was one of the best experiences ever!    The location is amazing we paid 40 dirhams to the medina which is so cheap just make sure you arrange the price before getting in the taxis outside the hotel! The train station is right next door which made it easy to get taxis back because we just had to say train station and they knew where to go! The train station had a McDonald's where we had a few lunches and it was just as good as UK! down the street about 10/15 mins walk is a supermarket like Walmart which was cool to look round!    The bowling alley was also great fun we went every night and paid 45 dirhams each which is a great price! We had the alley to ourselves every night and was great fun! It's made by AMF which is the legit bowling company so everything was pristine condition!    Carre Eden shopping centre isn't far away with shops such as Zara H&M monsoon etc It's cool to see but make sure to go to the medina and experience the real culture of the old town!,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanagh
Opera Plaza Hotel,staank wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Alls well that ends well,"We stayed at the Opera Plaza Hotel from 16th - 19th June.    We hesitated slightly based on the location of the hotel and after reading a few negative reviews we didnt really know what to expect. Had we made a mistake? Not at all!!!    Had a pleasant experience on arrival although found it weird that we started being checked in by one member of staff and then whilst signing the forms someone else came on and took over the check in process- bizarre.    Hotel has a lovely scent when you walk in and the staff seem very receptive to a good welcome :)    We were allocated Room 423 on the fourth floor. The hallways are a bit weird when you get to each floor its all about power saving so the hallways have these random switches you have to press for the lights to come on in the hallway. This made my wife a bit anxious and she wouldnt go to the room on her own if i was by the pool. The hallways can get very dark and a bit intimidating.    The room itself was beautiful really big with a balcony facing the pool although they did know that we were on our anniversary so I think they made an extra effort to make sure we had a pool view.    Reception staff and really friendly but the rest of the staff seem a bit lost in their own worlds hardly any smiles or acknowledgements as they pass you in the hallway.    If you want great customer service Faical is the man!!! We absolutely loved him he is so helpful extremely interested in his guests and we made a point of this before we left! Faical we really appreciated your assistance with how to buy a tagine in the Medina although you still owe us a recipe for a vegetarian Tagine!!!!    Breakfast is generally ok could be a few more varieties and as most guests have said it gets repetitive every day eating the same thing. We were only there for 4 days so cant imagine how people staying for 7 days felt. They have these lovely local Moroccan flatbreads that they serve each morning to be eaten with honey- YUM!!!    Evening entertainment was always good with live singer and we really enjoyed watching him. Entertainment is spot on!    Access to Carrefour is within walking distance and taxis to the Medina are regular. DO NOT pay more than 30 Dirhams (MAX!!!!!!). HAGGLE HAGGLE HAGGLE!!!! Do not ask the hotel doorman to get you a taxi I will explain why in the negatives below.    A few negative points  The pool is VERY cold even in 35 degree heat the pool was absolutely freezing and I almost passed out the first time I went in can't understand why the temperature is kept like this as we could barely even walk on the floor around the pool without shoes on because of how hot it was!!! Please Please PLEASEEEEEE do something about the pool temperature its there to be used as part of the money we have paid!!!! Atleast let it be useable!!!!    The ban on bringing your own food (including water!!!). This is pretty nonsense its not fair that we even had restrictions on taking up water to our rooms. We were only allowed 2 bottles a day if we bought these bottles externally (we did from carrefour and got chased by security when we came back to the hotel). Our 6 water bottles were stored in the Baggagerie room and we were given 2 bottles a day at request. Haven't heard any other hotels doing this water is a basic human need. All food is also banned to rooms unless you buy from the hotel or the minibar in the room (ridiculously overpriced). Beware- as you will be hounded by hotel security.    No tea or coffee making facilities in the room what a let down! Even 3* hotels give you this privelege.    The Air Conditioning in the rooms really are very light and hardly make your room ""air-conditioned"". Even on the lowest setting we were melting in our rooms.    Don't allow the hotel doorman to get you a taxi its all about his commision. We were stupid enough to allow him to after Faical told us clearly to go out and flag down a cab ourselves. The doorman ended up getting some tour guide as a taxi driver who wanted to charge us 70 dirhams for one trip to the Medina (single fare). We got him down to 30 Dirhams in his van and all he did was badmouth Faical and try to sell his tours to us. No joke we were quite scared as the driver was very intimidating and forced us to buy a tour package and we were scared he might have threatened us or taken us elsewhere. Just keep your wits about yourself. He stood outside our hotel every day waiting for us trying to keep selling us things and following us. Well that was as far as he got!!! But a very imtimidating experience.",Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/staank

Opera Plaza Hotel,MARELLE W wrote a review Jun 2015,30,"Enjoyable stay, good location - just a few bad points",We had a lovely 7 night stay at this hotel. We chose it for the location as we didn't want to stay directly within the Medina but still wanted to be within walking distance and the location was perfect for us about a 30 minute walk from the Jemaa el fna. The hotel was very modern clean and had a peaceful atmosphere. The pool area was great and our room also had everything we needed. We booked two excursions with the hotel - trips to the Atlas mountains and the Ouzoud waterfalls. Both were excellent and well worth doing particularly the Ouzoud waterfalls - though this was a 6 hour round trip in one day which is something to be aware of.    A few bad points - the wifi service in our room was dismal though worked fine at the pool area. The key card for our room stopped working on three occasions and we had to take it to reception to get fixed - this was quite frustrating. You are not allowed to bring any food or drink from outside the hotel in not even water. This was frustrating as we were getting through several large bottles of water every day due to the heat but the minibar prices were ridiculous as were the prices at the pool and restaurant. We bought water and snacks from a small kiosk just outside the hotel front door and from a small shop in the train station across the road both were much cheaper. We did eat lunch and dinner at the poolside and restaurant a few times and while the food was good it was expensive for what it was.    All in all though it was a great trip just a few points let the hotel down a little.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marellew2015

Opera Plaza Hotel,MisJudge wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Great spot,I really enjoyed this hotel. It is about 15 minutes from the airport. We paid 100 dirham to get there in a taxi from the airport. There was a baggage room which we utilised as we were trekking in the Atlas Mtns for a few days. We were really looking for somewhere to chill out after our trek & this hotel was ideal!! When we came back I had a dead sea body scrub followed by an argon oil massage This lasted 2 hours and cost me about €44 and it was absolutely top class in a really lovely spa. The staff were excellent in the Spa.    Fab breakfast every morning to set you up. We went to the gym & it's basic but does the job if you want to get a run in on the treadmill. The pool is 3 meters at it's deepest and is a perfect size. There are bar stools under the water & you can sit in the water and have a drink at the bar. There was a DJ there playing relaxing chill out music from 12 noon. The whole set up was lovely. Lots of loungers and plenty of umbrellas for those of us blessed with casper like features. The food menu is a bit basic & I stuck to the club sandwich alot but the pizza looked nice too.    The hotel is 6km from the medina and took about 40 mins to walk to it but it's a nice walk. We got a taxi back each night & this cost 50 Dirham.    a few negatives: There are lots of staff on hand but I had annoying experience with a card of mine that was refused and I wasn't listened to when I asked about the wireless connection if maybe that was the problem. I stuck to my guns because I knew there was money in the account & eventually they brought me to a dial up machine & it went through alright. I was a bit annoyed at having to waste my time traipsing around from machine to machine without being listened to but these things happen. It was the dismissiveness that annoyed me most.    On the three nights we ordered a bottle of red only to be recommended a different more expensive one. We politely declined and were told we should really take the bottle they were pushing. They were nearly put out by us not taking the more expensive one. On the last night we asked for the same (cheaper) bottle again (it was nice!) and the waiter brought out the more expensive bottle and was about to open it when I asked if it was the one we had asked for and he said no it was the more expensive one so I had to send him back to get the one we had ordered....strange carry on!!! Watch that you get what you order on the wine front!!    The concierge I presume that is what he is...he had a white outfit & a red hat on was not very useful. I stood beside him at one stage to ask a question and he continued to talk to one of the other staff as if I wasn't there. I felt like a child waiting for a grown up to talk to me. I eventually turned on my heel because he was just ignoring me. On the day we were leaving he asked us if we wanted a taxi to the airport & we said ok even though there seemed to be loads on the roads so we weren't that bothered if he got us one. Before we got into the cab we asked the concierge how much & he said 250 dirham! That's 2.5 times what we paid the first day! So we just got out and said we'd get our own for 100. The taxi driver conceded then and said he'd take us for 100 but I thought it was terrible to think we couldn't trust the man representing the hotel. Obviously the taxi was a mate but I really didn't appreciate the attempt to rip me off. Not very professional at all. He would want to improve especially as he is front of house staff.    Three very minor issues in what was a fantastic stay! Would highly recommend this hotel.

Opera Plaza Hotel,LaRa_travelaholic wrote a review Jun 2015,30,Average service and rooms,Location: As we had an early train to catch for our flight back home we chose this hotel. Its just across the street from the train station..It is away from all the action and would need a Taxi / bus services to make it anywhere  Rooms: Rooms are average with some of the bathroom fixtures (like tubs) really dated. The AC was not working and after repeated phone calls a technician came in at midnight to clean the filter. AC was still average only after that  Service: was the big downside. We had booked for a city view and they gave us a pool view room which was stinking. When we tried to get a new one they tried to say that the room was not ready(even though we checked in way past the check in time) However they changed it later on. Requesting for a adapter took at least 4 phone calls for any kind of response.  Food:The spread for breakfast was very poor and needs some additions  Other services: Wifi connection was dismal with no connectivity most of the times    All in all if you have an early train stay here! otherwise my guess is there are better options elsewhere,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,India,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaRa_travelaholic

Opera Plaza Hotel,Kathy H wrote a review May 2015,40,A pleasant stay,My husband and I stayed in this hotel for three nights as part of a group tour of Morocco. The situation of the hotel is good very near the attractive railway station in the `New Town` part of the city. The hotel is constructed on six floors round a central pool and eating area. The rooms are attractive and well furnished. Our room faced the road and the Opera House and was not at all noisy with the windows closed. The breakfast were acceptable but unexciting and the evening meal was also acceptable but unexciting with a choice of turkey and fish each evening. A taxi would whisk you into the Medina very easily and quickly - make sure you agree a price with the driver before you get in. You shouldn`t pay more than 40 Dirhams a trip.    Marrakech is a great city to visit. The souks are quite small here and very easy to negotiate on your own. Guides just take you where they want you to go and they receive commission so don`t bother with them. The Majorelle Gardens redesigned by Yves St Laurant are lovely and well worth a visit. The main square Djemaa El Fna is wonderful but at its best later in the day. Very atmospheric.

Yes whilst in Marrakech I should be eating going with the tradition but a little english foods would actually spruce up the breakfast/dinner menu. Coffee didn't taste nice it was from a nescafe machine which looked dated.    In terms of the grounds and people very enjoyable we had a corner view room which overlooked the train station mountains opera house and the street towards the centre of town as far as I am aware it was the biggest room.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Pierre G wrote a review May 2015,40,Centrally located hotel,Very good hotel located close to the train station and the airport which was the main point of choosing it as I had to work at the airport.  The hotel is nice and the rooms are spacious enough. Had a pool view so it was globally quiet but street-facing rooms might be noisy.  The only drawbacks are that the pool opens too late and closes too early for business travellers to enjoy it (9.00-18:00) and that the hotel doorman did not enforce the taxi to put the meter on leaving me to pay twice the price than what was on the meter.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Ian_Tomes wrote a review May 2015,50,A smart hotel,Stayed here for three nights in mid May during a week touring holiday with UK Riviera Travel. We were a group of 38 people. Overall a very a nice hotel with well appointed rooms and a very nice well kept pool area. Our only problem was that our room safe would not work but it was quickly repaired. As it was a busy holiday visit we were actually only in the hotel for short periods (not including sleeping) so did not really explore its facilities. The main problem for some of our group was that the air conditioning in some of the rooms was not working and apparently could not be repaired due to a lack of repair parts.. Perhaps a problem in a 'third world' country such as this is where the infrastructure when it comes to technical matters can be very limited. Luckily our room was OK but as the outside temperature rose to around 40 degrees for those who did not have it was not a very pleasant experience. The food at supper and breakfast was rather limited in scope. What there was was good but compared with similar Mediterranean/Canary Island type hotels we were rather surprised at the lack of choice. The choice though at the Pool Bar for lunch was very good. There is a money exchange bureau only a couple of hundred yards away (the best exchange rate we had during the whole holiday) and a useful shop (for water) in the new railway station just as close.. Overall though a good hotel and useful for a base in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wedmore, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ian_Tomes
Opera Plaza Hotel,Shalinee89 wrote a review May 2015,40,"Great location, Good value for money.",Recently stayed at the Opera Plaza in April for five days on a short trip to Marrakech. We managed to grab a great flight and hotel deal on Expedia and had already booked our room online. However when we arrived there were massive problems with our room and it wasn't until 4 pm that we were finally given a room. However we had been upgraded to a Pool view room; needless to say the views were stunning! We also had huge problems with the air conditioning as we were informed we had arrived during the winter season and they simply could not switch on the air conditioning for us even though the temperature had reached past 30 degrees! Rooms were clean and well stocked and bathroom was also very clean however we had a huge problem with a leaky tub! Breakfast was included in our package in the form of a buffet and we were given a huge variety of options to choose from. Great pool but always very busy so you need to get there early to guarantee a lounging spot. Food in the bar and restaurant was average would not recommend eating there as it was also very pricey.

Also there are many good resturants near by.    You can get to the Madina Square with a small taxi it should be 30 dirhams but because we are a family of five we had to use a grand taxi which we had to pay 40 dirhams after negotiating with the driver. At night time the taxi drivers tried to raise their prices to 60 dirhams.    The hotel rooms are well maintained and clean.The hotel staff do communicate in good English which is very helpful. We stayed on the 5th floor but we did not have interconnecting rooms which was a slight issue as our children had a room which was down the corridor. But the pool view is better than the city view.    The negative side of the hotel was that they had inadequate breakfast choices. After two days it got boring having the same food over and over again. I also noticed the hotel Red is connected to Hotel Opera. The only difference is the breakfast room and the reception. Otherwise the hotel is fine and ok.

We were located on the 5 floor and hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms are a good size and very clean. My only complaint is that the wifi is very poor. Only really worked in the lobby and even then kept on cutting in and out. There was no point using the wifi in the bedroom (very frustrating).    Said and Abdul were located outside the hotel and were able to offer us good rates on tours even though hotel staff advised us not to use them. It cost 3 of us 600dh (altogether) to go to Atlas mountains including a guide up the mountain from a berber man. 200dh for a tour of gardens and palaces. 30dh to souks market. Not sure if this is the best rate but we were pretty happy with them.    Overall I would go back again!,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253DonnaR253
Opera Plaza Hotel,Ken R wrote a review Apr 2015,40,A good choice of hotel.,A well situated hotel within yards of the train station with a direct service to the airport. it is a 30 minute walk to the old Midina. The hotel rooms are very clean and are of a good size well decorated with large beds. The staff being very pleasent and helpful. The evening meal was well cooked but rather restricted in choice. On the other hand the deserts where beautiful the best part of the meal by far.The breakfast was really adequate.  the drink prices where extortionate I and I would recommended that you look elsewhere if you enjoy a drink. We did see some guests have drinks bought from an outside source taken off them at the entrance to the hotel.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217KenR
Opera Plaza Hotel,pnhmrk wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A Very Good Stay,We were on a Cosmos tour of Morocco. I’ll list the hotels we stayed at as this differed from those given by Cosmos at the time of booking: Marrakech – Opera Plaza Hotel; Casablanca – Ibis City Center; Fez – Zalagh Parc Palace; Erfoud – Kasbah Tizimi; Ouarzazate – Ibis Moussafir; finally returning to the Opera Plaza hotel in Marrakech.    This hotel was the best hotel on the tour (as I've said above we stayed there twice) set very high standards and gave impeccable service. We arrived late on our first evening (about 2030) so we decided to eat at the hotel’s Moroccan restaurant. This was the best meal that we had on the entire trip.    The hotel is a fair way from the centre. It would take about half an hour to walk; however a Petit Taxi (flag one down on the street – don’t get the porter to call one) is only about £4.00 so getting to and from points of interest isn’t difficult.    Both rooms were large with big bathrooms. There was plenty of forceful hot water so showers weren't a problem. The one comment I would like to make about the bathrooms is that the floor got very slippery when wet however there were bathmats provided so this wasn't a problem.    Breakfast was very good with a great range of foods. On our last night in Marrakech our included meal was in the hotel’s buffet restaurant. This was more than adequate with an excellent selection of puddings but we felt that the main courses were rather limited.    I found the corridors and some of the areas around the ground floor to be very sparsely decorated. This showed that the walls were just painted concrete. However I think that this would have made the hotel seem much cooler in very hot weather.    The only word of warning I would say is about the swimming pool. This is large and has areas for children leisure swimming and fitness swimming. It forms part of the centre of the hotel. However it did not appear to be heated. I managed to swim one length of the deep section and had to get out because the water was so cold. In summer when the temperature’s in the mid 30C and above heating isn't needed however in March the pool is too cold to swim!    If I return to Marrakech in future then I will give serious consideration to staying here again.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnhmrk

Opera Plaza Hotel,FandRD wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Smart modern hotel but a few maintenance issues!,As others have written this is a smart modern comfortable hotel in a hollow rectangle formation; the outer rooms having views of perhaps the Opera House new railway station or distant Atlas Mountains but very noisy roads and the inner overlooking the pool and outside dining areas and which are much quieter. We were there in later February when the days were relatively short and when the sun was off the inner square the temperature dropped considerably and everyone disappeared inside!    We had 3 rooms having to move twice and could have moved again but gave up then. The first room smelled of smoke though we had specified non-smoking and had a large section of the thicker (though not thermal blackout) curtain hanging down. We were first told we couldn't move till the following day but when my husband went down in person he saw someone else at Reception and we were immediately offered another room and on the 5th - non-smoking - floor. This was ok until we noticed next morning that there was a large crack in the bath and which oozed black water when we stood on it! Once again we were moved to another 5th floor room and there we stayed though again some of the thicker curtain was hanging off the rail. We were amused to see that each bed had a printed notice stating that some senior housekeeper had personally supervised the preparation of the room....so we felt that they had somewhat fallen down on this give all our difficulties. We must have been unlucky as no one else has mentioned problems in their rooms.    Each room that we had had a slightly different layout and sizing but all were spacious attractive and modern with fairly neutral decor. The large double bed was hard and thus suited us. The large flatscreen TV had BBC and CNN in English amongst its channels. There was a small minibar fridge. You weren't supposed to take any food or drink into the hotel and which seems to be an increasing trend in hotels.    There was free wifi with different routers for different parts of the hotel and a free mini safe. We had a large balcony with table and 2 chairs.    Th bathroom was attractive but the bath had a high walled-in side so tricky for shorter or less able guests.    It can be a long walk to your room as the hotel is a big rectangle and there is only one set of lifts.    Staff were very helpful and responsive.    We had booked B and B but we were told that our travel agency had booked us in for half board and as we had paid for it we used it though we couldn't thus try local restaurants as intended. It was a pleasant surprise to find that the buffet style meals served hot rather than lukewarm food and all relevant dishes had warmers under them. The restaurant is long and thin with the kitchens at the opposite end from where the food was displayed so when it was busy it became congested not only with diners but also a constant stream of staff topping up all the dishes.    The food was varied and tasty including various pancake recipes at breakfast. There were varied salad dishes some vegetarian dishes some international and some Moroccan foods. We were pleasantly surprised to see how little our bar bill was at the end of our stay.    We used the hop on hop off bus to orientate ourselves as to attractions then petit taxis - always barter and agree a price before getting in. The hotel will tell you the appropriate cost.    Over and above the old town's many attractions we strongly recommend the Jardim Majorelle on the edge of town a sort of super cactus tranquil oasis garden designed early in 20 century by Majorelle a French painter then later owned and restored by Yves Saint-Laurent and his partner. It is now a foundation with a fascinating Berber museum and a very good cafe. It feels peaceful even when busy. We enjoyed it so much that we went twice.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FandRD

Buffet breakfast and dinner meals were generous with a wide variation on offer all well presented.    Within 35 minutes walking distance of the main square a large supermarket if required was about 10 minutes from the hotel.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Mkillick wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A lovely escape,A couple of friends and I stayed here in February for 3 nights and had a great time. The hotel is well located if you are after a break every now and then from the madness of the old town! It is just a 20-30 minute walk from the main square and most other areas so was ideal for us and a taxi is roughly 30 dirham to most places in the old town (well it was for us but it can really vary depending on how much you haggle!)    Watch how much you pay for a taxi from the airport when you first get there they try to charge you per person but it should be the price for the cab! We were told to expect about 100 dirham.    The pool looked lovely but it was sadly a bit cold for us to use it when we were there I would come back in hotter months to enjoy that!    Breakfast was great we'd all strongly recommend the Moroccan pancakes that they make fresh to order.    Lovely staff and we would definitely recommend the Atlas Mountains excursions that they offer.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mkillick
Opera Plaza Hotel,Lilian J wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Great location and service,Opera Plaza Hotel was warm and welcoming. It is modern clean and the rooms are very spacious. Having stayed in both a pool view room and opera view I can recommend both. The lobby is beautifully furnished and very neutral the bar downstairs has live acts in the evening. The breakfast could have been on the more continental side however it just about satisfied the palate. The pool area is accommodating as are all the staff. They are so helpful if you need absolutely anything i.e. a driver for a day trip to Agadir or Essaouira they will gladly do so for you. The location is PERFECT. Its a safe haven in comparison to the location of many a riad. There are many restaurants and fast food joints within walking distance as it is in the new town there is also a shopping district very nearby. The traditional markets take for example Jemaa El Fna square and the roads leading off it are about 10-15 minutes away by cab and there are many cabs available either right outside or along the left hand side of the hotel immediately outside Red Hotel which is on the other side of Opera Plaza. The station is right opposite and the Opera theatre is also opposite Opera Plaza.  The Medina is also nearby and if you get a cab from the hotel it will take again about 15 minutes or so.    The bathrooms are very nice the bigger bathrooms are on the pool view side however.  The beds in a twin room are small doubles which are perfect.  Opera Plaza is a little luxury on a budget.  Great value deal and great customer service.    I am already planning my return.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/870lilianJ
Opera Plaza Hotel,popsie2015 wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Great Hotel,We have just returned after 1 week at the Opera Plaza Hotel.  The hotel is only 3 years old so its very modern.The bedrooms are very spacious and the balcony is a good size also.  I found the staff to be very helpful in particular Fitzel on reception.Nothing was too much.  There is a lovely relaxed bar with a large TV playing sports and in the evening there is live music nightly. The barman Kamal is so friendly and so pleasant.  We opted for bed and breakfast and the food was plentiful and a good variety although after a week it did get a little boring.  The only downside to this hotel was that the beautiful swimming pool was not heated and far too cold to swimmuch to the dissapointment of my son.    If you need a Taxi they are plentiful outside the hotel-there are always drivers waiting directly outside to pounce on you! beware......they will try to rip you off. for a short journey they will triple the price.  We met one gentleman local taxi driverAbdula. he was so fare with the price and on our first journey we had asked him to collect us after dinnerhe told us to pay for the cab on our return ! we ended up booking him for any journey we needed and did a full day tour with him for half of what the tour guides will charge.He even brought us to the airport and refused to charge us-something that would never happen there!  his number is 00212 649 5504 59 and he gave permission for me to include him and his number in this review.If you need a taxi honestly call this guy- perfect english too!

Opera Plaza Hotel,LucyRabb wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Ticks all the boxes,We have just returned from a long weekend at the Opera Plaza Hotel and we were pleased with the hotel and its location. It is located on a very busy cross roads but once in the hotel traffic noise is not noticeable. We walked to the Medina on a few occasions (once late evening) and it was a pleasant walk easy to find along well lit roads and took us about 45 minutes.    Take care not to let any locals show you the way - the hotel reception will give you directions - as you might be taken to their 'sons shop' or a 'student market' (there isn't one) on the way and they can turn nasty if you won't buy anything or give them a tip for taking you.    We were in Room 516 which was ideally situated overlooking the pool on the top floor and had the sun on the balcony all afternoon. The room was spotless modern and well maintained. Nice bathroom with lashings of hot water anytime. The hairdryer was adequate for me (shoulder length hair). Towels were very clean but weren't very thick so if you are fussy about towels take your own. A slightly hard mattress but we slept well. Take your travel kettle plastic mugs and tea/coffee sachets if you like a hot drink and a plug adaptor.  If you like a drink in your room before going out in the evening (or don't like to pay the high hotel prices) buy duty free at your UK airport to take with you. The hotel has signs not to take in food or drink. We purchased water and other drinks/nibbles but were discreet taking them into the hotel putting them in a small ruck sack to take to our room. The local shop for bits is just round the corner from the hotel a couple of minutes away. From hotel entrance turn right. Turn next right and pass 2 small cafes on the right hand side which the locals use. Next to these cafes are 2 small shops which sell water other bottled drinks and bits at very good prices.    I emailed the hotel before we arrived to request a quiet top floor room and was pleased that they met our request. We had no problems with wifi - both in the lobby and in our room.    We were half board - the food was all buffet style. Breakfast was limited but adequate - we had cheese on toast every day which was fine but don't expect a full english. Lots of fruit juices pastries tea/coffee machine. The evening meal was limited but again ok. The soup was tasty and hot then a choice of maybe a chicken dish vegetables a fish dish and some sort of potato dish. I am fussy - I like my food hot - which it wasn't. The staff worked very hard and the restaurant area was clean modern and well presented.    If we went to Marrakech again - we would not go half board - there are very nice reasonable restaurants in the area. We ate our lunches in the cafes at the railway station which is just across the road - and they were very cheap had sun terraces to sit out and good food.    The pool area was smart clean and there were plenty of sun beds but again the drinks were very expensive. The pool was freezing so we did not venture in but it looked well maintained and clean. Inviting for hotter months.    There is a bank at the railway station that gives good exchange rates for your currency but ATMs all over Marrakech.    We went on a horse drawn carriage ride for an hour from the Medina which cost us 150 DH. Don't forget to haggle for everything. A meal overlooking the Square at night from a roof top restaurant is amazing - we paid 120 DH for a salad chicken tagine and fruit - all very tasty and had no tummy problems. On a day trip to Ourika Valley in the Atlas Mountains which included a visit to a Berber market which cost 320 each including a gorgeous tagine lunch. Also our package included a half day city tour with a guide. All excellent trips and well worth doing!

Opera Plaza Hotel,AlMacScotland wrote a review Feb 2015,40,"Good hotel, good location",We booked half board as we were unsure of local restaurants so this was a bit of an insurance policy. We were a bit disappointed to learn that whilst hotel boasts 3 restaurants the half board is only available in 1 restaurant.Like other reviews I would agree that the breakfast whilst adequate got a bit boring and predictable after a few days.  Rooms were large and spacious as was the bathroom and we had a room overlooking the pool which was away from the road and train station so no noise at all.  Had booked Marrakesh Airport transfers taxi and it was excellent in both directions. If a taxi turns up at allotted times and delivers safely at good low price I am happy. Would certainly recommend.  In terms of visiting Marrakesh we took Sterling cash to exchange but took out cash at Marrakesh airport ATM and spent that and put meals etc on credit card. I had been a bit apprehensive about cash after having read so much but it was no issue at all.  Hotel is well situated to walk to Medina - about 20 mins and 10 mins to Gueliz district with western shops and restaurants. The open top tourist bus stops right outside hotel and we made good use of it to see the sights and get our bearings.  Free Wi-Fi in rooms and separate free Wi-Fi in lobby/public areas.

Excellent clean and modern rooms...my wife who is very fussy about having a clean toilet was singing praises of the high levels of hygeine housekeeping and modern toilets. The buffet breakfast was delicious - just about the right number of dishes and very tasty and we both are very fussy eaters (the fresh crossaints and morrocan pancakes were heavenly). The hotel is relatively cheap and us excellent value for money. We did not have any issues with taking water/sift drinks to our rooms. We even took McDonald's and KFC to our rooms in a shopping bag and were never stopped. The staff at breakfast and reception were very friendly and helpful. The Medina/jema el fana was a 10 min taxi ride from the hotel and we never paid above 25 dirham's for the taxi ride (£1.70).

Opera Plaza Hotel,Craigy27 wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Satisfying but great may be within its grasp,Don't get me wrong this is a good hotel and is in a great location. It is situated conveniently by the train station and the supratours depot.I booked suntransfers.com for our transfers to / from the hotel which were done impeccably so I cannot recommend this company highly enough.    Firstly re the hotel - our room was a twin with what can be described as two double beds in a large room - we were promised a pool room and on arrival we were given roadside - a call made and the situation was rectified - no hassle.    The hotel has signs up re outside food and drinks not allowed - we did hear from others that challenges etc were made but I cannot comment on that other than my wife and I never had any issue but we didn't openly display what we brought into the hotel.    There is also no doubt in my mind that most Moroccans are after your cash - the person opening the door / the person lifting bags etc - I remain quite sceptical and it is this that I give as my reasoning for this hotel- service seems to be based on getting a 'sweetener' - a' tip' not service just for service sake - perhaps this unfair but it's how I found Marrekech.    The hotel itself is 20 mins walk away from medina but 10-15 walk away from Carre Eden a modern shopping centre with Starbucks McDonalds Mango Adidas Etam et Al food court etc and a big Carrefour super market for all grocery needs.    Food at hotel much more expensive than towards the city - we tended to go to where locals would eat and could pick up a main course with salad tarter - bread/ olives and soft drinks for about 110 dirham for 2!    From the hotel you should not pay more than 30 dirham to medina/ Jeena el fna but why you want to spend your time there i will leave to you to answer - do visit at night and not just day time.    All in all a good hotel hotel but simple touches like being more person friendly would go a long way to being truly great. Let's face it no one spends a fortune to stay here so expectations should remain realistiic.    Oh and a major for most travellers - wifi unpredictable - why cannot hoteliers grab this must for the modern tourist!

The reception staff leave a lot to be desired as they are inclined to ignore guests even taking photos of each other while we waited. Porters are present but some of them are of limited assistance.  Breakfast is a completely chaotic affair in rooms that are too small with the kitchen at one end and the food counter at the other meaning that staff (all sorts of staff!) and guests are milling around bumping into one another; there is also quite a limited food range and on the relatively cheap side. Most extraordinary is that they have a very rigid breakfast policy: everything (ie. cutlery staff available to customers and food) is suddenly removed at exactly 10.30. So although they say breakfast is up to 10.30 one wonders what sort of breakfast is offered to a client arriving at 10.28?!

Opera Plaza Hotel,DRoman wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Convenient Location,My travel companion and I stayed here on our last two days in Morocco. We chose this hotel for the price and not so much the location. I'm not keen on staying at hotels near a train station because the areas are usually seedy but this was the exception. The location was perfect and since we had traveled all over Morocco we were carrying lots of souvenirs and rugs so walking from the train station to the hotel was perfect. With that said the hotel is on a very busy intersection so get ready to hear lots of cars honking all day long. Opt for a pool side room for more quiet. Yeah! Breakfast was included in the rate!!    The staff was super lovely and always very helpful and attentive. The rooms were very very clean and even though we insisted our room not be cleaned because we had such a mess in there they cleaned it anyway. I thought that was very nice!    Go to the spa and try the four hand massage! It was superb! I'm still thinking about it.

Opera Plaza Hotel,missme1time wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Oasis in a crazy city,This hotel is located opposite the train station and about half an hour walk to the medina. We booked a pool view room so was lovely and quiet. The rooms are large and have nice bathrooms and balconies. Beds are comfy. Service was good everywhere. Went to the morrocan restaurant one night and it was ok but I am sure you could find better. The bar plays live Spanish music which we did not enjoy every night. Breakfast was ok plentiful but not as tasty as I would have liked.  As for Marrakech it is a crazy city and you have to be so careful as everyone tries to rip you off. My hand was grabbed by a lady at the medina and hennaed and even when I said no she carried on then insisted on charging my husband! On the way out one night a group of young morrocan boys ran past and grabbed my backside even though I was with my husband! It was a frightening experience.

The Opera Plaza Hotel was absolutely ideal for relaxation and extra quality of service. The location was good with access to the highlights of the ancient garden city with an atmosphere experiencing the past without leaving the present.  What really impressed my wife was the spacious room with two twin beds and the bathroom had every facility. The staff at the reception in the restaurant and the chamber maids were definitely in the premier league. They always greeting as a guest who is special!

Opera Plaza Hotel,Sllickster wrote a review Dec 2014,40,"Great staff, Amazing room and a good location",We went as a pair and thoroughly enjoyed everything that this hotel had to offer.    The hotel itself is in good condition. We had a twin room which was very spacious. The bathroom is in great condition looks really modern and is thoroughly cleaned. The only drawbacks with our room was that the paint on the walls could do with a touchup and the bath needed to be resealed. So on the whole they are only really trivial and minor issues so in summary the room was everything you could want. Our balcony doors were temperamental and didn't lock all of the time but this was never an issue for us. The room has a safe but you don't feel entirely comfortable putting your possessions into it as the safe isn't locked into the wardrobe and can be picked up and taken away with ease.    They have a few restaurants but the menu is somewhat limited. We stayed Bed and Breakfast which was very basic but did the job. We walked past the restaurant at night and the evening meal looked exactly the same so I wouldn't recommend doing an all-inclusive stay at this hotel.    The staff were very friendly especially the receptionists. Their grasp on the English language was also extremely good and made our stay in the hotel a more enjoyable experience because of it. The only issue we had was with the door-man. Every time we left/entered the hotel he would pester you to see if you wanted a taxi or to hold the door for you. Even when you say no thank you (in whatever language) he will come after you pressuring you to get a taxi with him. He does this because he gets a cut of the taxi fare. This is common practice among all of the hotel services. The prices are bumped up because the staff get a cut of whatever they sell. If you are going to buy anything we would recommend going outside of the complex.    Excursions - we went to the Atlas mountains. It was an excellent day out we had our travel and food included and the whole day only cost us about £25. We booked it through the hotel and while it was more expensive you get the usual assurances and comfort in knowing its going to go ahead. We even noticed that the prices changed depending on which member of staff that you ask.    ROOM/CITY TAX - we were not informed that we had to pay this tax until we arrived at the complex. While it was only something small it still takes up money that you didn't intend to spend. We were told upon arrival that it was 33 dirmahs a day per person when in fact it is 16.50 a night per person. We elected to pay it when we left and that way ensured that we got a receipt etc.    LOCATION - the location of this hotel can be ideal depending on what you want from your holiday. There is a train station with a few good restaurants just opposite the road including KFC and McDonalds. The main centre (Medina) is about a 30 minute walk with a few restaurants and shops along the way. There is a shopping centre and super market about 10 minutes away from the complex. The roads near the hotel are crazy although you get used to it within a day or two. Don't be afraid to walk out into the road it's pretty much a free-for-all so just go along with it.    In summary a great hotel for what you pay. So long as your cautious and well informed before you leave you shouldn't experience any problems. Just be wary that everyone is trying to get your money so long as you're informed before you go it will be a great experience. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sllickster
Opera Plaza Hotel,Me_n_my_rucksack wrote a review Dec 2014,50,An excellent hotel for the money - great staff and a comfortable room......,We spent one night here and chose the hotel mainly for its proximity to the railway station (3 mins - across the road). We didn't really expect much but were very pleasantly surprised.    Check in was straightforward - nice frieldly girl on the desk.    The room was for the price and grade of hotel very nice. Lots of TV channels huge comfortable bed and a balcony overlooking the pool. Wifi was great - worked very well both in the roomand in public areas. Breakfast was ok - not a vast amount of cooked food but lots of choice otherwise (Cerials breads etc) however they did have a crepe bar and made them to order - very nice.    The Medina is a 20 min walk away - if you are happy with that this is an excelent choice.    Downsides ? Bit stingy on the shampoos / shower gells (4 of those thin sacchet things) and there was no Bureau de Change. (They did give us directions to the best place to change money a 5 min walk away though).    Checkout was equally friendly and unfussy.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Barbara F wrote a review Nov 2014,40,A good base,Across the road from the fine railway station and the new opera house (currently being finished) the hotel is well placed in this city. The rooms were well furnished and comfortable the only slight problem being the long mirror was obscured by the heavy dressing table so not much use. Bathroom spacious but bath quite high with a wide tiled rim which made getting in and out to the over bath shower a bit of a contortionist exercise!!! The food was good/average and not exceptional. Timing for dinner was difficult as we had to slot in with another group and some people were kept waiting until nine o clock for a table. Not ideal. But the staff were nice helpful and polite which makes a huge difference.

Opera Plaza Hotel,akzah wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Nice stay,Stayed for 4 nights in november and overall it was a lovely stay.    Starting with the area: you are only 10mins or so from the airport so no long journey across the road is the station with McDonalds and cafes. Just a 10 minute walk brings to you Gueliz shopping mall various restaurants. Great safe location you do need to take a taxi to the medina otherwise you can walk it in about 30-45mins. Just outside is shop to buy some water cheaply and any other drinks.    The room was nice and large had a small TV but good enough to watch. Had a few English channels one which was fox movies. The bed was hard but nothing too bad the bathroom was nice and yes the shower/tube does require a bit of an effort to get into if your small it is still fine and spacious. We had a balcony overlooking the road but with the windows closed you could barely hear the traffic. Wifi across the hotel was good though did have times were it went for a few hours or was slow though good enough to check emails and whatsapp.    The lobby and areas around the pool are very nice 4* or higher quality. We tried some crepes one night with some tea and they were good standard. The breakfast however isn’t too great it’s the same food each day and not much variety and if you get there after 10 (it closes at 10.30) you may find the best items have finished and no refills. There is a electricity saving switches everywhere across the hotel and they can be a bit annoying.    Lastly the staff are helpful but be warned just like in other places in Marrakech they will try and get you to use their friends for example we asked about booking some day trips and buggy ride but they would only book through their friends agencies not the ones which were rated the best on trip advisor. The doorman will try and get you the hotel taxi or his friends taxi they will ask for 50 dirhams to go the medina or in fact anywhere local you should bargain with him and tell only for 30-40. Otherwise get your taxi from the station which will be around 20-35.    Overall for the price paid the hotel is very good nice location its safe and it’s a nice peaceful from the rush of Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akzah

Opera Plaza Hotel,CJT007 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Lovely hotel - 20 minutes from Medina,The rooms were spacious and although we were at the front overlooking the busy road the room was quiet when the windows were closed. The breakfast buffet was better than most and we had dinner in the Moroccan restaurant overlooking the large swimming pool. The food again was good and the service excellent. The pool is surrounded with sunbathing loungers but has a bizarre way of obtaining a towel whereby you pay a deposit at reception and then present the token to a boy at the pool who goes and gets you a towel. If he remembers who you are then you may get your towel but only if somebody else doesn't get to him first. The first day I waited 30 minutes. Other than that the hotel was a joy.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJT007
Opera Plaza Hotel,quinn281 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Good Hotel for the money,"The hotel is lovely but remember and ask for a quiet room looking onto the swimming pool. The roads outside the hotel are manic and like most of Morocco the drivers feel obliged to hit the horn.  The rooms had everything you needed including a fridge. The air-conditioning didn't work too well and I was grateful it wasn't high summer. The bed was a bit hard for me but that is far better than it being like a marshmallow.  We found the staff very helpful and friendly. The food was to my taste but my wife struggled a little but both of us always found something to eat.  The spa in this hotel is not too bad there are a couple of therapists that give a decent deep tissue massage and it isn't that expensive.  The hotel is about a 35 minute walk to the Medina. If going remember it is Morocco and only ask Police or Soldiers for help the reason is simple everyone else looks for money even to give directions.  Going into the Souk would be best done with a ""proper"" guide not one of the locals looking to make a quick buck and take you only to shops etc where they get a kick-back. We all know this goes on but give yourself the best chance.  The roads are crazy the green man only covers half the road the other half is a test of your courage. Watch the locals and do as they do once you start keep going if you stop they will drive round you leaving you stuck in the middle.  Marrakech is definitely an assault on the senses and worth seeing however if it is your first time stay outside the Medina and travel in that way you can chose to venture into the craziness of the souk or relax by the pool.",Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quinn281
Opera Plaza Hotel,Abid H wrote a review Nov 2014,20,"No internet, no evening buffet but good large rooms",We booked via alpha rooms who advertise that the hotel has an indoor swimming pool. Please note that this is not the case.    The rooms are spacious and clean.    We booked half board. The breakfast is the same everyday. We were told that they do not have many guests hence no evening buffet meal. We had a choice of two starters but were not offered a choice for the mains.    The wifi only worked on the first day. The staff first did not acknowledge that there was a problem with this They all promised to have this repaired the next day but this never materialised.    We booked for 2 nights via alpha rooms and planned to book on the same site in Morrocco the cost was approx £50 per night. If you book at the hotel its £80. Please note that the alpha rooms website is blocked in morrocco so book before you go. The hotel staff are aware of this but won't inform you as they would prefer you booking directly. One of the staff rudely stated that they charged us extra because we had 3 beds in the room while clearly being aware that there was two of us.    Finally the hotel does not allow you to bring in food and drinks. I however bought in cold food and drink. I explained that this was to take back to the UK (even the water). lol.    Despite the negatives the rooms were big with nice beds and a good bathroom (good shower) with a hairdryer    10/10 for the room cleaners knocked on the door if we forgot to put up the cleaning signs.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615abidh

Opera Plaza Hotel,Divecario wrote a review Nov 2014,40,"Clean, calm, cannot really fault",Chose this hotel for a week long stay with 12 yr old son as out of the bustle and hassle of the old town and because it has a proper pool. Not disappointed - staff courteous smiling and helpful without exception. Room large and spotless as was the ensuite - complete with proper bath. Clean pool and pool area unheated so a bit chilly on entry but I've been in worse :-). Breakfast OK - repetitive but nice enough and with freshly mulched smoothie of varying content on a daily basis. Only ate here twice in the evening once for the 'barbeque' and once in the Italian - neither were worth the cost nor particularly nice so I'd advise don't bother - there are plenty of cheap authentic Moroccan restaurants in walking distance - particular mention to 'hotel/restaurant (your guess is as good as mine) Farouk an unassuming place on the main road full of locals that serves incredibly tasty tagines - total bill for two 80 dirham -v- meal for two in hotel.... 460 dirham! I didn't find the hotel food/drink overpriced for a hotel - they're always overpriced but you don't HAVE to stay in! The couple of pool days we had were obviously more expensive as all food and drink by pool is hugely marked up but that's to be expected - these people are running a business and a pretty good one at that. We managed to bring discrete bottles of water for the room without trouble but discretion is the order of the day.  Evenings in the bar generally involved a duo of guitar playing musicians who were extremely good though with widescreen TV big football matches drew large (mainly local) crowds regardless of time of day. Not a problem.

Opera Plaza Hotel,sheilallan wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Slightly corporate but fills a need in Marrakesh,Stayed here for three nights with a Riviera party. Enormous room on the front - 217 - overlooking the front entrance but quiet unlike similar hotel in Fez. Comfortable large bed and good bathroom facilities which unfortunately were needed more than usual as my wife had picked up a bug by this stage. Pleasant sitting area around the bar by the pool which as well as drinks serves light lunches of the pizza/Panini/sandwich with fries type. One warning - if you order a tonic with ice and lemon and this is all you want they will assume you want a gin in it unless you make it clear that you don't! Buffet restaurant is fine for breakfast and lunch with a goodish selection and an attempt to provide some Moroccan cuisine. There is also an Italian restaurant attached - open evenings only and a small more extensively Moroccan a la carte restaurant near the pool which you pay for separately. It is worth crossing the road to the new Opera House Theatre which is under construction but far enough on the give a good impression of what it is likely to be when finished in about 18months. A small tip will get you a 15 minute tour from the concierge and it is well worth doing especially as it is not yet on the main tour circuit. You may be tempted to walk to the centre but it is a good half hour and the pavements are uneven with some steep kerbs. Better take a taxi but negotiate and don't pay more than 25dh. There are some pleasant strolls in the area of the hotel and the area is well laid out with gardens.

Our room was always serviced between three and four in the afternoon ..Not nice coming back after a day out and finding it hadn't been cleaned. It was cleaned well-just late in the day.

Our travel guide took us to the local shop to buy litre bottles of water for 6 drms.This was the only hotel on our tour that didn't provide free water in the room .From the mini bar it was 25drms.  The breakfast buffet was quite good apart from not having any unpeeled fruit.Tours were allocated time slots for the evening buffets and even then some of our group had to wait quite a long time to get into the dining area.

Opera Plaza Hotel,AlwaysUnited1 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,AClean but food is the worst,Please read my review of my 5 night stay. Arrived on Saturday night. Couldnt be bothered to take notes on the last two nights but you will understand me soon.    Airport   Arrive at 9pm empty airport 156 passengers being served by three staff then two then four people! All lazy and slow except one! Ridiculous queue didn't get out until 10.20pm!    Hotel    Not a bad location WiFi good thing but weak reception in rooms only works in lobby. Staff were okay. Dinner finished by the time we came so went McDonald's.    Area    Not bad made for tourists with it's prices but local eateries look dirty.     McDonald's was a let down with their price dry big mac and charging us for bbq sauce! I apologises to the guy for walking away when I was asked to pay and said in London we don't pay for standard sauces and he cheekily said this is Morocco so I said yes you charge for everything!    Breakfast - very basic Lipton tea was the best thing there     Lunch - kfc (coleslaw was best)    Dinner - opera plaza not nice whatsoever.However Desert was good. Had to pay extra for water!    2nd day food    Breakfast rubbish usual    Lunch - kfc chicken pieces rubbish. Coleslaw best as before    Dinner - even worse than first night     3rd day food    Breakfast - usual rubbish but the pancakes were nice    Lunch - big tasty from McDonald's    Dinner - at hotel. Rubbish as usual but roast chicken was available which was nice     Service not too bad,Date of stay: October 2014,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlwaysUnited1

Opera Plaza Hotel,Michele C wrote a review Oct 2014,40,A very comfortable stay,A good location opposite the train station & only 40 minutes walk to Djemma El Fna or a taxi ride away for about 40 DH.  Rooms are spacious clean & comfortable. Showers can be a little difficult to get into as you have to step into the steep sided bath to use the shower.  Rooms looking across to the swimming pool are generally quieter.  We had included dinners in the main buffet restaurant which was excellent but the restaurant struggles when the hotel is full with several groups all trying to have dinner at the same time as the restaurant is not large enough.  There is also an Italian & Moroccan restaurant in the hotel. Dined at the Moroccan restaurant which was a lovely atmosphere & the pool bar also serves light meals.  Bar area good atmosphere although prices are expensive.  Lovely large pool although the water was cold in October.  Had a massage which was excellent & good value.  There is also a bowling alley with a bar downstairs.  Free Wifi available in the rooms when there is a connection! Otherwise it usually worked in the reception.  Staff all helpful & friendly.  I would definitely recommend this hotel & hope to stay here again.

The 3rd bed was a single bed places to one side which was a little disappointing but the room was HUGE so I can't complain.    The staff were lovely and very helpful.    We were warned to keep our valuables in a safe which we did so didn't encounter any issues.    It's a shame that the rooms don't supply irons. We asked for it on day 1 and we're told we would get one soon. By day 3 the iron hadn't arrived.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Downhillskidave50 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Marrakech Express,This boutique style hotel is very new and extremely well positioned close to Marrakech Central Railway station. It has a bus stop immediately outside for the excellent open topped sightseeing bus for Marrakech - stop 3 out of 18 points of interest in the city.  The bedrooms have a good level of comfort and equipment - comfortable queen sized beds and double beds mini-bars TV and inroom Wi-Fi. The shower/bath arrangement needs some care - a large step over the bath rim to get into shower! Smaller clients may find this awkward.  Aircon adjustable and nice balconies overlooking the pool - or the busy main road....but excellent double glazing means no noticeable noise. The swimming pool is very clean and modern with Balinese style sunbeds. There are restaurants/snack bars around the pool.  Restaurants attached to the hotel (and sister Hotel RED ) - La Bella Italia - Le Melkis - Le Rossini are reasonable for Italian/Buffet/Moroccan food but wine prices are very high. The bars in the hotel are all very smart but also come at a cost.  Breakfast and dinner buffets are above average - no eggs are cooked at breakfast which is a pity but otherwise pastries/breads/pancakes etcx are plentiful. The dinner buffet at 220 DH is very well presented and gives a good selection of salads and cooked dishes.  Staff are helpful and the ambience of the hotel makes it feel upmarket - added to an excellent location with cafes and bus route just outside - this is a good place for a couple or three nights in Marrakech.  So - if you are on the Marrakech Express this hotel is perfect and on your doorstep from the station.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Alderholt, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Downhillskidave50

Hotel is clean and well presented. Staff very friendly and helpful. Nice Pool and bar areas. Food was excellent and times are good as well 7.30 to Morning and evening for breakfast and diner so you have plenty of time for out and about. We had a trip to Atlas Mountains with the hotel and that was worth every penny. Taxi's are just outside hotel but secure a price before getting in about 40 dirham to the medina and make sure they take you to the Medina and not a spice shop. The Souks have some wonderful goods. Leather bags are second to none. Silver wear and beautiful vibrant art work and look out for the recycled tyre shops- they turns tyres onto bags chairs pots you name it Beware of scroungers they are every where and only ask policeman directions as any one else will want paying but there are loads of policemen about. Some of the city is very poor and a real eye opener. Having said this we had a great time. Lack of booze a bit inconvenient at times especially when out and about in the midday sun.

Opera Plaza Hotel,MrAshraf wrote a review Oct 2014,20,Not for us,My wife and I were in Marrakech for the second time this year and opted to stay close to the new town. The Opera Plaza Hotel was given as an option as part of our BA package. Had we known what we know now we would have never stayed at the hotel. In brief food/drinks are over priced and I mean over priced. You are not allowed to bring food and drinks from outside so you have to sneak it in like a criminal. The hotel compared to British standards is 3 star. The walk ways within the hotel (on floors 2 and above) are dark therefore you continuously need to hit the light switch to see where your going (you have to see it to believe it). Because of the way the hotel is built you get very limited sunbathing time approx 7 hours when in reality should you should get 12 hours again this is because of the way the building is made. Breakfast. Basic basic and more basic. If you like Omelettes forget about it beans you must be joking. Breakfast was very poor. After 3 days we gave up and started eating outside a quarter of the price and much better food and options. Our room always smelt. Toilet paper was practically tracing paper and on one particular occasion on the 4th day a can of redbull was opened from the minibar half drunk and placed back in the minibar. The hotel staff we're not very helpful. The Spa within the hotel nice but you won't get what you pay for. Remember it's a 3 star hotel. You wouldn't visit a 3 star hotel in the UK and expect a wow experience so don't expect it here.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrAshraf
Opera Plaza Hotel,Jane D wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Lovely friendly hotel,I have just returned from a four night stay with a friend at the Opera Plaza we had a very large twin room with a great balcony that looked out towards the theatre and round a bout it was a great view and lovely when dark with all the car lights etc. We found the staff including the reception staff to be very polite and helpful whenever we had any questions or queries any minor hitches were quickly put right at no point did any staff member try to get us to join their tours the hop on hop off bus stopped right outside the hotel and stops at all the best spots there is also an out of town route included in the ticket which was worth doing. The hotel was very clean throughout restaurant and pool area included. The buffet breakfast and evening meal provided plenty of variety and no one left the table hungry my only criticism is that the restaurant did not serve complimentary water for dinner whilst at breakfast there was a selection of juice water tea or coffee. On our last day we had to check out at 12.00 and transfer to the airport at 6.30pm we were able to use the pool then go to the spa to shower and make ready for our journey; towels were provided and there was no charge for this very welcome extra. The hotel was in a good location and it was easy to get to the places we wanted to see I would definitely return to this hotel as it exceeded my expectations.

Opera Plaza Hotel,EmmetB1 wrote a review Sep 2014,40,"Great Pool area, clean rooms, fantastic breakfast buffet","Pros:  - Pool area was clean and nicely designed- Sun beds were comfortable and the pool bar provided tasty snack food and drinks. Deposit for a towel is 200dhs- Be careful the pool boys don't take your towel when you pop away for a bit as there seems to be a zero tolerance policy and it's a very easy way to lose your deposit money!  - Rooms were cleaned thoroughly by cleaners each day. We had a pool facing balcony by request as the view of the pool is lovely. A view of the beautifully aesthetic train station would also have been nice and it can be entertaining to watch the crazy constant traffic on Ave Hassan II. Room itself was comfortable and of decent size.  - The breakfast buffet was the highlight of my stay just get down before 10am! Great selection of fruit and pastries but my favourite was the pancake-like things which the girl makes outside restaurant.  - Location is great. Directly across from train station and a walkable distance from the Medina but taxi is best option. Tip- ask the hotel porters how much you should pay roughly for your required taxi trip and use this price suggestion to guide your agreed price with taxi driver. Otherwise...  - Pool Bar- Great for a drink or small lunch during the day or room service for a late night Pizza or Crepe! Staff are friendly.    Cons:  The reception staff- Rude manner constantly very pushy in selling their selected tours. We found that their specific selection represented bad value for money with fairly unknown tour providers. We couldn't find info on the tour company they referenced and they didn't have much information when questioned. Reception staff were also particularly unhelpful in recommending restaurants or riads for food things to do in the Medina or simply queries any hotel should expect from tourists. We stopped asking them any questions after 2 days as each time their response was sarcastic blunt and uninformed. I saw evidence of this poor unprofessionalism with other people also and it was a topic of discussion amongst tourists in the pool area each day. Tip- there's a tourist info centre in the train station. Avoid reception staff for queries because they don't like to help.  Room Card- Stopped working on 4 occasions in 6 days requiring us to queue up at reception and get it revalidated each time by the ""lovely mannered"" staff each time without an apology on any occasion. They made us feel like it was our fault it broke each time :(  Pool Bar Playlist- I love the Eagles I honestly do. However Hotel California does lose some of it's magic when heard literally 10 times per day every day without fail! Constant skipping of tracks kills the atmosphere in the pool area.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Christine P wrote a review Sep 2014,40,Perfectly suitable,We spent five nights at this hotel on an organised tour. The room was huge beds were comfortable and although our room overlooked the very very busy road it was double glazed so no real problem. A problem with the bathroom sink was sorted out at 11.00pm after two complaints to reception but done with great courtesy. The toiletries were rather basic so take your own but always masses of hot water and towels. Air conditioning was fine much needed because of the heat. We ate at the poolside restaurant and the service was good and the food very good also served in the bar inside. Drinks no more expensive than other parts of Europe. The buffet food was a little monotonous but fresh and replenished often. All the staff we had contact with were polite courteous and helpful and ready to be of assistance whenever you asked.

Opera Plaza Hotel,weekendjunkie wrote a review Sep 2014,50,No complaints,Before we came away on holiday I was worried after reading reviews of rude staff a doorman who potentially checked your bags for hidden food/drink and things going missing from rooms. BUT  we had 6 days and found the staff nothing but friendly and helpful advising us on what was a reasonable price to pay for taxis places to visit and generally welcoming us in and out of the hotel with good wishes and smiles all round. We did bring drink into the hotel but didn't flaunt it also disposing of empty water bottles by taking them out on our next outing. Everywhere was clean bedding was changed daily breakfasts were not as good as we have had in other hotels but good enough to see you through the whole morning. Drinks were expensive but the staff around the pool were so attentive it was easier just to order a couple and then we drank the water we brought in the other times. Al in all we had a great time in Marrakech and would recommend this hotel  and even come back to stay again in the future. Taxis were cheap mostly we paid 20 MAD during the day and 30 for night travel. we generally walked one way and then taxied it back later after our sightseeing.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weekendjunkie
Opera Plaza Hotel,intgen wrote a review Sep 2014,30,"Comfortable hotel, but be careful of the staff","We spend a week here.  The good stuff:  Everything was VERY clean  The pool area is amazing  The air condition worked great  The breakfast was good  Location was a plus too since it's nice to get a bit out of the Medina.  Don't mind the people writing about not being able to bring in food / water to the hotel we did that out in the open all the time and was never stopped you just can't bring it to the pool area which is fair and the hotels prices are not that overpriced it's a luxury hotel so what do you expect the prices in the hotel are European prices so we just ate/drank elsewhere.    The bad stuff:  We bought a bunch of trips from the hotel. The staff seemed to care just about selling those trips and not about informing us about them.  Firstly we went on a camel trek that we was told would last for 3 hours it lasted 2.  Then we booked a desert trip. I asked if we should bring warm clothes and we were told yes. That was a complete waste of packing as it was extremely hot even in the night.  We were also told that we would be back around noon the next day we were back at 19:00 so that was just a complete lie as well.  Instead of taking the 2 minutes and calling the agency for any of the questions we had the woman in the reception just told us stuff to try and make a quick sell she would also call us as soon as we got back from a trip and try to convince us to go on another trip right away probably she got some commission from it.    The security guard was very helpful with finding a taxi the first day we asked him how much we should pay and he gave us a price which we later found to be very overpriced probably the taxi driver was his friend so we never asked him again and just found our taxis across the road.    We had to pay a 25 euro ""city tax"" when checking out which is fine and I had expected something similar but would have been nice to pay that on check in or at least have been informed about it.    I also found the staff around the pool area and at the breakfast to be rude and unhelpful.    All in all the hotel is pretty good just buy your excursions in the medina or go directly to the agencies eat out and try to find helpful people elsewhere.    A few tips for Marrakech:  A taxi from the hotel to the Medina or anywhere else in the city for that matter should not cost more than 30 dh tops the taxi drivers in front of the hotel will rip you off go to the train station across the road and hail one.    If you want directions in the Medina ask shop owners they cannot leave otherwise you will end up with a guide who wants to overcharge you never pay anyone more than what you think their service is worth and ignore their sullen faces.    A lot of the Moroccans are really genuinely friendly and interested in helping tourists so be careful not to get into a ""everyone will rip me off"" kind of mood.

We stayed there for a week and were thoroughly impressed by the courteous staff and the great service in general. The hotel is located in the more recently developed part of town so the old town and central places are a 5-10 minute taxi ride away. One thing to note though is that the hotel does not offer irons as part of the room and you're forced to use the laundry service to have your clothes ironed (at a ridiculous price).

I understand that this is a policy at many a hotel for the pool or bar area but to include in the rooms is unreasonable. The food at the pool bar is average at best.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Nobbyclarke73 wrote a review Aug 2014,40,1 week in marakech,Overall the hotel was very good but a few things stopped us from giving it a 5  Water - they charge you 45 dhs for a large bottle when you can go 50 meters down the road and buy it for 8 dhs. I understand that hotels charge more but I found this to be profiteering the temperature is 40 + and you need to drink.  The doorman/security - when you walk to the door the try and spot if you are bringing any water into the hotel and then try to take it of you. If the water was cheaper in the hotel you would not bother buying elsewhere.  Security - though it did not happen to us I did speak to people who had things stolen from their rooms. One girl had an expensive pair of glasses stolen. If the security guard spent more time looking at the staff and less on the visitors maybe the hotel would get better reviews.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Quin H wrote a review Aug 2014,30,"Generally, a Good Hotel but You May Still be Ripped-off!",We have just returned from a 4-night stay at the Opera Plaza Hotel in Marrakech. On the whole we would have to say that this property provided a bit of a welcome break from the hassles of the city of Marrakech; however there were still a couple of issues that we felt ought to be brought to light.    The most prevalent being the fact that the bar and restaurant staff will definitely rip you off when it comes to their wine list. On a couple of occasions we were advised that our original choice of wine was not available; we were then offered an alternative choice which we thought would have been at the same price as our original choice; however this was not the case. In fact on one occasion the wine was 70 MAD more expensive and we went from a bottle of French wine to a more expensive Moroccan wine (how on earth did they come to this equation?!). We found that French bottles of wine were regularly swapped by domestic Moroccan brands which in turn meant that we were being ripped off and the hotel was extorting an even larger profit. If such a practice were to transpire in the UK Trading Standards would definitely take legal action against such an establishment.    Alas this is the general way of things in Marrakech! It is extremely tiring having to remain on your guard constantly when all of the locals view you as a gullible meal ticket and are ready to rip you off in some ingenious way or other. BE WARNED ABOUT THIS AND VERY CAREFUL!    The swimming pool was definitely a relaxing oasis to escape to and the size of the room was large and comfortable.    We nearly always find that reception staff are the people to let a hotel down; however The Opera Plaza was definitely an exception to this rule. There was one very pleasant young lady in particular who was very helpful and a real breath of fresh air to deal with.    We found the choice at breakfast to be somewhat lacking. There were very few choices of cold meats and the hot food only extended to eggs. The scrambled eggs on one morning were absolutely revolting and actually resembled more of a couscous consistency. All-in-all if The Opera Plaza is aspiring to achieve a 4- or 5-star property equivalent this needs to be looked at urgently.    If you do find yourself travelling to Marrakech from what we were able to gather it would seem that this particular hotel is definitely one of the best (if not the best!) choices in town. It isn't perfect but it's definitely got so many positives going for it and we would generally recommend it to others.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643quinh
Opera Plaza Hotel,Fothers wrote a review Aug 2014,20,Do not ignore the negative reviews if you want balanced feedback,The facilities were very good and the rooms and cleaning service was also good. The restaurant food was limited and not replenished quickly enough. The restaurant staff were generally polite and helpful as we're other staff members. The reception staff were an enigma - it seemed that helping the hotel residents was a chore and when engaged in conversation with them they would break off or allow interruptions which was very rude. We continually had to have our room cards recharged as they did not always work. The service around the pool was slow and we were repeatedly questioned about our room number when signing for drinks. On one occasion they said are you sure you are in the right hotel! Beware of hidden charges while at the hotel - there is a daily tax that everyone staying in hotels has to pay. The hotel trips are not all they say they are - your guides are not included in the cost of the trip and be prepared for other charges along the way. I would suggest you book your trips in the railway station close by at a reduced cost.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Sophie G wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay!,Having read several bad reviews of the hotel I can simply say I didn't experience any of it! The hotel was lovely all round the rooms were spacious and everywhere in the hotel was spotlessly clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful as was the doorman who greeted us everytime we came and went and also gave us some friendly advice about the local taxis. The swimming pool was lovely but very cold which was nice in such hot weather and more than enough sun loungers to go around. We had a pool view room and with both of the doors shut you couldn't hear the noise from the pool at all. The walk to the medina was quite far which we did a few times but taxis are also very reasonable at 20-40dh a ride. I would highly recommend the hotel as a lovely place to stay and hugely enjoyed Marrakech as a whole!,Date of stay: June 2014,,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/679sophieg
Opera Plaza Hotel,Ceri M wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Ignore the negative reviews!!,Stayed at this hotel from 15th - 22nd July and it was great - I honestly don't know what the bad reviews are about! The service was to a high level rooms were cleaned every day we used the safe during our stay and had nothing stolen the pool was spotless and the staff were all lovely.. if you're nice to them then they'll be nice to you. Easy. I'd recommend you ask for a pool view room. Rooms are a great size. We had a double room but the bed was easily a king-size.  200Dhs deposit to use a towel for the pool (refundable when you return it) if you forget your own. A little pricey for bottles of water (45Dhs) but there is a shop just outside of the hotel (right out the front door then first right again) which sells water for much cheaper (6Dhs) and we had no trouble getting back into the hotel with it.  It's about a 40min walk to the Medina which we managed to do easily 5 out of the 7 nights we were there - didn't bother to get a taxi - and about 10min was to Gueliz.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Marrakech especially for the air conned rooms! Also we were there right in the middle of Ramadan and it didn't affect us one bit.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836cerim

We had been out and came back mid-day room had been cleaned decided to have a couple of hours by the pool. in that time someone had been in and stole. We do use the safe provided but carelessly forget to put cash and phone away after being out.Hotel called police and we reported what had happened.Could have been worse!

We were welcomed first by Abdullah at the reception who gave us a good introduction about the hotel.  The hotel and the rooms are very clean.  The staff are all very helpful and very polite.  The food was very good.  The only downside was the Wi Fi in the rooms; it stopped working from 2nd day of our stay and we have to come to the lobby to access the wi fi.  In general we enjoyed our stay and would like to visit Merrakesh and stay in this hotel in the future.  I would lke to hank all the staff including the receptionists with special thanks to Abdullah the room cleaners the room service and all the staff at the restaurant where we used to have our breakfast and dinner.

Opera Plaza Hotel,vimal75 wrote a review Jul 2014,10,Stay away from this hotel.,I recently stayed at this hotel and I would Hello I recently stayed at the Opera Plaza Hotel and I strongly recommend you do NOT stay here and think its wise if you keep away. The rooms you cannot fault and some of the staff are pleasant. BUT !!!!  The people on reception are very rude and un-helpful. If you are doing Half board or Bed and breakfast then expect the same food every day which I can guarantee you will be sick of the sight off.    I am going to get straight to the bad points.    The Electric lamp wiring was lose in my room Please see pictures.    I was told I could not bring in food or drink from the local supermarket and that water had to be purchased from them only. ( Not sure why? as I had paid for room and I should be allowed to eat and drink what I wanted )    During the World Cup People were asked to leave !!! If they didn’t buy a drink from the bar. Some people complained stating they had just been out for a family meal in town and didn’t want to buy a drink from the bar.  The bar was very expensive and differed prices were charged depending on who served you. One lady charged me 30 dirhams for a can of coke and the next day a man charged me 40 Dirham.    I was told i was not allowed to hang up my towel on the balcony to let it dry out after being by the pool. My Balcony was at the front of the hotel.    My Television lost all its channels one day! I would also advise not to leave valuables in your room as i heard stories of the cleaners stealing items.  The staff of reception were un-helpful to the couple who had their iPad and charger stolen.    The security guards were often trying to order me a taxi and charging around 150 Dirhams to return me to the airport trying to make a profit for themselves.  I caught a taxi for half that price in the end. They would also try and flag down a taxi for you and again making a profit with the driver.    Finally on my last day I was charged 115 Dirhams so called Hotel tax? Not sure why as this as I had paid for my room in advance for 7 nights in with alpha rooms.  I will be lodging a complaint.    Please check that you will not be charged any extra money after your stay!!!! Please please keep away from this Hotel and don’t let me experience spoil your holiday.

Opera Plaza Hotel,La L wrote a review Jul 2014,50,"Lovely hotel, would stay again!",Location: good location from airport (about 12 minute taxi drive) and 20 minute walk from the Jemme el Fna market. There is also a shopping center with retail stores and restaurants about 10 minute walk from the hotel. Around the corner from the hotel is also a breakfast shop that has amazing Naan bread and coffee. Aside from that we didn't venture elsewhere outside the hotel so I don't know what else was near the hotel.    Room: The room was absolutely beautiful. Clean extremely spacious and had modern furniture. More than enough storage space with the closet. The room also comes with a table and seating area. The bathroom was also VERY spacious and comes with a blow dryer and heating rack for drying clothes bathing suits etc. The pictures on the website are true to form of what you will be getting. We were 3 persons occupying one room. The beds are more like twin size beds even though they are described on the website as a single bed. We didn't need to use the cot which was provided for the 3rd person. Two people are able to fit comfortably in one bed. We stayed in the hotel for 2 nights.    Staff: excellent customer service by the staff all the way around! Staff would provide assistance and give us very great information on restaurants and how to get to places. They are all very attentive and responsive. We arrived in Marrakesh on a 2am flight. We went to the hotel because certain members of our group were checking in to the hotel. However other members of the group were going on a camel trekking excursion at 7am so they did not pay for a hotel stay for 5 hours (as expected). The night crew staff had no problem allowing members of our group to hang out and sleep in a lounge section of the lobby. They even kept their luggage in storage until they returned from the excursion to check in to the hotel. I don't know of many hotels that would allow for that. THANKS TO THE STAFF FOR MAKING OUR STAY PLEASURABLE.    Overall experience: This was our first time in Morocco and the Opera Plaza Hotel made it memorable. No issues with anything during the 3 days of our reservation. There are about 3 restaurants within the hotel a spa fitness center large pool lounging area etc. We spent an entire day in the hotel and did not get bored once with all the amenities they offer. The included breakfast had great variety of food and beverages. Outside seating areas and canopy beds by the pool were great for either eating breakfast outside or lounging by the pool. I recommend a pool facing room. We utilized the spa while we were there and it was amazing as well. Spa staff only speak French but we were able to communicate with them with basic requests and signing. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/668lal
Opera Plaza Hotel,Stacey H wrote a review Jul 2014,10,Be warned!! Nice hotel but iPad stolen from locked hotel room,My stay at the Opera Plaza hotel started off really good and the gentlemen who was on reception when we arrived was very pleasant.    We stayed for two nights the pool was really nice the rooms were lovely and the fitness centre was nice.    After our first night we headed by the pool for the day after breakfast. I left my iPad on charge in my room and when I returned in the afternoon the cleaners were in my room and my iPad and charger were gone.    The manager took no responsibility for this and was extremely unhelpful. He sent us on a wild goose chase to two different police stations who said it was nothing to do with them. We were in a country where we did not speak the language and I expected the manager to help us. He tried to imply at one point that it were my friend and I who took the iPad.    We eventually managed to get the police but only because another lady had had her phone stolen from by the pool the day before and the same manager had told her NOT to ring the police and that they would help her find the phone and that they thought they knew who had it. She eventually got fed up of them messing her about that she went outside and stopped a police car who was passing the hotel and made them come in to help her.    Some of the staff at this hotel were really nice but most of them were rude unhelpful and didn't seem to care about their guests. The lady on reception at the Opera Plaza was so rude to me and refused to be my Arabic to English translator for the police and told me to ask at the reception at the red hotel next door.    I can't say anything negative about the look and feel of the hotel as it was lovely. But I would advise you to stay away from this hotel if you would like to keep your belongings. There is clearly a thief amongst the staff and there is some sort of scam going on with the staff at the hotel as you can read on here about all the other incidents that have happened in the last few months.,Date of stay: June 2014,,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R345ZJstaceyh
Opera Plaza Hotel,Some Bloke W wrote a review Jul 2014,50,My 3rd visit need I say more,I have stayed in a few hotels in Marrakech but I keep returning to the Opera Plaza. Not only is it a wonderful hotel but the staff are in a different league.  From attentive pool staff great bartenders a friendly face on the door and great reception team.    To me a sign of a good hotel is how they deal with a situation when it doesn't go smoothly. My online travel agent had booked me in the hotel even though the Opera was full. Not a problem they arranged a room in their sister hotel and had me back in the Opera Plaza the next morning....exceptional service from Siham on reception.

Opera Plaza Hotel,TinaHulbert wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Lovely hotel but doorman very intimidating,Very well decorated hotel that has a wonderful smell on entering the reception and a member of staff playing Moroccan music dressed in traditional costume and serves you mint tea. Our rooms were excellent. Really big. Very comfortable beds and lovely bathroom. Our room overlooked the swimming pool which was really lovely.    This hotel is located very centrally and opposite the train station and the National Theatre. So great for easy sight seeing. We took advantage of the open top bus service that actually stops right outside the entrance to the hotel.    Food was ok but the selection was very limited at breakfast and dinner.    Poolside bar and dining very nice.    Pool lovely and always a sunbed available. Only downside is your drinks are not served in shatterproof or plastic glasses and on our weekend there we noticed quite a few breakages that werent cleaned up very well. One instance a glass was smashed right into the childrens paddling pool and this wasnt tided up by the people who did the breakage or the staff very well.    Our major bug bear of our stay was the doorman. Bit of a thug. We bought some soft drinks water etc to take up to our rooms and he stopped us and wouldnt allow us to take any of them to our room and were made to feel like naughty school children. We had to put them in the left luggage room and ONLY allowed to get them if we were going to be going out of the hotel. After this incidient each time we entered the lobby he would look at our bags and try and look inside them to see if we had any other stashes we were trying to smuggle in!! On our final day he stopped her and asked her to open her small handbag and to look inside. She refused and made a complaint to the management. They were very apologetic.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Bonita I wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Opera Plaza Hotel.,I must say my first time in Morocco was not without drama this included spending time time in an ICU unit in Marrakesh. Had it not been for the wonderful staff at the Opera Plaza Hotel it would have been much worse. The Opera Plaza Hotel is a modern hotel with large rooms great balcony overlooking the pool area & a varied breakfast menu. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and I'm really sorry I spent half the time in hospital. If you are looking for a great hotel in Marrakesh book a room at the Opera Plaza you won't be disappointed it is located just across the road from Marrakesh Central Train Station. There is however one thing that should be upgraded that is WIFI it is not the best connection apart from that it is a wonderful hotel. In the future I intend to return and visit the places I missed and will definitely choose the Opera Plaza.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Rish2014 wrote a review Jun 2014,20,Not bad... But wouldnt stay here again.,"Stayed here with a friend in June although the hotel itself is really nicely decorated kept very clean has a fantastic pool area and is in a great location we found some of the staff unpleasant at times. Dont bother calling housekeeping or room service if they ever pick up the phone it will probably take them an hour to bring anything up and If you even think about walking into the hotel with a bottle of soda/water it is confiscated by the ""bouncer"" at the door at one point we were asked to throw our full water bottles away while sat in the lobby we decided to go sit by the pool with them and were followed by the doorman who took them off us and threw them out. There's a Mcdonalds over the road but the staff don't like you bringing food upto your room either so was asked not to take it up even though my friend wasn't feeling well couldn't come down and had to have his medication on a full stomach. For the price we paid though breakfast was great the majority of the staff are polite and helpful location is great however they lack tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms and the shower setup is terrible you have to climb into the shower shut the screen which doesnt fully close which means water goes everywhere our bath tub had a huge crack it in also which meant we had to shower in an akward position or risk going through the bath. The safe isnt very ""safe"" either the one we had in our room the first night was locked open so a new one was brought over in the morning and just left on the shelf without being secured wouldnt stop someone picking it up and walking off with it. We booked a taxi to the airport on out last day the guy on reception obviously forgot so after waiting around for a while they booked us a mini van (for 2 of us) for 100dh.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Dee222 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Fantastic stay - wonderful staff!!,This hotel is probably one of the best I've ever stayed in. It's definitely a 4* if not a 5*! My friend & I stayed for 11 nights & we were so delighted with our choice of hotel. The staff were fantastic especially everyone at reception & really took care of us which was really appreciated as we were two females travelling alone. Everyone was so polite helpful friendly kind & attentive. The staff always made sure we got the best deals gave great reccomendations & even haggled taxi prices for us. Our room was on the third floor & was poolside which was good since the front of the hotel was roadside & I would imagine might be noisy. The hotel has a cafe a nightclub bowling alley & a number of great restaurants including Moroccan Thai & Italian. It has a pool snack bar which serves lovely hot & cold food at the pool side restaurant until 11pm & they even served us the delicious pizzas inside the hotel bar when we were watching the world cup! Everything was luxurious about this hotel from the fabulous beds to the wonderful spa the fantastically cool pool to bamboo woven sunloungers & from the delicious & varied food to the fantastic staff. I have nothing but compliments for this hotel. My only suggestion would be to maybe have a kettle with tea & coffee in the rooms. My favourite thing of all about the hotel was definitely the staff.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Monty wrote a review Jun 2014,20,"The front of house staff are rude, unprofessional and greedy!",The hotel itself is a lovely hotel! Very chic kind of decent location and modern HOWEVER compared to the very hospitable Morrocan culture you encounter in Marrakesh in general the hotel staff and the front of door men are VERY RUDE AND BAD MANNERED! Totally not what you would expect from a hotel of this standard! The Morrocan hospitality is what makes your holiday amazing and unique and it is a shame to say that they failed miserably in this department! All they care about is money and charge 200DH to use to the pool if you are not staying at the hotel and on top of that the drinks menu is overpriced the food is horrible and service is extremely slow by the pool.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Rae H wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Can't recommend highly enough,We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Opera Plaza and have to say what a great hotel it was. The room was beautiful and the breakfast was lovely with a great choice of food and brilliant coffee! We found the staff very friendly answering all our questions and generally being very helpful. There are timer switches in the corridors but the buttons are regularly placed along the wall and very obvious so this didn't cause us any issues. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the hotel is lovely and quiet even though there were quite a few people staying. One thing you might need to know is that alcohol is very expensive but that seems to be the same for all the hotels in Marrakech not just this one and it was virtually impossible to buy alcohol outside of the hotels due to it being a Muslim country. The only other thing is that there is quite a step into the bath/shower so might not be the best if you have mobility problems (no problem for able bodied people!)

Opera Plaza Hotel,Bonso71 wrote a review May 2014,30,3 Day Stay,Stayed there as part of a tour of the Imperial Cities. Good average Hotel but lack attention to detail. On arrival at our room the entrance hall was very dark due to a broken lightbulb which I reported but was never replaced. In this dark area the instructions on the safe are in the smallest front size possible which meant that even with reading glasses they could not be read. Therefore had to ask at reception - who then gave wrong details. The shower was in the bath which had a narrow restricted entrance and a 2 foot broken tiled stepover. It appeared that a glass panel which had been in place had been broken or removed. This arrangement also allowed water to go through the gap to the tiled bathroom floor as well as penetrate the cracks in the tiles. This is not good for small elderly people getting in and out of the shower/bath. The food did not meet our expectations.

Opera Plaza Hotel,BowlerP wrote a review May 2014,30,Mainly OK but with a few reservations,A very clean Hotel with well appointed and good sized rooms ( we had a room on the 5th floor facing the pool which is recommended as some rooms face a very busy main street) The beds and pillows were rock hard so take a pillow if you can. We had excellent maid service plus pleasant poolside with reasonable food at the poolside bar. Staff were helpful and friendly. We stayed half board and this was a mistake as the evening buffet was poor quality food and hardly any choice or variety. We took this up with the Hotel and to their credit they allowed us to revert to Bed and Breakfast for 2 days and gave us a reasonable allowance against our bill so we could eat in one of the many fantastic restaurants in the square which was only a short taxi ride. ( About £2.50 (25 dirrhams) each way). It was not feasible to walk it as it could have taken up to 40 minutes in very warm conditions. Buffet Breakfast was OK without being very imaginative and we had no complaints about this meal. One small thing. The lights in the corridors were all on a sensitive time mechanism so sometimes we had to struggle in the dark to find the light switch. Either a cost cutting exercise or saving energy! Also the Wi-fi in the room is poor and you have to get a different password each day which is irritating. It worked slightly better in the lobby but for our last day there was no Wi-fi at all. The Hotel need to do something in this modern technological age!!    A visit to the Medina both day or night is an experience not to be missed. Also the Souks where the stall holders were very friendly and not too pushy! Visit the gardens and the Palace and the tombs and also the Hotel where Winston Churchill used to stay. See the Mosque from outside as we are not allowed inside We hired a personal guide and driver for a 3 hour tour which was not cheap ( about £60 but very informative.)    Marrakech itself is fantastic Everything was great as we expected there to be squalor etc but it was modern with an old fashioned feel where Bentleys Horses and Carts Donkeys Taxis and people just merged together on the roads. The traffic is frantic with everybody hooting and no discipline at all but it seems to work!! However most Moroccans we met were very friendly and respectful    The atmosphere especially in the Medina in the evening is fascinating and there are some decently priced restaurants some with balconies overlooking the square. 5 days was enough and we probably saw the best sights. After a few days it probably could get repetitious and the sun is very hot but no humidity so even 40 degrees did not make us feel uncomfortable    For a 5 day trip the experience is fantastic and the few problems at the Hotel did not eventually detract from out stay,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Woodford Green Essex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BowlerP

Exceptionally clean and well maintained extremely helpful and friendly staff food of a good quality overall for a reasonably priced hotel in Morocco. Pool area lovely with enough sunshades and sun beds. Good location more western cafes/bars and supermarket all within 15mins or so walking. Took about 30-40mins to walk to the centre of the old town if you didn't want to take a taxi. Rooms were very clean and modern. The air conditioning is a little slow to cool the room but leaving the spare key card in the room it was fine by the end of the day and we were out in the days (like I presume most people would be?). Sometimes service a little slow but it was when it was busier....if you go to Morocco it is like this don't expect someone running after you like a servant!

Opera Plaza Hotel,ProfRManchester wrote a review May 2014,30,Value but with some problems,Hotel located next to main train station. Small reception area. On arrival they couldnt find my booking via Hotels.com (quite common that web bookings I have found in hotels in Morocco at first till they search for it) but still gave me a room. Had room on 5th floor facing busy road and station despite double glazing very noisy and not that good air conditioning a bit smelly too at times. Room decor ok but small and bathroom has odd bath /shower that you have to climb in! A bit tired bathroom. I think poolside rooms probably much better re noise as courtyard is quiet. Food in hotel OK ate by pool but nothing special.  Staff friendly and helpful security guard on door helped with taxis etc.  As a short stop transit hotel its well located short hop from station or if you are on a budget OK but there are much better in Marrakech and those just outside have nicer gardens etc this hotel had pool but inner courtyard was very urban / concrete despite efforts to add Morrocan touches. I dont think I would use it again. Atlas Medina and Spa a bit pricier down the road but a lot better.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfRManchester
Opera Plaza Hotel,Nomad59 wrote a review Apr 2014,30,Good hotel in convenient location,We stayed at this hotel in early April. The hotel is very clean and well maintained the pool area is lovely although it could have done with some sunshades which were eventually brought out on our last day. Before the temperatures soared to the high 30s we found the walk into the souk areas very pleasant and interesting and it took about 25 minutes However the heat led us to take taxis which cost about 40 MAD each way (approx 4 euro) but you have to bargain sometimes we paid 50 and sometimes 30 depending on the time of day.  A few gripes about the hotel: they seem to have only one type of pillow which is hard and high I asked twice for an alternative but nothing was forthcoming; breakfasts are somewhat mediocre for a hotel of this apparent standard and finally because it was early in the season the aircon was not on so we needed to open our windows at night but the hotel played loud repetitive music in the pool area until about 12 each night (although there were very few people around) which seemed to rebound around the 4 sides of the inner square. Also the wifi is really slow. We bought our bottled water from the shop in the railway station over the road.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leyburn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad59

Opera Plaza Hotel,Jacqueline J wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Good value,If you want a large modern hotel with a good pool spa and fitness centre this hotel is perfect. It doesn't have the charm of the small riads closer to the Jemma-el-Fnaa square (where we had stayed previously) but it has spacious comfortable rooms good facilities and excellent breakfasts. A small drawback is the lack of reception staff - there was only ever one person on duty so if one client had a lengthy request to deal with everyone else had to wait. However when we were seen to the staff were charming and helpful. The hotel is situated next to a busy roundabout which could have made it noisy (we booked too late for a poolside view) but this proved not to be a problem. In fact it was quite entertaining looking down on the traffic chaos from our balcony.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622jacquelinej
Opera Plaza Hotel,jubagm wrote a review Apr 2014,40,"First time to Marrakech, but not the last.",Just got back from a 4 night break to Opera Plaza. Our room 206 was facing the very busy roads but with 2 sets of doors it wasn't noticeable. Around the pool was miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Just far enough from the shops and quite a long walk to the Souks. The hotel was clean and our room was cleaned each day. Staff were attentive and polite you do need to recap on your French before you come to Morocco as all menus and people speak French. The only downside was this was for a special birthday and even though it was on the booking nothing was done for it...... The spa was very dark and busy and even though it was really hot no offer of a drink was given.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Sleeve wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Do yourself a favour. Book In!,My wife and I are just back from a long weekend in Marrakech.  Short review - Do yourself a favour. Book In!    Longer review - As always prior to the trip we did the standard couple of days research. We chose the Opera Plaza as our base for exploring based on the reviews here. We wanted a relaxing stay at a reasonable price. This place hit all the targets smack in the middle.    I always disregard the top and bottom 10% of any reviews based on my experience that some folk are always happy and some folk just can't help complaining. That said for what it's worth my opinion is that this place is just about perfect.    We found great friendly helpful staff throughout the whole hotel. The place was extremely clean - everywhere. A good continental breakfast to start the day. A quiet lounge bar with reasonable prices open most of the day and evening and a location not too far from the prime tourist spots.    We are quite well travelled and can say without any hesitation that this hotel is in the top 3 hotels we have visited.    Initial check in was flawless polite and very fast. We had requested a late check in and a high room with our on-line booking and after 5 minutes we were in our pool facing room on the 3rd floor. We found the room a good size with a huge double bed a complementary safe in the ample wardrobe a mini bar and a wall mounted LCD TV.    If I'm hyper picky the tile grouting in the bathroom was a little worn (but very clean) the rooms are not sound proofed completely the TV only had one English channel (but who comes to Marrakech to watch TV?) and the pool was colder than a sauna plunge pool even though air temps got to 36C during the visit. I can honestly say though that we have stayed in 5* accommodation that has been quite a lot worse that this place.    Location...  3 minutes from the Train Station and the McDonald's (Who really needs this place?)  20 minutes walk from Guiliz District  30 Minutes walk from the South Mediana walls  45 minutes walk from Jemaa el-Fnaa square  45 minutes walk from Jardin Majorelle gardens    I have no hesitation at all in highly recommending the Opera Plaza.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Oxford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sleeve

Beautiful comfortable rooms with good soundproofing - great sleep.  All the public areas were of a high standard and easy to relax in after the bustle of the town. Good service at the bar in the evenings and great outdoor pool. Super selection of cold and hot for breakfast.  We found the position ideal after spending the first part of our holiday in the centre - we had taken a car into the Atlas Mts and wanted somewhere convenient to return the car to the railway station.

Opera Plaza Hotel,CarolNorthYorkshire wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Very impressed,We have just returned from a week staying at the Opera Plaza and had a wonderful time.    Prior to booking I read many hotel reviews before deciding on this hotel. It certainly exceeded expectations.    The hotel is located in a nice part of modern Marrakesh opposite the opera house and across the road from the train station which is a very nice looking building. Taxi from airport to hotel takes 10 minutes.    Without exception the hotel staff were very friendly and the hotel was spotlessly clean. There was always someone dusting or sweeping both inside and by the pool. There is a door man who seems in constant attendance and always gives a cheery greeting    We had a room with balcony over looking the pool on the third floor. The room was spacious two double beds and a single. My only complaint is the beds and pillows were very hard - but that is all down to personal preference. The room had a mini bar from which we removed some items to make space for our own. We had free wifi in our room but had to get a new access code from reception every 24 hours    We chose B&B as we prefered to eat out. Lots of restaurants to choose from both in the local area or within the walls and very reasonably priced Try Charly's Cabana about a 10 minute walk away.    To get to the medina and main square it is about a 30 minute walk along the wide tree lined boulevard. It is a pleasant walk but after doing it once we prefered to use taxi's - just over £2 during the day and a little more to return back at night. You need to agree the taxi price before setting off. They will overprice with their first offer. Our rep advised us when getting a taxi to walk away from the hotel before waving one down. They will charge more to pick up from any hotel.    At this time of the year the water in the pool is chilly but once you're in it's ok. The pool had comfortable sun beds and there was more than enough to go around for those who wanted to sit in the sun. At this time of the year the sun disappears behind the hotel about 4pm.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,North Yorkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolNorthYorkshire

The staff are very friendly and from the moment we walked through the door to the time we left they were always on hand. The breakfast is very good too great choice. Rooms are massive with a seperate shower/toilet area. We got a room with a front facing view with a balcony which was fantastic. The location of the hotel is superb with a 20 minute walk to the old town and across from the train station. We visited a restaurant called Alf Laila Wa Laila which is around 10 minutes away which had excellent food and shisha. The only point to note is that there is a city tax which you have to pay when you first check in.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShahidAli7

Opera Plaza Hotel,lutzy wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Great Choice At A Good Price,We stayed here for 3 nights after first having stayed for two nights in a Riad in the old town. While I wouldn't have wanted to miss out on a Riad stay our room there was so small that our room at the Opera Plaza seemed enormous. It was also clean and very comfortable. We chose this hotel for its very good price at the time of booking (several months in advance) and because it was next to the railway station from where we were going to depart. The bus station is also close by which was handy for a day excursion to Essaouira. The Hop-On Hop-Off bus stops right outside the hotel so you can easily get into the old town and do a bit of sightseeing at the same time. The top of the bus is a great place to see and photograph a few things from an angle not possible if you were walking or travelling by horse-drawn carriage a popular mode of transport for tourists.    Check-in was a bit lengthy but we were early yet still given a room to drop in our luggage while the room was quickly being made up. Breakfast was excellent as was the dinner we had at Le Melkis one of the restaurants on site. There are a number of other dining venues in the area including McDonalds for a quick cheap meal.    Free internet access was not available in the room but it was in the very spacious and attractive lobby. Staff were friendly and always happy to help with any queries. Check out was quick and uncomplicated.    To sum up I can highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again on a return visit to Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vaucluse, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lutzy
Opera Plaza Hotel,Kristen H wrote a review Mar 2014,30,"Good hotel, bad location","Stayed here for 10 nights with my girlfriend at the beginning of September 2013. The hotel is very clean & very modern with air con as standard nice bed balcony nice bathroom & everything else you'd expect from a 4* hotel. The weather was lovely for around 7 days of our stay but it was thunderstorms & overcast for the other 3 days sadly. The pool was great not overcrowded & we managed to get a sun lounger everyday no matter what time you went down. The food in the hotel was nice & I recommend the Thai restaurant the food there was amazing & it was always really quiet so the service was great! The bar in the hotel served alcoholic drinks & had sports on also the drink were expensive compared to everything else in morocco. The hotel doesn't have an exchange as part of it & also NOWHERE accepts travellers cheques anywhere near the hotel we spent 2 days going around all the banks & exchange places to be told they've not accepted them for years (Thanks Co-op travel)! Outside of the hotel is the rail station absolutely beautiful architecture & also the theatre which is also a great view. Sadly the theatre was closed when we were there looked like it was having building work done. We also visited the souks on one day (never again) some great ""genuine fakes"" for sale but the shopkeepers don't like being told no no matter how politely & how many times you say it. We booked a camel ride through the hotel & were picked up & dropped of by a taxi all arranged by the hotel. The experience was good but sadly we were just riding around a sort of waste land near some large houses. Having a basic understanding of French made our holiday run kind of smoothly if we didn't know any French at all we certainly wouldn't of got on so well. The roads are very busy & a lot of the city lacks pavements or at least pavements that haven't collapsed so a stroll soon become a hazard watching for cars as you walk on the road to avoid the 6ft ditch in the pavement.

Having had the previous 11 nights in riads and kasbahs entering the hotel was like changing worlds.  An excellent modern internationally styled hotel with every thing you would expect. Good food both at dinner and breakfast. Lovely pool and outdoor areas. Good underground parking. Helpful and friendly staff.  If you have your entire Marrakech stay here you would miss getting the true experience of the Medina that we had during our earlier stay in a riad. Ask me where I would stay next time.....answer... at the Opera Plaza with short trips into the near mayhem of the alley ways and passages of the medina.

Opera Plaza Hotel,gretan98 wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Ideal base.,"A very nice hotel which was ideally located for us. It is in the Nouvelle ville area which is about a 20 - 30 minute walk from the Medina and all the hustle and bustle. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes near the hotel. We were a bit concerned because it is on the main road right opposite the train station but we never heard any noise at all. The rooms are very spacious and spotlessly clean. Our towels were changed daily and the bed was made up with different patterns. We were here for valentines day and we had red rose petals spread on the bed. The bath is in an alcove which may be a bit of a problem for less mobile people.  The staff were all very helpful and polite they all said ""bonjour"" with a smile in the mornings. The inclusive breakfast was very good plenty of choice :- cereals toast freshly cooked pancakes meats fruits pastries etc. We did not eat in the restaurants for any other meals but we did have a club sandwich and a cup of coffee each at the pool bar which was very nice but turned out to be our most expensive meal during our stay. (£15). The swimming pool looked lovely but a little to cold for us to try it but I should imagine it would be welcome in high season. Reception gave us a map to help us get around and were always helpful with any inquiry. I would recommend this hotel to anyone yes it is a walk to the Medina but there are plenty of taxis if you don't want to walk and its nice to get away from it all at the end of the day.

We walked everywhere from here - to the Medina the various gardens and museums. Pool cold at this time of year and in the shade during late afternoon.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Nicky M wrote a review Feb 2014,50,"Great hotel, slightly further out of Morocco but fantastic rooms and service",I recently stayed here with a friend as part of an organised tour. I have to say that my expectations were low having read some of the other reviews on here. Our tour guide was also relatively negative about the service and food but our experience was quite the opposite! Staff were extremely polite friendly and helpful including moving sun loungers bringing drinks and suggesting places to eat.    Food: The food was also good not absolutely incredible but a decent selection hot and varied each night. On our arrival there was a Moroccan night which was lovely. The breakfast was brilliant particularly the woman who handmade the pastries while you wait - I still salivate thinking about them. Wine is expensive but there is a supermarket nearby and there doesn't seem to be an issue with taking shop-bought wine to your room. Snacks are available by the pool until mid-afternoon. There is also a Moroccan restaurant within the hotel complex but it is VERY expensive and not anywhere near as nice as the food out in Marrakech itself so I would avoid this.    Room: We had a room facing the street and heard absolutely no road traffic whatsoever despite it being on a main thoroughfare (we did witness one crash on the roundabout though!). There balcony looked down onto the road and faced the sunset which was very pleasant. The room was cool dark and the beds turned every day. The room was also much more spacious than I was expecting and the bathroom was done to a high standard. Some minor signs of wear and tear but certainly nothing to complain about.    Facilities: The pool is of a fairly decent size and there are a lot of sun loungers but these did become full when there were several coach parties staying. Towels were provided free of charge. However if you're staying in Marrakech you'll want to be out experiencing the city not staying in the hotel!    Location: The hotel is outside of the old city walls which means it's a taxi ride or a 45 minute walk into the main part of Morocco. We always took a taxi mainly because of the terrifying experience of crossing roads! We were advised not to pay more than 25 Dh for a taxi (about £2.00) and we succeeded in this although it usually took more than one attempt to get a taxi that was willing to take us for that fare. The taxi ride took a couple of minutes. If I was going to Marrakech again I would like to stay in a Riad for the atmosphere but know I would be paying for this.    Summary: A great base to explore Marrakech and the rest of Morocco from. Whatever issues other travellers had with staff or food seem to have been sorted now and I would have no qualms about going back again.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyM826

Opera Plaza Hotel,hiccup166 wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Good hotel,We stayed here over New Year and I have already recommended it as an option to my firends if they want to go to Marrakech. Location wise it is good as it is near the train station Supratours and the Nouvelle Ville. I would have found the medina too hectic to stay in. The medina is at least a 30min walk along the main busy roads. not the prettiest walk when doing it several times. We were reliably told a taxi to/from the the hotel/medina should be no more than 40d during the day and 60d during the evening. This is the tourist price including the tip. Get your water from the train station (8d) it's almost as cheap as a corner shop.    As someone else has mentioned breakfast was a bit disorganised awkwardly laid out and the Nescafe coffee machine was either not working or would break down every day. In saying that there was a decent selection for breakfast and we didn't go hungry.    The room was large and clean. The bed is massive and comfortable. Curtains block out light. Some noise could be heard but i think we had particularly noisy neighbours and lots of people liked to talk outside our room late at night.    Staff were friendly however we had a delayed check in and no reason was given. The pool area is nice however there is only about 4 hours worth of sunshine on it at this time of the year.

After an hour and a half of waiting for the manager we were each given a triple room in consolation for what we wanted. I warn you the hotel does not do twin rooms it only states it on the website I think it may be a translation issue.    Nevertheless this is a beautiful hotel with fantastic facilities. Rooms are a nice size with comfortable and clean beds    While it is not directly within the medina it is in a beautiful area. Medina is around a half an hour walk . It has great transport links it is next to the main station  taxi ranks and the tourist bus stops directly outside giving great access to the city and it's surroundings.    The meals were absolutely brilliant with a choice of various things for breakfast including breads and baguettes eggs sausages cereals  fruits  yoghurts and moroccan dishes.

Central and within walking distance of the Djemaa el Fna. Taxis are cheap so you're within striking distance of most Marrakech attractions from here. Stayed for a week on B&B though breakfast is a bit of a botched affair: every day the coffee machine broke while the buffet is beside the entrance which causes log jams every morning. Plenty places to grab b'fast elsewhere in the vicinity so I'd advice to take room only if possible.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Osei wrote a review Dec 2013,40,A very nice hotel,My friend & I stayed at the Opera Plaza at of the end of September this year. We went half board to make sure that we left the hotel to explore Marrakech. The hotel is located opposite the train station & about 20 minutes walk from the old city.    The breakfast buffet was lovely with plenty of choice. The bedroom & bathroom were well decorated with modern décor. The staff were friendly and attentive although the lady making pancakes in thge morning was a little rude. The pool area was clean & looked like it was recently decorated. There weren't that many loungers so I imagine it can get very busy at peak times. The pool bar was quite over priced as was the hotel bar. It cost the same for a lunchtime snack at the pool bar as it did for an evening meal at a local restaurant. The night time entertainment left a lot to be desired but that might have been because it was towards the end of the summer season. If it's like that all year round if recommend spending your evenings elsewhere.

On this trip to Morocco I saw quite a few hotels in Marrakech and Casablanca both staying in and popping in for drinks and I have to say The Opera Plaza is still my favourite well run with friendly efficient staff good food and a beautiful pool......I feel I have to be fair to future travellers here so I have to throw a but in at this point.  Not a big one but it is a but never the less. If I describe to you the pool it is fantastically big with a shallow end a paddling pool good size are for swimming lengths and a wonderful swim up bar. The pool itself is surrounded on all four sides by the Hotel. The Hotel is five stories high which means in the days of shorter sunshine the pool only gets the sun for a few short hours.  So you can find yourself sweltering in 30 degree heat and the pool is freezing.

Opera Plaza Hotel,VivienJane wrote a review Dec 2013,50,"Much, much better than we expected, but important to get the right room",The photos do not do this hotel justice. The public areas and pool are lovely and everywhere spotlessly clean. There seemed a permanent army of cleaners all of whom would look up to wish a cheery Bonjour. The room was spacious and well appointed.  Breakfast was excellent and beautifully presented and had everything for British tastes with exception of bacon.  We did not eat at the hotel but at Cafe Ayrz round the corner very fresh food and amazing value catering mainly to locals (turn right out of hotel right again after Planet Earth and follow the signs for cafe Ayrz 3 minute walk). You can get water and soft drinks very cheaply from the kiosk just outside the hotel just to the left 7 dirhams for a Coke as opposed to 30 from minibar!  Staff all very helpful and multilingual thank you in particular Z.F.  It is a very pleasant 25-30 minute walk to the Medina.  Two caveats the bath/shower is boxed in in a recessed tiled area which requires quite a bit of dexterity and concentration to get in and out. So if you have mobility issues you should ask if they have a room with a walk in shower. Also the bed was very firm great for us but some people like a soft bed. If you are sensitive to noise get a poolside view room at end of corridor.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Dorset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VivienJane

Opera Plaza Hotel,Jude42 wrote a review Dec 2013,50,"Lovely lunch by the pool,will stay here again.",We stayed here for three nights as part of a tour of the Imperial cities of Morocco. A really nice modern hotel. Large comfortable bedroom. Nice bathroom. Good thickfluffy towels.  Nice bar and lounge area. Dining room attractively laid out. Buffet good with plenty of choice and regularly replenished.  We had a lovely Moroccan salad for lunch one day at the Cafe by the pool.  Staff very pleasant and helpful. Free wifi.  The hotel is well situated about a 10min taxi ride to the big square Djemma el Fna and Souk. It is in the French district and is situated on a large tree lined boulevard  Our room faced onto the pool and had a balcony table and chairs. A really nice place to return to after a busy day sightseeing.

Opera Plaza Hotel,adrian1453 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,will visit this hotel again,This is a good quality hotel located in the heart of the French district of Marrakech with the old district about a half hour walk. The rooms are big and comfortable clean with nice beds. The hotel has a lovely inner courtyard with pool and plenty of space to relax either in or out of the sun. The restaurant is nice and the food very good with an emphasis on international cuisine. If you want local food you are spoiled for choice with the hundreds of restaurants in Marrakech. I found it a nice haven from the throbbing centre of old Marrakech. The staff our excellent and speak many languages. When I plan my next trip I will stay again.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Skeldergate wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Great staff,"We arrived in Marrakech by train. The Opera Plaza is opposite the station - 100 yards. It's 2 to 3 miles from the Medina and Souks.    Part of the hotel overlooks a couple of very busy roads. As we were only staying one night we thought we would be allocated one of these rooms.    However to our delight we had a room with a balcony overlooking the pool.    The hotel is furnished and decorated to a high standard. We felt like we were staying in a 5* hotel.    We dined in a restaurant next door after reading some reviews about food. This was about half the price of what the hotel was charging.    The pool area is very nice and we lounged around there for several hours on our day of departure.    The hotel has a room where you can store bags if you have a late flight. Latest check-out was mid-day.    Breakfast in every hotel is different. The Opera Plaza offered freshly cooked pancakes scrambled eggs croissants cereals etc.    We had a traumatic experience here which (logic dictates) we felt we may have been responsible for. I will not elaborate but the hotel staff (reception maintenance security and chambermaids) all handled really well and stayed after the ""going home time"" to help us out.",Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"York, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skeldergate

Good number of helpful staff available in various roles. Room overlooking pool was large and clean with small balcony with fridge but no hot drink facility. Decent bed etc but pillows were hopeless (stuffed too thick and no choice). Plenty of space in buffet dining area which accommodated numbers pretty well. Real disappointment was the poor hot food quality which was invariably lukewarm and then had to go on cold plates. Range of dishes and choice was good. Also reasonable choice of (deliberately) cold food.

The breakfast was plentiful and replenished quickly and often.

It's a slight walk to the Medina (about 30 minutes) but was nice to walk around the city.

The location is not great - it's at least a 20 minute walk to the souks but you can easily get a taxi for a couple of pounds. The hotel was spacious and clean and the staff were all very helpful. We never had to wait more than a few seconds for a lift. The pool area offers plenty of comfortable chairs and loungers and lots of them are in well shaded areas. Service at the poolside bar was excellent. The dining area can get a bit congested at peak times but hey you get the chance to brush up on your German or Italian ... or whatever. The choice and quality of food was good but really no better than that. Our room (suite would not be over-stating it) was truly sumptuous with everything very clean comfortable and functional. The rooms vary quite a bit in size and location however and we just struck lucky. Others in our group were less fortunate. If you want to know - we had room 220.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Rachel C wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Great hotel,Myself and my boyfriend spent a week at the Opera Plaza in June. It was very clean and modern nothing to complain about room wise either- big comfortable bed and great bathroom. Our room was overlooking the pool so was quiet and relaxing. I agree the staff in the hotel do not speak great English - we struggled to book a taxi or explain where we wanted to go but I expected that in Morocco. We ate in the hotel for the first 3 nights - wish we hadn't food is much cheaper when you go elsewhere. We also bought bottles of water from the newsagents in the station across the road. We booked 2 trips through the hotel which we really enjoyed. Overall we couldn't have asked for much more from our holiday would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Opera Plaza Hotel,JDB44R wrote a review Oct 2013,30,A tale of 2 hotels,Its difficult to summarise the hotel. The rooms are excellent with a lovely bathroom. The hotel is very clean the staff friendly and there's a great pool. The bar is also good although the live music was too loud for our choice. The main thing which let it down was the food in the buffet restaurant. The restaurant is too small for the size of hotel and the kitchen staff really struggled to make sure there was enough food for everyone which was often not the case. The wait for drinks is also excessive. After 3 evening meals we'd had enough and we went to the a la carte Morrocan restaurant. This was as different again. The food was excellent as was the service although it was a bit slow. It was a shame that we were the only one's in the restaurant. If the management could only sort out the buffet it would improve our rating to at least very good.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDB44R

Opera Plaza Hotel,cducklin wrote a review Sep 2013,20,"Clean Hotel, nice facilities, falls down on service & food.","We stayed here as part of a tour from the 15th - 18th September    The good points - The room was clean the minibar fridge was stocked and the hotel itself was clean. We had a room facing the pool so were kept out of the traffic noise. There appeared to be the use of a gym and there was free wi-fi as long as you were in the lobby.    The average - Although the room was clean the size was a bit on the small side although there was enough wardrobe space the room was too small for the low table and we had to keep moving the table and dodging our bags. The room could also have done with an extra power socket in order to charge things up without having to disconnect lamps. The aircon worked but was on the noisy side and the smell in the toilet was unpleasant (it smelt of cabbages).    The poor - The restaurant needs improvement on our first day there was a queue for large plates. The selection of savoury food was varied some local dishes some international dishes buffet style. (They do have other a la carte restaurants but we didn't try these as the buffet food was included in our holiday). The overall taste of the food I would classify as edible but nothing to praise about it it wasn't hot and the chicken was extremely dry. However the selection of desserts was nice. The breakfast selection wasn't much better and during our time there we weren't asked for a drinks order.    The bar - we were feeling a bit delicate and were chilling out in the bar and ordered a couple of teas - I wanted herbal my partner wanted Earl Grey (both were on the bar menu). Initially the barman said they only had the regular ""lipton tea"" and I walked away he soon came back with a selection box of teas. I asked for tea with milk for my partner and it came back made entirely of hot milk we sent it back again asking for a jug of milk and eventually got what we asked for at the third time of asking - although I then realised that my 'herbal tea' was also Earl Grey!    Although the room was clean the linen on the bed comprised of just a mattress protector with a duvet cover (no filling) on top and a sheet on top of that. There was no blanket in the room I went to reception to ask for a blanket that evening however nothing came. I had to ask again the next morning and eventually got one although that morning I also had to ask for towels as the dirty ones had been taken but not replaced.    The communal toilets on the ground floor did not appear to be monitored for supplies one evening there was no toilet paper in the toilets and the next morning upon visiting again the paper hadn't been restocked.    Although our stay was coloured by both me and my partner being ill (not the fault of the hotel) the hotel was very average and was let down by poor service and poor food.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Jan H wrote a review Sep 2013,30,Disappointed with stay Sept 11 - Sept 16 2013,My husband & I were looking forward to a week in Marrakech unfortunately we found the hotel staff to be rude and really not trained to provide a service. We arrived in our room to find the curtain track hanging off the wall and therefore we were unable to use the curtains. We reported this at reception on Wednesday evening 10th Sept again on Friday. Finally this was rectified on Sunday afternoon 15th Sept.  Food in the restaurant was extremely poor in that food was reproduced daily in another form to what it was the previous day. The restaurant opened for breakfast at 7am and again in the evening for dinner at 7.30pm. We very quickly realised that unless you arrived to the restaurant near to opening times that the supply of food ran out along with crockery and cutlery these were in short supply!  The hotel provided excellent evenings of music in the bar however the bar staff were not keen to serve drinks even if you went to the bar yourself more often than not we were ignored whilst the staff were talking amongst themselves.  The hotel was rated 4 star and I would agree that this rating is correct.

Opera Plaza Hotel,hIggsyNottingham wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Great Hotel Very Clean,We couldn't fault this hotel. We stayed here for a week 31st July - 7th August. We loved it the staff were helpful. We arrived early and the receptionist let us have breakfast in the Hotel and when we got back the room was ready this was approximately three hours early. This was unexpected but great news. We tried the moroccan restaurant the food was great but the service was typically laid back. We loved the international buffet my daughter said it was the best meal of the holiday.  Where the Hotel sits is ideal just away from the centre but taxis are always available 50 DM to the Medina. A quick tip don't stand at the side of the road as a Taxi will stop and ask if you need a lift. However if you start to walk towards the town centre and get a Taxi it will be cheaper than straight outside the hotel 20 DM to the Medina. The Pool bar was a great idea and the staff seamed to never stop cleaning it was always exceptionally clean.    Watching the traffic around the local roundabout was entertaining. It is not a place to wear hgh heels as the pavements had been dug up and not re-laid it was very unsturdy.

Great first impression with a fantastic pool really clean modern big room and a friendly concierge.    However the staff at the pool-side bar/restaurant were terrible. In particular the cocktail waiter who was actually aggressive. Shouting out that drinks were ready rather then bringing them over and giving short measures in cocktails and getting over defensive at any complaint.    Rest of the service was bad as well with unclean tables hour long waits for food in 1/4 full restaurant towel shortages...etc.    They also had a shortage of alcohol which meant beer was unavailable and you had to buy wine by the bottle.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Iain C wrote a review Aug 2013,30,Fine.,I would say first of all that this hotel is clean the pool is nice it is in a great location and it looks good.    I would then say that the staff were generally quite rude to us throughout our stay. And that is in direct contrast to the service we received in other restaurants and patisseries etc. throughout our stay. It might be fair to say that as this was during Ramadan a lot of the staff would have been suffering during the day but a few pleasantries wouldn't have gone amiss.    In absolutely no way is this a five star hotel it would be reaching to call it a four star hotel. A big part of being a 4/5 star hotel has to be the service and that is severely lacking. We tipped rather well for every meal as well and staff greeted us with the same lack of care any time we interacted with them.    But our room was clean the breakfast was fine (though I don't know why people are so excited about it again perhaps ours was not as good due to Ramadan.)    Perhaps they didn't like the look of us maybe they were just irritable but the attitude of the staff was such that I would be highly unlikely to return to that hotel. Some people at least said hello to us but that was about as far as it went.    Also we had to check back into our room because my girlfriend was very unwell on the day we were due to leave at the cost of 300 Dirhams which seems rather steep to me.    The lingering legacy of our stay in Marrakech was the rudeness of the staff. Which was particularly annoying given the care and research we put into respecting local customs and learning a bit of the language in order to get the most from our stay. Staff had zero interest in us beyond taking our money. Which is fine but they won't be getting any more of it.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iainc2013

I have only one criticism. We ate late at the buffet restaurant one evening. It cost about £24 per head + drinks. There was very little food left.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Fiona D wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Smoke & Mirrors,We stayed for 3 nights arrived to find the aircon in our room was broken and within 5 minutes it was 'repaired' however it was so weak we had to leave it on for our entire stay. The wash hand basin leaked badly & we got wet feet every time it was used. We complained to the evening receptionist (having had to interrupt him twice while he chatted to his friends) who insisted it had been repaired when we returned from dinner on our 1st night but it still hadn't been attended to when we checked out so our stay started badly. The towels in the bathroom were worn and rough. The bed was huge and comfortable but the sheets were too small. We were given one tiny sachet of shampoo between 2 people on our 2nd day. Despite there being at least 8 members of staff around the pool who saw us arrive we waited patiently for 15 minutes in the 37 degree heat before having to request towels. We were asked to pay for coffee by the pool immediately on receipt and requested that we pay when leaving as we were staying for the afternoon but the waiter insisted we pay in an aggressive manner so no tip given. Don't expect someone to take your cases or show you to your room. These admittedly sound petty but an accumulation of minor irritations make for unhappy guests. The positives - there was a barman at the pool bar who couldn't have been more attentive in a professional 4* hotel manner - a little nod and he was at your side. On our last night he went out of his way to get me a glass of white wine (it was Ramadan so drinks stocks were low) and allowed us to sign for drinks - it was a pleasure to tip him. The hotel pool is fabulous with comfortable loungers & huge parasols and unlike other pools in Marrakech is in the sun so you can sunbathe when it's too hot to walk around the city and it was never crowded. The hotel is spotless and the cleaning staff do an amazing job and greet you pleasantly. Breakfast was great - scrambled eggs cereals fruit pancakes & pastries so not repetitive fresh and delicious. In conclusion this hotel could be fantastic with a little more attention - treating guests as 'guests' retraining certain members of staff and less scrimping on the basics.,Date of stay: July 2013,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/47fionad

Opera Plaza Hotel,Pauline873 wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Clean value for money :),The Opera Plaza is a pleasant and well positioned Hotel. A friend and I stayed in Morocco for 2 weeks and used this hotel as a base. The train station and bus station are located across the street for the traveler who wants to see more.  It was soldto us as a 5 star hotel but realistically it is a decent 3/4 star.  The hotel is clean and well presented staff are friendly and willing to help. The concierge staff are always willing to advise and help you to make the most of your holiday they all speak good English and understand the needs of travelers in Morocco. Specifically Sabir who was most helpful with a cute smile and great knowledge of Marrakesh.  Our stay in the Opera Plaza was enjoyable and the shared pool with the red hotel was never overcrowded and was well kept.  The restaurants in the hotel are on the expensive side but there are many cafes and restaurants surrounding the hotel which are cheaper and very nice too.  Sadly we had no mini bar in the room for 14 days out of 15 but it is really the only flaw to mention.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Rameez H wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Really good but avoid some staff,I went on holiday with a few family members and thoroughly enjoyed the holiday.    Breakfast was brilliant however we tried the buffet one evening and we weren't very impressed with the selection of food available.    In terms of lounge around the pool it was great.. No need to reserve loungers however i would recommend going to the hit outside the hotel for snacks and drinks due to the extortionate prices at the bar. It would be ideal if you were all exclusive but we had the B&B package.    The staff are great however when we returned to the UK we found the staff very strange.. We became aware that some of the staff were over friendly throughout the stay especially Ousamma Nizha and Sabir... Be aware of the tax prices they charge at the end of your stay because we got charged and when returned to the UK we discovered we had already payed these when we booked the holiday... The three named staff members found us on Facebook and pretended to have accidents and were admitted in hospital and wanted our help by sending them money.    We shortly discovered that it was all a lie and a scam... Word of advise do not became friendly with them because they are con merchants and will try to scam you by acting overly friendly and polite.    Overall hotel location and room service was brilliant and we cannot complain about the cleanliness of the whole building as it was was sparking long throughout the day...    I have to give some credit to the man who worked around the pool... He was very attentive and did look after us by having towels ready and asked if we were ok throughout our 7 day stay..,Date of stay: June 2013,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RameezH15
Opera Plaza Hotel,Will M wrote a review Jul 2013,30,"Nice, clean hotel BUT...","If you're English and thinking of going here I would read this review/ rant.    I've just returned from a 4 day stay at this hotel. My girlfriend and I found it very clean with a very good sized 'standard' room. The pool area was nice with comfortable sun beds (although the padded matresses only came out on our last day which was strange). The main and VERY BIG problem with this hotel is the staff and their grasp of English which is almost non existent. I'm not exaggerating when I say this: we didn't come across one member of staff who we could have a full conversation with in English. When I say full conversation I mean things like booking a taxi or a resturant. For example - I asked if the clocks were going backwards or forwards the following day to which the reply was ""yes it will be open"" so I asked someone else the reply ""there will be signs everywhere tomorrow"" (no idea what that meant and there were no signs) I called reception later that evening to find out again from my room I was told I'd be called back with an answer no reply. This is just a small example of how bad it was. I also found one member quite agressive towards my girlfriend when she stated how she wanted to change a booking for a resturant he had made he almost took it personally. We found that the staff were not interested in helping us quickly for example - we would be invited to sit down at the desk we would begin asking a question and they would then pick up the phone and start a conversation after putting the phone down I would carry on with my question they would then start talking to a colleague and walk off we would then get passed onto another staff member and would have to being our question again this happened at least 4 times in just 4 days!There was one stand out receptionist named E. Sabir who was very friendly and at least tried to talk to us in a polite manner.    In short - it's a very nice hotel and it's very clean the pillows were like bricks and the bed was rock solid. The staff need to be trained to a 4* standard and learn how to deal with English people. I would also check out the Thai which was SO GOOD on both visits we were the only people there the sushi was perfect. The breakfast was also really nice get the pancakes!

Opera Plaza Hotel,mp14287 wrote a review Jul 2013,10,Avoid!!!!,Me and my wife chose this location as it looked special and we were on our one year wedding anniversary. Big mistake!!!  On arrival at check in I was requested to pay the city tax of 16.50 Dirhams per night for 7 nights (even though the hotel website confirms this is to be paid when checking out). This came to 231 Dirhams for the 2 of us for 7 nights. As we arrived at 11pm I did not have the currency and requested if I could pay in pounds. The check in staff (Mr Sabir) advised me that the conversion would result in cost of £30 if I paid in sterling. Luckily we convinced him that I will pay in the morning as I was tired and did not agree with his conversion. The currency exchange rate is approx. 13 dirhams to £1 so in effect the tax would have only been £17 so was very angry that an extra £13 was requested (guessing Mr Sabir was trying to rip me off).  Following this I confirmed what was included in Half Board as I had never travelled this way. Mr Sabir advised that breakfast and dinner were included alongside drinks. The first night we ordered drinks and were presented with a bill and we argued that we were told otherwise from the check in staff. Mr Hechim the catering manager told me it was not his problem as he was catering and check in were different even though they work for same hotel. During the complaint process I went to reception to resolve this alongside Mr Hechim and was insulted by the reception staff by saying he could not understand me as I was Indian even though English is my first language!!!  We also booked excursions through the hotel. We went to Cascade D' Ouzad which was amazing. Leaving at 7:30am and returning at 6pm. We were advised by reception (Mr Oussama) that this excursion included everything (food and drinks). Surprisingly no drinks were provided. Very annoying knowing we were lied to again. We returned to question Mr Oussama he told us that this is the case all over the world that excursions don’t include drinks. Not the case I'm afraid as I have been on many where drinks are very definitely included.  I would like to say we received very good service from Mr Hassan who was manager at breakfast and dinner on certain days.  Apart from the total lack of customer service the hotel was pleasant and in a good location.  This experience was very unpleasant and I would never return to Morocco again. Please avoid this hotel especially if you do not want to ruin your holiday.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mp14287
Opera Plaza Hotel,Anthony T wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Thin Walls,We stayed at this hotel during our Riviera Travel holiday to Marrakech and what a fine hotel it was too. However there were several problems but they were swiftly dealt with by the staff. This involved changing rooms twice because of noise from the road and from noisy people in the next room. The staff sorted this out until we were happy and comfortable.  It was a 20-min walk to the main square but taxis are cheap. We were picked up by the holiday coach.  Everything about the place seemed new and pristine – the room was superb with all facilities apart from tea and coffee. We knew about this and took our own kettle.  The food was excellent. Breakfast was amazing – tropical fruits meats even boiled and scrambled eggs and Moroccan crepes cooked while you wait. Dinner was even better with a choice of two meats and a fish. It was buffet style so you could eat as much as you wanted. Although it was traditional local cuisine nothing was too hot or spicy and we had a sumptuous meal every night. But – there’s always a ‘but’ – wine and beer was so expensive.  Sometimes little things let them down: running out of soup bowls bread and items from the buffet. You had to wait for a refill but this was always done with much apology. The staff members were well dressed attentive and almost courteous to a fault.  The pool guy did a great job and the water was so inviting (especially at 30 deg!) and by the pool there was a Bedouin tent where you could lounge on cushions and smoke a pretend bottle pipe – great for photos.  The evening entertainment was in the bar lounge and there was good and bad news. There was a great African solo singer and a fantastic authentic guitar group that played fabulous music. But there was no dance music or a place to dance which we have come to expect in places as big as this. So the evenings could have been better – not helped by the colossal price of a pint of Casablanca beer!,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Carlisle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonyuke

Opera Plaza Hotel,Nasseam K wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Excellent time,Fantastic hotel very clean and modern. Staff very helpful although not all of them had a good grasp of English but would find someone to assist. We were on bed and breakfast which was fresh and sufficient you must try the freshly made pancakes although you have to wait a while due to the demand but if you let the lady know how many you want she will bring them to the table. Never had lunch or dinner at the hotel looked a little pricey but if you go across the road to the train station you can't miss the McDonald's or KFC also Italian restaurant and gorgeous patisserie. Around the corner is a bank which had favourable exchange rate. There is free entry to Beirut nightclub but be mindful drinks expensive 2 sprites and 2 small bottles of water cost 300 drums would have been worth if entertainment was good but it was mediocre though don't tell the male singer who thought he was famous he sang his whole segment facing the musicians which led to his back to the audience.    Always got a sun-lounger no one was desperate to reserve with a towel. Enjoy your stay we did we were three females with high cleanliness expectations and we got that. On a final note enjoy the shower it was a hot torrent that left us buzzing and tingling. We will definitely go back again next year.    The soukhs were 10 minutes drive we took the smallest taxi which could be 20 dirhams but had to really haggle the price on return trip as they always wanted 50 dirhams but we managed to get it down to 30 dirhams.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Deb123072 wrote a review May 2013,50,Cannot Fault This Hotel,Stayed here four nights beautifull ambience and spotless. Gorgeous Morrocan shisha tent around the pool area with African singer to entertain you whilst relaxing with a coffee or cocktail.  Nothing too much trouble for the staff. Room cleaned every day and bed throw and my pyjamas arranged into flower designs. Had massage in the spa - very relaxing. Little tip dont let concierge hail you a taxi just walk over to the train station and they just pull up -don't pay any more than 30 or 40 dirhams to the square or Gardens Majorelle and we paid 60 to go back to airport (always agree price first) To be honest it's quite far to walk to the square and well worth the £3 taxi fare. Some people have commented that bath is an accident waiting to happen and very slippy - easy answer put towel on side of bath sit down and swing legs over to get out - common sense really!

Opera Plaza Hotel,John M wrote a review May 2013,40,"A good, modern hotel","This is a large modern hotel in the ""new"" part of Marrakech well away from the hustle and bustle of the medina. It's ideal if you want to explore the fascinating life of the old city during the day but then withdraw from the chaos at night. The hotel has a large variety of facilities such as bars restaurants a spa an open-air swimming pool and live entertainment. I booked a single room with breakfast and was given a spacious double room with a large built-in wardrobe a desk room safe and an attractive en suite bathroom. The room was clean and well kept with reliable daily room service. Breakfast was buffet style and provided an excellent choice of pastries bread cheese fruit yoghurt and hot food such as scrambled eggs and grilled tomatoes. The location next to the landmark railway station makes it easy to reach and the airport buses pass the hotel and will drop you off outside. There's also a plentiful selection of local buses that travel between the railway station and the central Place Foucauld next to Jemaa El Fna. Otherwise it's easy to get taxis. It probably takes about 30 minutes to walk to the central medina which can be an enjoyable stroll and will help to get your bearings. The hotel is especially good for first-time visitors who may not wish to risk booking a place within the confusing maze of streets and alleys which constitute much of the old city.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Keith M wrote a review May 2013,20,Worst recption and customer service ever!!!,If you expect even average customer service this hotel is not for you. Staff is way undertrained and their check in / recorded keeping process sucks....    If you need wifi in your room I would choose another hotel. 100 dh for wifi for one device and make sure you get a room close to a router or it wont work.    Very Nice hotel and rooms. I was staying at another hotel and wanted to move so I found Opera plaza on a site and wanted to give it a try. When I drove to the hotel there are two Operas right next to each other so I stayed in the wrong one for the first night. However it was a better than the opera plaza. When I walked over to stay in the newer Opera Plaza they guy told me it would be 750 a night but he was extremly busy as there was no one there help him out. After waiting 20 minutes to make my reservation I wrote down my information for him to do it later and left. Wehn I arrived the next day he never made the reservation and the lady was now charging me 900 dh. I also wanted wifi in my room which meant I had to pay 100 more dh. I tried to argue my point but was getting no where after an hour to check in I went to my room only to find out that they didn't give me the code of wifi so I went back down stairs and got the code. Then come to find out my room was right in the middle between two routers so the signal was weak and didnt work. You would think since I request wifi in my room they would give me one as close as possible. So after another hour of arguing for a new room I was able to get on the internet. The next day I decided to extend my stay for three days and they charged me 3000 dh to include wifi. However when I returned that night they did not give me wifi code and the internet guy was not there so I had no internet and spend an hour trying to figure out why when I paid for internet I did not have it. So the next evening when I returned the internet guy was there and I asked him to give me the code he said I had to pay. I explained I already paid but since I included it on my credit card they did not see the difference between room charge and wifi and therefore insist on charging me again. Then I also noted that they charged me 100 dh for the first night wifi that they expect me to pay upon check out. I argued with the manager who said I have to wait til the lady that checked me in comes back to sort it out. Like she is going to remember every detail about everyone she checked in. So as of now I am out 400 dh because this hotel does not have a staff trained.

Wi Fi available free in public areas. Restaurant comfortable and intimate offering standard buffet breakfast and very good evening cold/hot buffet. I staid here for three nights - double room very spacious with balcony overlooking pool area; very comfortable bed . Large bathroom - a bit too much wasted space. My complaint about the room was just little niggling things like not having enough hangers or hooks in bathroom and no drawer space. I do hope the hotel does something about their key-fob system which does not function as it should one would get to the bedroom door and be locked out and having to return to the reception to get the plastic card re activated - this went on every day and all guests seemed to be experiencing the same problem. If you are interested in modern architecture don't miss a visit to the Opera house opposite the hotel and the Marrakech Railway Railway Station on the opposite corner - stunning!.

However watching the lone policeman trying to control the mass of traffic including mopeds donkey's horse & carriages was entertaining especially when pedestrians tried to cross the road.  Only negative aspect was staff at reception always seemed busy & did not speak good English so organising taxis was hit & miss.  A great way to travel back to the hotel from the main square was by horse & carriage always negotiate a good deal. They never went same way twice so good way to see the city.

We stayed 3 nights on a half board basis. Our room overlooked the road but due to triple glazing we were not troubled by noise. The room was large with comfortable beds mini bar and large flat screened TV. Nice bathroom with plentiful supply of rather grey towels. The bath/shower is potentially very dangerous with a high step up to the bath and a wide surround. It required very careful management and to make matters worse the bath was slippery. A serious accident waiting to happen I suspect. Anyone with slight mobility/agility problems should avoid this hotel    Bar area was pleasant and a good selection of Morrocan wines available. The meal service for half board guests was totally chaotic and at times very stressful. There seemd to be no management and the staff were lacking in basic waiting skills and training. Shortage of cups shortage of glasses insufficient cutlery and slow service for every meal service. The same was true for the poolside bar. For an advertised 4* hotel their management and staff training is woeful.    Insufficient sun umbrella's around the lovely pool and one day it took me almost 45 minutes to obtain two pool towels!

When a friend complained to the restaurant manager about the tardiness she was told 'but madam you did not ask me'. The staff are just not trained properly.    The waste bins in the rooms were not emptied daily and the bath areas are potentially dangerous.

On this part of our trip we used this hotel as a convenient bed and breakfast as our days were taken up on long day trips into the mountains on one day and a train trip to Casablanca the next. The Breakfast was as good as anywhere in our opinion.  We had a lunch in the poolside restaurant on our last day and we could see what we guessed were the completed meals going cold on the side by the waiting staff while they were getting what appeared to be a training session on the tills.

One evening we got back late and decided to order a burger and dring from room service 90 minutes and about 4 frustrating phone conversations later they finally arrived with an apologetic manager.

Overall we were very satisfied with the services provided. Despite the fact that the first night the hotel was overbooked Sales Manager Wassima did offer an alternative hotel and she made sure we liked the room provided a lift back and forth and did offer a free dinner. She picked up next day with a driver and kept an eye on us during our stay in order to ensure that we have access to anything that we may possible require. We stayed on the 3rd floor (311) which is a room overlooking the pool. No problem with noise as other mention but we did come back to our room quite late. The location is pretty good as it take about 20 - 30 minute walk to the Medina or a 5 minute taxi ride ( 30 - 50 Dirham). The red tourist bus which goes all around Marrakech has a stop right infront of the hotel and you can buy a ticket from the driver. The breakfast was good with 2 ladies preparing fresh morrocean crepes (msemmen) and lots of other fresh baked sweets. Comparing to other staff in Morocco I would sincerely comment that Opera Plaza does pay attention to customer satisfaction. My recommendation when asking for something be polite and firm and set the right level of expectations. This will help you avoid any disappointments. In conclusion I did prefer Opera plaza to a Riyadh because of the space facilities (pool gym bowling 3 restaurants) and location.

Whilst being aesthetically pleasing spacious and clean I cant say I had an enjoyable experience at the Opera Plaza. The reception staff were exceptionally unhelpful and customer service in the bar and restaurant was appalling.    If you do decide to stay here I would strongly advise you not to eat at the hotel the food was about 4 times more expensive than local restaurants and the quality was poor. We had an awful experience in the Moroccan restaurant where we were made to feel like an inconvenience; waiting a very long time to see a menu then to order then for our food which was incredibly disappointing. The breakfast on the other hand was great especially the freshly made crepes!    During our stay we paid 300 dirhams for wifi in our room for 3 days. Unfortuantely neither myself or my partner could get it to work on our phones hotel reception told us they couldn't refund our money and that they would send an IT technician to help us solve the problem. He never came. They were equally unhelpful when we had a bottle of wine go missing from our room claiming that it was impossible that someone could have taken it.    It cant be argued that the rooms are lovely we had two twin beds which were the size of small doubles however both the bed and the pillows were incredibly uncomfortable. This combined with the lack of air conditioning with temperatures in the high 20s made for very sleepless nights.    On the plus side the location of the hotel is excellent if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the old city and is a short and easy taxi ride into the main square.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fbrown1807
Opera Plaza Hotel,JEL59 wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Good Hotel - Good Location,Stayed here for 6 nights 23 - 29 March and enjoyed every minute. Walking into the hotel smelt lovely with the scent distributed through the air con. Check in was a pleasure with the ever so helpful handsome man (whose name I didn't catch - sorry) he seated us down made us feel welcome and was amused at our request when we asked for our assigned pool view room be changed to a street view. The baggage boy showed us to our lovely spacious room which had two twin beds seating area plasma tv & mini bar the only drawback was that it had no tea & coffee facilities. The balcony had two double doors which kept any noise outside. There was no balcony furniture/seating but was quickly remedied when we asked The bathroom was also spacious but had no grab rail to enter the over the bath shower which was very high. Plenty of hot water clean towels but toiletries were disappointing consisting of 1 sachet of shampoo 1 showerwash sachet and a small bar of soap. Rooms were cleaned spotlessly every day.    Breakfast was nice hot & cold buffet pancakes tea coffee juices etc.    Morrocan Restaurant was lovely...didn't get to try the others.    Pool was really nice with comfortable sun loungers & seating areas fresh towels always available served by the wonderfuly efficient pool attendent and drinks served by the polite bar staff.    Reception staff helpful and Jawad (the nightshift guy) was a gem...    The staff were lovely but the bar lacked atmosphere and was pricy the live entertainment by the sound alike Gypsy Kings followed by Mark the soloist were Fantastic! and made up for it all. Both entertainment acts especially the Gypsy's were Great !!!!    Taxi's buses sightseeing bus all stop outside the hotel.    Coffee shops train station a few steps away. Supermarket 10 minute walk Medina approx 30 minute walk. Guelliz Bars restaurants 10 - 15 mins walk or 20 dirham in a taxi - Do not pay the 50 as suggested by hotel or the whopping prices by the taxi drivers. Hivernage 20/30 dirham.    Free wifi only available in the lobby & pool area - surcharge in room.    The hotel & staff here were really nice and attentive - I will certainly return.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Jo M wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Great holiday!,I stayed at the opera plaza for a week with my two daughters (20 & 22) for a week at the beginning of April. The holiday was organised by Thomson.  Our room was large and very comfortable - 2 double and 1 single bed. I think all the rooms have balconies with table & chairs; most face the pool which is beautifully lit up at night. The bathroom was huge- a word of warning about bath/shower- anyone with agility or mobility problems would have difficulty climbing in and out!  Useful reliable free safe in room; also minibar with space for a few of your own drinks. Kiosk selling drinks/water/crisps/choc just outside hotel.  Maids absolutely lovely room cleaned beautifully and towels/toiletries changed daily.  Pool area is spotless with charming pool attendant giving out towels and moving beds/parasols at your request.  Gym has 2 treadmills a cross-trainer a bike and a multigym- all newish and in good order. Gym very quiet (no attendant)  Large comfortable lobby area with free reliable wifi  Breakfast was brilliant- lots of fresh and dried fruit pastries cheese ham yogurts boiled and scrambled eggs.  While I was there I visited the spa and had a massage a little bit intimidating to be honest!  Close to train station but little noise heard.  Taxi to medina 40 dirhams 50 at night. Not much around in local area that we found.  All in all a peaceful restful haven from the craziness of Marrakech!,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Wirral, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G2274QDjom
Opera Plaza Hotel,Exilesman wrote a review Apr 2013,20,An awful hotel,Despite it's 4 star claim frankly I have stayed in more impressive Premier Inns.The sole raisond'etre of the hotel management is to cut costs and corners whilst squeezing as much money out of the guests as possible whilst being as unhelpful as they can. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room no iron available in the hotel nothing to open the drinks in the mini bar with.  The food in the International restaurant is truly appalling and the Asian restaurant has about half it's menu and wine list available.They were both reasonably busy the first night but empty after that  I wonder why that was the case? If you are thinking about booking this through Thomson don't bother because the Wi Fi is not free in the room and the air conditioning not available despite temperatures in the mid 20s.  Do not ask the reception staff for help as they are both elusive and economic with the truth and the manager is never available and also in on the act.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Shelley B. wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Very good hotel,Stayed with a large group for 4 nights (20-24th March 2013) through a short break arranged with Riviera. The hotel is very clean the staff is helpful and friendly. Most are very young and we had the feeling they were still “learning” but they try their best. Every possible option is covered for breakfast but evening meals at the Rossini were a bit samey and the main courses not always very hot. However there was always a vegetarian or fish option on offer.  Minor complaint: having to ask for extra shampoo/shower gel some days when having almost too much on others (different maid?).

Opera Plaza Hotel,silentcomplainer wrote a review Mar 2013,40,good clean hotel read on,stayed 15.3.13 - 22.3.13 the rooms were clean well kept the cleaning staff were excellent polite and entered daily no cause for complaint at all .The hotel is modern with a reasonable appointed pool area where you do not hear the surrounding traffic that will be audible outside all hotels  the location of the hotel is very good 35 minutes for an able tourist to walk to the main square  If you are less able then we haggled a cab to the square for 40 Drm .  My only complaint would be that our hotel key kept failing and we had to return on multiple occasions to reception and a dispute over the mini bar where at first they wanted to charge me for a drink which wasn't used when challenged a waiter beat me back to my room we agreed that no drink was used then when we checked out 2 hrs later they were trying to charge me for two further drinks make of that what you will.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Julia M wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Excellent location,This hotel is excellently placed for visiting Marrakech. It is a 25 minute walk from the centre and there are also plenty of taxis. We paid 80 dirham for a trip into the centre. The rooms are very comfortable and scrupulously clean. We had a balcony facing the theatre which also meant we had a wonderful view if the High Atlas mountains. At the moment there is a strike by some workers which affected the main dining room. Breakfast was fine but the evening buffet was mediocre and staff were stretched so on at least two occasions we were unable to order anything to drink. We felt that customer service in the evening could have been better but don't be put off as it is a very good centre for visiting Marrakech.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Weymouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuliaMWeymouth
Opera Plaza Hotel,Travel_queens_4 wrote a review Mar 2013,40,4 Lovely days in Marrekesh.,A group of friends stayed at Opera plaza in Early Feb 2013. Great hotel very central location Small taxi to main square and old town would cost about 70 Dihram. We loved the horse carriages and used to get to old town ( about 100 Dihram ).  We had a triple room and a double room. Triple room was large enough for three adults and did not at all feel cramped. Even the double room had two large beds as opposed to just a single double bed I have seen else where.  Breakfast at the hotel was very good. We never had dinner at the hotel although they do have several restaurants. Very easy to get taxis from airport to Hotel and Vice verse so no need to book expensive transfers. Airport to hotel after a bargaining is about 100 - 120 Dihrams.  Weather for early Feb - 2 days around 16 degrees Celsius. We were lucky to have the other two days at around 20 degrees. Marrakesh and Hotel Opera are lovely for a short break.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,united Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_queens_4

The manager was giving inflated prices on taxis that wernt true trying take advantage of our inexperience and when confronted just laughed. Obviously the hotel staff are supposed to make you feel welcome and enjoy your stay but we felt that the staff in this hotel were doing the opposite. They were no help full at all!!

Opera Plaza Hotel,HappyHeart2012 wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Beautiful Hotel but some snags,Stayed for one week. Booked with Thomsons. Industrial dispute still going on outside the hotel: apparently it was to do with the hotel wishing to change the way the catering staff were deployed. Sometimes there were 5 security guards with dark glasses outside the hotel - sort of disturbs the warm welcome expected. We had requested quiet poolside room but the pounding vibrations of the music which seemed to reach a crescendo around 5.30am lead us to seek a change of room after 3 days. (from disco next door? maybe??) Dealt with effectively but no apology or empathy! In our first room the flush on the toilet did not work and was not solved after a visit from the maintenance staff. In second room on top floor less disturbance from disco and toilet worked but juddering noise from the loud extraction fan was reduced (when help requested) but still did not cut out after reasonable time. Pool was far too cold to do anything than dip in a toe but was clean and looked very enticing. Rooms were kept spotlessly clean beds were extremely comfortable and staff all said Bonjour. Lights going off on the dim corridors were easy to cope with but not so convenient in the toilets!! Reception Staff/Management looked as though they were expecting people to complain all the time!! (Please smile a little??) Oh and morning coffee....the most important drink of the day.....was drinkable but only just. Really enjoyed the central location (next to the stunning Train Station Building) and the evening walk to find local restaurants 5 mins from bus station (trips to Essouaira - Comfort Bus leaves at 9 return bus 5) 10-15 mins to airport local buses to Medina 4Dh.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Jarves wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Fabulous Hotel,What a fabulous base this is for a holiday in Marrakech. Facing onto a busy street and ideally placed next to the train station inside the hotel is like a luxurious oasis of calm amid the happy chaos of the city. Staff are very friendly and helpful everywhere is spotless and service second to none. Before going we'd read a comment that breakfast was poor. All I can say is that the breakfasts we had were superb with loads of choice including the scrumptious Morroccan crepes made to order in the dining room and delivered hot to your table. When the hotel was very busy overspill dining was in a Berber tent erected by the pool and was a real experience. There is a lovely pool and pool bar for lazy days and the temperature was warm enough for bikinis and sunbathing even in January. I have to mention the staff again because during our trip my husband was unfortunately taken ill. The receptionist called out a doctor on a Sunday who drove an hour round trip was absolutely excellent and only charged us £40 though in fact the medication he prescribed was priceless to us because it meant my husband could enjoy the rest of the holiday pain free.  We cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and would certainly return without hesitation.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,English Lake District,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jarves

Opera Plaza Hotel,jprOxfordshire_Uk wrote a review Feb 2013,30,Short break,Booked with Thomsons for four nights for four of us. Taxi transfer was included in price of holiday and on arrival were taken to hotel (only a 10 min trip). Check in was a bit slow. Two of us had a poolside room and the other two had a room overlooking the (very busy) road. Although interesting to look at manic drivers on the roundabout it was quite noisy with the windows open. Try and get a poolside room if you can. The environment of the hotel is quite quiet and calm and very spacious. The poolside is very pleasant and everything spotlessly clean. Rooms were a good size and bathrooms also modern and good size (although a bit of a step up and over into the bath and shower!). Music round the pool drove us bonkers (heard winds of change about 50 times!). Had some drinks in the hotel but my advice is take some duty free - there is a kiosk outside the hotel selling tonic water coke etc and bottles of water at reasonable price and a fridge in the room. We had a fantastic trip which we booked with 4x4 Camel with Adil. Cannot recommend this highly enough - see my review. His email is adil.camel@gmail.com and we organised this before coming to Marrakesh. He communicates back very quickly and efficiently and kept to his word to pick us up at hotel as planned. You will not regret booking this - highlight of our trip. All in all a good break. We struggled with the very busy roads and manicness of Marrakesh at times and wish we had done more outside of the city such as the 4x4 trip.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wantage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jprOxfordshire_Uk

Opera Plaza Hotel,holidaymaddd wrote a review Feb 2013,10,"Worst Service Ever and ""Held Hostage"" over dates on Booking Voucher","We stayed for one night in this hotel and in terms of service this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. As I explain below we were not allowed to leave the hotel (a guard blocked the exit) because although we had paid the dates on the booking voucher had to be updated and the hotel did not want us to leave the hotel because Travel Republic had not given us a new voucher with different dates.    There were some good points.  1. The location is opposite the train station so if you are arriving or leaving by train the location is good.  2. The pool area is nice.  3. The rooms are fairly nice (however see below).  4. It is a fairly inexpensive hotel.  5. Due to an extra night in Marrakech (we could not get to Fez due to snow in Paris) the hotel was able to price match for the first night the price we paid for the second night.    However these were far outweighed by some very serious failings:  1. As a minor point we stayed on the fifth floor and the lights in the corridor were not on constant. You would exit the lift in pitch darkness and would be guided to a lit up switch about 10 metres away. In addition the corridors in the floor we stayed in were very shabby.    2. The room we were given had a large hole in the carpet. To compound matters the bell boy did not seem to understand why there was an issue. However to be fair after a small amount of hassle we were able to switch rooms.    3. I had called up the hotel before the stay and asked if we could use the kitchen freezer for our food and a microwave (we have a special diet and bring meals with us). The receptionist on the phone said that this is not a problem. When we arrived in the hotel during check in I mentioned that we required the use of the freezer and a microwave and we were told by the receptionist that this is not a problem. However 30 minutes later (by now this is 10.30pm) when I came downstairs to out our food in the freezer and after waiting for over an hour (our request had to be passed to the kitchen and the head chef) we were told that we cannot use the kitchen freezer. At 11.30pm we were told we also cannot use the kitchen microwave to heat up some food ""because we are not a business"". We had a nightmare arriving to Morocco (serious delays due to snow) and we had not eaten a proper meal all day. At 11.45pm I spotted another receptionist who said that the kitchen freezer ""is broken"" but he was able to arrange a microwave in 5 minutes for us to use. We had to stand outside in the cold to warm up our food - despite the fact that at 11pm (and possibly later) the kitchen staff were in the hotel and were happily relaxing in the kitchen (we checked).    4. The main receptionist who we dealt with (I think he was called Jawal but I am not sure) was extremely rude. In desperation when the receptionist told us that we cannot use the kitchen freezer (and as a result our food would spoil) I offered to pay some money to him to help us. He said and I quote ""do you think that I am an Arab and I only care about money and I only help because you give me money"". In addition he repeatedly ignored us. What was so unbelievable about this is that when I explained what had happened to the head manager the next morning her reaction was ""why did you not put the food in the freezer?"". Clearly there is a serious communication issue amongst the staff in the hotel.    5. The next morning we were understandably very upset at the way were treated. We wanted to check out of the hotel. After waiting in the lobby for 1.5 hours to speak to the head manager we explained what had happened and we wanted to check out. We had always planned to stay the second night and we had booked online in the UK with Travel Republic (I highly rate them). We therefore wanted the hotel to use our booking for the second night to pay for the first night. The manager at this point was very helpful and said that is fine but she asked us to change the dates on the booking voucher from Travel Republic. We agreed to ask Travel Republic to change the dates. We gathered our luggage and were about to exit the hotel when the head manager said that we cannot leave because we have not changed the dates on the voucher. At this point she walked off. I explained to someone else in the management that Travel Republic are a big company and they can take a couple of days to come back with a response. I could not understand what the fuss was about because the money was paid what difference would the dates on the voucher make anyway?!    6. I agreed with the assistant manager (or equivalent) that as a compromise I would send an email to Travel Republic there and then and the hotel management could see me doing this. After this was done we tried to leave but we were told that we were not allowed to leave until the head manager comes back. By now I was getting a little annoyed it was 12pm and my whole day was being delayed because of this circus act. I tried to leave but a GUARD MOVED TO THE FRONT DOOR AND WOULD NOT LET US LEAVE all because there was no confirmation email from Travel Republic that the dates on the voucher can be changed. At this point we were BEING HELD PRISONER IN THE HOTEL. The hotel management were frantically trying to find the hotel manager but she could not be located. We were standing by the door and the guard would not let us leave. After about 15 minutes I said to the hotel management that I am leaving in 5 minutes unless the head manager could be located. He agreed that in 5 minutes we could leave if the head manager could not be found. Predictably after 5 minutes the head manager could still not be found. I started ""making a scene"" in order to pressurise the management to let us out. At this point other guests started to notice what was going on. At this point as they had no choice the management let us leave the hotel.    7. When the updated voucher arrived from Travel Republic I forwarded it to the hotel. I did not receive a response but then again I did not expect to.",Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holidaymaddd
Opera Plaza Hotel,PromeneurSolitaire wrote a review Jan 2013,40,"Good hotel, let down by some details",A very good hotel with great breakfast attentive staff very good restaurants (especially the Japanese-Thai restaurant was a nice surprise and we ended up eating there twice incredibly good value and we were waited by one of the best waiters in Morocco) free on the spot parking and a decent spa. Unlike many other places in Morocco they also had a high chair (baby chair) so we had a bit of comfort during meals. Rooms are also very big clean and beds very comfortable so if you are growing a bit uncomfortable after a few riad stays (we were) this will be a nice change. On request we also had a good baby bed in our room which can be rare in Morocco.    However it is also lacking in some important details: I didn't like the custom of paying for the rooms in advance and the empty plain fridge in the room it gave the impression that the hotel is not trusting its guests. In addition although the rooms were nice many of the corridors (and public toilets) were dark a bit neglected and still lighted by timed switches (what's wrong with photocells?) Finally the wifi in the rooms was expensive (free wifi in the lobby and restaurants though). Overall not enough to spoil the experience still recommended but some things can be improved.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Istanbul, Türkiye",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PromeneurSolitaire

The location is fantastic in between the old and the new towns of Marrakech and near to the rail station. The rooms are spacious scrupulously clean and the staff are very helpful. There are three restaurants in the hotel. The Moroccan one worth a visit the Thai a bit expensive (but good food) but didn't try the third. The breakfast is actually very good a combination of continental Moroccan and western but the latter is not ' a big English '. Make sure you visit the Renaissance Hotel - great views and good food at a good price the Azar (Middle Eastern) and the one near to The Renaissance that is run by women. We went to The Atlas Mountains with Legendes Evasions - you get a 4 x 4 with driver at a little more money than for two people going on the tour company trip. But you choose where to go stop and have a great lunch.

We thought the hotel was good value for money and located in a safe convenient part of Marrakech especially for first time visitors. The lobby and lounge areas were immaculate and the lounge staff in particular very friendly and helpful. The restaurants were a little overpriced and not great but we ate out most of our stay which was much more exciting but the breakfast that was included was perfectly adequate with plenty of choice and as much as anyone could eat. The room was very clean and plenty of space with a large bathroom. There were three lifts servicing the hotel so never a problem waiting. After a lond day sightseeing I always felt comfortable coming back here at the end of the day. We thought Marrakech was a wonderful city with lots to do and wonderful restaurants if you do your research. We particularly liked Al Fassia restaurant located in the new town not too far from the hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel for the first time traveller to Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Crowborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82LAW
Opera Plaza Hotel,Amy c wrote a review Jan 2013,40,can't fault this hotel,We have just got back from 4 nights in this hotel and could not have asked for a better stay! Lovely clean and spacious rooms were perfect hideaway from the craziness of the medina.    The only fault I can think of is that we were short changed a few times by hotel stay (this seems to be a trend throughout Marrakech) so count your change carefully! Drinks are expensive as expected in the hotel but the supermarket is a 10 minute walk away.    The breakfast was good with plenty of choice of fresh fruits cereals and bread/cheese/ham..you can ask for mint tea to be to order at no extra charge. wifi is available but only in the reception/poolside and towels are provided for you for sunbeds so no need to take a towel down to the pool.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/342amyc
Opera Plaza Hotel,Sarah B wrote a review Jan 2013,30,A 3-star hotel really,Although its said to be 4-star the Opera Plaza is not what anyone would think of as a 4-star Hotel. For example: we arrived and despite having specifically booked & paid for a pool-side room we were shown into a street-side room -- and the street was very busy & noisy; the ensuite in our room wasn't well finished--you could see behind the facades!; there wasn't ever enough shower gel or shampoo for 1 much less 2 people; you couldn't make phone calls from the room other than to reception despite advice to 'dial 9 for outside line' sometimes there were no towels left for us etc etc. Having said that it doesn't charge a 4-star price either and the staff were friendly and helpful (for example helping us to rent a car at good price) and the place was clean and in a good location -- just opposite the train station -- where taxis could find it as they all know the station.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bridport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/121SarahB121
Opera Plaza Hotel,Lisa8232 wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Best Smelling Hotel I've Ever Been To!,This hotel only recently opened and you can really tell that a great deal of thought has gone into the decor which is both modern and traditionally Moroccan. They must have some kind of clever perfume system because the lobby smelt amazing! The rooms were clean large and comfortable. The breakfast was nice. The pool looked amazing but we visited in December so it was too cold to swim.    The hotel is not located near the medina you need to get a 5 minute taxi there (or it is a half hour walk). However the area is very modern clean and I felt safe walking along the street and it was nice to go from the noisy hustle and bustle back to such a restful and quite haven after a long day of sight seeing.    There were a few small issues that needed to be improved. We had a double bed but only one pillow between us and had to ask several times for a second one. There was no hair dryer in the room which we also had to inquire about several times before being advised late at night on our second day that we were to change rooms which we did not want to do as we were all unpacked and we did not want to re-pack and unpack again! So I coped without a hair drier for a few days. Also there was a mini fridge which was empty it would have been good to have some bottled water as you cannot drink the tap water and there was no safe. All these issues are small and can easily be resolved.    All in all this hotel is very nice and I would recommend it to a friend.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisa8232

Very clean large rooms and large bathrooms. My father had a room on the front of the hotel facing the Opera House which was a busy junction but he didn't have an issue with noise becuase the rooms have two separate sets of patio doors which block all noise. My room was facing the pool but I actually prefered my fathers view as it was more interesting. We were half board the breakfast was enough choice we loved the berber pancakes which were freshly made in the dining room.

The toilets have all amenities but the bath tub needs to have a handle as it is on higher platform. The hotel has live entertainment show in the evening.

Opera Plaza Hotel,xhattiex wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Amazing!,My mum and I stayed at the hotel last week and we were very happy with our choice. As soon as we arrived you could see the attention to detail lanterns in foyer and a doorman to help with us with our cases also on departure the doorman hailed us a taxi for a very good price. All staff were helpful and courteous but also discreet. On our final night we sat by the pool where they light the lanterns and put out leather poufs and lay out rugs to give you a very Moroccan experience. Breakfast was a continental buffet freshly cooked pancakes were also available on request which was a nice touch. We didn't use the restaurants a there are also plenty of places nearby where you can eat. There is entertainment in the lounge each night which consisted of traditional Moroccan singers. The Jamma el Fna is about a 2 mile walk away and took us about 30 mins to get there. It was also relatively central to the saadien tombs and majorelle gardens. The bedroom was spacious clean and there was no traffic noise disturbing us. After the hustle an bustle of the old town it was to return to the serenity and luxury of the opera plaza each evening and we would not hesitate to return.,Date of stay: November 2012,,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xhattiex

We were transferred to a twin bedroom the following night the room was also nice with working zircon but the glass shower enclosure was missing so water would flood the toilet floors. Another problem was the breakfast the buffet was very sparse and they were not ready even at 7 am when they open the breads and eggs would come out at 715 or later but the waiters were ok did not speak English at all.

The staff is very friendly and serivceminded. Spacious rooms with huge beds and a fridge. Very quiete at night if you prefer a good sleep better than the noise around the Medina. Balcony with view to the nice swimmingpool. The pool was rather cold at this time of the year in the end of October as the weather also was partly cloudy. The breakfast is Morrocan inspired so take it for what it is you are in Marocco :-) It's easy to get a taxi outside the hotel which is hardly recomanded insted of crossing too many of those crazy streets when you want to look around. When you get to the Medina take a ""hores and carriage"" safe and exciting about 45 min but try your best to get the price down to 100 dirham. Choose this hotel in ""the new town"" better than ""old town"" close to El Jemaa El Fna Medina. And don't eat in the Medina. It's expensive and you will not taste the real nice Moroccan food.

Great value. A hearty breakfast was available in the deal. The bar had live music although it lacked atmosphere. However the hotel excelled because it was in the new part of town by the station.  Day trips were easy to organise and the walk to the Medina was but a good fifteen stroll. The hotel had friendly staff and was very clean. Well managed. it was a little strange there was no tourist material available in the hotel for tourists to read so you need to ask reception and they are very helpful indeed one leant us her guide book for a few days !

Quite far from medina, breakfast isn't great.",You can get a bus from the airport to the hotel for 40 dhirams - it isnt far. The hotel is modern apparently one year old. Has all the amenities a great pool nice lounging areas nice bar. Staff are friendly. The only thing I would say is that breakfast is very limited and repetitive. Glad we didn't stay half board.    Quite far to the medina we walked the first day and it took 30 mins at least. You should be able to get a taxi for 25 dhirams. Don't pay more than 35 though! Eat in the medina for lunch and or dinner. So cheap and very good food.    If you like clubbing silver was great on Friday night but be aware every single local chick in there is a prostitute without exaggeration.

Our final two days we laid by the pool is very nice with a snack bar and architecture inspired by modern straight lines.    Some tool took my bag at the airport leaving an almost identical one and on arrival the hotel helped us ring their Riad and locate him. The staff are helpful and friendly.    They have an excellently buffet restaurant by the pool which changes cuisine every night. It is reasonably priced for a hotel and being in the new town is located near a lot of nice restaurants.

Opera Plaza Hotel,Gerry J wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Great Hotel,I had some concerns about this hotel after reading the reviews but I was more than pleasantly surprised. It is located in an excellent part of the new city central for most of the key attractions or only a short taxi ride from such areas as Jamaa El Fna one of the largest Souks I have ever seen. There are numerous options on dining inside and outside the hotel with the train station which is across the road but cannot be heard at all from the hotel having a mix of McDonalds Kentucky Fried Chicken or traditional Maroccan cuisine.    The staff were exceptionally helpful. We had a small problem with our room so the manager immediately upgraded us and offered several options on where in the hotel and which floor we would like to be located. The cleanliness was very good and considerably better than many hotels I have used in the UK. Breakfast is continental but you can eat all you want. There are several restaurants within the hotel all of which were very good value for money and good quality.    The pool was cleaned religiously every day and there were very few occasions when there were no sun loungers available. The pool is large and is a sun trap throughout the day. Towels are provided free of charge.    There is a small fridge in each room which is very useful for the obligatory bottled water. The satellite TV stations are predominently in either French or Arabic but the BBC world channel is available together with Fox movies which transmits the latest fils 24 hours a day.    I would suggest that if you visit Marrakech ensure that you have a French translation book if you do not speak the language. As is often the case the locals spoke English far better than I spoke French but there was never any resentment by the shops pubs or hotel staff due to my inedequacy with the language.    Wifi is availbale for free in the lobby which is spacious and has an ample amount of seating. You have to pay if you want to use this facility in your room but it is a very small amount of money. I quite liked using the lobby to check emails as it stopped me constantly checking in my room. The connection worked on every occasion so I am not sure why other people commented that they had difficulty with this issue?    My wife and I like to walk to see many of the points of interest and this is certainly possible from the hotel. Coffee shops abound around the area and are great for people watching. The police have a considerable presence and at no time did I feel unsafe. However haggle with the taxi drivers as they will definitely try to overcharge and never use a cab from outside any of the hotels as they know you are a tourist and will try to take you anywhere but your destination.    To conclude. I would give this hotel five stars esprcially after having heard some of the calamities some of my fellow travellers had suffered at their accommodation.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Plymouth, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GerryJ235

It was about 45 degrees celsius the days we were there and the air conditioning didn't cool as much as we had hoped though it was definitely much better than being outside. The pool is very nice.    2 minor complaints: the music played by the pool is really awful. One song that kept replaying is still running through my head 3 weeks after staying at the hotel: ""Let's do that thing Baby baby can we do that thing. I thought you said that we could do that thing."" The music is really about the worst that I've ever heard.    A more significant complaint is that I became trapped in the bathroom by the breakfast area one morning -- although I could unlock the lock the door to the stall wouldn't open no matter how hard I tried. I ended up banging on the door and yelling at the top of my lungs for someone to come and get me out. After a few minutes a maid came in but wasn't able to get the door open. She didn't speak English and just left without trying to tell me anything which was a bit disturbing. A few minutes later she returned with another employee who used a butter knife from the restaurant and pried the door open. The disturbing thing is that they never closed off the stall and I doubt those that helped me get out ever notified maintenance of the problem.

The room are quite big with a big bathroom bath tube and bidet air conditioned of course.  You can also reserve a guide for the Medina it's extremely necessary go there with a guide because going by yourself can transform your vacation in a nightmare.  There are 3 restaurant the Morrocan one is very good and you can enjoy dinner around the swimming pool.
