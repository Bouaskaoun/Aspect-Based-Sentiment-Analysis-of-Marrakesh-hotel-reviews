Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Kajol M wrote a review Mar 17,50,Great experience,The experience of this hotel was very good. The hotel was located near by to a lot of things to do in Marrakech. The poolside was so fun as the workers ensured everyone had a great time. We got a balcony room which was lovely. Only issue was that there was no aircon in the room and was very warm. And it was quite hard to locate an iron. But overall great experience.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kajolm858
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Onesexychic wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Great hotel in a superb location with the best staff!,This was my first visit to Marrakech and I had a hard time deciding between staying in a riad or hotel. As we're travelling with young teenagers we decided a hotel with waterpark would be best. Labranda ticked all the boxes. Waterpark great location and decent price. We arrived at the hotel at 11am but our room wasn't yet available. We were given our all inclusive wristbands and went to the bar to have some drinks until lunch began at 12:30. There were Moroccan dishes as well as pastas rice various meats a large varied salad and dessert section. There was also a grilling station. You will definitely not struggle to find something to eat. Breakfast has the usual fare and also an omelette station. Dinner is especially good and there is also an Italian restaurant which you need to pre-book a day before. There's a Moroccan restaurant on site but that was closed at the time of my visit.    There is nightly entertainment at the pool bar and live music in the Italian restaurant. The animation team also puts on a show in the conference center area.    The waterpark has two areas..one for smaller kids and the other section with larger slides. There is definitely enough to keep all ages entertained.    Rooms were spacious and contained a mini fridge. If there is none in your room please let reception know and they'll have it sorted.    The hotel is located 10 mins walk from Menara Mall and 20 mins was from Carre Eden Mall. It is in the perfect location.    Finally the staff of this hotel are really the standouts. Every single staff member was friendly and always willing to help. Special thanks to Bahija in the restaurant for always saving a table for my family at breakfast and dinner. Special mention to Zacharia the lovely young lady in the Italian restaurant the porter who's worked at the hotel for over 30 years the man who collects the tourist tax and last but not least the Manager. Thank you for making our first stay in Morocco indeed memorable and we will most definitely be back.,Date of stay: October 2021,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karissa2000

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,dominic s wrote a review Mar 16,40,Nice couples holiday.,Hotel facilities:    2 lovely pools with different vibes depending on what your after 1 pool where all activities take place with 5 water slides and a kids section music ping pong darts ect bar at pool side also. Other pool is lovely to relax with big day beds available to rent for the day for about ¬£4. Plenty of sun lounges.    Rooms:    The hotel rooms are very nicely decorated with a typical Moroccan decor shower is a nice walk in shower. But unfortunately the hotel room was a downfall during our stay the mattresses are super hard and not comfy at all. No balcony's and also very warm as a/c not the best.    Food/restaurants:    The food at the hotel main restaurant was faultless choices was small but nice only downfall is you won't find fries burgers ect but that did not bother us as we are not fussy eaters if you are you might struggle but we found the food very nice. We was really surprised when we found 2 more el carte style restaurants on the site these where Italian and traditional Moroccan both very nice and free of charge which was great! You can use Italian as much and Moroccan only once during your stay but you must reserve 24 hour before.    There is a snack bar but you have to pay which we though was a bit strange as we was all inclusive üëé    Alcohol/drinks:    Beer is from a bottle which is good. All cocktails and spirits was local branded average drinks.    Wine was okay üëå.    There is a piano bar with premium drinks but you have to pay.    Location :    Location of hotel is very good only a short 5 min taxi into the city some nice sky bars about 10min walk away which is defiantly worth a visit.    Overall for the price we paid we was more than happy with the hotel. Very clean nice food service was okay but hard of English most of the staff but helpful enough. Would recommend hotel. Only down side is the beds and snack bar.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352dominics
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,garryb801 wrote a review Mar 12,40,"Great positioned hotel , Definitely NOT 4 star !",where to start with this one ... we went to Marrakesh 3 years ago just before lockdown it wasn't the best experience so when we went back this time we thought we would try all inclusive  not the best idea with this hotel as most days the same food was served morning  noon and night ! this being said we always found some thing to eat . The restaurant staff needed a good shake some days  NO cups  No plates  Food not out quick enough and some times food running out . Some of the staff could do with a few lessons in manners ... even a smile would not go a miss !!    We thought all inclusive was all food only to be told AFTER we had ordered and eaten our pool snack that we then had to pay for them  so watch out for this if your kids want a burger why in the pool ... No ice cream .... REALLY ? We ended up at the little shop next door for ice lollys .    The entertainment team we brilliant lead by Reda and Simo these two and there team kept us entertained along with the bar men . The beer is sh1t so if you like a nice beer then try the wine    watch out for scams out side the hotel we actually had one of the waiters ( who had never spoken to us in the hotel) confront us in the street telling us he could get us oils which we didn't want ! he wasn't happy and started saying we didn't want to help handicapped people as all the proceeds from the oil went to these people ....which i found VERY offensive so just beware    The bedrooms were clean and we had our beds and towels changed every day by the lovely cleaners .    The hotel was full when we was there so some things can be excused and after all is said and done we would defo go back to this hotel .,Date of stay: March 2023,,"St Helens, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garryb801
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Rezana A wrote a review Mar 8,10,LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS AND AVOID AT ALL COST,The WORST hotel I have ever stayed at and believe me when I say avoid it. Listen to the low reviews I did not and went by the majority and it really was the worst experience ever. love holiday advertised that ALL ROOMS HAVE A BALCONY/PATIO - this is a lie. It is falsely advertised. We did not get a balcony. We booked a double room and it was two single beds how was my baby soposed to sleep in the middle?? They had to Change our room 3 times to only notice BIG VOMIT STAIN which was textured so it definitely wasn‚Äôt a stain that had been washed but stained - THEY LITERALLY GAVE US USED BEDSHEETS!! and the worst thing is we had to wait around 1 hour to get new ones and it was late and my baby was super tired! There was a broken chair which my son nearly fell over - clearly they don‚Äôt care about hazards. We had to pay for indoor pool and indoor bar although we paid for all inclusive - apparently it doesn‚Äôt mean everything is included! But somehow some people were not paying for indoor people but we were!? We also witnessed the kitchen staff picking up food from the FLOOR and putting it back as if it was normal practice!! They serve the same food every day and it was horrible. We paid for an all inclusive but could not eat there once! They told us it‚Äôs a 4 star hotel - it really was like a 2 star! The last night the night staff - short grey hair I think his name was Asir or something - super rude and when he did not acknowledge us waiting to be seen his only response was ‚Äúwell complain about me tomorrow then!?‚Äù With the most aggressive tone like he knew he wouldn‚Äôt get in trouble. He caused a fight with us and it was really unprofessional. He only spoke to those who could speak French and Arabic. I feel like most of these reviews are the same and have had the same problem so avoid at all costs. I really regret not listening as it was the worst time what a disgusting hotel. They don‚Äôt care about you complaining either.,Date of stay: March 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rezanaa2023

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Myrke70 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Topvakantie en aanrader,We left without any expectations for LABRANDA ROSE in Marrakesh.  The arrival and welcome was done in a professional and friendly way by the people of meeting point. The location is very central and cabs were at the door. Room was very spacious and clean. Nothing to criticize other than the fact that I did miss a balcony.  More than enough variety regarding food. It was always of good quality and well prepared. Staff at the reception bar cleaning and restaurant were helpful and friendly. An extra big compliment to Mustapha from the outdoor bar who was always happy to help.  The animation team was made up of pleasant people always ready for a chat and help when needed.  They were super friendly and nice to deal with.  The dancing and game nights as well as the cocktail games were a success. These were presented by Reda with the necessary professionalism and humor. Reda also spoke sufficient English. He was a very pleasant personality. Making mint tea and Tajine was also a great activity to learn more about it. Kenza was very popular as a kids entertainer and even in the evening she was still dancing with children. She is a super sweet girl. Shakir was the DJ on duty and always did his job with a smile as did Simo who along with Kenza got the dances going every night. In short a pleasant team that deserves a big compliment.  I would definitely recommend Labranda Rose to friends  If I could give the hotel a point to work with it would be a little more attention to non-French speaking guests but I am a satisfied customer who will definitely return.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Turnhout, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Myrke70
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,54m15 wrote a review Feb 2023,10,"THIEVES, LIARS AND INCOMPETENT STAFF",If you want to be ripped off lied to and discriminated against then this hotel is the right one for you. I have just come back from the worst hotel experience ever from the most rude inconsiderate and unhelpful staff ever and can honestly say its the first time I've been to a hotel where the bad reviews have been 100% accurate unless you're French. The only reason I say this is because it is crystal clear that the hotel is catered towards the French as they had proper greetings with guided tours on their arrivals. Me and my friends however did not on arrival we were asked to fill in a form and asked to borrow a pen to which the little old man behind the reception desk who works there during the day simply responded 'No.' During the day there are two male receptionists and any simple request given to them their answer was always no.    On the first night I asked the gentleman with the glasses behind the reception desk if I could borrow an iron he went to ask another receptionist and came back with 'no you have to pay for laundry service.' This was definitely a lie as I saw other guests requesting irons and getting given them. I asked again on the second day but again the answer was no. On the third day I went to ask again in the evening when the daytime make receptionists were gone and Houda arranged for an iron to be sent to my room in a matter of seconds. I also asked if she could use book us a table at the famous 555 club in marrakech she sorted this out in seconds. She is the only member of staff that tries her best to please customers. Thank you Houda.    This hotel also falsely advertises its service we paid for all inclusive but you have to pay extra to use the indoor pool or the aqua park. The pool next to the outdoor bar is like a freezer and impossible to swim in. It does not say anywhere on their website that you have to pay extra for the indoor pool.    On the last day it came to our attention that we had to have boarding passes printed as per the airport guidelines so I went down ro reception and asked the little old man working behind reception at daytime if he can print it for us he flatly refused and lied to me telling me that the reception printer was broken when it definitely was not as i saw it being used and he directed me to the concierge Mohamed who works for meeting point so I went and he was going to charge me 80 dirhams to print 4 boarding passes. I told him that this is extortionate and was not happy with his attitude. He then told me that it would cost me ¬£200 at the airport and that he was doing me a favour by only charging me 80 dirhams. Frustrated with his attitude I told him I'd write a bad review and got money ready as we were desperate and needed them printing. He then refused to print them for me at all. I went back to the reception desk and spoke to the gentleman working behind the currency exchange counter and explained that Mohamed was going to charge me 80 dirhams for 4 boarding passes and for him to do this for me instead. He then turned and spoke to his colleague (the little old man) in Arabic before changing his reason for not being able to print for me by claiming his outlook wasn't working (complete rubbish). Both day time male receptionists- the little old man and the man working behind the currency exchange counter are useless and always find the most ridiculous excuses not to fulfill any customer requests.    To the owner responding to every bad review with the same generic email saying that you will take on the feedback and use it to improve don't bother trying to mug me off with that rubbish because clearly you've done nothing to improve the quality of service.    AVOID THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS! STAFF ARE RUDE AND UNHELPFUL AND WILL TRY TO EXTORT AS MUCH MONEY OUT OF YOU AS POSSIBLE.    TO THE ONLY HELPFUL RECEPTIONIST HOUDA THANK YOU FOR HELPING US THE BEST YOU COULD.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54m15

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Hamza Sayed wrote a review Feb 2023,40,excellent service,Excellent hotel deffo coming again!  I was greeted by Hafidha and Hosni who sorted out my paperwork and quickly got me into my room. I had to wait till my room was ready but it was worth the wait nonetheless.    The animation team were a lovely group of young people who kept me and the guests entertained. Thanks especially to Kenza Chakir and Simon in particular who spoke excellent English and we became friends easily. I will never forget that Simon completely destroyed me in a game of badminton so I will train to beat him next time!  The tour guide reps Soukaina and Mustapha did an excellent job of showing me all the different excursions - thanks Mustapha the quad bike and camel ride was worth it!    I would really like to thank staff member Hakima. She is a very genuine hard working lady lovely personality who went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable from the beginning to the end of my stay. When I first arrived at the hotel and my room was not ready. she was the first person I met in the dining hall - she could sense I was in distress because I needed to charge my phone. She kindly took care and handle of my phone whilst then guiding me to have my 1st lunch!    Every afternoon she would greet me whenever she saw me in the hotel with her warm friendly smile check in to see if I was ok and needed anything and often recommend the various different foods to try.  Any time I needed help she would go out her way to ask for me and made sure any issues I had were sorted. Hakima definitely made my stay enjoyable!    Only downside was the pool was not working and no kettle or tea/coffee in the room  but inshallah I hope this fixes next time I come. I look forward to coming again in future but with friends and family!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hamzahC6795SX

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Becky Y wrote a review Jan 2023,10,Very poor hotel,I have visited Marrakech many times and stayed in hotels ranging from 2 to 5 stars and all have been excellent unfortunately the Labranda Rose was the first one that has disappointed.  The hotel looks run down and in need of refurbishment this is understandable after Covid and could be overlooked but I would not rate the Labranda Rose a 3 star let alone 4. Unfortunately the service or lack of it is inexcusable.  We had an issue the first night where power tripped leaving us with no light or power sockets. The telephone did not work to call reception. The manager was very rude and at first did not believe me. The electrics were eventually fixed by the very kind handyman in the middle of the night however I was concerned for his safety rewiring the trip switch with the power still on whilst we were in the room. The manager refused our request to change rooms and had a very rude and sarcastic manor.  The all inclusive had little choice and items unavailable. The food was poor with very little choice. Water was charged for which seemed strange when all inclusive.  The hotels seems to mainly cater for retired French guests who do appear to be there preferred clientele.  The entertainment team were pleasant and helpful as were the porters and doorman.  The location is good if you want to stay in Hivernage 10 mins from Menara Mall 20 mins to Guiliz.  I would not chose to stay here again. There are many better value hotels in Marrakech which offer wonderful service.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Folkestone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyY781
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Rohima Begum wrote a review Jan 2023,30,Decent hotel but wouldn't call it 4*,"Hotel food was ok.... Some things were bland. But in general an ok buffet. We had all inclusive. So THAT was all meals and unlimited bar. Bar only offered drinks no snacks. That was disappointing. Once I requested a tea and they had no milk... If you are not all inc. be aware they will charge you for water. Not given with meals if your BandB or half board.  Indoor pool and jacuzzi has a separate charge per day which I found to be very cheeky. As we were all inclusive so why are they charging extra for this??? The weather was cold so the outdoor pool was cold. And wasn't heated.  The mini club was closed .... again disappointing as my toddle didn't have much to do... Cold pool and no mini club... I felt the hotel has all these ""services"" that made them a 4* but they actually couldn't be used.....  Room basic.. cleaned daily. But no kettle /tea/coffee provided in room. Firdge was given but empty. Would like some drinks and water as a 4* and all inc.  In general a ok hotel nice helpful staff. But basic. Some services around this time not available so best to check.  They really need to offer more things at the bar... For all Inc.  I wouldn't choose this hotel again to be honey. It budget friendly. And close to mall and food places.

We didn‚Äôt use many of the facilities as we were on tour and the hotel was booked via our tour company. The view from our window showed the water slides which looked like a lot of fun. The dinner buffet was plentiful with variety and so were the breakfast options. The hotel is a little dated. Beds were quite hard. We had a better stay on our first occasion than the second. On the second occasion our room at times smelt like a sewer pipe has exploded and there was no drinking water in the room compared to our first stay.

It was superbly placed for the conference only 2 minutes walk away. I had a generally pleasant stay with friendly staff a comfortable clean room and facilities were fine. Good food at the dinner buffet including Moroccan and international dishes. The breakfast was ok. I'm sad the weather was too cold to use the beautiful pool! One problem I had was the entertainment held next to the pool was loud and went on until 23.30 every night including on week days.

Taxis in abundance outside of the hotel.  Room was fine a little dated and there were a lack of plug sockets I recommend taking at least a 4 plug short extension we did this so were ok the room was cleaned everyday and the towels changed every day.  Hotel communal areas were clean  Staff polite.  Swimming pool and area clean.  Small deposits for pool towels that you can change for fresh ones each day and deposit returned at end of your trip.  We didn‚Äôt use the aqua park pools so no comment.  We went out every night so can‚Äôt comment on any entertainment.  We didn‚Äôt enquire about their extra restaurants.  We booked half board which is usually breakfast and dinner we were able to swap dinner for lunch.  Enough selection for breakfast and lunch to keep you going the same breakfast selection was fine but the lunch was repetitive each day.  Over all we enjoyed our stay  I would give it a 3*. No more no less.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickycR534TL

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,ianryanjaz wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Please Avoid,The good.  The Spa Breakfast omelette.    Not Good  Food awful repetitive never hot.  Drinks poor quality 4 out of 8 days ran out of beer and vodka. I personally do not drink alcohol however others do. I never witnessed any guest's unruly due alcohol. Juices were like cordial certainly not fresh or even carton. Coffee which i do drink was very often in chipped cups and not good taste Morrocco should be able to provide good coffee.  Staff extremely rude none were happy to be there and made it obvious as with previous comments pool bar staff particularly rude. When I read about everything French and not good for English guests I too thought we are in a foreign country and need to accept that. However I and many others experienced actual discrimination on many levels and examples. If I were at the bar waiting for a drink and ordered if a French guest approached they were served before me and my drinks were delayed on several occasions. At afternoon tea many French or Arabic guests took food from restaurant to pool such as cakes and sandwiches. No English guests were allowed and were stopped doing this.  These are just 2 examples; I have many more.  Rooms were nothing like the pictures online. First room 616 toilet continuously noisily flushing constantly no flush button which seemed a regular thing speaking to other guests. Next room 505 which was ok not that great but ok. After 2 days here asked to move by hotel manager as allegedly needed for maintenance in room above bare faced lie as new guest in room straight after us. Next room 415 had no air con control on wall was not even electrically attached and came off wall burnt out inside only 1 power socket manager accused me not true but when he checked only one socket making re charging both mobiles overnight tricky furniture in room collapsing.  Last room offered was a suite 347 had I of paid for this I would have checked out such poor quality. Tiles on floor missing making it very sharp on feet as right in doorway large swathes of grout missing from around bath with shower over no balcony. I was so sick at this point I took the room but every time I passed reception I got anxious about being asked to move again.  I had a long conversation with manager about these things but nobody seemed bothered and I was informed the French basically have run of this hotel.  The pool water was so cold it was uncomfortable to swim in even though outside temperature was very hot.  What finished this poor experience off for me was when a disabled English lady on checkout but waiting for her taxi to airport had the wheelchair taken from her although not needed by hotel she was transported in hotel on a baggage trolley to the bathroom and outside. I have never been so upset to see this or disturbed and suddenly nobody speaks English.  I implore anyone about to book this hotel PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE.

Also after two small plastic cups of wine being instructed to go and get something to eat !! This didn‚Äôt end there the barman then thought it amusing to describe my partner as typically English in how he looked !! We laughed it off but we are well travelled and have stopped in lots of hotels all over the world and have never been spoken to like that ..Other staff were lovely Faty in particular is an asset to the hotel .only stop here for long weekends as it‚Äôs very central for us and it is very reasonably priced it‚Äôs somewhere we wouldnt choose to stay longer however .This hotel could be so much better Im sorry to say just needs management to open their eyes to customer reviews,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rossendale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steph_1968_10
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,TonbridgeStevef wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Near perfect week of indulgance,This was our second visit to this hotel so arrived already knowing layout. We arrived at 11am  received our wristbands and was told room would be available in approx hour. Told to go to outdoor bar have a drink and we would be informed when room was ready. At 11.30 I fancied a swim so went back to reception to get shorts and met receptionist on way to say our room was ready - in room and unpacked by noon - superb  As per my normal reviews these will include pros and cons  Room  Nice size lovely shower and large wardrobe/ dressing area . Toilet a little cramped but I am 1.94cm. Air con a little hit or miss but by leaving it on when going for dinner room was cool on return. We had an initial issue with a power socket that kept blowing but staff fixed this within 15 minutes.  Pools  Excellent - very clean staff attentive and plenty of loungers  Restuarents  At our first breakfast we were greeted by Bahija who remembered us from previous visit and from there on in nothing was too much for her and her staff. Every meal we arrived to find a table prepared for us with water and bread rolls ready to go . Copious drinks were refilled and a massive asset to the hotel.  The only negative of the buffet restaurent was the amount of people smoking in the outside / covered area. The food was goods always something to suit us with roast meats and stir frys along with 5-6 tagines.  There is also the Italian and the Moroccoan restaurents but this was our only major issue of the week. e booked the Italian for the Saturday evening and was told to arrive for 7.30pm. We were suited and booted but on arrival was informed there were now no couples books as it was now taken up by a group booking. We went to reception to complain but were fobbed off saying we could go to Moroccoan instead .We were then told Italian was fully booked for rest of our holiday.  Afternoon tea 4-5pm was a nice bonus with mint tea/coffee pastries  filled rolls and pancakes.  Bars  We only used the aqua park bar one day and were surprised that the staff member would not serve us at the swim up bar but expected us to get out of the water. The main outside bar was a little strange with often only one staff member when busy with 3-4 staff in indoor bar area with one customers.  Spa  Wonderful for Hamman and massage reasonable price too  All in all a very good week  some magnificent staff (and a couple of surly ones)  We will return,Date of stay: September 2022,,tonbridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonbridgeStevef

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Andy S wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Fantastic family hotel,After reading some of the reviews on here we were a little worried where we were staying but to rescue it the hotel for the price was lovely. Think some people expect the world on a tiny budget. All the staff were freindly alot couldn‚Äôt speak great English but guess what we‚Äôre not in England and French are the main visitors so they‚Äôve learnt more French. We stayed start of September for 2 weeks as a family of four me my partner and 2 kids first week was the end of the summer holidays so a lot more busy week 2 was alot more chilled.  We stayed in a family room which was great my kids had there own decorated kids room and we were down a small hall with our own room and balcony which was perfect for when kids gone bed.  Rooms kept clean fresh towels etc only let down the air con is a bit tired if you leave it on constant it ll just about get the room cool enough.  The hotel has 3 restaurants 2 to book into and the main one. The food was always great with loads of different options (shockingly a lot of Moroccan food) which our kids weren‚Äôt always keen on but we‚Äôre in Morocco so they made do. This is the classic all inclusive The restaurant and staff were great the let down were the people staying in week 1 when it was busy selfish humans rushing around pushing in which staff dealt with great week 2 out of summer holidays was a lot more chilled.  The bars again classic all inclusive in annoying plastic cups with basic options but again had a good time with what we had.  Entertainment team were great week one in summer holidays was based towards kids on other side of pool with there team we literally didn‚Äôt have our kids with us much got to chill by bar in peace while they had fun(bliss). Week 2 most kids gone home so it was based more towards adults nearer the bar but the team still tried to include our kids where they could. fatyma in there team is an asset to them and was always trying to have a giggle with them and us. Big thanks your a legend!  The hotel has 3 pools 2 in the aqua Parc with slides kids loved it.  If your looking for a nice family hotel to stay with your children for a really reasonable price this is a great option.  To the hotel - Only improvement I can say is needed besides improving amateur air con you need to give a better introduction to where things are we were given our key and told enjoy our stay and that was it but thanks for the enjoyable 2 weeks.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore452475

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Duncan wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Very fair and balances Family holiday review.,Please avoid this hotel. This hotel is simply 25 years behind the times. I have travelled around the world to all inclusive hotels this has to be the worst. We arrived for a family holiday we were never made to feel welcome never mind special.  Rooms- Basic but clean. Daughters bed was not made up and I had to ask several times. There were days when we had no towels toilet rolls or bedsheet. The worst was that I had 5 cold showers out of 14 days as there was no hot water. One of the days there was no water at all. Totally unacceptable.  Buffett restaurant was a disaster utter chaos. There seriously needs to be a manager in charge. The queues were awful people cut in holiday makers were fighting over chips plates and tables. It was a disgrace. Food was terrible. We didn‚Äôt even know what we were eating as nothing was labelled. Breakfast was either croissants or eggs with 3 choices of cheap cereal. No fresh fruit or smoothies for breakfast at all. Lunch and dinner was the same every day. Grilled fish and meat in a sauce. The cheapest cut of fish beef chicken and lamb. This was obvious. I couldn‚Äôt eat there at all by the end of the holiday. We ate out 6 of the 14 nights despite being all inclusive. There was no childrens food or section my 12 year old barely ate. The food was not appropriate for children.  Shockingly you were only allowed 2 bottles of 1.5litres of water per room per day. Nothing more. You could get a cup of warm water throughout the day if needed.  The bar. Well what can I say. Warm beer warm water warm juice and warm soda. Everything was served warm but they tried to get over this by putting an ice cube in it. WHERE ARE THE FRIDGES!! If this wasn‚Äôt bad enough all drinks were served in small cheap throw away plastic cups. Even the evening drinks. Gin and tonic served in plastic cups. No lemon limes. Unbelievable and shocking. The bar shut at 11 despite the entertainment continuing till 12. We‚Äôll when I say entertainment there was the same guy who sang the same songs for 14 nights. There were not enough chairs and tables for the evening. You actually had to sit on the sun loungers at night. The French people there were truly awful. Rude aggressive and threatening. The gym was terrible and they wanted ¬£8 a day to use the CV equipment. The only positive is the location of the hotel. Easy access to the City. All in all this was an awful hotel and an awful holiday. The staff really need to read the reviews and improve the quality of this hotel and manage peoples expectations.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,jo wrote a review Aug 2022,40,Authentic Stay in Marrakesh,This review is mainly aimed at British tourists. This is a very Moroccan hotel we were the only British or European family for first five days- a couple more have checked in since but it is mainly Moroccan families    Rooms- we had a family room on 5th floor. 2 double bed in a room with a wardrobe and tv and one room with 3 single beds tv and balcony with 2 chairs. In the bathroom there was a toilet and 2 showers. Sink blocked one night but was quickly fixed. No kettle but these can be hired from reception for 200D deposit.    Housekeeping- came every day but often quite late. Towels are ok- but thin. No towels in room when we arrived and bit of an issue with almost being accused if we stole towels üòÇ but rectified in the end. Rooms a little dated but clean    Hotel facilities- big reception although little English for some. Which is fine- I should of brushed up on my French! Their English definitely better than my French. There is a money exchange which gives as good a rate as the exchange in town. Grounds are beautifully kept. There is a tour booking facility who seemed really nice (I‚Äôd already booked my excursions to Ouzoud falls quad bikes and camels before we left) there is a gym and reasonably priced spa. There is a live singer by the pool bar every night a piano bar and a kids disco. There is also classes on during the day such as cooking and Arabic calligraphy. There are a lot of wasps about but to be expected in a hot country with sugary drinks- they are all over the bar staff bless them- they do put pesticide down so they don‚Äôt bother you too much if you are sensible and put your empty drinks in bin etc.    Pools- one large pool with a bar. Plenty of sunloungers. We went down about 9 and no stressing about towels on sun beds buts you can put towels out at 830. Aqua parc is amazing! A pool with a swim up bar. Games in the pool by the entertainment team such as aqua aerobics and water polo. A kids water section with small slides fountains and such. Then the 5 bigger slides. Perfect for my 11 and 5 year old. 5 year old can swim without bands and was allowed even on the bigger slides but there are 2 slower ones and 3 big quick ones    Food- one main buffet restaurant. This has omelette station for breakfast plus a salad station pastries and rolls plus some other random bits. Lunch and dinner are similar. Pastas potatoes and then Moroccan food. Please not there are no burgers/chips/nuggets. My kids have eaten brilliantly because of this. They have had cucumber and tomatoes and rice and then some kind of chicken or beef most meals. In the evenings there is a pizza station but very very long queues. The queuing etiquette is sporadic- but as it‚Äôs not very British you roll with it! They will bring bottles of water and soft drink if you ask. The first night mum ordered a red wine and every night when we sat down red wine appeared! There is a pool snack bar at the aqua parc. You can book this at reception once for you stay. This is really the only issue we had. I booked and on the day they said we didn‚Äôt have a reservation and were quite dismissive. I went and spoke to reception and still didn‚Äôt get anywhere. Spoke to yassine the manager who kindly resolved quickly and the man running the pool bar was then very lovely. The food was delicious- kids were happy to have burger and chips! Staff were lovely after initial issues. Would say Check reception have booked for the day you want- again this was due to language but I should be better at French!! There is also a Moroccan restaurant you can book for one evening which is stunning. Excellent food and service. My 5 year old very much enjoyed his tagine! Note there are not really and snacks during the day no ice cream. There is afternoon tea served in the main restaurant pastries cake and such    Staff- now they have been great. As I say it is very obvious they are often more comfortable with Moroccan and French speaking guests but they were mostly friendly! If you ask for something they will do their best to help you. Some speak impeccable English. Special shout outs to yassine the bar staff in the evening who kept magically producing popcorn for the boys Faty from the entertainment team who was very patient being taught uno by my 5 year old and the life guards at the aqua parc were brilliant lovely guys. The manager of the pool bar was also fab. Staff in restaurant were also kind and efficient.    Location- brilliant! Safe area- myself and 2 children walked to the supermarket first evening at menara mall (10 minutes) there are plenty of taxis outside to get to the main square Jemma El-Fnan (50 D- confirm cost before you get in) I booked transfers each way with a private company (¬£20 gbp return) we also went on the train to Casablanca easy to navigate and train station a 10 min walk.    Overall- if you are you are looking for more of a ‚Äòbutlins abroad‚Äô with lots of activity geared to English and wanting English food this may not be for you. For the price we paid we‚Äôve had a great stay. I‚Äôd say brush up on your French if you can! If you are looking for a chilled out authentic holiday then I would highly recommend. Thank you Labranda rose- I‚Äôm sure we will be back.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Road33669060214
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,lisajbw wrote a review Aug 2022,10,VERY DISAPPOINTED,Morocco it‚Äôs self is such a beautiful county we enjoyed all our time here when not in this awful hotel ! We travelled with a large group for a family wedding  the rooms upon arrival were an absolute disgrace with live wires hanging out of walls  showers hanging off wall and dirty rooms . There was cracks and chips in the cups for coffee at breakfast  the tables were left dirty the staff in the restaurant were lovely but there wasn‚Äôt enough of them for the amount of guests to keep everything clean !! The food was very repaetataive day after day and there was no snack s available readily like in most all inclusive hotels such as fruit and ice cream ! There were chip fights almost every day and rude people pushing in the queues to get the chips it was an absolute joke and I have never ever encountered such rude nasty French people in all my life ! A large family staying there were racially abusive and one English man ( who was not with us )was actually spat on !just disgusting behaviour it was just dreadful ! I made sure I kept myself busy outside the hotel as not to spend time with these animals !! I will return to morroco as I loved the country and the people but unfortunately not to this hotel it‚Äôs such a shame but standards were not up to much and they should have put actions in place when people were been attacked and racially abused ! Any advice to anyone deciding to book this hotel is please don‚Äôt book here as you will be very disappointed .,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisajbw

A lovely lady called Zainab went above and beyond to help keep our rooms clean. Every day she would leave both our rooms spotless leave shampoos towels etc. A true asset for Labranda Rose.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,T C wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Extremely disappointing hotel,Arrived at the hotel at 11.30am to be told our room wouldn‚Äôt be ready until after 2pm and we were asked to wait in the lobby and fill in some forms  the lobby was really warm due to the sun streaming in from above so we asked if we could have something to drink ( other hotels usually provide a welcome drink) only to be told we would have to wait until we got our all inclusive wrist bands which we wouldn‚Äôt receive until our rooms were ready. Once the rooms were ready we were then told we couldn‚Äôt have keys or wristbands until we paid the city tax we arrived as a large party attending a family wedding & we were charged more than some of the other families even though we all had the same amount of people in each room. The reception staff were rude  the only helpful person was Habib who worked for meeting point.  Once we eventually got to the rooms around 3/4pm having had no sleep the night before we couldn‚Äôt believe what we were met with the sliding toilet door would hardly move & left a 10inch gap we were sharing a room with our older son so wouldn‚Äôt have been comfortable using bathroom like that you couldn‚Äôt flush the toilet as the flush was broken the sink and shower was dirty the towel bracket in the shower was hanging off the shower head was clinging to the wall by a thread the 3rd bed was a seat under the window and hadn‚Äôt been made electric plug socket in my brothers room hanging off the wall it was dark and dingy lighting was terrible 3 families of our party complained and we were moved to the ‚Äúbetter rooms‚Äù ( they told us) on the 6th floor they were better but not great. No water for shower or toilet one day then a trickle the rest of the days we were there struggled to get more than 1 sometimes 2 towels for 3 adults.  The dining area was a joke not big enough by far to deal with the amount of people the food wasn‚Äôt great and when they put fries and pizza on it was a free for all people having to queue for over 20mins and so many arguments as people were just pushing in kids using there hands to scoop the chips out and piling the plates high people were picking the salad and buns with there hands using the same spoon in multiple dishes cross contaminating food we had a member of family who is gluten free who barely ate anything whilst we were there as nothing was labelled and even if she could have something she recognised she couldn‚Äôt because of the cross contamination with the spoons it is supposed to be continental food but was very much based around Moroccan dishes and it felt like it was the same dishes just changed position every night. Struggled in a morning to find a cup that actually had a handle or wasn‚Äôt badly cracked you could only get bottles of water at dinner or tea time there was no ice creams for kids snack bar was only open for a short time and usually consisted of dry cardboard like pastries with no fillings. The a la carte Italian restaurant was not available to book at all during our stay and we were told they keep it for the French. We had a lot of bother with a French family with a lot of kids who were spitting hitting and we were even racially abused.  The pool had broken and raised flags round and in it there was no signage as to deep and shallow ends the slides in the aqua park are old and caused a broken toe on one of our family members. The sun loungers are old and really uncomfortable.The pool side bar staff were ok and friendly but they have a horrendous problem with wasps be careful when taking a drink as the wasps are all over it.  We have all had to spend quite a bit of money eating out as it was so bad  we‚Äôve all been to lots of all inclusive hotels between us but we all agreed this is the worst one we‚Äôve been too this is definitely not worth the 4 * star status more a 1*.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Thomas B wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Don,What I would call a hotel from hell. Had us waiting in reception as room not ready no drinks to welcome guests as people needed a drink of water. Would not give us a wrist band till we paid city tax. And it took two people to sort it as the other could not add up. There were altifcations around the pool regular. and a few miss haps in the so called restraunt which was two small. Food bloody awful same food every day. No yogurts or ice cream. Never had a chip as could get near was like a cattle Stampede. First rooms were a joke moved us to better rooms. Electric cables and sockets hanging out of wall. Management was crap apart from one man who does the trips. All the aggro was caused by a vile French family and kids who seemed to be causing trouble all the time. As the kids like the idea of indicating at spitting at people and the vile mother spat in the face of a British guest who accidently bumped into. her. Never think the same about the French again. This was total low life at its best. Keep well away we have been all over the world and never know a place like this. Had to eat out a lot food awful. Lucky I have given it one star as I would give it half a star. Totally ruined our holiday.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K734ZHthomasb
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Rose B wrote a review Aug 2022,10,R Bateman,DON'T STAY IN THIS HOTEL  We arrived as family group on the 8th Aug at around 11. 30am we were told our rooms were not ready until 2pm then we would be able to get our all inclusive bands so we're unable to get a drink for more than 2 hours. They refused us a drink after us asking several times when eventually we were given our rooms we could not believe our eyes. They were rooms from hell. Sliding bathroom doors of the hinges towel rails hanging off dirty through out with body hairs even in the ward robes. Many times we had no water to shower. Electric cables hanging of the walls ugs hanging of the walls I would not keep a dog in such a room.  The only restourant was awful dirty cups plates tables were not wiped after they had been used by others. The food was mostly inedible apart from omelet at breakfast so it cost us a fortune eating out most of the time. Pool side bars were horrendous running out of beer many times all drinks were warm the bars were not cleaned down properly with many many wasps around  The aqua slides were very old and not very safe as one of our group broke her toe so we didn't use them again.  We were made to feel like second class citizens by the reception staff we were racially abused by some of the French guests who obviously didn't like the British. There were fights breaking out in the restourant over food as there wasn't enough especially chips which was the only thing edible for tea.  Arguments and fights were aslo breaking out around the pool numerous times so we felt totally unsafe.  We spent a lot of money staying away from the hotel.  So So glad to be home such an awful experience!!!,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosebT232MB
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Anneka G wrote a review Aug 2022,20,This could be so much more‚Ä¶,I‚Äôm writing this was a heavy heart. This hotel could be so much more and I am so disappointed that my review can‚Äôt be better. I will begin by saying that the Lifeguards Mehdi and Khalid the water park pool bar staff especially Unice and the animation team make this place and are the reason I don‚Äôt give the hotel 1*. They are amazing friendly and made the holiday for our 6 year old boy just one of fun and happy memories. He went every day to the mini club and loved it- Soufiane is a great guy- he had so many high fives from the lifeguards he just adored them and the animation team especially Simo (here we go!) made him laugh every day! They are the hotels biggest asset and should be praised highly.    However. Where to begin. The food in this hotel is no4* standard. The hotel states they have 3 onsite restaurants for guests a snack bar and several bars. The truth is they have 1 restaurant for all guests this is buffet style and 10 x worse than any school canteen. The food is described as ‚Äúinternational‚Äù it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs very same same all the time it‚Äôs often cold lukewarm at best‚Ä¶AND there is no organisation. Other guests are rude pushing in taking massive amounts of food and putting their hands in the food - our boy even commented ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt know if they have washed their hands after the toilet‚Äù. Staff should monitor this definitely as it happens all the time. There is a constant queue for pizza and chips- because it‚Äôs the only real option they offer for children. The ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù restaurant isn‚Äôt Italian at all- it‚Äôs a smaller version of the bigger buffet restaurant but it‚Äôs reserved for certain guests who have paid- you can try and book a dinner time slot to go but be warned you might not be able to - we arrived on Tuesday asked to book then they said they had nothing at all for our entire stay. However after I made a big complaint at the hotel reception and having had my type 1 son go into hypoglycaemia while waiting for lunch in the main buffet restaurant- because we had to queue for so long we were ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to use the ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù any time‚Ä¶this wasn‚Äôt without being given the third degree from some staff in there because we weren‚Äôt one of the ‚Äúcertain guests‚Äù. There is zero communication between staff at Labranda Rosa. The Moroccan restaurant doesn‚Äôt exist. Not one guest I spoke to during my week there knew where this restaurant was or had used it. The snack bar‚Ä¶ha ha this isn‚Äôt a snack bar. It‚Äôs a lunch time dining option you can go once during your stay if your lucky and can get a slot‚Ä¶the food was okay here cooked fresh but remember you can ONLY go one time‚Ä¶unless you pay! What is quite hilarious is we could only book for the Monday - but the snack bar area was never busy only ever 4-5 tables taken max so there was always plenty of spaces for other guests but seemingly they are always booked! There are two bars - the pool bar at the aqua park and the bar located near the other pool. The piano bar you can only use if you pay. Do you sense a theme here? You pay for all inclusive but actually it might as well be half board because you have to pay extra for a lot of the advertised services! There is no ice cream no other snacks just food at specified meal times‚Ä¶  Every drink is served in disposable plastic cups alcoholic or non even in the evening‚Ä¶I understand around the pool for safety but it was like they treat adult guests as children. The alcohol is so watered  down and limited what they have. Both my husband and I have had diarrhoea for 5 days we are convinced this has come from the post mix drinks as our son has been fine - he drinks only water and juice has eaten the same food etc.  Our room was a standard room on 5th floor. It wasn‚Äôt the cleanest- my husband wiped the floor with a baby wipe on arrival and it was filthy. Our toilet was broken and the lamp didn‚Äôt work (no bulb) both reported to reception on our first morning and was told would be fixed - it never was. We only ever had 2 towels when we were a family of 3 I asked every day if we could have more and only 1 day were more put in ( they are tiny not bath towel size at all) We were lucky though as I spoke to one lady who told me she had NO towels at all despite asking! The sheets were never cleaned my husband spilt something one evening and the sheets were just flipped - not changed! We had no water on two evenings - not great when you had spent the day at the pool and wanted to shower before going for dinner. We were told 10 minutes‚Ä¶over an hour later still no water we gave up waiting and were hungry. Our return flight was at 9pm- I asked if we could keep our room until later so that a) we could keep our sons insulin in the fridge b) have our belongings secure c) shower/freshen up before our flight. We were told no guarantee but we could try and get our room on the evening before we check out. So on Monday I went and asked - was told no at first I explained again I really needed somewhere for my sons medication and also if he was unwell. They said I could if I pay I was happy to do this and did- I asked for a receipt which I was told I had to wait until the next day. We spent the day by the pool but when we returned at 3pm they had blocked our room card! 3 trips back to reception and eventually we regained access- thankfully I had collected my receipt that morning otherwise I think it would have been a different story. Would I go back to Labranda Rosa‚Ä¶sadly no‚Ä¶there is much improvement needed here. The aqua park is a great hit for younger children - we have teens who didn‚Äôt holiday with us this time - we are glad because they would have been so bored as there is little else to do. The ‚Äúevening entertainment‚Äù is the same guy ‚Äúsinging‚Äù every night and some nights he goes on past midnight‚Ä¶so loud if you are unlucky to be in pool view room like us. This was my second visit to Marrakech my husbands first and this hotel sadly was a big let down‚Ä¶and I know we weren‚Äôt the only guests to think so.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/894annekag
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Abs wrote a review Aug 2022,30,All Inclusive Family 7,Where do I start. We checked in on 3rd August 2022. The hotel was very very busy indeed as it was Summer holiday for morrocan schools.    When I made booking via Booking.com and asked for early check in but this was not met.    My room were allocated after two hours wait one at 3:15 and one was allocated 4:30 the room was still being painted at the time Triple room was double bed and Sofa and family room was double and 3 single beds Room was big enough but fridge was lacking cool setting and AC was not cold enough.    Rooms were cleaned almost everyday but we needed ask the staff who were polite and responsive. TOILETS had no water or bedet cleaning facilities. Why ?    All inclusive was different to other package hotel's. Pizza in the evening with a very long wait minimum of 25mins. Food was mainly to tatse of Morrocan people. Limited items with no labelling of what the item is. Same food almost everyday Lunch and dinner long wait first few days were chaotic as lack of staff and tables wernt clean no knife and forks we had to ask for ice and drinks.    After a few days the increase in staff service got slightly better. Sadly the food lacked any taste or flavour or spice .    Staff should main control at que for chips and pizza. As children and adults push in. Sadly food was boring flavour less and did not have any taste. Please YouTube Indian subcontinent food recepies and try and do some of that .    Not much for desert no ice cream. The burger bar I was told I had to pay so did not use I WAS ALSO not told about snack time I found out on day 6 of 7 Sadly no explanation of what is included on all inclusive. This should be made clear on arrival.    Staff tried their best at times but unfortunately had to make do with what they had.    UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PRICE THIS IS Not a 4 star hotel.    Slides and pool were OK. Entertainment team did nit engage my children or approach them for any games.    Drinks bars were full of bees that entered drinks and drinks cartons they floated in some drinks.you needed to cover drinks up with your hands or else they go in. When I asked bar staff what they bees were doing insde open juice cartons his reply its Nature.    Sadly not a 4 star hotel more like a 2 star.  Location was good near EVERYTHING    Would I go again Sadly NOT for the money we paid.    Thank you to staff.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Iqzy wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Terrible and only first day,So I'm at this resort first day and already hate it!    First of all we arrived early at hotel around 12ish. We asked if we can at least get wristbands if room not ready as my kids are hungry and we are too tired to walk around looking for food. They didn't care. Then somehow 2 hours later their magic book opened and even though room wasn't ready they somehow gave us wristbands. The food was terrible by the way. No order in the restaurants. Drinks and cutlery take ages to come and even longer to clear tables. I saw 3 tables as I walked past 2 hours later still not clean that were next to us.    Swimming was fun but dangerous. Their steps are falling apart which is dangerous and hazard for kids especially.    As for drinks bees are going inside the drink and they shrug it off and still serve to you. When you try speak to them they cannot answer back as they can't speak English. They only care about the French speaking clientele.    We were also not told about snack time. My kids were a little peckish but no one was able to tell us there's snack time. Even their leaflet does not really tell you what you can have with all Inclusive. Also been told there's a pizza and burger bar but you can only book that once during your stay. How lame. My kids will starve unless I go out and grab food which defeats purpose of all inclusive.    I am here till next Monday and wow I don't think already I've been to a worst place. Customer service is ridiculous and this place is just not safe. Save your money and book elsewhere.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iqzy

There was grass leaves  flies peoples hair all in the pool and didn't seem to have chlorine in at all.  10/ There needs to be a more structured way in the restaurant as it was like a free for all and the amount of food that was getting taken out by Muslims was unreal!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,happyandlucky wrote a review Jul 2022,10,Didn‚Äôt enjoy at all - hotel was clean but food was average and staff need customer service training-,Location: Marrakesh Labranda rose  We booked this hotel half board  We arrived and were charged city tax straightaway instead of at the end . We hadn‚Äôt even changed money yet but had to change there and then although tired and exhausted after the flight and went for a meal. Immediately was asked do you want water? I replied yes then the guy came with a bottle and started asking for 3 euro !! I mean it wasn‚Äôt soft drink or alcohol was just drinking water. I explained we were half board but it didn‚Äôt matter. No water no soft drinks no diluted nothing included. No tea coffee although the machines were all there all cleared. .    at breakfast mint lemon jugs orange juice etc but at lunch/dinner everything is cleared away no tea coffee either. If you want that you have to walk to the bar and buy the coffee machines are just clean and empty used for breakfast only.    We stay in many hotels worldwide but this was first time it happened. Food was ok repetitive nothing exciting after a few days. The guest relation man habib showed us a few things outside where to get towels from. We have to pay 200 MD for 2 towels refunded when returned. Other hotels give towel cards. But Habib never mentioned that we could have a La carte meals if booked - we found out from a guest on the last day! He insisted all hotels charge for water but my children stayed in meridian and they were given 2 bottles of water daily in their rooms at no charge. Their rooms were cheaper also when booked through hotels.com.    Swimming areas were ok and pleasant gardens clean. Wondered on entertainment staff as we saw one or two touching the young ones and teenagers on shoulders or pushing them in water. Surely that can‚Äôt be right. Child protection etc??    When I complained at desk about drinking water not included in half board not tea and coffee and asked Zakaria at desk why it wasn‚Äôt mentioned on website he cheekily replied ‚Äòbut it‚Äôs not mentioned either that we do include‚Äô    Staff definitely need training. Customer care is very important but very Poor here . We spent more time outdoors and had our Hamam and massage outside other clean places reasonable price where at the hotel the prices were very high that‚Äôs why it was always empty.    The guest relation officer second one was Ummema and she came to talk to us by the poolside and we told her we weren‚Äôt happy about somethings so she listened made a few notes and then asked us to write a good review! We said we would write an honest review. Why should we write a good review if we weren‚Äôt happy and concerns not addressed.?    We didn‚Äôt even know we could ask for a kettle for deposit of 200 . When we asked Zakaria just said no we don‚Äôt give! I just read it on a review from another guest.    Room was ok long walk entertainment was nothing to write home about. Boring- hardly enough seats on the one where they were mimicking Hindi dancing to Bollywood music. Nothing of their own just copying from films. Same 4 entertainment guys as those that came near leisure areas.    Same fruits daily - no mangoes papaya or cherries but plenty in the markets.  We asked for late checkout the lady wanted 300 MD then changed to 200 MD we didn‚Äôt bother we were just glad to leave.    We checked out went for last lunch there came back our luggage was left in the room on side and the door was opened . No one was at reception. We waited a while then took the luggage from the room and walked out without anyone there to say goodbye to us.  Very strange!  We were glad to shift to another hotel for remaining five days where we thoroughly enjoyed the stay. This wasn‚Äôt a cheap hotel I would say it‚Äôs 3 star services.    I just read another review which mentions shuttle buses to centres for shopping etc. nobody mentioned that to us at reception or guest relations. Guest relation desk was always empty closed. We paid several taxis to take us to centres.    Only persons we were happy with was the bellboy can‚Äôt remember name and the one girl that was in breakfast sana maybe?    Will I book again No. won‚Äôt recommend. They don‚Äôt treat us as valued guests although when booking we were advised as VIP guests via the agent.    Needs lot of improvement.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,n22chy wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Great Location,You are like 10 minutes drive from the airport and the city center.  Staff was great and the facilities were good.  Food available was good other than they don't give you water as part of the meal.  Would definitely go again if I go to Marrakech.  Only off thing was probably that I had to wait for my room when I first checked in 20-25 minute wait once you just land ain't the best.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Ayman_stars wrote a review Jul 2022,30,"Average hotel, you pay for what you get",The hotel was standard as we arrived we were forced to pay city tax for the hotel and waited for an hour to get out hotel keys as we had arrived late from our flight we were eventually given our room but found out the beds were not made properly and had stains from the last guests. It was easily fixed by a kind gentleman who had offered to change the bedsheets and offer us a new fridge for my medication as the one provided was broken. The pool was nice and the food was standard the staff are friendly but still need to be trained a    s some of them were frustrated and stopped us from entering the cafeteria even though we had reserved the breakfast and dinner option however when checked he was in the wrong and let us enter. You were forced to buy bottles of water in the cafeteria and wasn't permitted to bring your own water bottle. Overall I enjoyed elements of the hotel however improvements need to be made especially on customer service. When we'd checked out the staff didn't even thank us for the stay or didn't even wish us a pleasant onward journey.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ayman_stars

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,BumbleBee wrote a review May 2022,20,Wouldn‚Äôt visit again,I booked this hotel as part of a birthday trip for my mother. Part of the attraction was the range of amenities advertised ‚Äú4-star food 3 bars 3 restaurants and a separate kids area‚Äù.    Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt the case the food is repetitive always lukewarm and is nowhere near 4-star level. The other 2 on-site restaurants were never open so we ate in the main restaurant most of the time which was overrun with kids running around and knocking food out of peoples hands. Most of the time we had finished our meals before any drinks were served despite asking repeatedly.    The piano bar is almost never open you can sit in there but I think I managed to get served once. According to the hotel details this bar is open until 3am it was always closed by 10.30/11pm.    The swim up bar was not fully stocked I ordered a glass of wine and they tried to serve me from a leftover bottle that was on another table. Apart from being incredibly lazy it‚Äôs unbelievably unhygienic.    Finally the pool bar was the subject of much frustration for most of the English speaking guests. The main server who wears a face mask on his chin most of the time would constantly ignore anyone asking to be served serve drinks that were mostly ice or dump half a bottle of beer into a tiny glass. Paying for all inclusive we shouldn‚Äôt have to argue or negotiate a full drink every time we visit the bar but this server made it an awful experience.    Finally the hotel is advertised as having entertainment every night. The entertainment consists of a Childrens entertainment squad dancing to the Macarena every night there is no adult entertainment at all. On our last night we were promised a ‚Äúshow‚Äù this was essentially the same 4 guys who had been dancing with the kids all week doing the same routine and their best Michael Jackson impressions.    Also despite the fact that there is an aqua parc and dedicated Childrens area the pool is full of screaming kids and disinterested parents most of the time so it‚Äôs anything but relaxing.    Unfortunately the hotel did not meet our expectations at all it is not a 4-star hotel and does not offer most of the amenities or entertainment promised. The rooms have obviously been redecorated recently however not to a high standard the finishes are sloppy. Our toilet wasn‚Äôt properly attached to the wall a drawer fell out of the cabinet as the runners were broken the door handle almost came off in my hands.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmithersLDN

Hafithad at the reception was very good and spoke English.  I remember Rim welcoming us and telling us that she is the guests relations contact and that we should not hesitate to contact her should there be anything. Rim that made us feel so welcome- Thank you.. Whenever one met Rim she would ask how the stay at the hotel is and if we needed anything.    The staff in the dinning were very friendly efficient and welcoming. Special credit to Othman who served us during our stay..    The food was very good with a variety of choices.    The maintance department needs some improvement. The day we checked in.(21/4)the safe was not in order we reported to the reception and the one who came up to ""fix"" fidgeted with the safe left and reported at the reception that the safe is fixed which was not true!  Fortunately the friends we travelled with had the next room and we stored our values in their safe  The next day I complained again and a better person was sent to repair the safe    One of the first days of our stay a group came in for dinner with unruley kids The kids shouted and fought with each other This disturbed the enjoyable dinner not only us but all guests sitted at the nearby tables were disturbed. One felt as if we were in a war zone!.A mature couple at the next table complained and the unruley kids were moved to another part of the dinning room.The dinning room staff should should be aware of such when locating tables to families with kids.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,mumofone2009 wrote a review Apr 2022,30,Amazing staff,We've just returned from a 1 week stay.    Check in was quick and informative.    Rooms were basic but clean and tidy and beds comfortable with good pillows. Fridge for keeping drinks cold.  Toiletries and fresh towels provided each day.    Staff were all absolutely wonderful. The staff make this hotel. They are so  friendly and keen to do all they can and I cannot praise them enough.    Pool and outside areas are really well maintained and attractive. Pool areas are really clean and well kept. Aqua park is fabulous with great selection of slides.    Food. Unfortunately this is where my disappointment lay. The hotel is All Inclusive yet in my opinion it is Full Board with drinks. I have stayed at many AI hotels and there have always been snacks/food available all day. Labranda serves the 3 main meals and some cake between 4-5pm. During the rest of the day there was nothing...no pizza burgers and in 1 week with temperatures of 30c we didn't see 1 ice cream. Unfortunately having children meant we actually ate out more than we wanted üòï  Main meals are also in my opinion not of a 4* standard. Firstly they are barely luke warm. We tried to get down early and even then the food was lukewarm.  I also think the food is very unappealing or inviting.  Breakfast is okay but we chose to miss it a few days as it just did not give us any great satisfaction. Few trays of pastries which were basically the same. Some big bowl of yoghurt that was as thin as milk. A few odd dishes such as mushrooms in a milk sauce half tomatoe with cheese plus omelette station. Breakfast was again not very enticing and cold!  Main meals were couple of stew/curry dishes veg pasta and salad selection. We have a child and its been very difficult to feed her sadly. They hardly cater for children. We had some thin sparse cold pizza one night and another night some chicken nuggets but that was it! No burgers pizzas and things for children at all really. The other thing that is done which I find odd is the chefs serve you which in itself sounds great BUT they have little dessert spoons which takes awhile to dish up a reasonable portion and if its busy 6+ people can be waiting whilst 1 or 2 chefs serve up 3/4 dishes for each customer with a small dessert spoon and another reason why food is cold.  There were plastic spoons on the top of the dessert stand which again I don't feel is particularly 4*.  Finally drinks. Tea coffee etc are nasty. Worse hot drinks I've ever had. Unfortunately I'm not a big alcohol drinker either so lived on water.  Desserts were a few cakes that I would consider you'd have with a cup of tea and a mousse cake but that was it. No fruit except apples under ripe Pears and banana. No fruit salad or riper fruits at all were served.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,Wolverhampton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mumofone2009
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Fraser_P wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Fantastic hotel for all ages,Just back from a fantastic week at Labranda Rose. The hotel far exceeded our expectations & everyone in our party had a great stay. Myself my wife & 5 year old son travelled with another couple & their 4 year old son & stayed on all inclusive deal. The value was amazing as the food was consistently great with a wide range of Moroccan & European cuisine to choose from. Everything tasted fresh & was well prepared. The drinks included in the all inclusive were also great & all the wines very drinkable in particular.    The staff at the hotel are fantastic & also plentiful so there is always someone on hand to serve you or help you. The animation team were brilliant with kids & adults alike & there were plenty activities & entertainment both day & night. Special shout out to Mizou who was so good with our kids & always had a big smile on his face. Abdel also deserves a special mention as he was always enthusiastic & pleased to see us. The restaurant staff were also brilliant & we were looked after by Bahija & Otthman(?) in particular. Both were attentive & made sure we had everything we needed.    The hotel itself is a beautiful building inside & it was clear a lot of the common areas had been refurbished in recent times with some work still ongoing. Our room was a decent size & comfortable. It was a little tired in places but clean & had everything we required. Outside there are well tended gardens a play park (which was being revamped when we were there) & three separate pools. The big slides were great fun for all & the boys enjoyed the kid‚Äôs pool with water features & small slides.    The hotel location is excellent in a modern attractive area of Marrakesh but only a short taxi ride or modest walk to the Medina & all the sights. There is also a mall less than 10 min walk away that stays open late (1.00am when we were there - possibly due to Ramadan?) & there is a brilliant kids amusement arcade on the top floor with arcade machines dodgems merry go rounds etc & even a small ice rink!    Overall really can‚Äôt fault the hotel & the low price we paid made it feel like an absolute bargain.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Katiedwards wrote a review Mar 2022,50,23rd birthday,Stayed 23rd - 27th March for my twenty third birthday with my partner. All inclusive.  We had a wonderful stay check in was a teeny bit slow due to a system error which after a long flight wasn‚Äôt ideal but couldn‚Äôt be helped and was quickly rectified by the receptionist. The room we booked was clean and had the necessities - big comfy bed hair dryer towels shampoo&shower gel mini fridge. I imagine the top floor superior are a bit bigger and fancier? The housekeeper was very friendly and even gave us fluffy white robes on the second day of our stay and provided us with extra pillowcases for the spare pillows in the wardrobe.  The food was okay for an all-inclusive. Breakfast was nice with fresh pastries and bread rolls every morning coffee was served to you from an automatic machine but was really quite nice and they had traditional Moroccan tea available too. The fresh omelettes cooked by the chef were my favourite.  Lunch and dinner were nice enough too we actually preferred the lunch options which were made up of different things everyday (including a BBQ on the terrace overlooking the main pool although this wasn‚Äôt made clear so you had to find out about it yourself by following your nose!) but always with traditional Moroccan tajine available and fresh salad.  Overall a really nice stay with lovely people in a beautiful country.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katiedwards
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Jennifer O wrote a review Mar 2022,20,La Branda Rose Marrakesh Morocco,would NOT recommend this Hotel. I pre booked and requested a low level floor as I walk with a stick due to fractured spine. I requested a room with shower/bath as soak for pain etc. On arrival we were met with a negative response and told the hotel had no other rooms despite pre booking and the company sending an email to request! There‚Äôs approximately 600 rooms!! No help was available. Next day we asked the rep who was helpful but he was met with distain and staff appeared abrupt with him and us too!  We were told to transfer to a sister hotel 30 mins away from Marrakesh! Despite explaining we were in Marrakesh for convenience due to everything being local as mobility being an issue!  The food was cold  bland and repetitive. The staff struggled to acknowledge or give us a drink even.  The shower was difficult to get into it was totally unsafe spraying into the dressing room which as a tiled floor was extremely unsafe and dangerous especially with a stick and already fractures in spine.! In the photos it looks lovely but it‚Äôs not!  I‚Äôve been previously 3 times to Marrakesh and never have we been treated so badly. We were mostly ignored throughout except for the last day as we‚Äôre leaving!  The bar was not good by the Pool  they were slow and wandered off not giving drinks  and the only one who smiled was the younger man on there.  I certainly would not recommend and feel this Hotel was more like a 2 Star ‚≠êÔ∏è  The best part of the Hotel was the Hairdresser in the Spa he was great.

I appreciate it was March and the weather wasn't as hot as I was expecting it but there didn't seem to be any heating or warmth. Some people had to wear coats at meal-times.  I had booked an All Inclusive holiday but (unknowingly at first) was given a Half Board wristband.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Owen F wrote a review Nov 2021,50,Exceeded expectations,What a great hotel! Stayed here with my nephew and sister and we loved it. We were a little disappointed not to have a balcony but the rooms were clean and spacious. The bathroom was modern with a lovely big rain shower. The rooms had a fridge which was great for keeping drinks cool. I slept on the single bed and it was very comfortable. The room was a very pleasant temperature at night for sleeping. No need for the air con (granted it was October so it got cool in the evenings) Our only gripe was the extortionate price for the safe 150Dirhams a night is robbery. We were room only but we had a look at the breakfasts/lunches/dinners and they looked good a bit selection and it looked good quality with chefs cooking dishes in front of you. If we returned we'd probably go B&B at least.    The pool area of the hotel was just fantastic. The water was a bit cold (22degrees) but as a result it was lovely and quiet (that was great for doing lengths about 26m if you turn at the little ledge). The water park area was great too. The slides were quite tame to be fair and all very similar but great for kids (adults would be bored after a few minutes).    The animation team were the star of the show for us though. Mono Amine and Xico were just brilliant and kept us entertained. We had so much fun playing all the games with them and getting involved in the aqua aerobics/waterpolo/darts/archery/petanque etc. We were never bored. They are an asset to the hotel.    The hotel itself is about 2-3km from the Medina (main market area). We used to pay about 30Dirhams (<‚Ç¨3) for a taxi in. The taxi men are supposed to use the meter but we didn't find any that would. We just agreed a price before we got in and always made sure we had exact change for them and honestly it was never much of a hassle. They would always try charge us 50-120Dirhams but we'd just laugh and walk away and tell them it's 30 or nothing and they'd always drop the price.    We ate in the pool bar and it was great value. Less than ‚Ç¨5 for a pizza/burger/pasta and a small soft drink. The only inconvenience was having to trek to the reception to pay the bill before we could get our food. They should really have a payment machine at the pool area.    Overall we loved our stay at the Labranda Rose and will probably return again. It was the perfect October destination for us sun worshippers.,Date of stay: October 2021,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260owenf

I booked 2 rooms (1 double and 1 triple) the double was paid in advance the amount charged corresponded to the Booking amount (with taxes included - 236 euros) the triple room was paid at the Hotel with 388.60 euros being charged instead of 365 as mentioned in the Booking (taxes already included). At the reception they were unable to explain they resorted to the support of the reservations department which only mentioned that the value of the fees was wrong.

Although we had no children with us the children around seemed to enjoy the entertainment.  Unfortunately the spa and gym were closed due to Covid so I can‚Äôt comment on those.

And we did lots of dancing and some fun things for all ages. It was brilliant! The people on reception didnt make the hotel proud. The reception is the thing that makes the hotel sad.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Philip Oladipo wrote a review May 2020,30,Not bad - Not really a 5 star Resort,Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 5 nights in March and hotel transfer was good. We got to the hotel and they gave us the wrong room - we booked a room with balcony and pool view but we were given something else and had to wait until next day to get what we paid for. The room itself was decent nothing special but tidy and clean enough to be comfortable. The reception staff were friendly enough although not very helpful some times and seemed clueless. The all-inclusive food was below average and just about edible but I guess that depends on your taste and the drinks were watered down. The general clientele is retirees and not many young people around.

I was kicked out of the restaurant with my guest because my reservation was only for breakfast. Although I asked two guests if it was okay to come in to consume PAYG drinks. And they confirmed it was completely fine. Few minutes later my guest and I were kicked out for the reason above stating the two staffs I spoke to didn‚Äôt speak proper English.. BS!!!.  The next day I asked the staff for a pen and paper (that was clearly on the desk and not in use) to write something for the taxi driver waiting outside.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Janhay wrote a review Mar 2020,40,Great hotel,"I have just returned from a great week's stay at the Labranda Rose Aqua Parc on an all-inclusive package. The hotel is near the airport but no plane noise was heard and it is a quick taxi ride into the centre of town which many guests also walked.    As a ""mature"" guest I particularly liked the peace of the quieter pool but also enjoyed lunch at the more lively pool though this needs to be booked the day before. The food in the main restaurant was good but a bit repetitive and didn't get to try the Moroccan or Italian restaurants which again need to be booked the day before.    My friend and I found the staff friendly particularly the lunch/evening restaurant staff and the bar staff and we found the all-inclusive drinks perfectly ok.    We could not get our air conditioning to work but in March the temperature wasn't too hot at night so didnt complain. There was a free safe.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Michael S wrote a review Mar 2020,50,We are absolutely coming back!!,I am your typical brit very critical of everything. I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the review of this hotel however based on my experience I struggle to see how this place has any negative reviews. We arrived en masse 3 adults and 6 children. The hotel itself is very clean modern and beautiful. We had twins rooms and a suite room. All rooms were spotless with comfy beds a TV a fridge and a safe. All rooms also have a sofa which also makes a very comfy bed. The suite room was grand with a huge patio area with a stunning view.  For both children and adults the swimming pools are the perfect way to enjoy the sun. The aqua park is well maintained and clean with lots of big slides for the kids and a swim up bar for the adults. There is also a more peaceful relaxing swimming pool away from the excitement of the aqua Park.  Now the all inclusive. We booked this hotel as it was near major fast food restaurants in case the hotel food was below average. No concerns there at all now. The choice of food was always vast fresh and changed every day. There are apparently more restaurants on site but we always ate in the same restaurant. We ate well every day with no grumbles from the kids which is shocking. The drinks in the all inclusive are local spirits and beers as expected but flow freely and easily and rest assured they absolutely contain enough alcohol.  What really made our holiday though is the hotel staff. We don't speak French or Arabic. We honestly expected and prepared for a difficult time. From the moment we stepped into the reception they couldn't have been more helpful. Every staff member engaged with us and more so remembered us each day and couldn't have been more helpful. The piano bar staff and the staff at the aqua park were hilarious and honestly seems to really enjoy their jobs.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Christine & Friends wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Great Stay,Myself and 3 friends stayed here last month and highly recommend this hotel. Staff were attentive and friendly. Food was plentiful varied and delicious. Our arrival was delayed and although the dining room was closing were taken straight through to lunch and checked in very efficiently after we had eaten. Rooms were connecting which was a very pleasant surprise. Very clean bright and spacious. Cleaned daily with clean towels provided. Pool tools available for very small deposit.  Amenities at the hotel were as described and the location was excellent for visiting the local sites.  The friendly helpful staff were a delight and we would highly recommend the spa. We had a hammam and full body massage - luxurious. The Morrocan restaurant on site had to be booked and although we felt the food was no different to the dining room it is a beautiful building and enjoyable experience (maybe the music was a little intrusive). It was also an advantage that the children's pool play area and Aqua park were completely separate to allow us oldies to relax by the pool.  Would highly recommend and return.,Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scottishtraveller202

I literally hate it in this hotel. Should be a 2 or three star rooms are shabby and old lamp doesn‚Äôt work smell of old in them view of a building wall from the window. Loud drilling noise for 45 min from 9am.    Old man on reception rude constantly just shouting ignore you if you‚Äôre English you have to be French to be even acknowledged.    Ordered a drink and dinner (as it‚Äôs not an all inclusive self service) never had this before! We‚Äôd finished our dinner and still no drink!!!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,TonbridgeStevef wrote a review Mar 2020,50,First visit but certainly not the last,This was an early break to escape the english weather and it certainly achieved that with temperatures between 25 and 29 each day. We arrived late after a delay with transfer but reception gave us our all inc bands straight away to enable us to get dinner. Checking in was then really simple and we were shown to our room. We then had a great week with positives far outweighing negatives.  As is my usual format on reviews I will start with any negatives  The rooms are not designated non smoking so our room had a slight odour of smoke and the cushions on the bed definately held the smell. We had no view other than a pink wall but we were only in the room to sleep or change so not a problem. Our air conditioning was not good - sometimes actually heating the room although set on cool we then had to turn this off completely as there was an over powering smell of paint from where they were decorating further into the hotel. There is no shower curtain so water did elope into the bathroom.  Information from reception and around the hotel was poor especially for non French guests we only knew about the 2 al la carte restaurents from the reviews. The young guy at the aqua park bar is obviously new and learning on the job but was often left alone with a big queue whilst his suited superior tapped away on his phone. We felt that the animation team were the poorest we have found in 8 visits to Marrakesh the only activities we saw was the daily aqua gym and all they wanted to do was converse with the young ladies around the pool. The main issue around the waterpark was the loud music that was being played that really wasnt conjusive with the demograpghic of families with very small kids and older couples with continual rap being played  All minor gripes really compared to the positives. At meal times we were looked after so well by 2 marvelous ladies- saved our table outside drinks bread etc brought to table and topped up nothing too much. The food most days was exceptional for all inc lamb chops on bbq superb kebabs whole roast turkeys and even roast pork. Very good drink selection 5 cocktails decent wines and cold beer . Lovely steak meal in Italien and Morrocan was very good although underused.  The water in the main pool was cold but in 29 degrees it will feel cold certainly didnt keep me out of it. Water at waterpark was warmer and swim up bar was a good addition even if a little neglected by staff.  The cleaner who looked after our room went above and beyond - thouroughly cleaned every day and towel surprises left for us.  The hotel is only a 15 minute walk from the main sq 10 min to Mcdonalds or Burgerking/ Menara mall if needed.,Date of stay: February 2020,,tonbridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonbridgeStevef

On this visit the room didn't have a balcony but we only slept there so it wasn't an issue.  Check in was easy and as we arrived late they had kept dinner for us. The all inclusive package is very good value and no drinks are watered down.  The dining room has a variety of meals fishbeefchicken salads pasta I wanted soup one night and although this was not available our waiter went and got me some!!  There are 2 pools one quite no music and the aqua park great for kids the animation team were friendly but as we wanted a quiet holiday we didn't engage with them so I can't comment.  We had dinner one night in the Italian restaurant which is also on the all inclusive and this was excellent. Our food was well cooked and there was a live singer not rushed and also good service.  In the main dinning room our waiter Harim abdeljalil who has looked after us every time we visit was exceptional anything we wanted we got!! Thank you  Abderazakabdelhadinadine in the piano bar were very efficient and professional.  Soufiane at the pool bar was also professional.  Everyone was nice around the hotel and very helpful.

The hotel has a relaxed atmosphere with friendly helpful staff (special mention to Hajer our maid). The food was lovely: varied tasty and beautifully presented. Unfortunately the pool was still too cold for swimming but the surrounding area was perfect for quiet sunbathing. The aqua park next door kept the younger guests well occupied!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,RobertVesters(NL) wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Vacation Marrakech 18-02-2020,Last month we decided to visit the labranda rose aqua Park. We had a great stay and we will return back for sure! The staff is doing a great job fun entertainment crew great kitchen and restaurant staff and friendly people helping us with everything at the hotel reception! In my life I visit at least 100 hotels in different country's. As well as the more expensive hotels such as : four seasons hotels sheraton hotels peninsula hotels Hilton hotels etc. But I think these hotels still have a lot to learn in various ways. Sometimes the prices are way to expensive for what the service is. Before booking we did read a lot of reviews but seeing how some of the guest behaved everything was totally clear for us. Some people should just not go on any vacation because they behave like animals! When arriving in the hotel the staff did everything to please us and that's what they did! I want to thanks especially the hotel manager for helping us in every possible way and also the boy working as a waiter in the hotel restaurant named : Badr. He has an all seeing eye and he understands exactly what he is doing he is a great guy! to be honest I think he should be promoted because some of the other people can learn a lot from this guy. We both work in the hotel/restaurant business and we have a busy life so when we booked the vacation we really needed a place to relax and enjoy before going back into the busy lifestyle. Thanks to all people from the labranda rose hotel and we will see you soon!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Rob wrote a review Feb 2020,10,Won't stay here again.,Wouldn't stay here again.    Things to bear in mind based on my experience here:    1. They charge rooms per person (unlike many overseas hotels that charge per room). Make sure your booking is correct to say number of people staying. My reservation was booked through work and they chose 1 adult but my partner was traveling with me so the hotel charged me more for an extra person. Not impressed by this at all. Straight away I felt everyone in Morrocco is trying to rip you off as soon as you leave the airport.    2. There are no separate smoking and non-smoking rooms. Our first room smelled like cigarette smoke so had to get it changed. (Note to hotel management: smoking is bad for you so consider separate non smoking rooms like other overseas hotels).    3. There are no complimentary tea and coffee in the rooms....    4. They only supply basic toiletries. Soap shampoo and conditioner. There's no body wash or lotion.    5. You can hear what's happening in the hotel lobby as the noise travels upwards. Given it's a water park/ resort there are plenty of kids and you can hear them.    There are a lot of things this hotel can improve on....

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,RossDAber wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Lovely hotel,Second time at this hotel. Rooms were beautiful. We stayed with our 3 daughters so got given 2 rooms with joining doors this was perfect for us. The reception staff are amazing and very helpful. The staff in dining room are great expecially with the kids. The piano bar staff are friendly some don't speak the best of English but dont expect them to and are very patient. The entertainment team are amazing and always interact with the kids. The only negative with the exception of one young barman is the pool bar staff the seem to have a genuine dislike for English speaking people however this did not spoil anything just something you maybe want to review. The pool are is great and spent many wonderful hours enjoying it.  The food is great and always plenty of choice.    The only downside was when I used the atm at reception and tried to withdraw 2000dh (¬£166) and no money came out to be told it was because it ran out of money. However the money was deducted from my account. Nobody was willing to take responsibility for this and I'm left out of pocket.

We did have a problem with our room 518 as there was a caberet bar nearby open till 5am and the music kept us awake. The next day we told reception and they moved us to a new room (202) straight away. This new room it was very quiet and peaceful at night. The Aqua Park and pools were awesome too. We had lots of fun going down the slides. I would recommend this hotel. Amazing value for money. Great location just be ready to barter with the taxi drivers if you need a ride.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Gidius-1950 wrote a review Jan 2020,20,Be Careful for the false bills!,FRIST THING FIRST: LABRANDA HOTELS CHARGED FROM US 1200 DIRHAM (112-‚Ç¨)FOR A NEW YEAR DINER WHICH WE DID NOT HAVE AT ALL. INSTEAD WE HAD OUR DINER AT ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN BUFFET FORM WHERE CATS WERE WALKING ON TABLES.    THIS CAN BE ONLY CALLED A SCAM . I see that this Hotel chain does not care for the correct handling of their guests at all and scamming their guests.  The new year gala diner costed 80-‚Ç¨ per person(Not 600 Dirham I do not get where they made up that 1200 dirham for 2 people) and two girls sold those tickets and registered room numbers. So we did not have a gala diner at all  instead we had our diner at Italian restaurant in buffet form where cats are walking on the tables.  How it is possible in a big hotel chain such as Labranda Hotels group can happen  I do not understand at all. Because I booked this holiday at Labranda by relaying on their name not to get Scammed for a dinner which we did not get while those tickets were sold.    Except  our disappointing story above the all in concept of the hotel not comparable to its counterparts in Turkey or Spain. Especially all in guests are treated as 3. Class guest (Because you get drinks in plastic glasses) which is very sad.    Except than all in concept  hygiene is good compared to Moroccan standards and room are ok though outdated.    Breakfast is always same but it is almost everywhere is same. We have never lunched in the hotel where I ca not give my comments. The only positive point diner was quite ok. Because after reading all the negative reviews I had really doubted about the dinner. Happily dinner is the only positive memory I will remember this hotel.    My advise book it only bed an breakfast or half board for a short stay and NEVER PAY ANY BILL IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT.

We arrived a little early for check in so had to wait about an hour no problem we sat by the pool and had a couple of drinks. We were room only which was clean and perfectly adequate. We had requested a kettle but this wasn't provided. However had taken travel kettle so we were ok. The fridge wasn't working but we didn't really need one. We found all the staff extremely friendly and accommodating and special thanks to Nadina who looked after us well at the bar and provided free bar snacks. The hotel is quiet at this time of year and as we were busy and the water was cool we didn't take advantage of the Aqua Park. Location is fine only short ride from airport and about 30 minute walk to main square. Check out time is 12.00 noon and as our flight wasn't until 9.00pm We paid 40 euro to keep room until 6.00pm which we thought a bit pricey.

Negatives included a lengthly check in process where we were asked to fill in little forms which generally hotels do themself thereafter we were sitting around for quite a while which was disappointing also the indoor pool was chargeable which was a shame.

Upon arrival the staff and service was very good polite and professional. We had the half board breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was boring as the same thing was served every day but dinner was really good. The biggest upset for us was the indoor pool the whole reason we chose this hotel was for the indoor pool for our 2 and half year old daughter due to the off season period the weather was not that great. We were told by reception that we had to pay to use the indoor pool as it was not part of the hotel but was part of the spa in the hotel. Nowhere did it say we had to pay when we booked the hotel. So this was very annoying.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zahid5889

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,welltravelledoap wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Great Winter break,Just spent a week at the hotel. It was clean and I agree with others that the breakfast and lunch staff were great but the evening staff were a little abrupt and less helpful. The food was good the best all inclusive I have had. The bar staff were friendly but I also thought it was silly that you had to book a day in advance to use the pool snack bar especially out of season when the hotel is not busy. There are two restaurants you can use on the all inclusive package one Morrocan and one Italian. Both were good and made a nice change from wiring for the buffet.  The hotel is in a good location a short walk from the centre.. I will be going back as it was a really unexpectedly good stay.,Date of stay: November 2019,,Blackpool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/welltravelledoap

The hotel was lovely and clean and most of the staff were helpful and polite especially the breakfast and lunchtime staff The evening meal time staff could learn a lot from them. A couple of points that would have made the stay even better would be not having to book the day before for the snack bar the snack bar was empty and we were fully inclusive but was turned away due to not booking or we could have eaten there but would of had to pay ??? And the other point would be having more announcement and entertainment in English they seemed to cater for the french and German but we as English had to struggle to understand the entertainment. All in all it was a nice hot break and we are going back so wasn‚Äôt that bad.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluemoonjane

Our room was very comfortable and spotless clean. Asked for a room with a balcony and were moved as soon as one became available reception staff were very friendly.  Had a wonderful waitress in the restaurant who went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.  Piano bar staff were friendly and we never waited long for a drink. I‚Äôd read many reviews about the drink being watered down but it was strong enough for us.  Animation team were very friendly and sociable.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,jt12345678aa wrote a review Nov 2019,10,"If you have other options, use them",If you take the budget deal (we found a room for 50‚Ç¨ on booking.com) then everything in the hotel is paid extra which we weren't informed of properly even though we visited the hotel before we made the booking online and we were told the hotel was an all inclusive resort. The only thing included in our stay was the outside pool but that wasn't much since the water was far too cold to actually go swimming in the winter months. The inside pool is 10‚Ç¨ extra the fitness also the spa of course even more the breakfast is 8‚Ç¨ extra and the all inclusive dinner or lunch is 20‚Ç¨ or 30‚Ç¨ extra we forgot exactly the exact number per person of course.

No kettle in the room And having to pay a deposit to have one (surely this is just normal to have one in the room?!... well in most hotels anyways!)- there was also no process to this at all as when departing expecting our deposit back my partner had to follow someone around for 15mins for them asking everyone if they have the money to give us (complete scam!- luckily we got our money back)..... then the fact we reported our fridge not working when we arrived at 3pm and not having it fixed until 7pm ( which yes we had to ask many times! And he my partner had to leave the room several times to have this fixed and also had to wait at reception until it was done) room was clean - maid was very good  however the room itself was very UNfour star and view was a nice roof.... :( food in restaurant was ok  basic but chefs and staff were friendly. In all not a hotel I would ever go back to  in fact the first night was so appalled at how we were treated were very close to checking out and finding a new hotel ... not a great start to the holiday but none the less Marrakesh was a brilliant place!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,louisa lo wrote a review Nov 2019,20,Not great! Honest review from someone who does budget all inc packages,Food-  Breakfast-is limited to a couple of cereal bread cheese ham salad omelette and pastries.    Lunch- book lunch at the pool bar- you must book or you can‚Äôt eat there! It‚Äôs table service and 3 courses.    Dinner - very limited! Usually a couple of meats some veg rice cous cous and salad. If you get here late then there may not be much left as they don‚Äôt replenish until things have gone.    If you are someone who is looking for British food in an all inclusive- you won‚Äôt find much here.    Room- basic and not many of them have balcony‚Äôs. Apparently the 6th floor have been refurbished. You can smoke in the rooms so they are a bit smelly and even if you don‚Äôt smoke in them the smells comes in from other rooms. The doors to the bathrooms do not fully close there is hair dryers. People have clothes shoes and electrics stolen whilst we were here    Communal areas- are very morrocan and traditional which is lovely. You can smoke in all the communal areas inside and out and lots of people do! So the entertainment at night is smelly and smoky. The lounge area is often a place where people relax with coffee and smoke and chat- it‚Äôs hard to escape (I sound like a moany non smoker I know!)    Staff- the bar restaurant and reception staff are rude and unhelpful! The bar staff are not interested in serving one was on his phone whilst I was just standing waiting at the bar! The restaurant staff are just as uninterested in helping guests!    Pools- lovely and lots of loungers    There is no map of the hotel no one explains the additional restaurants that you have to book or what is and isn‚Äôt not included!    Im not someone who spend a lot of money on their holidays and I have been to lots of 3/4* hotels.

Thanks to Mr. Abdelghani essaid.  Also special thanks to the reception Ms. Hafida.  Few down points evening restaurant waiters has to learn some customer service skills how to be polite & not make customer wait long to get a table clean or waiting for water or a drink for long time that you will have to remind them not expectable.

In general staff were friendly and courteous and food was good as long as you accept it‚Äôs not English. Suited us we wanted Morocco food and that‚Äôs what we got lovely tagines rice and cous cous etc. A few down points. Check in was awful 90 minutes queuing. Food runs out and is not replaced you have to go early for full choice. Some evening waiters do not want to be there and have no interest in cleaning your table whereas the morning and lunch staff would always greet you with a smile and great service. Spirits were watered down quite significantly. Beer was fine. Wine is drinkable let‚Äôs leave it at that! We would still go back wouthout a shadow of a doubt but I always believe in critique so hotel can improve. Also if booking trips do it via trip advisor not the hotel much cheaper. Airport is 10 minutes by taxi. Hotel to souk/main square is 50 drm ( ¬£5) If going up the Atlas Mountains wear good shoes and a coat cold up the top!

Day 3. No more.  So far (in an all inclusive hotel) they have run out of beer 3 times. The hotel directory says one thing reception staff say another. My husband has been told to basically take drinks from one side to the other to get them filled because it is too much trouble for the bar staff to fill with rum then walk the 5 yards to the coke dispenser to top it up. They were more interested in watching the football. The restaurant staff are just as bad. When asked if there was any more butter he was snubbed with ""Tsk it's over there!"" It wasn't. The kitchen staff got some eventually.  Look I know we're here in low season but still I expected more.  Slopey shoulders; the lot of them.  Seriously running out of beer!!!!!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,SEfamily wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Around about average,I wanted to love this place the weather and location was perfect for our 5 night break however day 1 the kids club lost my child. The first time I've ever left my 6 yr old took him at 9.30 and filled out all the contact form with my/his details but when I went back to collect him 30 mins before the end of the morning session he wasn't in kids club the guy then said we'll check the playground next perhaps he's playing football? not there. We found him alone in the swimming pool. He said everyone just disappeared so he didn't know what to do. I think language was the problem nobody explained to him what was going on or what was expected of him - all other children were French. I didn't leave him again.  The food was also an issue for us I'm not sure if it was because we're off season but at dinner all the meals were 'tagine' style cooked meat and veg all in a pot excepting one evening they had pizza slices. This doesn't suit my taste or my 6yr old so unfortunately we had bread as we're both not keen on salad either. Lunch was pretty much the same so we booked into the pool bar each day. They have a set menu of 4/5 dishes and we really enjoyed the chicken breast so ate that each day. Despite being all inclusive they also had a pay menu so when i was particularly hungry after no evening dinner I bought myself a pizza however it tasted like a frozen one from this bar. We didn't drink alcohol so couldn't comment of that.  The room needed updating (453) unfortunately we were placed over the service road so were woken by the bin men and some deliveries. We came back several times to find the bathroom flooded with water which smelt like urine - we never did work out exactly where it came from but after the first time of getting it cleaned up we just started doing it ourselves.  Animation guys were all friendly and worked hard during the day we saw the kids entertainment in the bar but no other entertainment for adults-not sure if there was and we missed it or there wasn't anything?  I booked a room for the night on booking.com as our flight wasn't until 9 in the evening and I wanted use of our room until we left. When I went to reception to ask if we could remain in the same room and pay our room tax the first girl didn't understand the second boy said the hotel was full! it was only the third man who understood and confirmed we could stay in our room.

The hotel looks good and has everything you need to have a good stay. Our room was well cleaned and maintained daily as were the pools and communal areas.    After seeing the reviews I decided to go for bed and breakfast. I wanted to try the local food and be encouraged to go beyond the walls of the hotel. I also like my food and could not face being disappointed or having to get up time and time again for small drinks. We brought brita filter bottles with us and when we asked for water the staff at all bars gave us water from the bottle and never a tap.    The breakfast was good the queuing for pancakes was always worth the wait wide selection of infused water alongside juice and Moroccan tea. Omelettes pastries cerealsbeans cooked veg and cold salad bar (with cheese and meat) were available.    Good selection of activities with a good animation team. We got involved and had plenty of fun if you are not fluent in French just let them know and they will speak in English also. The evening shows were fun and entertaining.    My only gripe was that the gym is run by the spa and therefore only opens at 9am. It is then split into two areas. Common machines such as the cross trainer are payable whilst the weights room is complimentry. I have travelled within Europe Africa and the Carribean but this is the first experience of having to pay to go to the gym or it remaining closed past 8am. I spoke with the manager who took my feedback on board so I do hope changes are made for future visitors. After the first few mornings I got used to the routine of the activities instead.    This hotel is in a good area lots of restaurants the mall is a ten minute walk and the Medina is a stroll away (30 minutes).

We also went on the Marrakech evening trip where we did a camel ride then dinner and a show in the dessert this was well worth the money pools at the hotel well pleasant and clean food at the restaurant very repetitive but no more so than any other all inclusive  Now on to the treatment of all inclusive guests! If you are all inclusive you get treated like a imposter...... when asked if you want alcohol in you‚Äôre cocktail you don‚Äôt even get a single measure it‚Äôs not even worth having it‚Äôs almost like the staff are paying for it out of there own money when people were asking for more to be put in it fell on deafs ears when the pool bar closes you get sent to a little area of the main bar where there is about 5 spirts to choose from and the main bar is only for people who are paying as they go! these people get proper glasses and proper measures this hotel is mainly french and if you‚Äôre not french don‚Äôt expect anything to be done for you we witnessed a waiter in the restaurant rip up a piece off paper and throw it in a English woman‚Äôs face just because she asked what the paper was for this particular waiter would of been sacked on the spot anywhere else his attitude stunk rude is a understatement couple of the staff nice but the majority rude as hell there is lots more I could moan about but I haven‚Äôt got the time all in all we would not go back to the labranda!

Great activities for children under 7 years mini club where you have to book children in. 4 fab pools poolside bars and Piano room. On sight photographer to capture precious holiday pics. And fantastic people very warm and friendly. Downside our bathroom didn't have a lock sliding door would only open 1 and a half foot to get and out. No drinks in fridges you have to ask the restaurant for water bottles. No electric sockets near the dressing corner so girls if your doing your hair a portable mirror extension cables is a must. Bathroom does have a hair dryer and connection for electric shaver. And there are no shops in the restaurant which isn't a problem there are plenty outside the Hotel. I only wished they had chips burgers and roast chicken nuggets and meatballs for children every day. And a variety of cereals in the morning. Children didn't like the food much. I suppose everyone has their own tastes.

The pool bar is very good with both Simohammad & Mustafa looking after us every day :) these two are amazing and a credit to the hotel.  The snack bar at the aqua Parc has to be booked the day before if you want to eat there. We did twice and on both occasions found the food ok. The main restaurant it seemed did not have as much choice for food compared to possibly August/September. For us the food wasn‚Äôt as good as we have had at other hotels but there is a choice each day and you could always find something to eat. We did eat out most evenings but this was personal choice. No fruit at breakfast which was strange. The hotel is a short walk from the shopping mall and a short taxi ride to the Carr√® Eden mall also. For location this hotel is perfect!! All in all we had a brilliant stay and we will be back next year for sure!,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsAirmiles

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Pete100 wrote a review Sep 2019,30,A few niggles but we would visit again.,Firstly let me say myself wife and daughter visited and would definately go again. Overall we really enjoyed the hotel There are issues to be fair but it is Morroco. Most of the staff are very friendly. Yes language is an issue but that is as more our fault than theirs. Food was a bit repetitive but you could always find something nice to eat. We didn't go to Morroco to eat Sunday Roasts and Full English so why people complain about their food is beyond me. Go to Benidorm!!! The room was ok Bathroom cleaned but room floor not swept. Cleaner did the towel on the bed with petals but forgot to leave loo rolls.  Pool areas lovely with a biq quiet pool and bar and two other pools with music playing and a bar. Music not too loud. We were all inclusive drinks basic but ok. Cocktails hit & miss. I ordered 3 the same and got 3 different looking drinks all tasted different but nice. I ordered alcohol free cocktails and the barman queried if I wanted alcohol in it I ordered alcoholic cocktails and had to remind him to put alcohol in it. Breakfast great lunch ok. Dinner was ok too. The head waiter in the outdoor section was all over us at first we had no currency at that point to tip him then he went miserable and pulled unpleasant faces at us. To be fair he looked miserable most of the time. We gave him a tip to cover both days the next day but damage was done. Ate inside after that under the care of waiter called Othman lovely fellow attentive and always smiling.  Met by a chap called Habib from the information team he showed us round the hotel and offered to help us with a transfer issue which he did. Thank you Habib. In fact thank you to all the staff. Yes some issues but we would go again.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteTW100
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,claireatty wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Good holiday,After reading the reviews I was absolutely dreading this holiday we arrived at the hotel 12.30 and got given our bands by lovely reception staff got told room wasn't ready so go and have dinner we went back to the reception and our room was ready 130 got took up to the room with suitcase and wow room was amazing.    All staff say hello I didn't come across anyone who didn't they said bonjour soon as I said hello they quickly changed to hello in English which is good as I don't speak French.... How people can call staff when they speak English is beyond me.    Restaurant is ok food bit repetitive but most all inclusives are some people you would think have never been fed the way they pile the food on the plates some people push in and then look at you like your in the wrong staff again great in there.    Pool area and aqua Parc fab can't fault it whatsoever entertainment was fab Simo was great with all the kids he even taught us to write our names in Arabic which is great (Claire grandad and Luke) thought he was amazing. Life guards around pools always looking around and keeping things clean and in order again can't fault them.    Only thing I thought was strange for an all inclusive you have to order pool side snacks the day before and there was no ice-cream for the kids or adultsespecially in the heat we had in August.    Only other downside is when you arrive you get shown around the hotel which is good so you know where to go and stuff but my god everytime they see you after that they want you too book days out. We went for a chilled holiday not to be hounded everyday.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Amie wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Don't believe everything you read!,"To be honest after reading the reviews of this hotel I was beginning to dread our holiday here but I couldn't have been more wrong. We had a fantastic time!    There are some parts of the bad reviews which are true. The language barrier can be a problem but I don't think this is ""racism"" as people have said. I speak enough French that I could communicate with the staff and most staff made an effort to speak English (if they could). It is a very English thing to expect everyone to speak English to us when we make no effort in return!    Our room was beautiful with a huge terrace with sun loungers and was spotless. The beds were really comfortable and although the noise from the street was loud we all slept really well. Our cleaner came every day with towels robes and toiletries and knocked on the door every day to check whether we needed anything else.    The staff were friendly and helpful apart from the reception we didn't experience anybody who didn't go out of their way to be kind and friendly. Particularly the lifeguards at the Aqua Park who were so lovely to our children.    We were all-inclusive and the food was probably the only negative we had It was all fine but repetitive. People tended to pile up massive plates for the whole family (pizza at dinner and pancakes at breakfast) so that there was none left by the time it was your turn which was frustrating. We went a little earlier for breakfast to avoid the crowds and that worked well. We booked the pool bar for lunch which was waiter service and that was a nice relief from the buffet. The Italian restaurant wasn't up to much in our opinion. I think they could definitely work on replenishing the buffet more quickly as this would have meant less hanging around waiting for food!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Nargis S wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Worse Hotel & Poor Service & Management,Before we get into this review I suggest you buy yourself a UV blue light and bring it to any hotel and shine it on the surfaces and sheets to find unseen dirtgerms and bacteria.    This hotel is not of international standards especially for Western European travellers.    In summary this is not a very good hotel please don't stay here the service is sub standard the food quality and hygiene is poor quality of the rooms is poor and the facilities aren't up to the expectations you pay for. The staff pushed my daughter into the lift and the way they speak to you is horrendous.    A detailed Review:  I arrived at in the hotel for 1.30 pm and did not get my room till 3.45 pm the check in time is 2pm.    Drinking water in the fridge you have to purchase it yourself. The air conditioning barely works and you can't leave the windows open as there is traffic noise all night until the early hours of the morning coming from out side.    The cleaning of the rooms is very bad with hair left on your floor and muck building up in the corner of the shower. The same sponge and brush used to clean the toilet bowl is used in the basin. The toilet is broken reported at the hotel stuff and they haven't done anything about it. They do not leave clean towels and after requesting them at least 10 times they still did not give us the right amount of towels for the number of guest staying. The air conditioning is non existent in the main hotel you roast in the restaurant area and the AC in the room hardly work.    Don't be fooled by the name it's not really an aqua park  having a few water slides does not equate to a water park.    There is one main restaurant where you have to queue for food for 30 minutes. The variety is poor and beware of uncooked meat being served. When the food runs out its does get replaced quickly you have to ask for the food to be refilled and it takes more than half an hour. The Italian restaurant within the hotel was booked for one month therefore no option for new coming guests to try out the food. So you're stuck with the only one option.    I will never come back here.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NS_London1234

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Jonny2211 wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Avoid if British,I landed 2 hours ago I'm so happy to be not just out this hell hole of a hotel but Morocco altogether. I've traveled many places around the world and this hotel is basically racist towards British! The reception ignored us on check inn and another english family until all the french/Muslim familys were sorted with rooms. Changing money normally they will count it out not this place just throw it at you its unbelievable. The rooms are pathetic no balcony no air con no British tv channel. The food selection is nothing short of horrific there not much to pick from but what is there is disgusting I couldn't face going the canteen it was feeding time at the zoo with the rest of the guests acting like they have never been fed. The only good point is the pools are ok although there was a big turd on the side if the kids splash pool one day the pool lads are ok the entertainment and life guardsall other staff are racist.thats my opinion I believe the staff in this hotel are racist towards British. It's a 2 star hotel at best.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Jay H wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Definitely NOT recommended!!,Firstly room that was initially offered was in very poor condition and nothing like advertised. We immediately asked for a better room as it was in need of serious refurb. Upper level rooms seem to be in better state. How they claim to be a 4 star hotel is beyond belief with a lot of amenities either broken or on its last legs like Air Conditioning not working properly faulty safe and flimsy entry card system. No tea/coffee kettle or mini bar.  If you don't know French or Arabic you will be at a disadvantage as it seems this time of year the hotel mostly caters for French or Arabs. Most of the staff seem to be overworked and discourteous with the exception of some of the animation team who did their best to smile and entertain. And if you are gonna exchange currency at reception make sure you count your money as you can be short changed.  Gets very noisy and loud late at night music till 4am!! . Very poor wifi in the rooms and intermittent connection problems.    We got half-board and although they do try to offer a variety of items it does get boring. Restaurant prices are extortionate and expect to wait in queues for popular items. Expect to see some guests jumping the queue and being plainly greedy rude and wasteful.  When a hotel has to charge 4 times the amount for a bottle of water even when u got inclusive you have to wonder surely it wouldn't effect their profits if they gave a free bottle for each table even 2 star hotels offer free water!!.    In all honesty they only thing good about this hotel is the aqua park which the kids enjoyed otherwise this experience would've ruined our holiday completely and enough to put you off Marrakech altogether.  You might get lucky and have a pleasant experience but last thing you want is to have your well earned expensive summer vacation ruined by choosing a hotel with so many unexpected problems.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zee3h
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,CeeN wrote a review Aug 2019,10,WORST HOTEL EVER!!!,Firstly i am totally confused as to how anyone can give this place more than 1 star. I have never stayed in such appalling conditions like i did last week in my life and i travel a lot. Arrived at the hotel @10am and was told we'd have to wait till 3pm for our rooms. Not even a bottle of water was offered as we waited. They even said we couldn't have lunch! We had reserved a family room with interconnecting rooms only to be told they couldn't find our reservation. So four people had to share a double room (2 on bed 1 on sofa and 1 on a folded bed). Disgusting not at all accommodating. They fobbed us off with tomorrow you'll get a room until we gave up on the 3rd day. Staff are extremely rude and do not care for the english speaking people just the french. Food is absolutely diabolical gave us an upset stomach. Even though we were half board we mainly ate out. People would push in front of you when getting food and argue. Was like a cattle market in the restaurants. I was shocked. I even woke up one morning (Eid) to see 7 goats get slaughtered on the hotel grounds for sacrifice. Is this the norm?    Best and only good thing about the hotel was the Aqua Parc (if you can call it that so small) My son would spend hours in there. Regardless i would never stay here again even if someone paid me.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldwidemovers3

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,jane s wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Horrendous hotel,Just got back from our holiday from rose aqua park and can honestly say if anybody tells me they are thinking about going to this hotel I would talk them out of it. The staff are rude and no help what to ever. I have been on a few all inclusive holiday and this one has to be the worse one yet. On our second night and third night at 10 o‚Äôclock the one bar you could get a drink from on your all inclusive ran out of beer the only snack bar around the pool area you had to book really for a snack you had to book ? And then there was 5 things on the menu you could have the other menu you had to pay for. Breakfast was horrendous it was like a cattle market everybody pushing and shoving we lived of bread omelette and pastries all week. One morning I was going to try the muesli until I watch a waiter crumbling it up with his dirty fingers whilst talking to the manager. Lunch in the main restaurant was the same people pushing and shoving with not much choose chips where like gold dust.  The only good thing about this hotel was the pool the kids had a great time in the pool. I would never return to this hotel and would advice others to not go ether I can‚Äôt believe how rude they are even the entertainment of a night for the kids was in french not once did they translate to English.

Arrived at 11.15am and was told to sit in the reception area and we would be called in approximately 15 minutes.    Our cases were taken by a porter which we thought would be to our room.    15 minutes later we were told our room would be ready at 2pm so we had a walk around the hotel still in our clothes we travelled in and not able to get to our suitcase and change into our swimmers as this had been taken away.    36 degrees in jeans and t shirt was a bit over layered to say the least.    Went to reception at 2 to be told another hour at least which was frustrating.    Went back at 3 and still wasn‚Äôt ready so kicked up a fuss and surprise was now ready until we went up there and 4 cleaners were blitzing it.    Room was lovely no complaints only the fact the air conditioning is next to useless. 27 degrees at night with no air con is a nightmare.    In the canteen I‚Äôve never seen vultures pile there plates up so high it‚Äôs crazy.    The drinks at the bar are warm even the bottled water is warm no fridges etc just left on the side to heat up.    Water park is great for kids    Tried to book the Italian restaurant to be told it‚Äôs reserved all week by a big group. How can it be reserved if we have paid for it in our all inclusive?

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Saima wrote a review Jul 2019,50,OUTSTANDING HOTEL!! TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!,When we arrived it was 2 am and we were greeted by some friendly members of staff who brought us some food to eat as they knew we had a delayed flight to Marrakesh and were more than willing to assist us with luggage etc. The Aqua Park is amazing Shout out to the Lifeguards and animation team who were willing to always assist and made our holiday really enjoyable with Water Polo Water Aerobics and a bit of Zumba dancing. We were all inclusive however a day before you stay at this hotel you do have to book on to other restaurants and the snack bar although the main restaurant was always available for you to eat. Food wise the main restaurant mostly serves moroccan based food such as Salad hummus etc. For breakfast there were beautiful Omelettes a lot of the food was French based and we didn't mind that at all. The snack bar had Burgers pizzas and a lot of english based food the Italian restaurants Lasagna was to die for! my little brother was special needs and knowing this the staff went out of their way to let him personalise his own pizza just the way he likes as he can be a bit particular. They are willing to help out any special needs children and can be very kind. The staff even went out of their way to plan a birthday surprise for me as they knew I came to Morocco for a birthday treat there was a cake that the chef prepared and they sang in many languages which was quite hilarious. The bar staff were always ready to deliver your drinks some even would bring them personally to your table. In the evening there was always entertainment such as DJ shows entertainment shows with a huge stage and lights!  The hotel was always clean and very hygienic the maids were always there and would clean everyday they would make swans and love hearts on our beds which we found very sweet of them our room size was amazing we had double beds two flat screen tv's walk-in wardrobe and the shower was always hot never to disappoint. There's a mall up the road which was just a 10 min walk and mcdonalds and KFC down the road so even if you wanted to eat out and were fed up of the food the hotel is right in the city not to mention Jamaa el Fina just being around the corner and lots of camels to see on the street!  The day we left we were so sad to leave and would definitely recommend this to everyone there are a load of bad reviews about this hotel but just ignore them. We came from the UK for just 7 nights however would definitely look into staying at this hotel again.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/703sz

Then we did a Shopping Tour.... A LOAD OF RUBBISH... we were taken to one shop and stayed there for about an hour then left back to the hotel hardly any fun in that.    Food at the hotel needs much more variety especially for people my age and kids always Tagines and Vegetables :( . Also queues for some of the meats are ridiculous if you are behind a fat French Person they will just take all of the meat and leave you with nothing !

We never encountered any staff members being ignorant.Yes there are a lot of French in this hotel but we didn't get treated any different.The pools were great especially the aqua parc.We did have a few days around the larger pool but the sunbeds aren't as comfy.The pool areas and gardens are well kept.There is gardeners working allday long with cleanersbar staff and waiters also working long hours.The animation team do a good job making sure everyone has a great time with different activities on each day.The food was good most days.Lunch seemed to be the best meal of the day.We booked the Italian restaurant one night.This was ok but there was only about 8 items on the menu for mains.It was a buffet for your starters and desserts.We didn't book the Moroccan restaurant as we didn't really fancy it.With lunch and dinner you get bottled water and a choice of wines and soft drinks.You can only get drinks in the evening from the outside pool bar.During the day from the aqua parc pool bar also.It does get very noisy during the afternoon from the animation teams music but you get used to it.Our room over looked the larger pool.This does not shut till 7pm so if your wanting to sleep in the afternoon or have an early night then take ear plugs as I did.The pool bar shuts between 11-11.30.The music is loud till then too.Most rooms don't have balcony so if you want one state this when booking.There was plenty of sunloungers so no need to get up at the crack of dawn to put your towels down.Even at 10am we didn't struggle.The hotel itself is clean but could do with a little updating.Apparently they are doing some rooms up on some floors but this didn't affect us.They are doing a hotel up next door but didn't notice much noise.We booked the Moroccan markets and Souks.Please if u book this trip book it through meeting point in the hotel and with a tour guide.Im glad we didnt just go on our own in a taxi.It was a bit daunting and with the heat it was an eye opener.There is a shop across the road that sells toiletriesdrinkscigarettes and ice lollysetc.....If you turn right from the hotel there is a shopping mall 15 mins walk down the road.Turn left from the hotel and 15 mins down the road there are other restaurantsetc....and a McDonald's which we visited one evening.Across the road from the hotel we tried a restaurant called Cafe'l'Opera.This was lovely.With drinks and a main and 2 side orders for 4 of us it worked out around ¬£21.I would recommend people to try this hotel as for the price we paid it was worth it.We didn't have any problems.If u greet the staff with a bonjour and a merci and give them a smile you will be fine.Treat people how you want to be tret it goes a long way.This hotel is ideal only 10 mins from the airport.Ignore the negative reviews I would.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Morecambe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1971Lorraine

The hotel ya having major work done during our visit to a point were it was impossible to sleep later than 6am and no rest until 4pm when the work stopped we had a look at the work the whole 3rd floor was having bathrooms replaced. We were lied to by staff when we tried to make a complaint we were physically intimidated by one member if staff to a point were he was told not to return to work while we were in resort. Then on our final full day they offered to drop our hotel but we would if had to pay charges and pay for transfers so we declined. Over all I would never use this group if hotels again. We were not told about the amount of work and would of swooped before arrival if we knew.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Beverley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T621UUpaulap

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,hottieevs wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Not your normal all inclusive,The hotel itself is spotless and feels Moroccan from the moment you walk in the staff where all friendly I can‚Äôt understand the negative reviews regarding the staff as we got the feeling they couldn‚Äôt do enough despite being slow to do it. I think if you try to be polite and try to attempt some basic French this will go a long way ‚Äì It is a French speaking hotel and the animation/evening entertainment is all in French however they do try to involve you and the atmosphere is fun  We stayed here for a week at the start of July and had booked all inclusive however this isn‚Äôt the all inclusive you may be accustomed to - You are only allowed drinks from 2 bars both pool bars and they serve them in small plastic cups. You are also only given bottles of water at lunch and dinner time in the main restaurant the room has a fridge but this isn‚Äôt topped up during your stay so getting a drink of water felt difficult. I resorted to ordering 4 cups of water a time and would drink them there and then the cups are so small.  There is a small shop opposite where you can buy bottles of water lays ice creams etc which is so handy/stopped us dying of thirst!  If you walk out the hotel and turn right there is a 10 min walk to the mall which has plenty of different shops and places to eat ‚Äì By the end of the week we fancied a burger and chips and stopped at the American grill before the mall which I recommend  The food in the hotel was nice but very repetitive by the end of the week. Breakfast had a selection of pastries pancakes including a big bowl of melted Nutella! And there is a cooked option of sausages scrambled egg tomatoes etc all of which was nice. Lunch and Dinner where usually a variation of each other with various meats and vegi options again nice but repetitive.  The staff in the outside section of the restaurant are slow and it feels impossible to get a drink on a night ‚Äì we asked for orange juice and advised not available at tea time only fizzy drinks and wine ‚Äì I don‚Äôt have the waitress name but a female waitress who works breakfast and lunch only was so lovely and made our stay comfortable by having our usual drinks/bread ready and waiting for us on our table wish she had been working a night too!  The rooms are spacious and comfortable the beds where made up daily and the towels changed too ‚Äì Tip; Don‚Äôt put your room card on your phone as it stops it working this happened multiple times before they told us that was why the cards stopped working!  I visited the gym daily in a morning as it doesn‚Äôt have air con it would be unbearably hot to try and train at a different time of day ‚Äì The gym is very basic with dumbbells only up to 10kg a smith with enough plates but don‚Äôt expect to be smashing any PBs and a few machines including leg extension and lat pull down.  The aqua park was great fun and was great at cooling you down the sunbeds where also comfier at the aqua park pool. If you wanted a bit more peace and quiet the main pool was quiet and relaxed until 5pm when the water slides closed.  I wouldn‚Äôt choose to stay at this hotel again however if we did go back we would do B&B or half board.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hottieevs
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Allan M wrote a review Jul 2019,20,Different,We stayed at Labranda Rose for 4 days in June. When we arrived at the hotel at 12.45 we were told our room wasn't ready and wouldn't be ready until 2 pm. Since we were all inclusive we got our wrist bands put our cases in the holding room beside reception and explored the hotel. We decided to grab something to eat in the restaurant. We were greeted by a friendly waiter who showed us our table and asked what we wanted to drink. We ordered water and went to the buffet. We came back to water and rose wine in glasses. The waiter couldn't do enough for us and was looking for a tip. I said we would return later that evening. We eventually got into our room at 3pm and went for a swim. Later we went for dinner and the friendly waiter again was so helpful so after dinner i gave him a tip and from that point on he never spoke to us and we had to get our own cutlery and drinks. The same waiter by the end of our stay was in a foul mood with everyone in the dining room and the oh so friendly waiter had turned into a monster.    The pool area was good although most of the parasols didnt work and people were running around with nails to stick in them to get them to stay up. The pool bar closed at least an hour before the pool did. The snack bar didn't serve you unless you had been to reception the day before and reserved the snack bar. I have never been all inclusive and been stopped from getting something to eat or drink within the complex.    The evening entertainment was in French as it was the language spoken by all staff. It was weird 90s songs with zumba every night.The poolside bar was always filled by what seemed like locals who sat and drank wine smoked cigarrettes and had a banquet everyday and when hotel guests went for a drink it seemed as though you were not suppossed to be in that area. It was very intimidating.    Meals were varied but not a lot of selection but we did manage to find something to eat every meal time just. We did try the Italian one night and were made to feel unwanted with the attitude of am going to have to do something now that you are here. Starter and desert was the exact same as the main restaurant and the main course was a poor effort of a pizza not very a la carte. The bar area was the area that never failed to please.You never waited for very long to be served and nothing was to much trouble.    The rooms did what you needed and were always clean and fresh towels everyday buy its obvious that the hotel needs money spent on it . It is definately not a 4 star hotel possibly a low standard 3 start would be closer.    We did notice lots of hotels around the city with flags outside and there are not to many with British flags and Labranda Rose didnt have one either. I would suggest you find one that caters for the British. Marrakesh is an amazing place and i will return one day but unfortunately i will not be returning to the Labranda Rose.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stranraer, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allanmU9824OF

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,pinkmumsieblue wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Lovely stay,After reading some of the reviews here before I went I was a bit apprehensive about my stay! But turns out I was wrong to feel that. We had a lovely stay!! Room was lovely and clean with air con. Was confusion of rooms booked when arrived but staff quickly sorted it out! I read that staff were quite ignorant to the English as they preferred french guests but I did not feel like this. All the staff here was friendly and was always nice in assisting with anything we needed. There was one older guy who I think was in charge of the pool or the boss of the pool who my friends had quite an unfriendly experience with. The entertainers around the pool were brilliant tried very hard to get you involved in the activities or just sat and chatted to you. The pool with its water parc and slides was fun for young and old!! My only negative was the pool snacks bar.... you had to pre book a place the day before you want to eat there then if ur all inclusive you have a little menu with a handful of dishes unless you wanted to pay and see the full sized menu. The buffet restaurant was good and food on offer was lovely. Don‚Äôt expect a full English brekkie in the morning though! :-) but there chorizo sausages was delicious! All staff I came across was friendly hardworking and helpful! Outside of the hotel - across the road there is a tiny shop (inbetween the cafes) that sells the majority of your needs. If your stood with your back to the hotel and walk right at the top of the road there is a big shopping mall!! It‚Äôs brilliant! On the top floor is all for families with loads for children to do and outside has lots of different eateries (including Burger King!) Paul‚Äôs bakery here is absolutely definitely worth a visit!! There cakes are out of this world!!  I would definitely return here!!!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Colwyn Bay, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkmumsieblue

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Lidi H wrote a review Jul 2019,10,Racist and rude staff!,After having finished university my two girl friends and I decided to celebrate by going to Marrakech to relax and enjoy ourselves. We were greeted by a man whom we thought was friendly and pleasant from first appearances. He sat us down and started explaining what excursions you can book with the hotel and when breakfast was etc. I was sat in the middle and he completely ignored me. The disregard for me due to my ethnicity was completely and utterly obvious I felt degraded and inferior. Throughout this whole 'welcome talk; I came to realise what a complete and utter ignorant and uneducated man he was.    Throughout the 6 days here when I went to the bar the bar staff would chant words based purely on my race which I think is appalling! I have never in my life felt so disgusted by another person.    Having paid a lot of money to come to this hotel to enjoy myself and celebrate. I was faced with several racist and demeaning staff.    I would never return to Morocco ever again after having had this kind of shameful treatment. If I were you I‚Äôd find a hotel with staff that care and want to make your experience enjoyable.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Sally F wrote a review Jun 2019,40,An amazing stay!!,I can not believe the mixed reviews given to this hotel. It was a short distance from the airport (70drh maximum) and very close to the markets and the general strip (30drh taxi). The hotel was beautiful with different pools for adults children and slides aswell. The rooms were also beautiful with lovely and comfortable beds a spacious bathroom and a large couch like area underneath the window. The staff are super friendly they cannot do enough for you and the food is lovely. The lunchtime food is much nicer than the tea time food but there is a huge range of Moroccan dishes tagines salad and a large variety of meats and freshly cooked dishes of the day. My only issues are that some of the waiters (especially one) would harass us every night for a tip and was impolite when we said we hadn‚Äôt brought our bags down. We also made friends with a woman who had travelled alone and had waiters and other staff making her uncomfortable and trying to get to her room. Also the drinks on the all inclusive had little to no alcohol in them which was annoying.  All in all the stay was amazing I would definitely recommend it to a friend in a family or couple environment.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyF1329

I don‚Äôt know where these comments come from we were always served in the order we came to the bar etc in and never were any french people give priority over us. Our room was spotlessly clean and cleaned every day. The food was always fresh and plentiful. There were plenty of excursions and activities to keep you busy if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,MartRobb wrote a review Jun 2019,50,"Unbelievable value, great facilities and some fantastic staff",First point I need to make is to respond to the anti-English comments pure nonsense. If the staff treat you poorly it's probably because you treat them poorly. I'm not saying all the staff were brilliant and/or friendly because the weren't some were slow and miserable but they were the same with everyone. In a whole weeks stay not once was I served after someone who was paying or of another nationality either for food in the restaurants or for drink in any of the bars.    The staff speak much better French than English so they'd obviously strike up more of a conversation with them however I must give special praise to Abdel from the animation team who always came to see how we were and come for a chat (I imagine helping with his english) Jamelia in the buffet stood out for her friendliness and service with a smile each day the best barmen in the place Reda (most proactive and best beer pourer) and Mohamed. Unfortunelty I didn't get his name but the man from the meeting point lobby who helped us at check in was brilliant and spoke fantastic English.    Right now onto the hotel itself we arrived in the morning after a short transfer. We were checked in very quickly but told our room wouldn't be available until 1 (pretty standard check in time in hotels around the world) in the mean time tho they gave us our all inc wristbands and stored our luggage in the store behind reception.    The room was immaculate not a single broken/faulty element. There was a fridge (not mini-bar like some people bizzarely expect) with water topped up daily bathroom well maintained with strong water pressure. Cleaners came in daily and did a great job as well as keeping the hotel corriders / lobbies extremely tidy. One thing to point out is that very few rooms have a balcony we weren't bothered by this when booking but were lucky enough to be given one    The pool areas were brilliantly set out with a quiet(er) pool on one side of the hotel adjacent to the buffet restaurant with a pool bar on the opposite side serving coffee tea soft drinks beer wine rum vodka gin tequila and a selection of cocktails (as well as more for paying guests ie. imported). The pool area was kept clean and tidy and there was more than enough sunbeds for everyone (probably enough for 4 each). The only disappointing part was when rude guests played their own music through portable speakers they weren't told to turn them off  The other pool had a swim up bar (which was never manned) a bar and a snack bar (which needed to be booked the day before they aren't excluding people). Also by this pool were the water slides which were great fun and enjoyed by guests of all ages. One confusing part was their opening hours as they seemed to vary day to day although they were always on in the afternoon and ran until 6 alongside that was a fantastic kids play area with mini slides waterfalls sprays and a bucket drop.  I didn't use it because I'm happy outsde in the heat but there's also an indoor pool which they charge extra for it did look well kept from what I could see.    The food was ok to good the options changed every day with a range of meats pastas vegetables and local dishes as well as a good selection of fruits and deserts which again changed each day.    The location is pretty good short transfer of around 15 minutes 20/25 minute walk to Jema el Fna the mosque and the medina as well as this there's dozens of local shops restaurants and a shopping mall within 5 minutes walk    To sum up for the amount paid it is a fantastic hotel I would have given it the same score if I'd paid twice as much. The facilities are brilliant and well maintained and the lobby area is beautiful. The staff are mostly friendly although let down by a few there isn't a bias or a superiority complex and you'll come to see that unless you have a chip on your shoulder.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Carlisle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartRobb

I can defiantly recommend it and we will be returning. We are a English non french speaking family of three and the staff have never been rude to us and been nothing more than accommodating. I think people just need to remember that Morocco is a french speaking country so the staff are all fluent speaking and are a bit limited in English We opted for the all inclusive and drinks are also included in the aqua park part of the hotel ( I read reviews stating otherwise) Food caters for all nationality‚Äôs and children. Rooms clean and comfy tv Channels all in french but WiFi strong in room so we took our I pad and watched Netflix. No mini bar but fridge with bottles of water fruit and biscuits.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Sheila wrote a review Jun 2019,20,Very disappointed,We chose this hotel to visit Morocco for the first time  The hotel was very close to the airport but had been an early flight so we had been on the road for about 6 hours + when we arrived at the hotel reception asked the ‚Äòrep‚Äô to welcome us as our room would not be ready until 2 pm ( it was 9.30 am )  The rep showed us into breakfast and asked us to wait in reception area when finished and he would explain the different aspects of the hotel. We waited an hour before going to find him and were told he would be with us soon. . We waited another hour still in our travelling clothes and clutching hand luggage and again approached him while the rep stayed glued to his mobile phone. We waited another 30 mins and decided to ask reception again if there was a room ready now. We waited another 30 mins and were then showed to our room. We had now been at hotel sat in reception for 3 hours +  The room was not at all like the pictures no morrocan furnishings  no terrace  no balcony and looking in need of renovation . The bathroom in particular was very shabby and in serious need of update. the toilet was cracked and the bath surround was very stained  The room was as clean as possible and I cannot praise the cleaners enough.  The bar staff were either great or surly. The drinks were watered and I think the gin was made in the local bathtub it was awful  The food was plentiful but a bit repetitive and we were very disappointed in the morrocan restaurant and the international/Italian.  My biggest complaint was that the non inclusive guests always took priority even if the staff were halfway through your order they would stop and serve the non inc first. Very annoying  One morning I was waiting for the two fried eggs I had ordered and just as they were ready they were whisked off by a waiter to a non inc guest . I was offered two that had been pushed to one side as they had broken and had over cooked yolks. I said I would prefer fresh ones and although the waiter did prepare them he was not happy. Nor was I !!!  The markets were fascinating but the vendors VERY aggressive and we were deliberately led to shops the guide recommended. These were overpriced and we felt very pressured to buy ( guide ? Kickback from shop on sales The taxis and vendors were very keen to take advantage of unaware tourists  We will not return to Morroco  We will never recommend this hotel,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nightmareholiday
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Stan wrote a review Jun 2019,10,2nd Class Citizen,We stayed here last week on a fully inclusive basis and were very disappointed by the level of service. The bar staff were surly and arrogant and clearly favored non inclusive guests whether French or other nationals this extended to almost all areas of the hotel including the restaurants making us feel like lesser mortals. We are not in any sense wealthy and saved like mad for this holiday and this type of service is unacceptable and ruined our holiday.  We did a couple of excursions which cost quite a bit and found that the guides lead you to their favored merchants(Who presumably compensate them) who then apply pressure to purchase their overpriced wares. These are excursions organized by the holiday repsso we will not.be using this particular holiday agent again.  I can go on and on but suffice to say that we will never go back to this hotel or Morocco in general.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coldharbourlanelond

On arrival i asked reception whether I could have a room with a balcony and was very fortunate that we were given a room on the 3rd floor with a balcony. Room was nice including shower & bath wardrobe safe (free) air con (free) mini fridge (empty on arrival - however filled with water when requested) tv (only french channels) and on one of the days fresh oranges & biscuits were put into our room. The room we had was facing the main road which was very busy and noisy whenever the balcony door was open but wasn‚Äôt too terrible. There was building work taking place the whole time we were at the hotel drilling and banging from around 9am until 5pm.  The swimming pools were lovely! There is the main pool then there is a small pool which is very secluded and warm a children‚Äôs pool the pool with the 4 slides and bar and then an indoor pool. The hotel itself is very nice just a shame about the food which was the same every single day. Whatever was on offer at lunch would be put into a different sauce or cut up and served again at dinner. The sorts of things on offer = chicken in a variety of sauces pizza chips salad pasta and bread. We found some of the staff very rude ignoring us and serving the French people first. This was especially the case in the restaurant. Marrakech is enjoyed by many French guests and therefore all staff speak French and very little speak English. There is nothing much near the hotel (one tiny shop opposite which sells cigarettes and milk) a Carrefour about 15 minutes walk up the road and a restaurant. Everything else will require a taxi ride (always Haggle to 20 dirham to go to the main square as that‚Äôs what we paid every time). There is a spa on site however the massages worked out at around ¬£28 and therefore we didn‚Äôt bother.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlottelouise14

The men treat women like bits of meat especially young girls they look them up and down in a rude way and say things behind there back. All the tv channels are in French as is the entertainment. They treat us British like 2nd class people when trying to join in in entertainment they just accused us of cheating because we knew the English songs (shocker) then just ignored us the staff never smile or seem willing to help you. The air con barley works the wifi kept going off. We booked a deluxe room with balcony to only find only a few had balcony and we was put on th top floor with just a window as the French got all the balconies. We only had 2 single beds not even a double so felt like we was friends sharing a room. The room had a door leading into the room next door and the walls are like paper can here everything from room next door even them going to the toilet wich is not nice there hygiene here is shocking we watched a barman put glasses upside down on the grass/mud then take them to be put on the shelf. Even being all inclusive you cant eat when you want to as you have to book your times even at the snack bar a day in advance and as for the food it's bad its stone cold and no English food as stated overall a very bad experience of the country and hotel even the taxi drivers try to rip you off.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/589clintonc
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Kamla Devi wrote a review May 2019,10,Absolutely Awful,we‚Äôve had the worst time in this hotel the food was not up-to standard for a 4* hotel the food was almost always cold.. the staff were rude the staff prioritised the french people 1st which was awful as it felt quite racist including the entertainment staff they didn‚Äôt let our kids take part and even accused them of cheating during games and only let the french people answer... the wifi didn‚Äôt work properly we didn‚Äôt like the fact that our room was joint to a strangers room and we told the staff however they did nothing about it.. also they had 1 iron to share to all the guests on the 1st couple of days there was no life guard which is dangerous anything could have happened to any guests the life guards pulled a face if we asked them for help for anything (for example we had to ask for them to clean the pool as it was full of bugs).. the only good thing was the aqua park snack bar (however one day they accused us lying and said we didn‚Äôt book in advance when we did) and the pretty fountain in the middle of the reception (although it was never on) this hotel needs experienced staff not absolutely anyone that is not qualified for there job role.. i would never recommend this hotel to anyone..,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"West Midlands, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamlaDevi

Hotel staff very friendly especially if you make the effort to say bonjour and Merci. They don‚Äôt really speak English but friendly. Entertainment was mainly in french but the animation team make a good effort to get all involved. Food was fresh and tasty especially the freshly made pancakes and omelette station!! All inclusive drinks were watered down however the cocktails were nice. 3 lovely pools to choose from and a jacuzzi! Water park is 5 slides but lots of fun. Spa was lovely we had a hammam treatment which is a must! Prices were decent ¬£18 per treatment.  The hotel is located on a heavy main road which can be noisy however this didn‚Äôt affect us. When we arrived there was building work going on in the hotel which we complained about and was told it will stop by tomorrow ( this didn‚Äôt happen) would of been nice to be made aware of before we arrived we tried to not let it spoil our holiday but it was noisy! Starting drilling around 8am untill 5pm.  Hotel is in a good location with Mac Donald‚Äôs shops and restaurants close by. Easy enough to get a taxi ( they stay parked outside hotel) ¬£3 into the M√©dina.

Bar staff very rude in all bars  Dining room staff absolutely lovely  Reception staff rude and again if you don‚Äôt speak fluent French they ignore you and actually serve others before you that join the queue after you  Rooms clean and tidy and areas around the hotel very well maintained  Food was a bit repetitious but which AI hotel isn‚Äôt but choices varied from Thai beef or chicken or pork tagine type meals and plenty of rices and vegetables meat balls pasta carbonara or spaghetti Bol.  ATM in the reception was useful and safer than on the streets outside  Restaurants around don‚Äôt really serve alcohol apart from the Saxo bar but food at the restaurant/ snack bars across the road was ¬£25 approx for 4 of us including soft drinks  Hotel located on a heavily used duel carriageway that didn‚Äôt stop all day and night  Air conditioning in the rooms didn‚Äôt work so had to open windows to allow breeze but as our bedroom was above the nightclub was noisy due to the fact it was 12am til 5:30am opening hours!!!! So not a great night sleep had at all  The aqua park for the kids was fun and enough but the staff around the pool were not easily distinguished as just in Adidas Tracky type outfit but whistle happy when they weren‚Äôt using their phones  All inclusive drinks list was lengthy but all spirits were bottles used for cocktails so no premium or even nice gin or whisky!! Cocktails were random and sometimes asking for two G and T you would end up with one cocktail..again unless French they don‚Äôt listen and not interested in you!!!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Sat1956 wrote a review May 2019,10,Worse service ever,We have just come back from a stay at this hotel. Their customer service was appalling. Firstly even though we stayed all inclusive here every time we went to get a drink they would not serve us and when they did they served people who came after us first. Also we had few in the party who are strict vegetarians I asked the chef to wash the utensils used for meat items. He did but then used spoons for mixing that were used for meat items-this was unacceptable. Furthermore none of the food items were labelled and we had to ask other guests if they could let us know what was what as the chefs did not understand us. I would not recommend anyone going there.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sat1956
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Travellingratbag wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Not great,This hotel is a little bit tired. On the positive side the food on the whole was pretty good. Good choice and tasty meals. We were all inclusive which I think really helped. The pool area is pleasant. I imagine it would be good for kids. The location of the hotel is not brilliant but ok if you are prepared to walk a while or get taxis. I found the staff to be reasonably helpful. Our room was ok. Nice and spacious. The beds were exceptionally hard. The shower took more than 10 minutes of running to warm up (not exaggerating) and the drain didn‚Äôt drain so one had to shower in a cold ankle-height bath.    The main issue was cleanliness. When we checked in we were given our keys but when we opened the room it was still dirty from previous guests. We returned an hour or so later and the room had been made up but there were bits of biscuit on the floor and we noticed that some gift-wrapped oranges that had been on the table when the room was dirty had been left there. On closer inspection they were mouldy so goodness knows how long they‚Äôd been there. There was dirt and hairs in the drawers. Over the course of our stay we found a used contact lens on the floor (not ours - presumably the cleaner‚Äôs) long dark hairs on our pillows (ditto) and the key card to a different room left on the side. Wet towels that we had left out to hang dry were folded up and put on the side still wet. Some days however the cleaners did a fab job and left folded towels like swans and rose petals (not that we expected this!).,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingratbag
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Rachel Spinks wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Would not recommend,POSITIVES: food was lovely hotel clean and great aqua park for children.    NEGATIVES: we visited the Italian adjacent to Labranda on our last night and the service was terrible! We waited 40 minutes for drinks and the menu had all of 6 main meals to choose from!  Service over all at Labranda was extremely poor! We felt that as we were English we were treated less favourably then the French and other languages.  In regards to the area there was not much at all to do.  The hotel itself didn‚Äôt have a huge amount of activities/ entertainment especially when the weather took a turn for the worse. Some french activities but again not great for other nationalities!  After wanting to visit Morocco Marrakech in particular we were left very disappointed mainly due to this hotel and it‚Äôs service. Due to this we will probably never return.    Also a huge warning that passport control into Marrakech and out of Marrakech is diabolical! Travellers missing flights due to waiting hours to pass through departures. If you are visiting ensure you give yourself at least 3-4 hours before your flight.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60rachels
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Jenjo wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Had a brilliant holiday and would visit again,The poor reviews of this hotel are not fair we had an excellent 7 night stay (family of 3 our son is 11). I am not normally one for reviewing but thought that this hotel could do with an honest and positive review. I'll break it down:  Cleanliness - excellent. The hotel and all of its facilities were spotless.    Room - simply decorated very clean spacious and VERY comfortable beds. The bathroom was a bit dated and could do with a refurb but it was fine and everything worked. Hair dryer available but I used my own. The cleaners were very friendly and trustworthy. Air conditioning was available but I can't review it as we didn't need it. A good size fridge was also in the room. Slightly noisy until the entertainment stopped around midnight but didn't bother us at all.    Food - breakfast was great. the fresh omlettes and pancakes were lovely lots of fresh breads and pastries with jams and spreads. The only thing that breakfast lacked was fruit as it was only available at lunch and dinner.  Lunch - a bit hit and miss. Plenty of fresh salads breads and pastas. The hot food (could do with being hotter) was OK but not fantastic. My son is very picky so had chips when they were available.  Dinner - As above not excellent but enough choice for all. The pizzas were fresh (have to wait for the pizzas). My son really enjoyed the pizzas.  You could also book the Italian or Moroccan restaurant. We only visited the Italian. My husband and son had a pizza and I had a chicken dish. There isn't much choice but what we had was fine. We did wait a long time for the food to arrive.  You can also book the BBQ for lunch which we preferred. They serve salads paninis chicken skewers burgers chips etc. We really enjoyed the BBQ and preferred this over the main restaurant (have to book).    Service - the reception staff were not the happiest of people but they are also very busy. I didn't find them rude though. The service at the bars was fine we didn't experience any problems at the bar during the day and evening (although the drinks are very weak). If you are pleasant to the staff then they are pleasant back. They really appreciate you attempting some words or phrases in French or Arabic but they do speak English.    Drinks - the beer was lovey and was fresh from a bottle. The wine and soft drinks were also fine. The spirits are very weak and tiny measures but this didn't bother me too much. Drinks are served to your table at meal times - you need to be vocal if you want an alcoholic drink otherwise they will just bring bottled water.    Entertainment - the entertainment team were brilliant very friendly and they DO speak English. They made my son feel very welcome and included him in lots of games at the poolside such as Darts football and water polo. They also had aqua aerobics dancing Arabic lessons cookery and mint tea lessons. The entertainment team work so hard to make everybody feel included and there is a quiet pool for those who want to relax in peace. The evening entertainment wasn't really to my taste - dancing karaoke kids songs etc - there was also a quiz and they made every effort to include the English guests.    The aqua park was brilliant my son loved it! They close for 2 hours during lunch time but you can still use the pool.    Trips and excursions - we booked the desert safari and absolutely loved it. This included the 4x4 sand dunes experience camel ride dinner and entertainment. I would definitely book this again but would exclude the camel ride as they were not well looked after. We booked the Atlas mountains trip through a different company but was definitely worth the visit.    Location - great location. Very easy to get a taxi or horse & carriage outside (negotiate the price first). If you turn right walk to the shopping center then take a left turn this takes you straight to the Medina. It was a long walk but was a nice walk.    Overall we have had an amazing holiday and will definitely visit again. Marrakech is a lovely place and should definitely be experienced. Remember the hotel is rated 4 star based on Moroccan standards. If I wanted to be fussy I would rate it as a 3 star but this wouldn't put me off returning.

The hotel is on the main boulevard 10 min by car from the airport and 10 min to the medina.  Check in went ok the reception staff and doorman were really nice! The doorman was so helpful he gave us tips.where to go for how much etc.  Room was large enough with AC fridge TV safe and bathroom with ammenities and hairdryer. Wifi was working properly.    We did have all.inclusive. Restaurant had plenty of food to.choose pizzas pastas meat oriental.food salads.......do not expect high gastronomy! But all was tasty and fresh made. The waiters need a better system of service when it gets crowded.  The traditional restaurant in the garden is nice but they serve just one a la carte meal and has to be booked day before.  Hotel entertainment was in french because the team works for a french travel agency. It wasnt so developed as in Egypt or Turkey.  Pool area is great - large outdoor swimming pool small jacuzzi and the aquapark are great. The aquapark.for.kids is just amazing! Water in the pool was ""fresh"" but the kids had lot of fun. There is a pool bar next to.it with music and entertainment.  Outdoor pool and spa are against charge we did not try that.  During the week there is a small market in the hotel with traditional souvenirs. It is a nice choice if you do not want to.go.outside into the jungle.  Menara shopping mall is 10 min walking from hotel.

DON'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEW PUT YOU OFF!!",Not usually one to write reviews but my friend and I both said during the holiday that this place deserves one! We got back on the 7th March from an 8 night stay at the Labranda Rose Aqua Parc and couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough! Every member of staff we came across was lovely and made a conscious effort to say hello and engage in a conversation with us despite some members of staff speaking very little English. Everyone was polite and friendly! We had all inclusive and we were both pleasantly surprised at the value for money despite the holiday being a bargain! They mixed up the menu from the day/night before and you even had the option to book into a separate Italian or Moroccan restaurant if you wanted a change of scenery we tried the Italian one night at it was good some of the food choices was similar to the main restaurant but still good! The drinks included in the all inclusive were good value too not just your basic bog standard local spirit and mixers you could get cocktails which included bloody Mary‚Äôs mojitos and Pina colada which was lovely! They have an animation / entertainment team that work throughout the day and night all day everyday despite it being low season! They were lovely and made every effort to ensure all guests no matter what age was having a good time and enjoying their stay.    The hotel itself is clean and well kept there are 2 swimming pools (ones heated and one isn‚Äôt). The pool with the slides in is heated and we swam in it comfortable and wasn‚Äôt cold. The slide were great fun and a lovely surprise as we didn‚Äôt realise they were at the hotel! The hotel has a spa (additional charge for this) and a gym which is free of charge! Our room was spacious and had a mini fridge which was a nice surprise as we were all inclusive! The room was cleaned everyday also!    It‚Äôs a short taxi ride from the medina (old town) which we paid 30 dihrams but if you‚Äôre with a local you can get it cheaper! There‚Äôs some lovely bars and clubs in the surrounding area too we‚Äôre both 23 so we did venture out a few nights and felt safe wherever we went we even walked to and from one bar called l‚Äôepicurien which was such a good bar had live music (in English!!!)

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Naz wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Nice hotel..very surprised!! Please do not let negative reviews hinder your experience of staying here.,I visted with my husband and 2 children (aged 1 and 3) at the beginning of february..i was apprehensive when i read the reviews before we travelled but was very pleasantly surprised with our stay here. Customer service was excellent the reception staff clearly try their best to converse with guests that speak english.  We had a family room and it was perfect. The housekeeping staff were amazing! They went the extra mile with making our kids smile when we bumped into them in the corridors and our rooms were cleaned to a satisfactory level.  For those that have babies or toddlers that drink milk please note the difficulty in getting this..the experience was like bleeding a stone. We required milk for our 1 year old and were told to go to the restaurant..then to the bar..then to outside to get milk. We were then told its powdered milk and cartoned milk is not available..some staff said its ok for children..some said its not safe. On our last day a staff member gave us cartoned milk!!! Its crazy that babies needs are not catered for!  We went all inclusive -overall the food was very repetitive however for us as a family it was okay. The restaurant needs to have yogurts and more variety of fruit..only bananas pears and satsumas available on some days.  My biggest concern and other muslim guests concern with this hotel was the serving of pork. I have visited marrakech before and no pork was served in the hotel i stayed at. So for me (and this is no disrespect to people who eat pork) as a muslim visiting a muslim country i do not agree with the serving of pork and this alone would stop me from staying at this hotel in the future. The management of this hotel has written in another review that pork is served on the request of customers..the concerns raised by those that do not eat pork should also be ackowledged!  Finally the restaurant needs to have high chairs for young children. Due to these not being available i had to use a push chair for my 1 year old.  The outdoor pools were very cold to use which was a shame as this would have been perfect for our children. The indoor pool has charges which we chose not to use due to the cost of each indivudal for a day.  Overall we had a lovely trip but the concerns raised should be addressed to increase customer satisfaction.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naz_ali_1234

Rooms were clean and well maintained. Receptionists were very helpful and kind. Over the entire team of management was brilliantly well organised. My only concern was at breakfast time the chefs making omlet couldn't keep the contamination of meat in the non meat omlet dye to being so busy but it can be addressed with a little bit of attention. Also didn't like the idea of serving pork as a buffet. This should be served upon request bookings in advance and kept away from halal food.(No discriminations to pork eaters). Food was exelent  as we were all inclusive the buffet restaurant was open for us but in other 2 restaurants we were told to book in advance at the reception in the morning thus wasn't explained to us upon arrival at reception.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,conhol wrote a review Mar 2019,10,Worst Hotel we have ever stayed in,This hotel is rated as 4 star but should only be rated as maximium 2 star. The hotel is dated but the room was ok. The food is the worst you could get for an all inclusive deal with very limited choice and most of the time the fish and any meet they serve is very poorly cooked and dried out.  The chefs stand behind the counter on mobile phones instead of attending to customers(unless you are French).  The waiting staff are only prepared to serve you if you tip them every day and they are always arguing in the resturant with eachother so customers can seeand hear them.  The bar staff are so bad that you have to wait there untill they have fininshed on their phones before you get served and when they do serve you its like they own the drink and the measures are so small that you would never get merry and to get drunk you would need to prop the bar up for about 12 months there if you got lucky. Oh and the bar closes at 11pmduring the day you can only get a drink from the poolside bar and that is not maned all the time so be prepared for a long wait and then the choice is very limited.  The animation team try but are so unprofessional that its a bit of a laugh really and they will only speak in french NO ENGLISH.  The overall management of this so called hotel is by far the worst we have ever had any where in the world and all the people we met there all said exactly the same as us.  There was lots of people having to argue with all the staff to get served i.e bar staff  waiting staffcleaners etc before anything gets done.

The pools were lovely and the entertainment team were fantastic. Look out for Tito. He is very energetic and was brilliant with my 3 grandchildren. He made sure they had a great time. The staff overall were great. All polite and very helpful despite a bit of a language barrier. The food was a good mix of international and traditional. The salad bar always looked fresh and appealing. The restaurant staff dont stop. The tables were kept clean and again all staff were welcoming helpful and friendly. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Little disappointed with the morrocan themed restaurant. But that would be my only compliant. The spa offers a wide range of treatments which were received gratefully. A Very professional and hardworking lady served all 3 females in our family. Thank you to all the staff that made a family of 7's holiday a very happy one..,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenS3352

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Anthony wrote a review Feb 2019,40,"Great hotel and location, few tweaks needed.",Arrived late and was kindly ushered with family to have a meal which was a great gesture. We were given a family room(125) with balcony but unfortunately was above a nightclub which went on till 5. The noise was horrendous we moved room which was great. Gutted to see another family the next day in same room as they would eventually vacate due to noise. Food was excellent loads of choice couldn't fault it. Staff were attentive with drink orders. Entertainment could of been better with regards to the piano bar. It was predominantly French songs until 11pm. Karaoke was spot on as they catered for everyone. The main hall for the shows were laughable need outside entertainment or a manager for the six staff. Overall the hotel was great just a few tweaks needed. Met great people whom we got on so well. Boys were never out of the pool with great slides.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stockport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/choppygit1
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Unknown girl wrote a review Feb 2019,40,"Lovely, relaxing stay with family",Stayed here for 6 days during the feb half term holidays. Had an amazing time with my family and got to see and experince true Moroccan culture. If you love experiencing new things then this hotel is for you. Reading previous reviews we were hesitant to stay here but the reviews are nonsense becasue this hotel was truly amazing for the price. Well worth the price.  The hotel room was clean and cleaned on a daily basis. Lovely view of lemon trees too. We loved the cleaning staff especially zainab she was very friendly and made an effort with us despite the language barriers French and English.    We payed for half board and was very happy with the selection offered. Fresh fruits and fresh food for each meal with a wide selection available very continental and lovely. We enjoyed the Moroccan night especially allowing us to experience new cuisine. Breakfast was amazing being offered fresh drinks in the morning was refreshing. The only problem was having to pay for water at meal times. Water should be offered for free even tap and should not have a price as it is a nessasity. I hope you improve this in the future. Other than that food was amazing.    Entertainment facilities were very good and fun. We loved the night disco and the aqua aerobics in the pool. Entertainment staff were friendly especially Tito he was very energetic and very helpful. He also made an effort despite language barriers.    Overall this hotel was lovely. WiFi everywhere. Friendly staff such as yousaf the photographer and Siham on reception desk. Would recommend too other British people but be aware this is a French hotel only a few staff members speak broken down English. French is the second language of Morocco which is why. They should have more entertainment in English. Should also have usb slots around the hotel to accommodate those without adaptors Will be back in the future had a lovely time.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/explorer2019love
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Naomi D wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Beautiful Hotel,I stayed here with my 2 children from 10/02/2019- 17/02/2019. The Hotel itself is beautiful well presented and kept clean at all times The Maids done a fantastic job cleaning my room daily.  Labranda Rose is in a great location and all staff were friendly and welcoming however there is a tourist tax that you need to pay before they give you the keys to your room I wasn't aware of this and I was not told by the agency that I booked with at the time so this may be useful to know for anybody visiting here.  I stayed Half Board but will return All Inclusive next time.  The food was nice although I think there could be more variety to cater to the children. The snack bar by the pool was lovely but it may also be useful to let others know that you have to pay for this All inclusive or not.

Everyone was so friendly and kind to us and that meant a lot to me as I was a single mum travelling with my two girls . I felt safe and very well looked after and I'm English !!!!!  Reading the reviews before I went made me so uncomfortable being English and I was worried but I didn't need to be at all !!  Everyone was just so so lovely ! So thank you .    The food was excellent and was all freshly made  with great variety .  I can relate to people's comments about the drinks  however it didn't bother me as I wasn't on holiday to drink lots of alcohol anyway ! There was enough variety to sit and have a drink without the same every night .    The entertainment was good ! I especially liked the aqua aerobics in the afternoon at the pool . My girls really enjoyed it and said it was one of our best holidays culture wise ! The medina is def worth a visit  it was so different to anything I've seen before and the atmosphere is fantastic !

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Natz9587 wrote a review Feb 2019,40,"Beautiful hotel, nice location",I've just gotten back from a 5 nights stay here and found the hotel to be amazing. The hotel and grounds are beautiful and the rooms are spacious and clean. We had a room with a balcony and a lovely view. The housekeeping team were excellent.  We arrived fairly late in the evening just 15minutes before the food finished and they put our bands on and ushered us to eat before we checked in which I personally was very greatful for having had a long day travelling. The food was very nice and every day there was a different variety. The breakfast was basic but still nice.  All 3 meals were very good and the snack selection in the afternoon was also good. As for the all inclusive drinks part I again had no issues yes the selection is a little lacking but what was on offer was perfectly fine.  I had no issues with the staff and found them all very friendly and helpful. Yes they do interact more with the French clients but that is a language they speak. The staff were still very courteous and polite to us and tried to interact with us. There is one staff member at the poolside bar who was particularly friendly and helpful.i can not comment on the entertainment as I didn't see any (a personal choice I preferred sitting outside by the pool in the evening). They did however lay on a nice little buffet with food to celebrate valentines day where the centre part of the hotel had tables laid out with wine sangria fruit punch roses nd petals with snacks (biscuits and pastry) and nice music was being played which I found a nice touch.  The hotel is in a good location a 10 min walk to the mall which has stores food Court and a traditional souk section. Taxis are readily avaliable to the main old town which cost around ¬£5. It's also only around a 10minute cab journey to/from the airport. The surrounding location within walking distance has some nice shops and a park.  I very much enjoyed my stay and I am definitely interested in going back.  Thank you!

The rooms are always clean and tidy. The food in restqurant is exeptional with a great wine list to match. I wonder why some people are writing q negative messages which is not true comparing with reality as i was checking before my trip and i found out that some clients demande and request much than what expected like asking for extra food and asking some extra and special drink for free which is not listed on the free items mentioned on the menues (all inclusive) mostly are british as they spend most of time at the hotel bars.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Diana Krutsko wrote a review Jan 2019,40,A good stay in Marrakech,The hotel is situated in a perfect zone. Large avenue a lot of good restaurants next to Menara shopping 2 km to Jemaa el Fna.  We had the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù service which allows you to eat and drink whatever you want during the day until 11pm. That was perfect. Luch was good dinner as well breakfast should have fruits and natural juices. Drinks at bar were good. Just one remark: the hotel should improve the ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù service. They ask you to book your snack one day before and once you did it they say that you haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a shame. Anyway we complained to the girl responsable at reception and got our snack.  Hammam was so good the women that work there are just amazing.  The room was normal/clean/warm.  Young personal al the hotel is good better than older staff. Special mention to ‚ÄúAdanane‚Äù (not sure if I write it well) of the buffet restaurant: he‚Äôs just amazing. He does a very good job european level.

Only bonus is it‚Äôs close to the airport-  And the weather has been fantastic..  However.......  If your English I wouldn‚Äôt bother coming here  No one talks English or even tries to understand what your asking for-  Towel- cup- kettle... this should be the basic stuff these workers should be taught  Entertainment staff was non existent and the one time they done something by the pool was spoken in french-  Restaurant/bar staff would serve the french first-  If you want to eat in Moroccan restaurant you need to book in advance I wouldn‚Äôt bother with that as it‚Äôs a set mean and you come out hungry. Even in main restaurant food wasn‚Äôt great either..  Rooms wasn‚Äôt great- decor run down-  There was filming in hotel and was told a few times to Ssshhh.. while going to the lift and was told we couldn‚Äôt and to use stairs by the someone who was filming.  Why have guests in a hotel while filming If you wanted us to be quiet.  We‚Äôve had non stop banging from building work going in too..  Really not impressed with anything..

No where near any all inclusive I have ever been on before no snacks during the day no food after 9.30pm cocktails are non-alcoholic unless you as for alcohol.

Heated outdoor pool is not heated to the temperature it states it was freezing    Food - needed a lot to be desired although did have chips on a few occasions so could eat something - pork was pink kept running out of food / deserts were biscuits    After coming to Marrakech for a few years now would NOT come back to this hotel again unless I spoke fluent French    Weather was lovely üòÉ,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cbennett12017

Hotel itself was ok good dated but lots of building work on going (from 7am every morning) do may be better I future.  Reception staff were rudedidn't try to u understand often getting someone else go deal with us...Very much felt like we were an inconvenience to them.  Rooms  Dated no kettle or iron. Couldn't get kettle from reception we were told we could get from bar. Took 15 minutes and Google translator to get a cup of hot water.  Our towel rail was hanging off of the wall and one room we still dirty. Ashtray full bins full it was disgusting add then that they had an interconnecting door ( not in our party) that wouldn't lock so after wasting half a day waiting for it to be fixed they were moved.  Food  Not a huge selection some weird combinations and mountains of cous cous. Morrocan restaurant - don't bother. No choice olives and beetroot a weird soup tiny about of meat and fruit for dessert - no rice potatoes cous cous or anything to go with meat. Apparently afternoon snacks - we never found them.  Pool  Pool was nice but really cold eve though it is classed as heated. Po bar..nightmare took ages to get served seemed everyone was seen to before us even when we were the only people there it would take 10 minutes to get a coke due to language barrier.    Weather was great but can get that in any hotel. If you're French then you'll get priority treatment and they'll understand you...the French even got drinks brought to their sun lounger.

Noboby spoke much English and it was very hard to make yourself understood the entertainment was in french and very poor taste. The man at the money exchange gave us a lower rate and we had to get a rep to sort it out. We had to get moved to another room as we had no hot water or electricity.

Bar very noisy with football shown on a TV piped music and a so called disco in an annex that went on to 5 am keeping us three floors up awake. Staff gave folk misleading info telling folks that it was unsafe outside trying to keep their money inside the building. We found that the locals and French got better service so switched languages.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,natasha102 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Brilliant holiday! Ignore the bad reviews!,As a group of 8 English girls (aged 20‚Äôs/30‚Äôs) we were apprehensive after reading the reviews. I can honestly say every member of staff was friendly and welcoming! There is a language barrier with some staff but they are trying their best to learn English and Google Translate always helps. It is a predominately French clientele due to it being exclusively for the French in previous years but I will say something if someone is going to be rude it‚Äôs down to the individual person and their ignorance so it‚Äôs completely irrelevant where you‚Äôre from.    The meeting point staff who look after you are AMAZING! Hamza and Ismail ensured we had the best stay and advised us of the excursions. We went quad biking and camel riding in the desert which cost 500d which was brilliant. There were so many excursions available but we were only there for 4 days so just stuck with the one as we wanted a day at M√©dina Square and to relax.    The Spa there is so relaxing and again the staff so skilled welcoming and friendly. The two ladies in the Hamam part were lovely and the massage ladies excellent. It cost 250d for a hamam and 250d for a full body massage which was very reasonable. We had full access to the jacuzzi and indoor heated pool thrown in.    The Aqua Park was open when we went it has a lovely clean kids area and a huge heated pool with water slides. They play great music around the pool all day and you can hire a towel with a 100d deposit which you get back when you return. There are plenty of sunbeds and could always get a sunbed in the afternoon if we had been out in the morning. There is a pool bar in the centre and this is where the animation team are usually carrying out the activities. The animation team work so hard and are so funny we had such a laugh with them Hamza and Amine were so friendly and had really good banter! If someone could finally manage to throw Hamza in the pool when they visit that would be great as we failed.    There is another pool which is much quieter no music which also has a pool bar. However as it is not heated in winter we did not spend much time there.    The food was good and varied. There are two other restaurants in the hotel a Italian and a Moroccan. We visited the Italian which was o.k. The food is better in the main restaurant though. In regards to the alcohol they do pour small measures and the all inclusive spirits are weaker than U.K spirits. However if you ask for more they would always top up. We picked up bottles of spirits from duty free on the way and used those in the daytime which wasn‚Äôt a problem. There is a rule you can only bring in one litre of spirits and one litre of wine per person. It is impossible to find any shops that sell alcohol nearby. To buy a drink that is not on the all inclusive was around 60d which wasn‚Äôt too bad for a cocktail. The bar staff were lovely especially Mohammed and Abdlhadi Beladem!    The hotel nightclub is actually next to the hotel was great fun. They play all the music you request to the d.j have a morrocan band who play for an hour and shisha is available for 150d. Drinks were the same price as the hotel if you want to buy a bottle of spirits for your table it was a 1000d. Which was quite expensive but not much when split between a group.    Dont‚Äôt get mugged off with cabs we paid 200d to and from the airport and when we went to the M√©dina Square/Souk markets we paid 25d there and 50d back because we used a M√©dina square taxi. You have to see the square and market! It was such a good experience people were lovely and it was fun haggling we all wished we had brought more suitcases as we wanted to bring so much back with us.    The rooms were nice and the hotel grounds were so clean. We all had such a great holiday at the Labranda Rose and will definitely be returning!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Amjad M wrote a review Jan 2019,30,"Good food selection, Party every day until midnight, with loud music throughout hotel",We stayed here a few days as a family during December 2018. The hotel is is a good location with the many restaurants and cafes on the main road. There are bicycles you can hire (similar to London Boris Bikes) for a small fee although we didnt get time to do this. The Hotel has two/three pools. One has the slides and has a smaller one for kids with fountains etc. The water was very cold during winter even though the daily temperature was 24-25 degrees. The other pool is quieter and very clean.  The hotel itself was OK. The staff were always busy but when they were not they wern't too keen to treat guests with a smile. The rooms are typical of a 3 star hotel with very small windows. The TV has mostly french TV with a few british (CNN type) but no cartoons. The plugs are the two round pin type so make sure you take the adaptors as these are hard to find outside. There are no usb plugs ether.  The beds are really firm and we found they were all like this. The toilets doors have no locks and the safe is not bolted to anything so you can literally walk off with it!.  The worst part for us was the noise. We had 2 rooms on the first floor which were above a karaoke room which they started around 9pm and lasted until around 1am. The room is not soundproofed in any way so the sound carries out into the hotel every night. We did change rooms to another room but found this was above some other club which had the same issue. For us the nights were not comfortable due to the beds and not comfortable due to the noise. This was the worst part of the hotel.  The breakfast variety is very good. there is a huge selection of fruits yoghurts cereal vegetables and a cook that makes omlettes - although the lines can get big. They also serve pork something we were not aware of (being non-pork eaters) - so it is quite popular with europeans. They didnt make much effort to separate the pork from other dishes.  You have to pay for water and they watch you like hawks when you are about to leave the table. Similarly for dinner there is no tea or coffee. This was a huge letdown but luckily there are lots of cafes outside with better service and atmosphere.  There is a shopping mall within 10 minutes walk and a mcdonalds within 5 minutes walk which is near the train station. There is a money exchange about 2 minutes near another hotel and their rates were not bad although if you can go to a bank you will get a much better deal.  You can get bands depending on what you purchased (i.e breakfast only breakfast and lunch or breakfast lunch and dinner) we found that breakfast and dinner was ok as we were out during the day anyway. They didnt seem to have too much available around the pools to warrant the additional cost. However another lady was requesting an upgrade and she was being charged around ¬£45 per person per day - so if you are considering it it may be better to book up front rather than at the hotel.,Date of stay: December 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/292amjadm
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Vibhor31 wrote a review Jan 2019,10,Terrible Experience,We have booked 2 rooms in this hotel from 1st Jan till 5th. Firstly room was not at all like what they show on website. Furniture was old and the locker was broken. This hotel do not have iron so pls carry with you if you need one. Bathroom was pretty ordinary and the sliding door was difficult to close. The gap between the door and the frame was so much I could put my hand across - could see through if someone is sitting on w/c. After repeated complaints AC mechanic came to repair but surprised us by saying that the room doesnt have an AC instead it was just a heater. Towels were replaced only once a day and they refused to change if we used that in the hotel hot pool.    We had an all inclusive deal but the food was not available 24x7 as in most of hotels. The quality was not great and most of the times menu was quite repetitive. Lifts were always crammed and we had to wait for long to get one. Language with the hotel staff was issue as we spoke only english. The evening entertainment is super boring and the quality of the booze is very low.    Recommend to avoid this!!,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vibhor31
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,BVvdB wrote a review Jan 2019,40,"Nice hotel, but swimming not possible in winter",For the end of 2018 we (Dutch family of 4 kids 14 and 18) chose to visit Morocco. Fly to Fez and hire a car to drive our way via Meknes and Ouzoud to Marrakech.  The last hotel on our trip was the Labranda Rose Aqua Park hotel and would be the most luxurious one. Upon arrival we were welcomed by an extremely friendly and humorous host. We asked about the swimmingpool and heard you could swim but the water would be cold (as we experienced already in Meknes). Luckily they had an indoor pool as well‚Ä¶We had to fill in the forms and the found two adjacent rooms for our family on the 5th floor. One room was nog cleaned yet the other had no towels (15:00 PM).  Upon arriving late in the evening after visiting the medina of Marrakech we found out the airco was not working in the opposite way and there was a constant rumble. At first we thought it was the airport (only 4 km‚Äôs from the hotel) but later we reasoned it was too constant and maybe was the general installations of the hotel or an aggregate of some sort.  The breakfast was a great buffet with freshly baked ommelettes and Moroccan pancakes (don‚Äôt know the name sorry). After breakfast we wanted to take a swim in the indoorpool but then found out it was part of the spa and was not included in the normal rent of the hotelroom. That was a small disappointment during our stay in this great hotel.  The hotel has its own parking space and it takes 30 minutes walking (partly on a walking-lane in the middle of the street partly through parks) to get to the walls of the old city.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,The Netherlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BVvdB
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,SHOTLEYBOYS wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Much better than expected,We stayed here for a week all inclusive over Christmas for 7 days. Having read some of the reviews I was worried about what we would find. However I must say that it was way better than I was expecting . Yes it‚Äôs a little tired in places and the staff do mostly speak French. If you try with the language an occasional bonjour or Merci they do appreciate it remember you are in a French speaking country. As vegans we found the food quite acceptable and varied there was always lots to choose from with nice salads etc the chef on the pasta station understood completely and used a clean ladle to add the tomato (no meat ) sauce to our pasta. The waiting staff were polite and smiley as were the pool bar staff. Also we had to keep in mind what we had paid for this trip always keep this in mind when managing your expectations. Yes the alcohol is a bit Ropey but we didn‚Äôt come to get drunk. The total package including return flights for 7 days all inclusive was just over ¬£500 each. I saw how much the flights were so that really didn‚Äôt leave much for the hotel so don‚Äôt expect too much  overall we had a really nice stay and I have to say would return .,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chelmondiston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHOTLEYBOYS

The bedroom was ok but the bathroom was very small for two people and there was a hole underneath the sink and the button of the cistern kept moving as we have to put it in place for the cistern to flush.

The bed sheets didn't get cleaned aircon didn't work rips in the bed sheets and the toilets smelt like sewage and were dirty with exposed pipes. The cleaner would also take your towels in the morning and then not replace them with clean ones till the evening. The drinks dispenser was covered in wasps only good think about this hotel was finding a water park. Other than that the food was below average staff refused to talk to or involve English people and the rooms were of very low quality and just an unpleasant experience staying here.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lincoln, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857nikitaj

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Delectatio wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Enjoyable...!,Stayed 2 weeks ago for a 4 night winter break.  We didn't expect much but we enjoyed it (the glorious weather helped a lot!).    Room: nice enough clean and with comfortable beds. Bathroom very dated with a shower over bath and shower temperature was hard to control But we managed for 4 nights...    Hotel itself: recently renovated/painted and with well maintained spacious gardens and several pools and a nice water park unfortunately not heated (opposed to what is advertised). We still used the pools every day though! Well located (it was our 5th time in Marrakech and because we wanted to avoid the hassle with taxi drivers we choose a hotel within walking distance of the medina/Gueliz).    Staff: Some were lovely some of them just didn't want to be there. Language barrier wasn't to blame as I speak French on a daily basis for work and only spoke French to them as well. Animation team was dedicated and fun front desk staff also ok but some of the bartenders and restaurant staff seemed really unhappy.    Food: Breakfast good enough (nice scrambled eggs/omelettes lovely Moroccan pancakes and sausages very nice breads / jams). Coffee really bad though and no fresh orange juice. Lunch and dinner rather limited (this isn't necessary a problem) but not enough Moroccan dishes and the salads were always the same. Would have preferred a nice tagine instead of the pork roast that they offered one evening (and that we didn't eat). No nice desserts surprising because Morocco is so famous for the nice patisserie. Pizzas (freshly made) were really good.    Bar: Drinks on all inclusive very limited and cocktails extremely weak we gave up after the first night and drank wine instead (the Ros√© Toulal Prestige was quiet nice). Bar service very hit and miss.    We wouldn't stay for an extended time but for the price we paid we really enjoyed it and would stay again!,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Antwerp, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Delectatio

Lovely room very clean with comfy beds lot of cupboard space. Housekeeping good with towel art some days. Towels alittle thin!!! Nice view to main Street.    We enjoyed relaxing by both pools sunbeds at slide pool are more comfortable and music playing water alittle cold but still enjoyed a quick swim and had a go on the water slides which was fun.    It does coat 80 to have a swim in indoor pool which I feel is abit expensive about ¬£6.50(but it is for all day) be good if you could just pay for one or two hours?? If you fancy a swim.    We were all inclusive range of drinks alittle limited four cocktails vodka rum etc some drinks had run out.. Husband enjoyed beer and pitist  We drank the rose wine in the restaurant which was plentiful and good to drink. All bar staff were very friendly except one at pool slides bar who was alittle grumpy at times think his name was Jamal?    We enjoyed the food in the restaurant breakfast not traditional English but lovely for what we had paid there was still plenty to eat omelette morrocan pancakes (yum yum) cereals yoghurts spicy sausages Scrabble eggs vegetables salad cheeses Bread (toaster took ages to toast!!!). Jams cakes. Coffee tea cappuccino etc to drink. Multiple juices.    Lunch and dinner food always some sort of chicken dish fish carved meat one night morrocan tegines pizza different types of potatoes chips at lunchtime and vegetables soup salads so plenty to choose from. Cakes alittle limited and normally three types of fruit. Great value for money.    We enjoyed sitting in the piano bar at night alittle light entertainment some nights animation team tried to make everyone welcome at night not sure if there was activities were on in the day as we only speak English and wasn't asked to join in anything.    We had a great relaxing break away weather was fantastic about 25 with clear blue skies and no wind.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,DAURA wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Get what you pay for,We booked this holiday as a cheap winter get away. After reading the reviews we felt a bit nervous about arriving at the hotel however overall I would say it exceeded our expectations. It is certainly not as bad as some of the people in previous reviews have made out but it‚Äôs not the best hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed at either. The stay at this hotel truly reflects the saying you get what you pay for.    I had read reviews about the staff being rude to English people and only catering for the French. I felt that the reception staff could be a lot more polite but as a whole we found the staff here quite friendly. I don‚Äôt think they mean to be rude it is simply that they speak limited English. As they are French speaking it makes sense that they have more to talk about with French guests. Some of the bar and restaurant staff were really lovely.    On arrival we got taken into a room with an English speaking member of staff Hamza. He told us about the excursions we could do through the hotel. He was helpful and wasn‚Äôt too pushy with trying to get money out of us. We opted to do everything ourselves but it‚Äôs just whatever suits.    When we got to the airport we jumped into one of the taxis outside to take us to the hotel but we got ripped off. One of our first nights out we met a really lovely taxi driver called Abdellah. I cannot speak highly enough of him. He took us wherever we wanted to go and didn‚Äôt even expect to take money off us. One of the nights we went to a restaurant in a dodgy area and he walked us to the door and picked us up from the door to ensure we were safe. He never charged us a price he just says give me what you can. He is such a lovely person. We really recommend you use him if you need a taxi he works all over Marrakesh and his number is ‚Ä≠0212636754076‚Ä¨. You just need to text or WhatsApp him and he will come to pick you up!    We did go all inclusive and the reviews are true that you only get a small glass of beer however it‚Äôs not really a problem because you can get multiple drinks at a time. I must say though the local beer included in the all inclusive is the worst beer we have ever had in our lives. My partner and I both enjoy a beer but on this holiday we resorted to drinking spirits.    The all inclusive includes the pool bar and the piano bar there are reviews moaning about this but it‚Äôs not a problem because the pool bar is open all day and the piano bar is open until 11pm.    The piano bar has your usual cheesy hotel entertainment on of an evening. The worst thing about this bar is that you are able to smoke in doors and it really does smell really strongly of cigarettes. Obviously smoking laws are different in Morocco to the UK however I think they could do with airing the room out of a day time when the bar is closed to make the smell a bit more bearable.    There is a gym with some weights which is free to use but then there is also a cardio room with treadmills which you have to pay to use. First I was told it was 80 Moroccan dirham to use and then someone else said it was a 100 dirham. Seems a bit of a rip off that you have to pay!?    The free gym has no air con which made it a bit unbearable but the kind of gym you would expect for the price you pay at this hotel.    The pool area is nice and the hotel is clean.    We were pleasantly surprised with the food it is really tasty and a good variety. The coconut cakes are lovely!,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraaK9523ZH
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Annamaria d wrote a review Nov 2018,40,A De Sousa,Labranda rose is all as described on their site clean welcoming staff and more. Hamsa from meeting point was very helpful. To those who complained about his pushing you to take a tour obviously thought being confronted on streets was a more welcoming prospect. Or maybe they come from a country where they have no respect for other cultures. We did the balloon trip and Mugmat the pilot was very professional and his thorough explanation on the flight cannot fault. Even the camel rides and the contrast of culture difference was eye opening. The historical tour excellent. I heard bad reviews and complaints from others on tour about their hotels but a small complaint for Labranda Rose. This is a very busy hotel that is frequented by many international people. Grew up in S Africa and live in UK. When travelling have learnt to respect the culture of that country not expecting them to change it to suit me.

The entertainment team and the bar and restaurant staff are really nice    The aqua park really good however you have to pay for drinks there    Cleaners really trustworthy we left everything in our room including my engagement ring on several occasions and nothing ever went missing    Great location for a city break as close to the airport  M√©dina and new town    Negatives-    The location of the hotel is good however if you have requested a balcony room please expect to not have much sleep as the doors do not block anything out as the traffic never eases and plus we were woke up one night with a woman smashing the bar up and police having to attend at 4am.    The food is not great if I‚Äôm honest I mainly lived off pizza and pasta for the majority of my stay and be warned there is hardly anything food wise for children. The all inclusive aspect of this hotel is really quite poor. This is to do with management not staff. A lot of guests complained about not being served alcohol in their drinks or bare minimum amounts. The lunch is the best meal of the day. Dinner is terrible. We were here for 10 nights and can honestly say that the food is that repetitive it puts you off. the snacks in between meals are just a handful of cakes from the kitchen put by the pool bar now and again    I emailed somebody who works for the hotel before arrival asking about a kettle. She replied and advised a kettle would be provided in our room. When we arrived the receptionist said that the woman is not based in the hotel and the hotel does not provide kettles! We had to go and buy one.    Rooms are not very clean and when we arrived the toilet was broke which was fixed within the hour. In 10 nights the bedding was changed twice    There is a creepy meeting point guy who tries to sell you way overpriced trips and when he realised he was t getting our money didn‚Äôt want to know us    I was told the pool was heated in the winter . It is not it‚Äôs freezing and the indoor one is not heated either    Overall we met some fantastic people but staying at this hotel has not made us feel rested at all it would be good for a 4 day short city break. Non all inclusive as just a base to go exploring but not for anything more    We loved Marrakech and will visit next year but this hotel is not for us and definitely not 4*,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abbilove
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,charlie094 wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Winter week away,Arrived at the hotel 10.30am and was told the room would be ready at 12. Had a wonder around the place it looked fine. Approached by meeting point travel to say we had to attend a meeting at 2pm so they could give information about the hotel and excursions and at looking at their prices we didn't bother as this was my second visit to marrakech so I knew what prices to expect.  The hotel is in hivernage which is very nice and safe to walk around. Taxi to the square pay no more than 40hm and same price to gueliz. Gueliz is the new town with shopping mall which is also very nice.  Staff at the hotel were all very friendly especially hassan the rep.  Food was hit and miss breakfast and lunch were fine but dinner wasn't great on any evening.  All inclusive started at 10 am and ended at 11pm.  Very reasonable to eat out with some excellent food available in restaurants nearby.  Highly recommended comptoir darna restaurant and also barometer m is a must visit amazing food and excellent cocktails but pre book as very popular.    Our room had a balcony which overlooked the main road and city could be noisy at times but preferred a balcony to just a small window. Very spacious and modern but the bathroom was in need of refurbishment.  Cleaned daily so for somewhere to sleep and refresh was fine.    Essaouira is about 3 hours away and is a beautiful part of Morocco so do try and visit the souks were selling the usual souvenirs at half the price.  Booked our excursions on trip advisor and were all good and much cheaper than meeting point from the hotel.    Pools were very cold as the sun doesn't hit till lunch time but OK to dip in.  For what we paid we had a fantastic week away. Yes there are better hotels but at a price.  Marrakech is not Spain so don't expect all inclusive to be the same.  Added a few pics of barometer and various from essaouira and square.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,marleytraveller wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Pools too cold for winter sun.,Booked a break for some winter sun. The hotel is located in the new town and is situated well for the Menara Mall and restaurants. It is approximately a 30 min walk to the Medina  so taxi is recommended. A row of nice cafes across from hotel when the all inclusive is getting very samey.  The receptionists speak mainly French but you are allocated a Meeting Point host who speaks English. To be honest though once they realise you have no interest in booking excursions their interest wears off very quickly.  All inclusive not great. Buffet breakfast lunch and dinner. Wine available with meals . Choice extremely repetitive and usual free for all to get your meal. We had dinner once and it was enough we ate out the rest of the time. The bar was really smokey and it depended on the mood of the bar staff where you were to be served as you were all inclusive. Drinks stop at 11 in the bar and you would have to go to the club cabaret if you wanted more. Entertainment in bar was purely for kids and in a very confined area.  We chose this hotel as it had a heated indoor pool. Here‚Äôs the rub....it‚Äôs not heated and it‚Äôs not free. It would cost 80dirhams per use per person. We really wanted a swim and were reluctantly going to pay but we tested the temp and it was as cold as the outdoor pool. No good for winter sun.  Staff friendly when you engage them but only once prompted. They are not rude just not friendly.  Minor things like bedroom bins not being emptied a couple of times and balcony not swept and flies left but overall very clean.  Taxi everywhere is 50 dam seems to be the negeotiated price . Taxi to airport was 70dhm.  Red bus tour is good but only do red line and be aware only one bus has guided commentary.  For a special meal go to Comptoir Darna .  Jardin Marjorelle worth a visit.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Richard S wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Nice hotel with very friendly staff,This is a smart hotel with spacious clean comfortable rooms and shower facilities. I think that the Moroccans must be the friendliest people I have met and the hotel staff are no exception. We were out a lot on trips so can‚Äôt give feedback about gym swimming pool etc. The food was really nice.  The Atlas Mountains and scenery we saw on our trips out are beautiful and stunning. The country was a lot greener than expected. Apart from a cool wet day when we arrived the weather was really nice hot enough for sunbathing.  The only downside of our holiday (and this is not about the hotel) was the fact that you can get seriously ripped off by being overcharged for things. The taxi to the hotel charged 20 Euro‚Äôs for a 3 mile journey from the airport. Even the little boy who pestered us selling tissues in the market (who I felt a bit sorry for) took our money but disappeared without giving us the tissues ! The kilo of walnuts that I managed to ‚Äòhaggle‚Äô down to a price slightly better than you‚Äôd get in Tesco weighed in at under half a kilo when I got home. We did meet a lot of honest genuine people but I‚Äôve never encountered dishonesty on such a scale before. I think the Moroccan tourist industry needs to address this problem as it could put people off going back.  Most hotel staff spoke English to some degree. However I noticed some fellow Brits struggling to get the barman to understand what they wanted and sounding a bit aggressive in the process. I don‚Äôt think we should expect that everyone in Morocco should be able to understand English - it does help a lot to ask for things in French if possible and attempt simple greetings in Arabic like salaam aleikum or shukraan (thank you). If you‚Äôre not confident with this sort of thing you can always use Google translate on your phone and show the translation to the person you‚Äôre talking to if they don‚Äôt understand.  We arranged a trip to the Atlas Mountains through the hotel - it was quite expensive at about ¬£80 per person and didn‚Äôt have some of the things included in other similar trips I‚Äôve seen - one trip includes a hike to see a waterfall and I was disappointed when I realised this wasn‚Äôt included in our trip.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kettering, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N67NVrichards

You Pay""  after 4 people shouting at us in Arabic and French we found an English speaker...agreed we had paid and would talk to directors...then walked off never to be seen again  had to pay the tax again in the end or they refused to check us in  then threw room key on counter and walked off we had to collect our own bags and find where in the hotel our room was ourselves    Breakfast food was cold undercooked  hotel was aware of this and provided a Microwave for you to warm it up  asked 5 people for water and none provided had to get a part used bottle off a vacant table in the end    Dinner Service was atrocious had eaten Dinner by the time we were asked if we wanted a drink  waiters concentrated on the young female groups and groups they knew would tip ignored everyone else  hotel was off season and not busy    Moroccan restaurant was good but booking was a nightmare  when we tried to book at reception (Friday. Same staff member that checked us in) we were told it was full that night (our friend later told us that there was 2 people in there when they went that night)  we were told we could book the following Wednesday instead we said we couldn't as traveling home wed morning.  then was offered Monday we agreed and was told we had to come back Sunday to book????  (can book wed on Friday but not Monday??)

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,skye13 wrote a review Nov 2018,20,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying here,When we arrived here we were given a warm welcome by the reception staff and shown to our room. The room itself was quite spacious but the noise from the busy road could be heard all the time day/night as the double glazing didn‚Äôt seem to do much to stop this. The air conditioning only worked when it wanted to often sending out warm air instead of cold whilst our phone in room never worked as well as on one occasion our towels/bed spread were removed and not returned (we complained about the phone air con bed spread & towels-only towels were dealt with/returned. The food was quite good with a wonderful lady making morrocan pancakes in the morning and every night there was a choice of chicken/fish & normally beef but was quite repetitive.  One word of warning in restaurant if you are asked if you want fizzy water or beer (large not small) and you agree you will be charged regardless of being all inclusive and the waiters being aware of this (this was not explained to us and we had to pay 65 Drn we were never given a receipt for this and we never received any change back from the waiter).  On the subject of all inclusive/drinks the all inclusive here is not like AL in Spain Caribbean/other countries yes you have your meals covered but drinks are only available from pool bar/piano bar and it can be a struggle to get one (I waited 35 mins had to ask 3 times when bar was quiet for a mint tea and when it did arrive it was full of brown/old mint leaves) it seems if you are french German or local you will be served promptly/receive plentiful drinks but if you are English you will often be left waiting or ignored in favour of others (numerous English guest mentioned this to us as well) unless of course you are a young lady. Drinks seemed to be watered down and beer would be decanted into very small plastic cups so 1 beer would go between 2-3 people. We saw locals in piano bar being served immediately by table service and this leads to the most worrying aspect.  In the piano bar every night sat two older local men that were continuously being table served (we never saw them pay for a beer and they didn‚Äôt have any tell tell hotel arm bands on) who would leer at all the young ladies often shouting across the room at them or would proposition them and even when turned down would keep persistently asking for there room numbers/to go for drinks in the room (this was making all the girls we spoke with very uncomfortable the bar staff were aware of this but seemed to be laughing about it). It made us so uncomfortable that we stopped going to the bar after day 3. We also witnessed an unpleasant incident were 2 English girls complained about there drinks being made out of sight/with no alcohol being put into drinks and when challenged the bar staff completely ignored the girls/refused to serve them and eventually called in a guy who looked like security to stand at the end of the bar and just stare at them. The girls explained they were all inclusive and would like some drinks with alcohol in and only after saying they were going to manager at reception were the girls offered a drinks/wine.  I will definitely be coming back to marrakech as city/people are lovely but I won‚Äôt be staying here again and wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,hampshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skye13
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Richard A wrote a review Nov 2018,20,"Good, the Bad and the Ugly","Apologies for the random order -    We arrived in the Hotel to a warm welcome and we were immediately directed to the restaurant as they stop serving at 2130.  After dumping our bags in the room (which was clean and spacious with a balcony) we ventured into the restaurant. We went all inclusive which after reading some of the other reviews we were quite apprehensive.  The food was good with fish meat and veggie options.  The red wine wasn't the best (probably clean jewellery quite well) and when we ordered some fizzy water and a Moroccan beer we were charged extra - 65MAD. The waiter did not notice (or ignored) our all inclusive bracelets.  Pool area nice and clean but the water was very cold even for November.  Pool bar (the only bar during the day for the All-Inclusive) was very hit and miss - all drinks served in small plastic cups that you'd expect to find on a water cooler in an office (one 330ml bottle of beer looked like it was being shared between 2/3 cups). Spirit measures very small.  If you can speak French/local dialect you'd probably be able to complain and get more but they just seem to shrug their shoulders and ignore everyone. You either got served immediately or would have to stand for up to 10-15 minutes as they seemed to be constantly chatting amongst themselves. The hotel wasn't that busy and they still seem to have full staff for the high season!  One night we witnessed the Piano Bar staff ignore two holiday makers (English) after they complained about the lack of spirits in their drinks (the bar staff disappeared when they ordered the drinks and reappeared with glasses for them made without the spirits and from a room behind the bar) - this then accumulated in what appeared to be a security man coming in and standing in intimidating manner. Only after they continued to complain as they were all inclusive were they finally offered a suitable alcoholic beverage.  The locals seem to get preferential treatment with table service whilst guests were left waiting at the bar unless you are a young female.  The a/c seems to work in the room when it wants and beds have been made and room cleaned daily and we have had numerous creations of towels on the bed.  Our room was facing the main road and the balcony doors did not block out the sound of traffic which never seems to let up.  Breakfast pancakes were excellent - the lady making them was like a machine churning then out with military precision.  We didn't venture into the Spa - not our thing but the indoor pool looked amazing. One thing I will add is that the labranda website fact sheet for the hotel shows the other hotels aqua park so check the photos on other hotel booking sites.  15-20 minutes from the Mosque and Jeema-al-Fnaa and the Medina but harassed by taxi drivers as soon as you step out of the hotel. A polite ""la shoukran"" works wonders.  Would we come back ?

Food was ok always something to eat but couple really busy nights with overnight stays and food ran out and did not seem to be replenished which was a shame as my sister had her meatballs stolen from her spoon by another guest lol well we had to laugh animation team work so hard and were very nice. We were all inclusive but trying to get a drink was a nightmare at both the pool bar well the swim up one is only a pay bar and the other one well we asked for beer and when the barman did decide to serve us by the way a male sitting at the bar just constantly had his glass filled our beer was in a small disposable cup 1/4 beer and rest froth he did not seem to like us very bad service and well the creepy little man in the piano bar who mentioned his bee farm and how it makes him able to take 2 women at a time lol none of us which was 5 of us all women of a certain age wanted to go to the bar and to be honest when we did get a drink it was bloody awful brandy and lemonade was whisky pina colada was disgusting and tried some red thing which I had to leave.it seemed if you pay for your drink and are constantly tipping you will get a decent drink. It was a shame as the bar and outside was lovely. 10 mins up the road is a mall and restaurants which at night is so vibrant but of course no alcohol but was lovely to sit and people watch and also recommend Marrakech hop on hop off tour bus was great to see the city.

However it took over a few hours and when we went to the rooms they werent done yet at all. The children were getting really cranky and tired after waiting for so long. We finally got our rooms around half five which was really dissapointing since we were all tired and got our rooms really late. The manager Mehdi was quick to help.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Paul01010101 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Ups and Downs,Family holiday for seven people (five children aged 12-17) for one week all-inclusive.    The positives - very clean hotel aqua park excellent good location (although is an urban hotel) most staff very pleasant good daily cleaning of room.    Hotel in good repair and attractive in general with free safe in room (didn‚Äôt have a fridge but some of the other rooms did - seems it‚Äôs hit and miss).    Negatives - most staff speak little English and this can be frustrating if you‚Äôre not use to it.    We arrived in the middle of the night to be informed not all four booked rooms were next to each other (as had been previously arranged). One of the rooms was adjoining another (not one of our party‚Äôs) but had no lock so wasn‚Äôt good when one of the kids opened it to find a man sleeping (who unsurprisingly wasn‚Äôt happy). Reception unable to resolve this at the time.    Not a great start and on top of that trying to purchase water when we arrived was challenging (you think that as a welcome they would leave a free bottle of water in each room).    Some of the staff (particularly one man at the free pool bar) was abrupt and didn‚Äôt smile once. He seemed to be like that with everyone so at least he was consistent! Shocking that the hotel management haven‚Äôt addressed this poor service which must be bad for business.    As has been mentioned by others only the pool bar serves free alcohol - hotel bar and aqua park bars were not included which is poor as the aqua park was where we spent most of our days. Free drinks also served in very small plastic cups which spoiled the experience significantly.    Food was varied and of good quality but mainly salads and vegetable dishes. And a lot of rude guests taking excess food then washing it.    I experienced gastroenteritis after three days which put a dampener on things (for me at least!)    Everyone enjoyed themselves so that was the main thing.    For people looking for a sunny holiday be aware that Morocco is very different from your usual European sun holiday. Both the food and language differences as well as being in the minority as a UK native can take some getting used to. As can the attitude of many local men towards females in the party especially if they didn‚Äôt have a male with them.    Also - crossing the main roads in Morocco is dangerous. I thought Naples was bad but Morocco takes it to a new level. Traffic in general is shocking and seeing four people riding a 50cc moped was common!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Denbigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul01010101

I went there with my girlfriend on arrival it was quiet and the meeting point agent signed us in.    One thing I will say is avoid meeting point . They are expensive and they will lie . Hamsa took a excursion sheet off us that was given to us by are transport driver and stated they were the same company. Also stating other tours do not pick up . This is a lie we had no problems with this .    Once we got to are room in was clean cool and ac worked . You could get a iron and kettle from downstairs .    We faced the aqua park it was nice quiet and view pleasant. We did not have a balcony but next to us was a terrace .    Breakfast- this is always the same fresh fried egg or omlette  Juices fresh fruit  Sausage  Breads and pastry  All hot and tasty  You will not find a full English though.    Lunch - this changed daily from hot kebabs fresh pannies and fresh cooked pasta dishes .  Also salads chips and fresh bread    Also you can order at reception for the bar food fresh meet salad and rice .This needs to be advertised more    Dinner  Stews  Tagines  Pizza  Local foods  Pasta  Chicken dishes    Prior reviews state the food is bad it is not . If your a picky eater or just want British food stay in Britain    The only complaint was the food went down hill on the Sunday.    The bars  There are two main bars the pool bar and the piano bar    One is for all inclusive and the piano bar for paid  You can still sit in there with your drinks  The pool bar is good get cocktails run vodka gin olives    The measurements are small but you can ask for more .    There is a distaste for English with some of the bar staff. But make an effort speak French be friendly . Don't moan about everything . I witnessed English while I was there the English moaned constantly about the bees the drinks .    There are bees they leave you be and the do there thing    Entertainment through out the day appeared good we never got invited yo join or spoke to by the entertainment staff . We were not making an effort either    Cleaners clean daily    Pool is great aqua park decent    Wi-Fi was in are room    Staff were really helpful a few people were rude or would simple ignore my self serve everyone else  Jamal at the bar was payicaly good at this,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leebI7975WY

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Cou√´toux J wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Nice family hotel,Stayed there four nights with our two kids 7&9. I was a bit concerned with all the bad reviews yet we decided shortly before our vacation to sacrifice the charm of a medina riad for this more kid friendly hotel and eventually we were happy with our decision.  The hotel is not all new but it‚Äôs clean (cleaning done everyday) our family room was very spacious and the hotel was really much enjoyable. With the summer heat we really enjoyed the convenience of the swimming pool and of the aqua park. The location was also good. We didn‚Äôt try the all inclusive though nor did we take part in any activities as we were just visiting the town most of the time so cannot be judge of that. Besides the reception staff that might be straightforward from time to time everybody was really kind and helpful to us. Anyway we really enjoyed our stay and if you‚Äôre just looking for a cheap accommodation with family fun I would definitely recommend that hotel.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cou_touxj

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Andy M wrote a review Aug 2018,30,Good value for money but only small percentage of rooms have a balcony not like it says in the adverts all rooms have ba,excellent food with a good variety Room was big and clean with a very good chamber made each day. Pools good and a very good variety of things to do each day including petanque water fitness dancing etc.  The only negatives were as follows very poor staff at reception none of which wanted to help if you were English The all inclusive bar had a serious health problem with Wasps around the Pepsi dispenser (the first drink we had included a wasp in the cup) none of the staff seemed to worry at all. The restaurant need to put up signs to say only take what you will eat many of our Arab and Muslim friends were filling the tables with food only to leave more than half of it. This was awful and we got very annoid when we saw what was being taken and left with others having to go without.  Before we left for our break i emailed and asked a few questions that i wanted to know about one was the spa and its offers etc and another was to do with Gluten free food. I emailed 5 times and never got one reply ? I raised this when we arrived and checked in and all i got was a shrug of the shoulders as if to say we dont care.  This was a real shame as its in a good position and has a great deal going for it but the main problem is the staffing which is seriously letting the side down.  I would love to hear back from the manager who seemed to go awol on the last day hiding round the corner when he new we wanted to speak to him ?  i would say more of a 3 star with the staff and the wasps around the drinks areas letting it down big time.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sutton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andymE2193BL

Staff are very helpful and it really helps if you try a little French. They really appreciate it.    Food is good and plentiful. There was always something I could eat. Breakfast was excellent. Restaurant staff really do their best to make you feel at home.    Rooms are really big and comfortable. We slept really well.    There are only a few things to improve-    No tea/coffee facilities in room.  No A/C in lobby.  WiFi only in lobby so definitely need A/C.    Otherwise thanks for a wonderful stay.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,amylawton2 wrote a review Jun 2018,20,13 reasons not to visit! It's a long read but hopefully helpful.,"Firstly the hotel itself is quite nice a little dated with some questionable maintenance however it's clean and rooms where a good size fresh towels and room made up daily and had no faults with the house keeping team at all! Location is good a 10 min walk to the new town and train station in one direction and airport and shopping centre in the other and only 1.8km to the Jemaa el Fna square and souks.    However!! Our holiday was dampened by the following I have bullet pointed for ease but its a long read.    1. We checked in early hours on the saturday having landed late friday night. It wasn't until the morning that we realised we hadn't got our all inclusive bands we then had to ask reception who almost didnt believe we hadn't recieved them before making our way to breakfast.    2. We didnt recieve any information of the hotel dining times or facilities.. and there was no information in the rooms other than a TV channel list. We found out from other guests on a trip that you can order pool side snacks.. the day before? And trip advisor about booking in the Moroccan restaurant  (which was delicious and empty so no need to have booked).    3. No snack bar 4pm snacks was taken from the morning breakfast leftover pastries and without knowing we could pre order there were no menus for any food or drink which I hadn't come across at an all inclusive before.    4. Italian and Bbq restaurants ""did not work"". Leaving only the main restaurant area and Moroccan restaurant. The food in the main restaurant is mediocre at best and the meat is NEVER cooked thoroughly when asking for well done (grilled chicken) we got a shrug and given it pink anyway.    5. All inclusive is probably not the all inclusive we all come to expect we were given tiny plastic cups of drinks and alcohol and it would have been quite nice to have had a pint. If your paying the bar for a drink you get a full bottle of beer but if paid for all inclusive its not despite asking for the rest of the 330ml bottle we were told no glass outside the bar and seems one rule for paying guests and one for all inclusive guests. In an evening the poolside bar upgrades your plastic cup to a small glass.    6. It's an effort to get any water unless its lunch or dinner time and only from the restaurant after 11pm when everything is closed I had to beg someone for a half opened bottle which he kindly gave up as the resturant and bar staff refused to go into the restaurant to get a fresh bottle as it was closed. We had skipped dinner that evening as chose to eat out! And lack of local shops meant we hadn't been able to pick one up.    7. Some staff can speak English however its difficult to get any sort of nice hospitality from them. It is a French speaking resort and unless you speak french you will struggle.    8. Meeting point and reception staff told us one thing one day and another thing the next day on 4 seperate occasions and everything is a battle and stressful this varied from the price of trips the price of car hire the price of taxi to the airport and the offer to sort a room for our late check out.    9. There is No Wi-Fi other than lobby which is fine if you don't need your phone but would be nice to research the area in your room.    10. When we arrived we were given room 240 directly above the ""club"" the next morning we requested a quieter room and given 554 overlooking the new pool building site and works started at 5/6am until 8/9pm and also above the deliveries entrance which was actually alot noisier!    11. There were works around the hotel throughout our stay.. they were drilling painting laying new block paving around the pool area and new electric cables near the small pool so not really relaxing at all. Major repairs shouldn't be carried out whilst guests are present as on our last day we were sat in clouds of dust.    12. No tennis or basketball courts as advertised I assume this made way for the new slides etc but again non of this was advised through our booking agent or hotel website itself.    13. Check out is 12pm however our flight wasnt until 11pm and having paid for the Friday before and not using the room until Saturday we asked for a little flexability to keep our room longer. There are NO facilities for you to keep your luggage safe have a shower unless you use the outdoor pool showers or freshen up and staff insisted you pay an extra 40euro (almost a full nights rate) for a room until 6pm?    Overall I wouldn't visit the hotel again the staff are rude and unhelpful and the hotel doesnt care about its guests only on earning a few extra euros. I am sure there are plenty other hotels nicer and better quality than the Labranda rose.    It was stressful throughout and in the end we dreaded the same mundane food and avoided eating at the hotel when we could.",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amylawton2

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Elƒ´na P wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Great hotel.,The hotel by itself is very nice. We spent there 8 nights. Didn‚Äôt have to complain about anything. Room was cleaned every day towels were changed everyday too. Pool is very big and clean. Plenty of sun beds. Pool towels you can hire for 100 dirham. Also have a jacuzzi. After two months or so they will have a water park at the hotel which I think it‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs not going to be very huge but with few slides and pool for kids. We had all inclusive delicious food and plenty of food. Everyday we left the restaurant full and happy. Unfortunately the Italian restaurant didn‚Äôt work we would have loved to try it. But there was also traditional Moroccan restaurant. If you want to have a dinner there then you have to make a booking a day before. Atmosphere and food was good. We had amazing spa experience at the hotel and it was very cheap. Sauna body scrubbing and massage done by very nice ladies. Awesome. The hotel staff is helpful polite and nice but I would suggest to improve a bit more of their English. Animation team tried their best to entertain everyone. Didn‚Äôt have any problems just because we are not French. Just be nice and people around you will be nice too. Can‚Äôt say anything bad about this hotel our experience was great.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Audrey-Ann P wrote a review Apr 2018,20,"What a deception! Worst service I ever had, reception staff laughed at us.",My friend and I were both very disappointed by this hostel. The hotel is very old and our room did not look like the picture at all. In our reservation it was mentioned that we had a safe in the room but we did not. We told the reception and they said we would have one when we came back from dinner. We didn‚Äôt and they told us we would have one the next day. We were there for five days and never got a safe. The reception staff is not helpful not flexible at all and didn‚Äôt really care about us during the stay when we went to see them for questions. We used the phone to make a call in Marrakech and got charged a lot more than what they told us it would be. At a moment the lady at the reception even laughed at us in our face they were quite disrespectful. The staff from the activity desk is ok two of them know the activities and are able to provide us with information but the rest of them I don‚Äôt know what they were doing there they were not even able to have a discussion with us. Our activity got canceled and the staff forgot to tell us so we discovered it at the time of the activity because there was no one downstairs. He lied to us saying that it was because it was a public holiday which was not true. He finally managed to organize something but we ended up paying too much for what we got.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Juice1985 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Fantastic hotel!!,We stayed here in March for 4 nights. We were a group of 4 ladies- mum 2 sisters and daughter so we had 2 interconnecting rooms. Overall we absolutely loved it!  The hotel is lovely from the minute we arrived our check-in was very smooth with welcoming staff. We were shown to our rooms which were a great size clean fresh and comfortable with a nice view of the pool and loads of cupboard space too.  The rooms are centered round a large Atrium which is the center of the hotel and a nice place to have a seat and relax we also went here to use the wi-fi.  We had a great weather so we spent most of our time by the pool which is really stunning. Loads of sun beds clean large pool it was fantastic. although the pool was really cold but lots of people were swimming to cool down from the sun!  A particular mention to the super entertainment team who were always chatting to us and trying to get us involved in actives like aqua gym petanq zumba card games and tagine making it was all great fun and you didn't have to do anything you didn't want to. Monair was super fun they were all great! We also went to the spa one morning when the sun had not come out and had a hammam which was really good and relaxing.The manager walked round and spoke to everyone by the pool and asked if they were enjoying the holiday etc which was nice.  We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and this was fine a wide choice with live cooking stations and good quality food. Jonelle the waitress was particularly welcoming and friendly. We booked the hotel's Moroccan restaurant one night so that was good for a change of scenery.  The evening bar was nice it had some entertainment and a band most nights it was a good atmosphere to relax with a drink you could also watch sports on a screen in there too.  Overall we loved our stay here it was only 10 minutes drive from the airport and 5 minutes taxi to the medina and the souks so the location was ideal. relaxing rooms fun staff and great pool - and a very reasonable price for the quality.

Clean in fact they would have cleaned every day if I let them. Didn't have a fridge but asked & 1 was brought up immediately. The heating worked fine & stayed on when out had to turn it down to sleep. Beautiful foyer/lounge area & fantastic pool. Entertainment lads worked relentlessly well done boys! Piano bar nice and cosy staff were a good laugh despite the language barrier school girl French came back to me! Music from Hafid 6 nights a week and nightclub next door was interesting!

After reading some of the reviews on here I really do not get why people put this hotel down. Yes there's a chip in the table in the room Does it spoil your holiday NO... Yes the one of the four wardrobe doors doesn't shut properly does it spoil your holiday... NO. This hotel is stunning inside and out. The staff here work tirelessly every minute of every day to make your holiday a good one. The reception staff are friendly and welcoming the animation team make you feel at home and do a good job of entertaining you/children the bar staff work morning til evening and never scowl at you they welcome you with a smile and friendly service even though they are tired. Pool area is great big and plenty of sunbeds. Pool is quite cold but just jump in and you soon forget. The piano bar is catered for families at one end with no smoking and the other end near the bar live singers every night and tv/sport on at all times. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that but if it's anything like the surrounding areas to eat then I don't think there will be a problem. There's a nightclub attached to the hotel (which we are visiting tonight) . The hotel is located right in the middle of everything.  Overall I would recommend this hotel (we paid ¬£400 that's including flights and transfers and for room only for 1 week).

The spa staff are a joke and would not treat us for some reason perhaps because we did not speak French or Arabic. There was no heating in the room so we were freezing. There is no plugs near the mirrors so girls will have to straighten their hair in the bathroom which is a hassle leaning over the sink. Also NO WIFI! at this day and age it is a joke especially that they said they had wifi in the advert. The wifi is only downstairs in the lobby - too much effort to go up and down from the above floors.

Getting a good room was pure lottery which we didn't won.    The first biggest two issues were that the heating system was not working (it was providing cold air which was smelling bad) and the windows had problems as those did not close well and cold air would passing through. The temperature inside the room was very low. We ask them to fix the issueswhich they said they did but what they've done was to turn on the ""heating system"" all the time (which was providing bad smells) and left the windows as they were. Our fix was to block the windows with pillows which partially fixed the problem as now we got stuck with the bad smells (the ""heating system"" couldn't be stoped anymore) .    Next the water was cold and the shower was not working properly.    No WiFi in rooms - you have to come to the lounge area to use internet.    In the end I asked them to give us glasses because we wanted to have some drinks in the room but they refused us and said that the glasses are just at the bar and if we want to have a drink the bar is the right place. We had to go in the kitchen and get some plastic glasses in order to drink inside the room.    p.s. If you want to get alcohol there is a Carrefour next to the hotel which has good prices (3 4 times cheaper than hotel bar) but it's open till 6 PM.

Im very disappointed to the fact that this hotel room lacks basic services like warm water working telephone clean toilet paper ( they put only used ones which is a shame ) I advise them to remove it and ask clients to bring theirs). internet in the 21st century in a 4* hotel they asked me to sit in the lobby. wobderful idea. I have asked for a smoking room and the staff suggested to smoke in the corridor. nice one. for these special ideas. in regards to my accomodations I m confident that I made the wrong choice for first time.    Without a doubt it was the ugliest hotel I have ever visited. I traveled to many countries. And booked at many hotels even in marrakech. And believe me this one is the worst and even a 3* hotel is quite better    Service was 0. They treat clients like ......  I m sorry. But they changed the name of this hotel from les idrissides which has very bad image to labranda rose. Im sorry to hit you with the fact that it was not enough.    Room. Telephone out of service. Warm water 0. Used toilet paper. Rust every where. Room service came at 5pm to make my room. Fridge not working.

My room was comfortable clean and better than I thought with a good TV ad fridge.The staff were all OK and polite. Breakfast was good with a lot of choice. I did have a dinner buffet one night that I didnt like much and cost 200 dihram. Plenty of restaurants near by.You can walk into the old town or take a short taxi ride I bought a ticket (190 dr) for the tourist bus which lasted two for days and stopped just near the hotel. I didnt use the pools they looked nice I heard they were cold but I cant vouch for that.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Adventure743251 wrote a review Dec 2017,10,If I could PAY you not to book I would,Where shall I start. Me my mum my friend and her two year old son visited this BUILDING and came back Friday 1st December 2017. So bad was the service that I actually tried to get internet connection so I could write my trip advisor review while I was there. If i could legally pay you not to go to this hotel until they sort themselves out I would.    I travel frequently and consider myself to be very open minded when visiting different countries because everyone does things differently. I understand that at times there will be language barriers cultural challenges and differences especially with people so im not quick to speak negatively and try to see things from the other persons perspective before being offended. I dont write negative reviews but unfortunately on this occasion I have had to.    Hotel not for English people    The hotel is not for English people. To put it frankly a dog would have been treated better then us. They go out of their way to accommodate and look after the French and Germans but the English are just not regarded even when I did my best to speak in french and constantly said Salaam-Alaikum before making any requests.    Room not ready    When we arrived we were told our room wasn't ready and would have to wait until 2pm even though we had a screaming child with us and we had been travelling all morning. Unfortunatly we just had to let the child scream and cry in the foyer and lo and behold 5 minutes later our room was miraculously available.    Even if check in is at 2pm you would think that knowing we had been travelling all morning and just to provide good customer service they would have let us in a couple of hours early especially with a screaming child.    We had no help bringing our luggage upstairs and wasn't told this service was even available. So we all had to struggle in the lift with our luggage a pushchair and a child. But once again when the French and Germans were checking in there was miraculously lots of moving trolleys available and a very energetic bell man transporting luggage in the foyer and i witnessed this on several occassions. We even had to ask where to go to get up into our room.    Hotel room    The hotel room was'nt too bad but there was'nt enough storage in the room i was sharing with my friend and her child. I even had to drag one of the side tables into my room just so I could put my suitcase under it and put things on top. My friend used half her bed to put her and her sons clothes on as we didn't have a wardrobe or draws.    We did self catering and was suppose to get a fridge and kettle and we got neither so ended up having to buy milk reguarly because even the box milk which didn't need to be stored in a fridge went off quickly due to the warm weather.    Buying coffee    When I brought coffe a few mornings I was given mixed information. Some mornings i had to give the money to the waiting staff other mornings I was told it would go on my room bill. So I had to check to makesure nothing had gone on my room bill because I had already paid the waiter. There was a lot of confusion and miscommunication and no one seem to know what the right protocol was for self catering people buying food and drink.    Horrible Man at reception (does currency exchange)    When we were getting ready to go home we had to contact the transport 24 hours before. I asked at reception and the guy that does the currency (see photo) was very rude and pointed telling me to go to the place where they book day trips. I told him I just needed to use the phone to call and he said I would have to pay which I have never ever heard of before. Normally hotels go out of their way to ensure you're able to print off any boarding passes or make any arrangenents so you have everything you need before you leave for the airport. I asked gim for his name so i had it as a reference to query later and he REFUSED. I was so shocked I honestly for the first time in the many trips I have been on never felt more stranded and alone and I have been to Morocco before but a different hotel.    I went to the trips room called 'me point' and the guy said I could use the phone at first and even called on my behalf but when more important people came in to enquire about his extremely overpriced day trips he sent me away and told me I had to go back to reception.    Moving forward    The prices are obviously lower because they have lost a lot of business. In terms of what they can do to resolve the crisis they are having I think it would be good to put the staff through customer service training maybe bring someone in. I wouldn't be willing to return until I can see the service is better.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventure743251

I was checked in by an unfriendly receptionist who seemed as if he is unhappy with his job. Upon check in nothing was mentioned I.e. breakfast timing hotel facilities check out timing etc.    Location  The hotel is in a good location as it‚Äôs very close to the new town as well as the old town.    Housekeeping department works really hard as the room was found spotless every evening on my return.    Spa  I used hotel spa facilities the staff is nice and friendly but I think they don‚Äôt do justice to the price you pay.    Breakfast  It‚Äôs too repetitive they could do with more choice of food.    Overall I am not too keen on this hotel as the front office staff is very unfriendly. They don‚Äôt understand that they are the face of the business and for them to look miserable is not acceptable. They all seem quite unhappy/dissatisfied in their job.  They don‚Äôt know the meaning of customer service. They don‚Äôt wish to go the extra mile to bring a smile on their guests face.    Next time I will definitely choose a different hotel.

The greeting at hotel was nice rooms looked good until we noticed air conditioning was not working so we got moved to another room. The second room given to us had a balcony which opens from the outside and we were not giving a key to lock the balcony door. Bathroom had no shower curtain there was a hole in the ceiling. The shower was blocked and flooded the hallway on first use of the shower. No locks on toilet doors. Music is played at late hours of the night. The second room we had one bed short so we had to squeeze then got moved a third time to another room. The bathroom smelt of urine on arrival to new room toilets were dirty even before use. Electricity cupboard was left open no lock. Easily accessible for little children. I read reviews on this hotel before staying here. I came across both good and bad reviews and thought I would make my own judgment on the hotel and I have regretted this decision since the second day baring in mind it was a seven day stay. Definitely will not book this hotel again. Not all staff are friendly.

Their website lies and when we complained through love holidays the hotel replied with defamatory statements.  When we arrived the welcome meeting at meeting point was not about the hotel it was just about excursions.  The food was appalling I have stayed in hotels in north africa and nothing has been as bad as this hotel I spoke with the restaurant manager and head chef but nothing changed the food was cold and they used left overs for the meals.  The staff were rude and abysmal. Yvette in particular was rude she refused our party water as part of us was AI and we were HB while a French AI couple opposite us had 2 bottles wine and 3 bottles water hows that fair?  The currency exchange man tried to rob us a few times even though we had the amount on our phones..  The room we had was a balcony but this shouldnt have happened although we had paid for one.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Jonny F wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Overall not bad,We moved to this hotel after being allocated an awful hotel by Teletext. Though the rooms were dated and basic they were adequate. If anything I would say the bathroom needed a refurb. The towel rail was hanging off and the water took a while to drain away after a shower. Other than that no real issue as bed was comfy and room cleaned daily.    Pool area was big plenty of sun beds. And clean towels available daily. The entertainment staff were fun and spoke by good English and often sat chatting it's us.    We upgraded to all inclusive and it was annoying you were only allowed to acquire drinks from the pool bar. If you wanted to watch the entertainment you had to leave the room go to the pool bar then return. Some evenings it was pouring with rain so I got wet. During they day all drinks were served in a small plastic cup whilst those paying over the counter got a glass. When I asked for a glass I was refused during the day but was allowed on an evening...    The food was fine. There was a good selection for all with some meals cooked fresh. However SOME not all of the staff were ride or ignorant and when you asked for omelette it was as though they were doing you a massive favour and they scowled. However some staff were really nice and friendly. My gripe is that birds were flying around the restaurant and perching on light fittings above food and staff did nothing to deter this.    I can't say Marrakech is a place I would return to.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scarborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonny243

When they took us upstairs after all that time the room was still not ready so we had to wait additional 45min and no one even said sorry. There was no information provided about anything we had to ask for times of meals been served etc. Nothing was translated into English. We could get drinks only from a pool bar and not from a hotel bar. All entertainment was in French.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Sandra R wrote a review Oct 2017,10,Not as described run down and terrible food,We stayed here for a week and after reading the other reviews I went with an open mind... sadly they were right.    The room was basic no coffee making facilities as described air con barely worked broken mirror which I had to pick off the floor and door when we arrived which despite reporting was not dealt with. Beds were not comfortable and we both struggled to sleep.    The food was bland and recycled from lunch to dinner and vice versa. By day three we could not stand anymore and ate out. If you were a paying guest or french rather than all inc and british you clearly got different treatment. This was far to apparent and the hotel needs to address this.    The best part of the hotel was the pool and pool bar staff. They work hard to take as good care of you as they can.    I would not recommend this hotel for any more than a night or a stop over. For what we paid To go all inclusive it was appalling and the worst we have ever encountered.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Ricky Medcalf wrote a review Sep 2017,20,Great for the French... Not for the English!,The room we were given was lovely fourth floor with a balcony. Maid came everyday clean towels and bedding every other day. Air conditioning worked well if you leave it on all day and night don‚Äôt turn it off otherwise it‚Äôll take forever to cool the room back down.    The staff are unfriendly towards English people. They would deliberately serve French people behind you in the queue and make you wait. The portions for the drinks were tiny a small throwaway plastic cup - the sort the dentist gives you with mouthwash in! The food wasn‚Äôt that great - we really struggled to find anything to eat and ate out every evening except one. Other English people we spoke to in the hotel who has eaten in the hotel every night had complained of upset stomachs.    We went All Inclusive and we noticed that other people with Half Board and Full Board wrist bands were treated with more respect than people who had All Inclusive wrist bands on!    The entertainment staff were the best part of the hotel and although their English was limited they tried they best and we spent a good few hours chatting with them over the course of the week. Ibrahim and Mohammed were lovely although Mohammed hated the hotel too and left on the day we were leaving because he had had enough too. The hotel pool was a decent size although wasn‚Äôt as clean as you would expect!    The best thing about the hotel is the location. 10 minute taxi from the airport and a 15 minute walk into the new town centre and a 15 minute walk in the other direction to the Souks. The hotel is located right near Marrakech train station which is handy if you want to explore further afield.    I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel if you‚Äôre English and want All Inclusive. However; it was cheap and was perfect to lay your head - if that‚Äôs what you want self catering would be fine here!,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/actualricky
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Bradley C wrote a review Sep 2017,30,"Good if you're French, not if you're British",Overall a pleasant place to stay. Not quite what I would call 'all inclusive'. Cups were laughably small (2 to 3 mouthfuls) if you asked for a second drink you were looked at very questionably. The staff clearly had a disliking to all Brits but were very welcoming to French tourists. That being said there was 1 young lady who worked around the pool and events who did a fantastic job and never seemed to stop working! The pool was lovely the rooms were not amazing but comfortable enough to lay your head after a day of exploring. The WiFi was only available in the lobby we could not get it on the second floor but you may be lucky on the first floor. I would not return to this place purely due to how unwelcome the staff make you feel but if you ignore the staff overall it is a lovely well kept hotel. The food was very nice and prepared well but not much variety from day to day. It seemed that whatever was left from breakfast would be made in to some sort of dish that evening.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,I H wrote a review Aug 2017,20,7 days misery,We are a family with a young teenager requested a triple room with a balcony however in this hotel the rooms were mostly the same with two single beds doubled up and a sofa against the window.I checked a balcony room on the 4th floor which was a double room with no sofa and low balcony wall and felt unsafe so declined.  On arrival we were given a room on the first floor facing the pool which had the animation team constantly blaring out loud music till late hours.  We changed rooms in the morning to a different level which was the same in layout away from constant loud music.  The hotel is accessed through the car park and not the front gate which is permanently shut causing an additional 50 meters walk which is not ideal particularly in the hot sun.I made numerous complaints but was advised by the staff this was due to security and all the hotels have done the same.I checked other hotels on the same road had direct access so felt this was an excuse to lower staff costs.  The breakfast was good albeit the staff were not efficient and did not replenish items quickly.Positive note the animation team were friendly and my son was kept entertained with pool games.the pool area was clean and plenty of free sun beds.  On balance I don't think I would choose this hotel again as it was below average and away from the centre of the city also surrounding cafesrestaurants and shops were pricey due to the amount of tourist hotels,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/646ih

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Rebecca wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Pleasant 10 Days,"The hotel was superb and the majority of staff were very welcoming and polite.    Currency Exchange  The hotel has a currency exchange inside but mistakes were made during our visit that were corrected. I advise you to watch carefully when they change your money to absolutely ensure you have the right amount owed to you and ask for a receipt. Alternatively there is an exchange facility about 10 mins walk if you turn right out of the hotel.    Food and drink  We were all inclusive and the food was good at the hotel with a large variety of meals to chose from. There are a few bars and restaurants in the hotel- one of which you have to book first and one bar in which you have to pay despite being all inclusive. There is also a bar for sheisha by the pool. The drinks were ""ok"" although the cups are very small. The staff don't limit how many cups you can order at one time but it would be more convenient and less runs to the bar if the cups were larger. I am sure the above cup situation is not the staffs fault. The BBQ/pool bar staff were usually welcoming particularly Sofaine and Abrahim.    Hygiene and rooms  The hotel is very clean and hygienic the rooms are cleaned daily and fresh towels are also provided at these times. The rooms were nice and the beds were very comfortable. Some rooms have balconies we had a balcony TV shower wardrobes with hangers and a hair dryer in the bathroom. Soap Shampoo and shower gel were provided on a daily basis too. Air con worked but wasn't massively powerful.  The pool and surrounding areas were also kept clean and tidy.    Entertainment  The entertainment was provided throughout the day and evening. Overall it was ok but could become quite repetitive. The children's entertainment is provided on the main stage outside and somewhat projected to all the other guests. It would have been nice to not listen to the children's same songs every night for hours. However the entertainment staff were outstanding with amusing the children but maybe this could happen else where to allow adult entertainment to be enjoyed too.    Excursions  The hotel is 15/20 mins from Menera Mall where their are a variety of restaurants shops and a supermarket (turn right of the hotel and walk straight for about 20 mins until you see the traffic lights). We didn't really find many bars in the area that were not restaurants apart from Buddha Bar next to the mall. Buddha bar has girls doing shows inside and plays latest UK music.    Taxis are readily available as soon as you set foot onto the pathways but barter on the price. We paid around 50 MAD for anything within 15 mins such as Medina Square etc. Medina square is a unique experience but watch out for people involuntarily putting snakes monkeys and henna tattoos on you and then trying to charge you!! Or overcharge for photos when you've partaken in the above.    There is a gentlemen called 'Ahmed' who provides a thorough tour of the old city and leather wood metal and fabric manufacture of all the unique handmade gifts that are sold everywhere in the city. Ahmed charges 100 MAD (¬£8 approx) for the day and he is very polite knowledgable and courteous. However part of the tour involves visiting numerous shops that are priced significantly higher than the surrounding shops that are readily available. Do not feel obliged to buy despite offers as the prices are still higher than what you should be paying. We also booked to visit 'Atlas Mountains' via Ahmed which cost 200 MAD pp (¬£17 approx) for a 1.5 hour drive. There a few stops on the way including few points Berbere houses and shops. On arrival at Atlas Mountains we paid 220 MAD (¬£18 approx) for a lovely Berbere tour guide who was very knowledgable and patient when climbing. The water falls were worth the hike as they were beautiful. After climbing we at at 'Restaurant Le Noyer' where you can eat 3 courses from 100 MAD- the food was delicious and very quickly served whilst we sat alongside the river that runs through the village.    Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Labranda and found that it met our needs. After such a relaxing week of nice food and limitless drinks etc I find it hard to believe some of the negative reviews previously posted about this hotel.",Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dover, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/884rebeccaj

The hotel food in my opinion was excellent but I love Moroccan Tagines my daughter on the other had does not so thank god for Mac Donald's down the road. The entertainment staff never stop and try to involve everyone . A massive problem with the pool bar was the size of the plastic cups they were like children's party cups so only a couple of mouthfuls which leaves you feeling like your constantly at the bar . I would advise future travellers to take their own larger plastic cup. Another bit of advice a small tip goes a long way and you will see huge improvement with your service.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,tim b wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Brilliant 2 weeks,As has been said on reading some of the reviews before going I was expecting a disaster but was left wondering if they had even been to the same hotel!  The staff in the restaurant couldn't do enough for you the food was varied and served with unlimited wine at lunch & evening. 1.5 litre bottles of water given out each time too.The rooms were cleaned daily and any complaints were dealt with promptly. For example we requested a balcony didn't get one and were moved before we had even started to unpack. The second room had no fridge and no bracket for the shower head. Both problems were resolved the first day.  Negatives; service at the bar can be slow and some not all of the bar staff can be 'waspy' (you will realise why I chose that word if you go there)  Everything finishes at 11pm lights out goodnight.  However the positives very much outweigh the negatives and finally the animation team must get a mention..Brilliant!!!!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Witham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timb694
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Angie W wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Weekend break.,Unexpectedly had a fantastic time even though I've read the reviews and we are English!! There was a bit of confusion with the room we were first given having booked a deluxe one bedroom suite and walking in to a one room small bathroom and no balcony offering.. we were quickly offered keys to two suites and told to take our pick üëåhousekeeping were there every day and were quick and discrete we did have to ask for towels and robes though as there were three of us and the room was laid out for two every time! Our only small grumble ( not complaint ) is the AI was very limited and the hot food was not particularly hot with only one small bar that kept running out of Rum ü•ÉüôÑ and the coffee machine in the restaurant could have done with being left on all day for use at lunch and dinner rather than just for breakfast.  The staff throughout the hotel made efforts to include all the guests no matter what nationality and the animation team were all fantastic üëåüëç  I can recommend the trip to the square at night by horse and cart and most of all... go on a camel ride üê™ xxx,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Stevenage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/watersbaby
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Pearly wrote a review Jul 2017,10,HELL!!,What I am about to say is FACT not fabricated in any way !  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel unwelcome staff rude can't be bothered attitude everything too much trouble! We arrived approximately 9.30pm. Rooms are dated bathroom dirty blood on shower curtain shower head full of mould and towels stunk. Went to the restaurant and managed to have a quick bite to eat standard food nothing labelled though. Water was from a dispenser which tasted weird when I asked for a bottle of water was pointed in direction of dispenser. Bar was very poor had a handful of local spirits which were definitely watered down no atmosphere at all and no entertainment except a bloke singing. The next day we got up went for breakfast which again was poor coffee machine not working and when I asked for a bottle of water was told 'dispenser'. Lunch was salads etc so it was ok but not great. When we went for dinner that night there was nothing that looked edible so we didn't bother and went out instead. That evening my daughter became ill (sickness and diarrhoea) and had to go to bed my husband also felt ill. On Friday both my husband and daughter were really sick and when I asked for a bottle of water was told no it's only served on a lunchtime. Also Friday morning when I asked for a bottle of water one of the waiters got an empty bottle out of the bin and filled it up out of the water dispenser which was dirty. That was the last straw! We got in touch with our tour operator and managed to get transferred to another hotel by Saturday lunchtime. If you think that wasps flying around the fizzy drinks dispenser is acceptable drinks stood in the heat all day and no access to clean water then you have little standards. When we challenged management about our complaints (along with half of the hotel from the queues to see the manager!) he couldn't give a monkeys! Not bothered at all and this guy Salim?? (Not sure of spelling) Just shouted at my daughter and told her to go away ... this is just the tip of the iceberg ... it's disgusting the way staff spoke to us. Even when we checked out they didn't care NO CUSTOMER SERVICE at all.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Kate B wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Such a wonderful Stay - I was shocked after the bad reviews,"I have just got back for 5 nights / 6 days at Labranda Les Idrissides having read the previous reviews I was nearly booking another hotel but we didn't and we are so pleased that we stuck to our original plans.    We arrived around 10.00 AM we were greeted by Habib this was a very warm and friendly welcome they said our room was ready :-) (this was supposed to be 14.00 ) so very good start - the rooms were good sized bright and very cool with a fridge  good size bathroom (with air dryer) and plenty of wardrobe space with hangers.    Pool area fantastic  plenty of loungers & parasols sun all day long    Meals - breakfast lunch and evening meal all good with plenty of choices (amazing freshly baked pizza) all very tasty - maybe could do with some labels.    Staff - well I can't speak highly enough of them what a load of rubbish that they don't like the English the staff I would give a 5 star rating all day long not one member of staff did I found rude - maybe the people giving the reviews don't have manors or smiles !!!! I can't remember the pool bars mans name (we called him Morgan Freeman as he was his double) always had a smile and said ""my pleasure""    The Entertainment Team - wow they made our holiday they work so hard to please their guests dancing singing Games Shows they never stop but fully respect if you want to be left alone for a relaxing holiday I can honestly say at the end of our holiday I would class them all as friends!!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,CarlaJay wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Don't believe everything that you read!,So after booking a spontaneous holiday to Morocco via Wowcher me and my friend had the painstaking countdown...  This however gave us ample opportunity to google the hotel (which in this day and age is a standard procedure)  The majority if not all of these reviews filled me with sheer terror as we like to over indulge on a 5* all inclusive getaway.    Most of the reviews on trip advisor commented on the terrible customer service or shocking rooms or the general hatred for the English.    On arrival to the hotel e was greeted with an English speaking rep (i think his name was Salem) he was more than helpful and even offered us a drink on arrival and provided us with the wifi code as we waited to check in.  The rooms are not usually available until 2pm however as we arrived early 10am they made our room available at midday.  When entering the room we were a little disappointed that there was no balcony so we immediately checked out the aircon (as the reviews we had read noted that they were terrible) the aircon didn't seem to work so we went down to reception and explained they immediately sent a maintenance guy to the room and when he had no joy they happily provided us with a new room. The aircon in this one worked perfectly (insert your driving license into the card holder thing when you go out to ensure it stays on while your exploring)  The room has a fridge (previous reviews stated that they don't)  The bathroom is clean and tidy the rooms are cleaned everyday. They state that the wifi only works in the public areas however we found that if you sit in the window seat you can easily get 2 bars. (room 657)  I would advise people to bring a travel iron.    The pool area is kept clean and tidy and its never been a problem to get a sunbed and yes as stated in previous reviews they serve you drinks in small plastic cups but that seems logical as the drinks heat up in minutes due to the heat. They never moaned when we would order two drinks at a time. There is also a water cooler dispenser thing (heres another tip... when going to the shops purchase a bottle of water which you can fill up) although at breakfast lunch and dinner they give you a large 2 litre bottle of water. So the reviews stating they refuse to give English people water is rubbish.    The pool entertainment (animation team) are full of energy and enthusiasm and speak great English and throughout the day organise multiple activities both in the pool and out. And encourage everyone (young and old) to get involved but are never offended if you decline.    The food....  Breakfast - Agreed with previous reviews was the best meal of the day. With a wide variety of choice; freshly made pancakes pastry breads eggs/omelettes sausage cereals fruits and a variety of fresh juices.    Lunch/Dinner - We aren't exactly fussy eaters but we found lunch was a bit of a struggle mainly due to the fact that the food isn't labelled so you don't really know what it is and you don't want to annoy the servers every 2 minutes asking. However towards the end of the week you start to try out more things. The hotel also put on a lunch time BBQ (home made burgers and fries) aswel as a Moroccan restaurant for evening meals which was included in the all inclusive.    There is a mcdonalds nearby 5 minute walk left out of the hotel.    Outside the hotel (in the entrance) a lovely old guy called Ahmed hangs out. After speaking to someone at lunch they told us about there trip to the Souks (Moroccan market) and informed us that Ahmed is a tour guide and for 100 dirham each (roughly ¬£8) he will take you to the Souks and give you a guided tour (the Excursion company on site offered you this for 250 dirham each) In our opinion giving Ahmed 100 dirham each was well worth it he clearly is very passionate about where he is from and gives a full explanation of the Souks. He would talk to the owners and then they would give you a guided tour around their 'factory' and explain the history around it at no point did we ever feel obligated to buy anything. Without Ahmed that would of been a different story and we would of easily gotten lost as it is like a maze.    If we was to come to Morocco again we wouldn't have a problem with staying here again.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlajay88
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,shoegyalist wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Rudeness IS Inclusive,Stayed here for two days from 13th - 15th June 2017. The hotel is impressive in size and cleanliness and the lounge area has a Zen like calming aura. However that's where it all stops.    The bar staff are markedly rude! They seem resentful of patrons and even more resentful to be working there. The heavily watered down beverages are served in cups the size of babies beakers which necessitates two or more visits much to the chagrin of the bar tenders.    If you are there for only two days it's annoying that the over zealous Saleem - (hotel rep) insists on wasting literally half a day of YOUR time with excuses and useless bits of information and his incessant vanity in believing he's the world's best comedian. He repeatedly ignored our protests and even failed to turn up for appointments HE made. Also take with a large pinch of salt anything he tells you. E.G. he told several of us varying times for breakfast in relation to our departure morning. When asked why we couldn't be provided with a little breakfast before our 6.30 a.m. departure he said 'Because there isn't any breakfast' yet breakfast was served. He was uncaring and sneeringly told one couple to 'Eat at the airport'. We were also left without meals/snacks between 2.00 p.m. and 8.00 p.m because quote 'That is how it is'. (Saleem). This is easily the worst inclusive meal deal I've ever experienced. Generally the food is okay but much of it rehashed for lunch and breakfast and don't even bother with the Moroccan Night's. Dinner. Really!!!    If you can ignore the rude staff and repetitive/limited food then do stay here. Oh and do try the spa treatments they're wonderful and the staff are lovely there.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoegyalist

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Suzi H wrote a review Jun 2017,10,It could be great,I visited this hotel with a large group of friends - don't go there with a big group especially if you're British. Reception staff are incredibly flappy and don't actually care if you have a problem with something. I personally witnessed the bar man putting BOTTLED WATER into the whiskey! When I challenged him on it he told me the manager makes him do it. I actually felt sorry for the bar staff. They work all day in the heat whilst a manager sits there watching them and won't help serve drinks if there's a queue. The drinks are served to all inclusive guests in tiny plastic cups so you have to get two at a time so you're not going up every 5 mins for a drink.  The sun beds are extremely uncomfortable. You have to put down a deposit for a towel maybe that's standard practice but seriously? We aren't going to steal your towels. What is good is the hotel isn't extremely busy so you can always get a bed by the pool no need to be getting up early to try reserve a sunbed.  The food was the worst I've ever had in an all inclusive and I've been to a lot. Some of the food they serve for lunch has been left over from the night before. The 16:00 snacks are just leftover hard pastries from breakfast. They're not bothered making sandwiches or salad. The only thing that was fairly ok was the breakfast. Nice bread and omelettes that are made fresh to order. Restaurant staff 50/50. Some are friendly most are grumpy and won't even say hello. We ended up eating out for every meal after 4 days which was fun but annoying when we had paid all inclusive.  The physical hotel itself is beautiful very tastefully don't with nice rooms. Although the air conditioning doesn't work in half the rooms which was uncomfortable. We didn't ask for them to look at it as they had been so unhelpful about something else.  The entertainment staff are wonderful. They are always so friendly and helpful despite the face that they work 15 hours a day and get paid ¬£240 a month!! Which I thought was absolutely disgusting because they work so hard.  Overall I couldn't wait to get out of the place and I genuinely am not fussy when it comes to hotels.

The entertainment staff were amazing! Lots of pool side activities and shows at night Asma and Omar and Abdel are far to good for this hotel! Now the negatives reception and bar staff's attitude was disgraceful especially to the British! The drinks are watered down with their own water and you were served in a tiny plastic cup and given dirty looks whenever you asked for another drink! The food was so poor I was laid up in bed on the third day due to sickness and dioreah. My friend witnessed two of the bar staff physically fighting in front of young children as one had over charged another guest another British woman got spat at in reception! We went all inclusive but nothing apart from contaminated drinks and food was included IE spaindoor pooltennisgympiano barhotel restaurants.

I did not enjoyed the pool but it was well frequented by guests and filled until the end of the day.  Wifi available only in the lobby. TV only with a few channels mainly news.  The attendants are attentive but it maintains a certain characteristic of the Marrocans rudeness.  Breakfast was good with quality with fresh eggs and breads made in front of you.

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Malvina M. wrote a review May 2017,20,Don't choose this hotel,This hotel itself was pretty well located and refurbished with good taste but lots of things were bad. Little minus : It was 30¬∞ min for all week and the swimming pool temperature was below 20¬∞... Very frustrating not to swim when you are here to enjoy the sun and you are sweating under the Moroccan sun. Wifi was only available in the hall not nice for a pretended high standards hotel. The location was super nice though we were close to everything.    Our room was nice good size we even had a room with a little terrasse. But no hot water the door of the bathroom wasn't closing and the housekeeper was coming every morning in the room without knocking while we were still sleeping. Once I was only wearing a towel because I just finished my shower and she asked me to give her all the others towels ...    The staff wasn't nice at all ... Price a the piano bar and the bar near the pool were made depending on each staff member's mood. The same drink could be paid double sometimes because we were not in a all inclusive offer.  We had a breakfast included formula. Breakfast was ok though it was mainly salty food ... All the sweet pastry were few and not good at all. One day we wanted to enjoy the swimming pool all day and decided to eat at the buffet. We paid 40‚Ç¨ for all you can eat buffet which was exactly the same salty dishes of the breakfast buffet. For this amount we ate three times at the restaurant in Marrakech's Medina and ten times better. The staff kept on checking on us and telling us to pay every 5 min. We went out of the buffet very upset and with the feeling we have been robbed.    Gladly I speak French but even though the staff was very rude at the reception. We tried to complain for the buffet episode but they didn't care at all. Telling us it was an amazing buffet which wasn't.    The animation team were very very nice very polite and hopefully they can give hospitality lesson to the rest of the hotel staff.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bologna, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malvinoushka

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Esme wrote a review May 2017,30,Good.,The reason why i didnt title this hotel as great is due to some flaws whuch could make it better. I must say the hotel is beautiful. On arrival we were made to wait 3 hours before we could go to our rooms. In this time we were able to relax in the seating area and get some lunch too which was fine however we would have much preferred our rooms to be ready and have showered and changed upon arrival. P  The rooms are nice but the mirrors could have been placed in a better space. Plenty of wardrobe space includes hairdryer in bathroom which was good. When cleaning would take place the towels would get replaced very late and at times they were needed which caused a delay for us to enjoy the pool and be able to shower. The pool was amazing really nice decor inside and out. The staff at the pool were friendly. The reception staff were the opposite of friendly quite rude and did not understand english well nor did they greet. There was one main manager named Habib who would assist us so we could always go to him if we needed anything which helped when any questions needed answering. I can only remember one night staff member who did talk to us and give information on where we should go and how much to pay for taxis. He was very pleasant and helpful. His name was Ahmed and he only worked the night shifts.  All in all i must say the hotel itself was pretty good and as it was all inclusive food was nice too however when ordering drinks they would take their time at the restaurant.The bar is open throughout the day and staff were friendly here. Entertainment was provided by animation team which was also fun. The only downfall for this place would have to be reception staff and the fact that wifi would only work downstairs in reception area. It helps if you know the language as majority of staff do not understand nor speak english.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/945asmar
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Lesley T wrote a review May 2017,20,Mixed feelings,We are both well travelled and easy going people..we are very low maintenance travellers but our experience of this hotel has left us a bit frustrated. We had read the reviews so where aware of some of the negative comments but we went with an open mind. Anyway we took a taxi from the airport which was a hilarious experience..only a short drive to this hotel and an excellent location for shopping etc. We arrived before check in so knew our room wouldn't be ready however they put our suitcases to a storage room and we changed and went to the pool. We booked a room only option and I have to say the reception staff where ok but they guy who took our card payment was rude. Not even a smile a thank you just rude. Anyway he wasn't going to ruin our break and we had lovely drinks by the pool and where treated to real glasses rather than the horrible little plastic cups. Pool bar staff where lovely and gave us olives which was a lovely touch. We went back to reception at 2pm for our room key not a lot of information was given to us about the hotels amenities or where our room was we managed to find it ourselves on the 6th floor (the lifts doors close very quickly and don't stop closing). Our room was ok. Basic clean. Bathroom door was sliding and didn't fully close but lots of storage and comfy beds. No fridge or kettle but it was ok and air con was working. We really enjoyed our first day had a meal at poolside which was lovely. Our 2nd day we had breakfast at the hotel which was 80drms each and really not worth it and the staff reminded us we had to pay and seemed concerned we would mysteriously forget to pay so reminded us again whilst we ate. Our second lunch meal at poolside was a different experience. Chef salad ( remains from breakfast-lettuce oranges and sweet corn) and a mixed grill which my other half ate until discovering the chicken was uncooked. When he took it to show the waiter he took it from my partner and offered to have it cooked! Obviously we didn't want it cooked...so the waiter brought him over a half larger and a fresh bit of chicken which we also refused. Then they tried to charge for the full meal which we refused to pay - we paid for drinks and salad and left. Day 3 breakfast again we where reminded to pay by 3 members of staff whilst eating our breakfast which was now wearing thin I really felt like they thought we where going to do a runner! We complained but the language barrier meant the guy was clueless to what we where saying so we decided not to eat there again. Final straw was the towels that we paid a deposit for of 400 dirhams. On returning the towels we where given back just 200 and when we complained we where told we where crazy by the towel man! Totally ripped off we told the man to keep the money as he obviously needed it more than we did. We had some lovely experiences of Marrakech but the only good things about this hotel is the location the pool and a few of the staff. Don't eat here- go across the road for breakfast or down to the mall (about 15 minute walk) it's much better. Customer service? Don't waste your breathe complaining as no one understands you or seems to care less. I felt like second class as we weren't French or all inclusive. Everything just seems to be about money. We loved Marrakech it's just a shame the customer service was non existent.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesleyT265

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Sallly1 wrote a review May 2017,10,Horrible experience!,Shocking experience! Harrassed by the excursions representive as soon as we came he was very flirtatious initially as he wanted to make a sale we were initially interested in an excursion but because we needed more time to decide he started to get irritated! It was not a cheap excursion so we needed to consider affordability. When we said we required more time he got very aggressive and at one point said tell me now if you want to go or not! We were quite upset as he hurried off after showing clear disapproval and practically shouting at us.    The hotel staff behind the reception area were no help whatsoever completely unapproachable and very rude. After our arrival our room was missing a lot of basic amenities and when we went to request these the man at the reception just said yes yes! A complete fob off as we has to come down twice that night to make the request again.  After this we didn't bother going to the front desk because they looked constantly irritated by having to help us!  The room itself was comfortable but the noise level was shocking due to very thin walls the beds creaked very loudly by just sitting on them.  Constantly broken lifts which would randomly close on people myself included.  Tried to stay out of the hotel as much as possible!  Overall a completely horrendous experience would not recommend this hotel at all!  Clearly overpriced and definitely not a 3/4 star! More like 2 stars!,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sallly1

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Zaki M wrote a review May 2017,40,Animation Team Make This Hotel!,Nicely situated hotel on a busy road which gives you a feel of Marrakesh when we got there the rooms they gave us weren't really what we expected I travelled with my brother and his wife who was expecting a child and they provided us initially with rooms that had two separate beds that were joined together to make a double also the rooms were very small after a conversation with the reception staff they moved us to two rooms which were accessible from each and also with an actual double bed. The food was decent we were half board so just got the option of either lunch or dinner (avoid chicken if you can unless you want to be on the toilet straight after) we had to pay for drinks bottles were about 20dhs which was under ¬£2.    Poolside is really nice and the weather was just right the animation team which consisted of Asma Hind Abdel Ayoub Omar & Mido made our time here special constant activities throughout the day like aqua gym aqua basketball cooking classes and other sports they were all so friendly and made the experience at the hotel a really pleasant one. They have shows near enough every night which is good entertainment when you just want a chilled night at the hotel and then after every show you head to the piano bar where there's a a really nice vibe with a really good live singer. All football is shown in the bar too they tend to favour any team with a French connection but you can tell them to change to a team you want to watch.    Overall a nice experience and would return every year.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454zakim

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,zohra7862 wrote a review May 2017,10,WORST EXPERIENCE!,So we checked in after a 3hour flight we arrived at the hotel at 11am the reception ( who spoke no english and also extremely useless) told us we would have to wait until the room is ready at 15:30 (5hrs and 30 mins) bearing in mind we were so so tired. Finally our room was ready we went in and were very hungry ( it was all inclusive) went downstairs to have a very late lunch/dinner they charged us ¬£50 for the food tried there best to make money out of us. HOTEL STAFF IS TERRIBLE! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!  EVERYONE LITERALLY TRIED TO RIP US OFF!    Marrakech however is a beautiful place shame about the arrogant selfish people!

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,jane C wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Will not be staying again,This was our third visit to Moroccoour second to Marakesh as we love the country but not this hotel!  May have been a better experience if we had spoken fluent French and later in the season. But this really should not make a difference.  Rooms were acceptable but sheets just didn't fit the bed so not a comfortable nights sleep. Asked several times for larger ones but didn't materializeexcuse the pun!  Roomswe had two as travelled with our daughter and her partnerwere kept very clean. As was the whole hotel. We were given adjoining rooms and you could happily have a conversation without opening the dividing doors. Would however be perfect if you had children to keep an eye on.  Dining was interesting. Some days the staff couldn't do enough to an OTT standard Other days completely ignored you. Food not kept hot enoughin my opinionand desserts limited if you don't want cake or oranges.  One evening were shown to a table with other guestswho we didn't knowand expected to share. We had four in our party and there were plenty of tables not being used so re seated ourselves.  Several lunch times my husband thought it would be nice to order food from the pool bar. Not as easy as you would think! Got the third digree as to why not eating in the main resturant then checked to see if we had already eaten there! My husband practiced his French the second time he ordered and got a better response.  We also decided to book the hotels Moroccan resturant one evening. Booking was messed up and despite it being empty refused to serve us and had to be rebook for another evening. Wish we hadn't bothered! Service was awful! Food was nothing special but may have been due to the fuss we made the previous daywho knows.  Positive points if you want to book tripswhich we did the guys were brilliant! Also very happy to help to out any problems with hotel staff.  Will be returning to Marocco but not this hotel despite it being in a great location. If you are just using as a base and speak good French you should be ok.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeC572

Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,ELA_Reviewer wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Good value for explorers!,If you want somewhere that's good for you to sit by the pool all day but also makes a good base to go exploring Marrakech from then this hotel will do the trick.    Staff... On the whole the staff were very polite and helpful. Some of the waiting staff especially would go out of their way to try and remember what drinks we liked and bring them to us before we even had to ask. We had an issue when we arrived in that we had booked a 'pool view room' and after checking in realised our room had a view of the A road outside but the reception staff were apologetic and moved us the next day to a much better room with a view and a balcony. Plus there was always someone outside to help us hail a taxi and barter with the driver on out behalf.    Food... The food was quite repetitive but there is something for everyone and that's coming from a fussy eater. We were all-inclusive but spent a lot of time out of the hotel so the repetitiveness wasn't too much of an issue for us. There is a traditional Moroccan restaurant on site which you can eat dinner at as part of the all-inclusive deal and I'd recommend that if you are staying in the hotel for dinner but want something a little bit different.    Noise... our biggest issue was that there was some building works going on pretty much everyday that we could hear from our room and the lobby. Luckily we already had plans to explore on the days this was really bad but if we'd planned lots of long lie-ins it could easily have ruined our holiday.    If you're looking for absolute luxury this hotel isn't it BUT for a fairly cheap 4 day break this was exactly what we were looking for.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELA_Reviewer
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,cmckinnon1 wrote a review Apr 2017,40,Great value for money but you need to be flexible,This is a great location for families looking to entertain their kids and lay by the pool. I think the restaurant food can be improved and the friendliness of the front desk as well. The animation staff was great and the kids were very happy running around playing and being cared for by everyone. The air conditioning in my room was weak and there was no hot water when I showered around 7pm. But the rooms were spacious and clean.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,cmckinnon1,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmckinnon1
Labranda Rose Aqua Parc,Sally1074 wrote a review Apr 2017,10,Would Not Stay At Again,This hotel is a lovely hotel to look at but when it comes down to the service it is completely terrible. The hotel staff is very rude and moody on my first night I was asked to pay a tax and the staff member who managed the currency exchange was very rude we where later given our room numbers and told to go to the third floor me and my husband were not shown our rooms and we were left to discover this big hotel all on our own we were not informed about the food timings or where to go to use the different facilities. We also were not informed that we had no A/C in our rooms which were very warm at night.    Furthermore the food in the hotel is very tasteless and basic but still it was edible.  Depending on what board you pay for if you go all inclusive you can enjoy both food and drinks however if you go on half board you will not be able to have any drinks during your dinner you even have to pay for the water which is much more expensive than what it costs outside the hotel.    Only a few members of staff where very nice and welcoming including one bar man who worked in the evening bar.    The entertainment team were incredibly kind they where the highlight of my stay they made me and my husband feel very welcome we watched some great shows which they performed and enjoyed spending the evenings with them singing and dancing at the bar.    Overall i would not personally stay at the hotel again.,Date of stay: April 2017,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sally1074
