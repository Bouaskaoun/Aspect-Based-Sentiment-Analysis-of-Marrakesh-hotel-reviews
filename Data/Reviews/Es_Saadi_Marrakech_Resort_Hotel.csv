Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Jeff L wrote a review Feb 2023,40,"Nice hotel, close to the action",I came to Marrakech on a press trip and was very pleased with the hotel. It's a very short cab ride to the old medina so the location is convenient. The room was comfortable the staff was courteous and helpful the breakfast buffet offered a lot of choices. In all I'd recommend this for people who come to Marrakech and want to stay at a hotel close to most tourist spots.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jefflY9721TS

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Marion L wrote a review Feb 2023,50,an oasis with great omelettes,My balcony looked out over an oasis of palm trees and the hotel was a perfect oasis in the madness of Marrakech and wonderful to return to after adventures in the souk and the Medina. Kind and friendly staff - they gave me directions told me how much to pay a taxi and printed my boarding pass for me in about 30 seconds. Highlights included a swim in the pool beautifully warm in mid-February red roses appearing in my immaculately clean room for no apparent reason and the amazing omelette chef at breakfast.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marionleeper
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,R√©mi Weber Dublaron wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Old and overpriced,Interior from 1960 with luxury standard of 1960. If you dont care about what is normal today in a 5 star hotel this suits you. This hotel is really overpriced for the interior it offers ( metal keys dirty carpet very old interior no dimming lights curtains that arent closing mediocre breakfast for ehat they charge etc etc. Makes you feel in a 1980 movie from James Bond. Deco from 1960. Service us perfect though friendly smiling devoted staff. Beds are old. Only wifi is good üòÄ. Close the windows: busy roads all around and airplanes.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,whodeystock wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Relaxing stay in great location but room for improvement,The location of the hotel is fantastic. Near the upmarket bars shops and also the mall. It is also an easy walk to the main tourist sites.    The breakfast was high quality and the serving staff members were good.    The pool was heated and the pool area within the large grounds was relaxing.    The hotel staff in general didn‚Äôt seem that happy and weren‚Äôt overly helpful.    The room was very noisy over the weekend evenings however the hotel are installing new windows/doors to accommodate for this fact.    Use of the fitness centre in the palace was good. However you have to pay ‚Ç¨20 to use the tennis court.    However there were little things which shouldn‚Äôt occur in a 5-star resort.  1. If you know two guests are staying in a room provide two towels and two cups.  2. Once the cups have been used it is normal to replace them for fresh ones.  3. Once the tea bags have been used it is normal to replace them.  4. If a do not disturb sign is on the door then staff should not enter.    Also the hotel has a big problem when it comes to Information Governance and security procedures in general. If they wish to contact me I am happy to discuss this further with them.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whodeystock

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,rosezabee2013 wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Wonderful stay,Highly recommend this hotel !    We stayed 3 nights at this hotel for our honeymoon. I appreciated how our room had been so nicely decorated with rose petals.  Breakfast was really tasty with a good variety available.  The pool was nice with plenty of sunloungers around.  But what sets Es Saadi apart is their staff.  All team members there from the room cleaner to the waiter or receptionist are just so kind and warm people making you feel so well looked after.  Hats off to them as they are the biggest asset of this hotel.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Imane wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Female Traveller ARENT Safe - the staff shared my room number & personal information with a male guest I don‚Äôt know.,I decided to file a complaint against the hotel as the reception or workers have breached my privacy rights as a guest of the hotel.    In fact on the night of the 18th July around 2am in the morning the room‚Äôs phone was ringing I didn‚Äôt answer as I was half asleep and it was in the middle of the night.    The morning before leaving the hotel (as I stayed only one night) a man came to me while I have breakfast whom I don‚Äôt know (he was a guest as well) started telling me how he has asked for my name and my room and the reception & pool workers gave it to him because he saw me and liked me. He went on saying how he was calling my room in the middle of the night in order to see me and get to know me. First he told me he was calling the room of my neighbors at around 1am it didn‚Äôt worked out but then he asked again and they told him the exact number of my room - I was shocked and surprised I had no words. Beside seeing how mad I was he was pushing and insisting to sit next to me for breakfast and answers to my ‚Äûno I don‚Äôt want to‚Äú with a ‚Äûyou should feel honored you grabbed my attention‚Äú    To be honest I don‚Äôt know what he expected however imagine if instead of calling my room he came to my room and since he knows the staff very well opened my room and did something to me - raped me for example? I was a female guest alone in my room.    Hotels aren‚Äôt supposed to share guests contact to anyone worldwide. This is really messed up. I choose to not say anything till I left the hotel because this man was always around following me and it was such a scary situation.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imanefaq1
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Sofia S wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Very nice hotel but staff need to mind their own business and stop being so invasive!,First off me and my partner stayed here and though the location was fantastic and the hotel was beautiful with lots of options of restaurants and night time entertainment if you so wished (casino club bar). However there were a few things that we thought weren't great. The aircon in the room is not adjustable it only had an on/off switch it was extremely hot when we went there so it would've been useful to be able to turn it on higher. There was no shop that was near enough to just quickly grab some water (the mall is still quite far if you're just in need of some water) and as a very hot country at the time we went we needed this a lot - so we were forced to buy it at the hotel at upmarket price because they only provided 2 TINY free bottles a day which has never happened in my experience even in colder climates you can always request more free bottles in your mini bar - cheap way for them to make money off you if you ask me. Secondly most of the staff we encountered were lovely however some of them were extremely intrusive and needed to mind their own business - upon bringing us our room service on day 1 one member asked me about my religious beliefs based off of my name which he must've seen on the system which is none of his business and i found this quite invasive. Another staff member whilst bringing us something to our room asked if he could come in to sign the bill (there was no need) and started asking us if we were leaving the hotel that night and looking around the room at our possessions again very weird and unnecessary I don't know why he couldn't just sign it at the door. The last incident which was very disturbing they let themselves in to our room whilst we were in there. A member of staff normally would knock some time after 6pm to provide those 2 free bottles of water a lot of the time we weren't in so they come in and leave it - which is fine as I imagine they waited to see if we were in there however once we were in there and they knocked and literally 1 second later they let themselves in. my partner had to rush to the door as I was sitting round in underwear (having just had a shower) and luckily he stopped them before entering the bedroom area - totally unacceptable they should have knocked and waited to make sure no one was in - very invasive behaviour and I think the manager needs to have words with their staff about this type of behaviour and intrusive attitude. Other than that the actual place is lovely and a great place to stay in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: July 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E9983UJsofias
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Nicole_from_Canada wrote a review Jul 2022,30,A mixed bag,Let‚Äôs start with the good. The service at this hotel is definitely 5-star. Everyone we encountered was amazingly efficient nice and helpful that goes above and beyond your typical hotel. The food was also good - we had breakfast and dinner and the cocktails were amazing. These factors made the stay better than we would have conclude.    The bigger downfall are the rooms. We were on the second floor and our room was very cramped a d extremely dated. They need a complete redo or at least a paint job. The entry door is a challenge to open‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt just us we saw a few other guests struggling as well. Once in the bathroom is extremely small tough to navigate unless you‚Äôre by yourself. The actual room is okay big bed small balcony but everything is just so tired and worn. It‚Äôs unfortunate that they have let this part of the experience slide so badly especially in light that they have such amazing staff that could really bumped them into a great hotel.,Date of stay: July 2022,,"Ottawa, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nicole_from_Canada
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Maher wrote a review Jul 2022,10,"SCAM, I SUGGEST YOU READ BEFORE BOOKING",To begin with the Es Saadi Hotel and Es Saadi Palace are two different standards of hotels obviously coming for the first time we did not know this. When booking the hotel we are shown pictures of Es Saadi Palace which seems to be of much higher quality (5 star) than Es Saadi Hotel which really upset me as I feel I got scammed for my money.    Arriving at the resort we thought we would be staying at the higher quality side of the hotel as by the pictures we saw. Straight away they put us on a golf cart and took us to the not so nice side of the hotel (Es Saadi hotel). Upon arrival to the Es Saadi hotel we are told our room will not be ready until 3 PM which is a pretty late check in for a hotel. We waited the few hours in the hotel lobby. Close to 3 pm I asked if the room was almost ready and I was told that the room might not be ready at 3 pm and that it might take longer. Obviously I was furious I witnessed another tourist that had a argument with the hotel reception he ended up leaving the hotel.    Luckily at 3 pm they gave us the room we entered the room and I was honestly shocked by the standard of the room the rooms are out dated and the Air conditioning is also out dated the room is very hot. There is no temperature gauge for the air conditioning it‚Äôs literally just on or off. I turned it on and off and the air conditioning broke down immediately. I called reception they sent someone to come fix the AC. The person fixing the AC told me that the AC will not be fixed today and that I will have to change rooms. I end up going downstairs again to change rooms they offered me another room which is no surprise also out dated and very hot.    Once into the new room I honestly contemplated to leave the hotel and ask for a refund I started looking for Airbnb‚Äôs in the area to move to. They brought me a fan for the room which made it slightly more bearable. Non the less I decided to stay as I was already exhausted and it was getting late by the time I received the new room.    May I also mention the Wifi is horrible if you have work or any sort of business to conduct online you would have to go pay for a external router to help as the wifi is very spotty and sometimes completely stops working. Why this hotel is labelled a 5 star hotel is far beyond me I have stayed in 3 star hotels that have been much better than this.    On the plus the staff are super friendly and helpful breakfast is decent this just seems to be more of a managerial problem than anything else. For the money I paid to stay at this hotel you can definitely find better accommodation else where in the city. I was counting down the days to leave this hotel even though I really enjoyed Marrakech as a whole. The swimming pool area is nice and staff are attentive.    What upsets me the most is the fact that the reviews online giving it a 5 star review is of the Es Saadi Palace and not the hotel which tricked me into believing this hotel would be decent.    I will definitely not be coming back to this hotel. If you do decide to book I suggest you book Esaadi Palace.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/328maher

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Luci G wrote a review May 2022,30,Not a 5 star,Firstly I would like to start with the hotel entrance beautiful nice welcoming staff really promising. Totally different story when you get to your room. Very basic old carpets no minibar no tea/coffees facilities bathroom quite old with dirty looking tub( provably worn out tub) toilet flush very hard to push( seems like a work out) every time i had to flush the toilet. Air con very old and ineffective on and off button only no facility to set the temp.  Staffing nice especially if you have plenty tips. Bad experience with Halid(waiter) when he follow us  one evening when we run out of change snd told us that service wasn‚Äôt included then tge next evening he did not even say good evening just throw the menu on the tablenot spoken with us all evening which mare us feel very uncomfortable. However not all staff was the same Ahmed(waiter) was super friendly and funny a real pleasure to be served by him. He make us feel really comfortable and made our night with his sense of humour and ability to make you feel good.  One pice of advice if you thinking of going half board just don‚Äôt. Reason for that is that if you half board you have different menu from the rest of the restaurant which is very limited and boring. Practically 3 choices at only 1restaurant. If you want to change you have to pay the full price  Swimming poll and gardens very nice with outdoor var and restaurant during the day.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,CRML wrote a review Apr 2022,10,Not as advertised,Pros  - Restaurant Epicurien in the adjacent grounds was excellent - great food service and atmosphere  - the waiting and pool staff were friendly and obliging  - good location and easy walk to centre  - Very good breakfast    Cons  - False advertising of rooms - pictures in promotional material showed more modern rooms when in reality the hotel was very old and run down. The rooms shown on the booking was the adjacent Es Saadi Palace not the hotel so we felt deceived. On arrival we were very disappointed with the condition of the rooms in particular especially as it was a 5 star hotel with prices to match.  - Dated decor and run down rooms and furniture - eg broken tiles (pictured) and worn carpet with stains. Mattresses were way too soft.  - Poor WiFi - in the rooms this was very slow unless one stood next to the room door  - Pay extra for wellness MAD 250pp?? - an additional fee charged at a 5 star hotel?!  - some of the reception staff were abrupt  - at a hotel of this rating (seriously a 5 star??) the features of the room should be explained. The AC was freezing on the first night and despite asking reception to send someone up to show us how to adjust it no one turned up.,Date of stay: April 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRML

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Jo F wrote a review Apr 2022,40,Mixed bag,We stayed at the Ed Saadi Palace last time we visited Marrakech and had a really fabulous experience so booked the hotel for our return on more of a budget break. Many of the reviews refer to the hotel being quite tired. It is but personally I thought it had a lot of character and was in the main spotlessly clean. The pool is very nice (warmer than the Palace which was a bonus!) and the breakfast offering was decent. For me what really let it down was the service. In fairness it was a mixed bag - some very polite and friendly staff- particularly at the pool and the front door. However we found some of the reception and restaurant staff at breakfast less friendly and accommodating. The lack of control over room temperature was also a bit of an issue - our room was really quite hot but we could only turn the heating on not the AC.    We didn‚Äôt spend a huge amount of time at the hotel. It‚Äôs in a fantastic location and there‚Äôs so much to do nearby we tended to get out and about. This is a good hotel to use as a base but on the whole definitely not a 5* experience especially when compared to some of the surrounding competition and Riad accommodation in the Medina.,Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sandbach, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214jof

The area around the hotel could be any resort type area worldwide but was attractive safe and clean. The staff arranged the covid test I needed before departure and answered many questions. The pool area was beautiful. The rooms were clean however a tad dated but decent size and a balcony was nice. The breakfast was also good.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,PeterDro wrote a review Mar 2022,10,OVERRATED - THERE ARE BETTER OPTIONS,THE BAD;  * Rooms are small old carpeting and drab furniture.  * Bathroom is super tiny.  * Bed is very uncomfortable.  * Wifi doesn‚Äôt work most of the time. I called the front desk about it. They said they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it and literally hung up on me.  * Tv signal periodically drops out.  * Front desk staff are generally rude angry and unhelpful. They frown and raise their voice when they tell you they don‚Äôt intend to solve your problem. They act as if the guests are a nuisance.  * We were part of a group. Some got flowers in the room in the room each day as a special touch. But others did not. This inconsistency points to a lack of attention to detail and a lack of caring about guests.  * You cannot drink water from the tap in Morocco. Moroccans say you shouldn‚Äôt even use it to brush your teeth. But the hotel makes you pay for water. Seriously? In my opinion it is a basic responsibility of any hotel to provide resources to allow guests to sleep well bathe and brush your teeth. So having to pay (to buy water) to brush your teeth is unacceptable. Other hotels in Morocco offer free water in the rooms.    THE GOOD:  * Building lobby pool and landscaping are beautiful.  * Restaurants and food are good but expensive.  * Concierge staff are friendly and helpful.    This hotel is greatly overrated. There are too many examples of them just not caring about guests.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,ROB JONES wrote a review Feb 2022,40,A SUNNY FEB 2022,We felt that we would rather be aay from the noise of the mosques and narrow alleys in the medina yet still close enough to the centre to walk in which we did easily in @ 25 mins mostly along quiet roads and park avenues. Taxis and carriages outside the door if wanted. Convenient for us too droppping hire car off at airport before our last three days in Morocco staying in Marrakech after a road trip down from Casa.  Very good breakfasts though the restaurant is very quiet now with the general lack of tourists. A valntines dinner in the hotel was great and my wife was given a red rose by the hotel - nice touch. No awareness of dietary requirements it seemed from the menu and like all of Morocco no details on the wine list - they just dont get it as they generally dont drink alcohol.  On the down side we found the fact that smoking is still generally allowed inside buildings hotels and restaurants in Morocco. This made some parts of the hotel unpleasant for us so voted with our feet when that happened.  Morocco is poor. It is lacking in clean potable water even in hotels like this. The net result is a huge amount of bottled water use and the country is littered with plastic bottles everywhere. Hotels such as this should set an example by using glass containers that can be reused -even if the they are still going to be refilled from much larger plastic bottles until such time as the country sorts out a solution to this huge problem.    So in summary we felt slightly guilty about adding to the problems. It is strange for a country that has to be so careful with water and has such a rich history of water engineering that they have not yet seemingly addressed this problem. Businesses and famiies such as those that own hotels like this one should be exerting their influence on the government of Morocco. Meanwhile take your own water containers and ask for them to be refilled.,Date of stay: February 2022,,"Exeter, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robanniejones

The air conditioning could have been a little stronger but that was my only real complaint. The pool are was great as were the pool attendants. The gym was ok.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,PALTravel wrote a review Mar 2020,50,CORVID-19 Shutdown,We were staying at this hotel during the Coronavirus shutdown of Morocco. They closed the hotel but were gracious enough to let the 10 of us stay one extra night. We had the hotel to ourselves with the ability to order room service. Then they opened up at 2:00am to let us check out and get to the airport to try and get flights home to the USA. WOW. Extraordinary and astonishing customer service especially when they could have simply kicked us out onto the streets.    Abdeljalil Mazouara the Hotel Manager/Director was the most incredible helpful thoughtful person that we dealt with during our entire trip to Morocco. He went above and beyond in helping me secure my diabetic meds in case we couldn't get flights out. His suggestion to stay in an American owned hotel chain if we went to Casablanca and his hospitality while at his hotel were spot on and also very calming during a frantic time.    The staff was also very helpful especially all the people who delivered our room service meals. We never felt like we weren't wanted ... which wasn't the case outside of the hotel.

One had worked for an animal charity in Morocco for fi e years so we had interesting insight to Marrakesh. The hotel is situated within 20 minute of the old town and has excellent facilities. Rooms comfortable and quiet and breakfast is first class. Main meals in restaurant are a bit pricey but of good standard. Hotel staff friendly and attentive however the sting in the tail was settling the bill. My credit card makes no commission charge and I said I wanted to pay in Moroccan dirhams- BUT she did GB¬£. I didn't realise until home. TWO emails to hotel have been ignored which is poor service. I reckon I lost ¬£17 with poor exchange rate.

The hotel is in the most wonderful grounds. The gardens are stunning the pools the palace the casino all the restaurants. It is great how you can roam and have so much choice of things to do without actually leaving the resort. The spa is pure luxury and has a great photo op. The breakfast is delicious and there is so much choice and can be enjoyed amongst the birds in the garden. The wifi is excellent and stays connected throughout the whole resort. We enjoyed a free yoga class on Saturday morning. The location is great near a shopping centre and 20 minute walk from the Medina. There is a bus stop for the red tour bus just outside the hotel. The man who plays the piano every night is charming. Would highly recommend staying here.

We like the location and beautiful garden at the hotel. It's a 20 min walk to the Medina and around the corner from all the trendy spots of the new town. We went for a room they call ""a suite"" as we were 3 of this trip.    The room looked even more dated than the one we had last year: plugs coming off the wall telephone didn't work everything looked a bit of a mess. We had a large terrace with two metal chairs and a broken table in the middle. The mini bar was empty (?!) not even a kettle which we had to go all the way to the reception asking for one as the only telephone in the room wasn't working. When they brought it up they didn't even bother bringing tea bags or cups so it was really a waste of our time!    But what is really not 5 stars about it is the service. The staff is generally quite abrupt some are very unpleasant. It's a shame cause some of them are actually lovely but it just makes you feel really unwelcome. We had a bad experience with a woman at the conciergerie really unhelpful. Then another bad experience at the pool where we got told off for having a bite there while every day we ate at their pool bar. If that's their policy they should review their manners in how to deliver it.    Overall a very poor rating and disappointing stay in one of our favourite city escape. One thing is for sure they will not see us again as their guests there.",Date of stay: November 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoineM-W

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,DivineMissMaja wrote a review Oct 2019,40,"Quiet Hotel, Excellent Location",The hotel is very nicely located a short walk from the Medina and there are shops and restaurants nearby. I stayed twice at this hotel: once for one night and the second time for two nights. Both rooms were a bit dated in style but clean. They both had balconies that looked out over the grounds. One room had an oddly designed bathroom with a very short glass panel that really didn't do much to keep shower water off the floor: I felt I had to shower with my face nearly pressed against the wall so as not to flood the bathroom. The common areas of the hotel are very nice. The breakfast buffet has a nice selection of things and you can eat outside when the weather is nice (or inside when it is not). We tried the hotel restaurant one night and the food was good. I also had a sandwich in the bar one afternoon and it was also good and well priced. A pianist was playing well-recognized standards and it was pleasant to sit and listen. All interactions with staff were pleasant. They have a metal detector at the door and there is a man who checks incoming people...unless it's late and then you can walk right in.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Silver Spring, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DivineMissMaja

However if you can live with that there are a lot of good things about it such location just aside the Sofitel and 20 minutes walking to the Plaza Jamal el Fna. There is a huge garden and if you choose a room with view to the pool and garden you have the feeling of being in a botanic garden. The staff is friendly and willing to help you.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Michael T wrote a review May 2019,20,Diappointing,I invited 12 international customers of my company for 1 week in Es Saadi. After arrival at 4 pm it took more than one hour before we got our room keys. The rooms are spacious but need to be completely renovated. Dirty carpet with many spots of burnt cigarettes and very oldfashioned bathroom with broken shaving mirror should not be rewarded with 5 stars. Room temperature was over 35¬∞ but the air condition was not working in several rooms. After two complaints at the reception they finally switched it on but very noisy. Every night it was additionally extremely noisy at the street because of sports cars posing in front of the casino in the neighbour hotel. On a windy and rainy day the carpets and wall at the windows were full of water - incredible.    As we had booked halfboard we were placed in a sticky rear corner of the restaurant close to the kitchen door while other guests have been served at the terrace. Trial next day to get seated closer to the terrace failed. The answer to my polite question was just no without explanations although the restaurant was half empty and I had to apologize to my guests. After complaints to the management the problem was solved from the third evening we got a nice table and the service level improved. I have to mention Ghassane who served us extremely nice.    So even if the location is quite perfect and 25 minutes walk away from the old town and the gardens are beautiful the hotel cannot be recommended due to room quality and unacceptable bad service.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Kloten, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taraba1957

What's the big deal??? Brought coffee slammed the pot on the table (a table of 5) then brought water and filled ONE of 5 water glasses.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Dunny0578 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Overall a Good Experience,Es Saadi Hotel is not the Palace so If you want the Palace book it and pay for it. You will be situated in a nice area within easy reach of the centre (souks) with three shopping malls all within walking distance. The staff we interacted with were all helpful and friendly and for the price we paid I was more than happy. We had a room with a pool view overlooking the Palace. The gardens and out door areas were lovely and in general the hotel tries hard to maintain standards in my humble opinion.    Our room was large clean and had everything we needed large bed safe mini bar tv with some English programmes and news on etc. No issues with the room at all. Housekeeping did a good job and again had smiles on their faces and said hello etc.    Breakfast was varied and plentiful although a lot of the food such as pancakes were cold. No doubt they would have cooked fresh for you if you asked as the staff were very pleasant and accommodating. Orange juice is a must it's REALLY good. You can sit outside to eat breakfast and there is always someone to help within reach without being overbearing etc.    Le Cours des Lions (the restaurant we ate in on the first and second evening) was well decorated and the staff very attentive. Food was good on the first evening (lamb tagine) but unfortunately on the second evening I ordered chicken breast . Quite simply it was not a good experience although the staff were very apologetic and tried to remedy the problem one you have eaten a piece of chicken that is unseasoned tastes like it has just been popped in a microwave and still raw in the middle you lose your appetite. I felt quite bad for the staff (perhaps its just a British thing). I just lost my appetite after that and made the choice not to eat there again but other than this one experience everything else food wise was good. I ordered room service on the last evening and we had been out all day. It was delivered promptly and what I chose was pleasant. It is a real shame that I had this experience but the Maitre d' and the lovely lady who took my order brought me boiled water and thyme to help settle any potential stomach issues later.    Things happen and I don't want to take anything away from the hotel or it's staff. we enjoyed our staff and it was good value for money so I would recommend it... just be respectful and understand that not everything is 100% all the time.    Free wifi in the hotel main areas is good but in the room was on and off depending on luck.    I really enjoyed Morocco (Marrakech) and if you are thinking of going there do!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Helensonia wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Es Saadi short stay with the Girls,Its my second visit to the ES Saadi Hotel It may look alittle dated inside but i love it. The local is fab near the square but not. Very near to the airport and so close to so many things and places you can walk everywhere if you can. if you cant then there are reams of taxis waiting to help you out. I love Marrakech i Really enjoy staying at the Es Saadi.  the Staff are friendly the food is good. The breakfast is of course my favourite there is a large variety and choice and its of good quality. the coffee of course is never how you like it but that is the one thing i bring from my home.  All in all The Es Saadi has everything you could ask for location facilities quality friendliness and a very nice pool with beer.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Chris R wrote a review Mar 2019,10,Poor Hotel // Not As Advertised,We visited this hotel booking a superior room in a 5 star hotel as advertised on Expedia. Unfortunately this is not what you get. We were surprised to see the photos on the website (both Es Saadi and Expedia) are out of date by quite a long shot. We were greeted by our room smelling of smoke with ripped carpet and cigarette burns in the carpet. We asked to be moved which the hotel could not accommodate so had to find other accommodation. We still await a refund from Expedia and a regrading from both Expedia and the local tourism board. It‚Äôs definitely not what is ‚Äòsold‚Äô and may feel like a scam. Visit Riad Nashia in the M√©dina instead where honestly everything was 10 times better for the same price.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,DigitalRabbit wrote a review Dec 2018,20,The Glory Days are Over,In its glory days the Es Saadi Hotel saw the likes of Mick Jagger lounging by its pool. Even today the hotel‚Äôs website invites you to ‚Äú‚Ä¶ imagine a young Mick Jagger posing by the pool.‚Äù You‚Äôll also need to imagine the building‚Äôs former splendor as the hotel is aging. Its king-sized beds are really two beds pushed together. The gap in the center is quite uncomfortable. For a hotel that claims to be 5-star it is lacking in the bathroom amenities one might expect. You will get shampoo and shower gel but no conditioner.    Although it is wonderful to have a balcony the railings for some are shakier than others. It‚Äôs best not to lean on them. The room was quite warm. In November the entire hotel goes to heating mode. During my stay Marrakesh was experiencing a wonderful heat spell so heat wasn‚Äôt really what I needed. The room got quite stuffy. The hotel allows smoking in the public areas which spoils some of the ambience and creates an unhealthy atmosphere.    The ultimate test of a hotel is whether it provides a great sleeping environment. The Es Saadi property also has a casino and several high-end lodging options. The casino is directly across from the hotel. Because of that weekend nights to early morning are filled with club music and lots of people on the outside patio living it up. When the casino closes the traffic jam that ensues triggers a lot of car horn honking. The casino boasts a light show on its facade. The curtains in the room will shield you from that but unfortunately the native birds chatter quite a bit thinking the sun is constantly rising. There are an amazing number of birds on the property.    Do not confuse the Hotel with the Palace the Ksars or the Villas. These newer options cost substantially more and have their own pool area that is not available to Hotel guests.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Los Gatos, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DigitalRabbit

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,AlunR wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Enjoyed the stay,Having read the mixed reviews I found the hotel neither superb (best) or in desperate need of renovation (worst) so I‚Äôll speak as I find.  We stayed for four nights with a package via British Airways. We chose half board so as not to have the hassle of looking for food in the middle of the city every night and I feel we made the right choice.  The hotel is in a residential area outside the M√©dina and amongst a group of other hotels. It styles itself as 5 star and whilst that may be correct for the Palace or villas it is a little stretched for the main hotel.  However it is friendly clean and comfortable and we found the room more than adequate. We deliberately went for a city view room rather than pool so as to avoid any noise and we slept soundly as a result.  Check-in was efficient and we arrived after 9pm due to Morocco‚Äôs very late decision not to fall back to GMT which made our arrival an hour later than scheduled plus an interminably inefficient immigration system at the airport (1 1/2 hours to get through pick up bags and then queue again for them to be scanned).  The restaurant was still open serving until 10:30 so we were still able to eat.  We found the set menu (for half board) fine. It‚Äôs French cuisine so a good standard. Three courses with soup or two choices of salad to start and three or four main courses (including vegetarian). Dessert was from a sweet trolley.  My only gripe really was the steep price of wines (cheapest half bottle ¬£15 but main bottles at ¬£30+. Perhaps the weak pound doesn‚Äôt help).  The room had a good sized bed two armchairs table of fruit and a balcony. The bathroom had a bath and shower hose and a separate toilet section.  Again my only gripe was that toiletries weren‚Äôt necessarily replaced and neither were hand towels (which were taken away daily but fresh ones not always brought back). They seemed to always replace bath towels though.  One late afternoon as we were dressing for dinner (after a shower) someone knocked to bring the fresh hand towels and two small bottles of water. He waited for his tip but as we neither wanted the water or needed the towels which had already been replaced that day it just seemed like a ruse to get tips from the residents.  Breakfast was fine and you could eat as much or as little as you wanted. There were breads pastries cereals fruit pancakes or cooked food (including boiled eggs). You could also have an omelette cooked freshly.  There was plenty of room around the pool area (although it was late October the weather was fine for us but maybe a little cold if you‚Äôre used to 30+ degree heat) and waiters served drinks and food although expensive.  The walk to town was around 10-15 minutes involving some hair-raising road crosses. Beware when the green man shows on crossing as they may still ignore it and beep their displeasure at you for having the temerity to cross.  Beware also of ‚Äúofficial‚Äù tour guides in the centre (near the Koutoubia Mosque) with names badges on lanyards who say they work for the government and will offer you a free tour of the souks taking you to areas other guides won‚Äôt. They take you deep in the souk and then bring you into shops with eye watering prices (a small bag of spices for ¬£15). Next a carpet shop where no matter how much you try and walk away they haggle you into submission (they always keep hold of anything you buy so you won‚Äôt simply run!). We told him ‚Äúenough‚Äù and he quickly marched us back to the square asking for a tip. When given he complained it wasn‚Äôt enough. So much for a free tour. If approached just walk away even though they pretend to be offended. They‚Äôre there to fleece the tourists.  All in all an experience and I‚Äôd recommend the hotel.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bridgend, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlunR

I booked it through Expedia and the pgmtmdp and room looked amazing.  Well I have been staying in more than 400 hotel during my live and I can admit that this was the worst one. The hotel is for sure 50 years old which actually has never been renovated. All the furniture are old and damaged in different way during their 50 years. Disgusting smell in the room. The reception is old and bring you to the 70s. Location is of course nice and surrounded by super nice hotels which made me believe that this hotel is nice too.

The foyer is very grand with polished marble uniformed reception staff and helful conceirge. The remaining public areas are very swish piano bar restaurant and breakfast area. There is a currency exchange and atm. It is a good location.    The breakfast was fantastic good choice of fresh and dried fruit yoghurt toast breads continent breakfast cooked choices an ""egg station"" and pastries. A selection of fresh fruit juices coffee and teas the staff were attentive and helpful. We did not eat in the restaurant preferring the choices of the medina which was also a lot cheaper.  We did try the pool which was fine but did close at 6.00pm. Too early?  The concierge was good we organised a trip to the coast and a transfer to our next hotel in the mountains which also took in a trip to the Ourika valley.    What lets the hotel down are the rooms. Whilst they are cool spacious and comfortable they are a little tired and lack maintenance. Our bathroom had cracked tiles and the bathplug mechanism did not work.One evening as we left to eat in the city we reported that they lighted were not working in the adjoining room occupied by our student children. When we returned none of the electric was working in in either of our rooms we reported this in reception and they just said they were having some trouble and hoped to sort it soon they had had at least a couple of hours. What I would have expected is them to say would be something like take a seat in the bar and have a complementary coffee/softdrink and we will tell you when it is resolved.  The hotel should be a place of safety from those in the city who would seek to do a deal with one of their friends (in exchange for some consideration) one of the doormen was offering us deal.

The room service after that was poor no turn down service and only 2 small water bottles which weren't replaced.  The pool was fine and clean pool staff efficient.  What let the hotel down was the restaurant for dinner and breakfast . Our waitress was brisk and unsmiling. The restaurant was unable to provide the wine from the wine menu we ordered  the waiter suggested the Moroccan Chardonnay as an alternative. I asked if it was oaked he had no idea. I had to send the wine back and choose an alternative. The food was ok nothing special  the Moroccan salad starter was liver and eggs. I did question this but felt uncomfortable as I had already returned the wine.  The breakfast was very disappointing more 3 star than 5 star.  We chose this hotel following spending two days walking in the mountains as it advertised yoga and spa. There was no yoga and if staying in the hotel you had to pay extra to use the spa.  The location is good we were able to walk to the Medina.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,cali972 wrote a review Aug 2018,30,"Great staff, amazing food ... very bad insonorisation Need soundproofing.",This is my second time in Marrakech I used to rent a small riad on the outskirts of the city ... but this time had to stay there for business reasons so we picked this hotel because it was a five star so one could expect a comfortable secure cosy and quiet stay with good wifi and easy access to the city. It was all I needed ... the quiet part did not turn out so well. When I booked I was given the choice between the view on the swimming pool and the view on the street. I naturally choose the first option for obvious reasons. I was given a nice clean big bedroom with view to the swimming pool ... which was quite lovely by day... but turn out be a total nightmare as the hotel is right in front of the in house nightclub and the Casino. I was unable to sleep for two nights. When I complained about it they gave me another room with a partial view to the street and a bathroom that was totally wornout complete with leaking tap toilets right in the middle near the bathtub yellow coating on white imitation marble .... and of course I could still hear street noises (and Marrakech streets ARE noisy). Don't get me wrong It was not as bad as the night club nuisance but I still had to lock myself in incompletely and close all the doors of the room to be able to sleep at night. Also not being able to set room temperature and air conditioning is not ok. But on the other side the food is delicious with quite a large choice ranging from your typical snack to XVI th century morrocan recipes ( You have to visit La cours des Lions  had a terrific evening there). Most of the ingredients are locally grown in their farms located in the Ourika valley. Staff is amazing  very nice polite and available. Some of them can be a little intrusive but nothing to really worry about that's just the mediterranean way of dealing with people ; ) Access to the city is very good perhaps 8-10 min by feet from the heart of the city. They systematically made sure I had a cab taking me to wherever I needed waiting for me there and taking me back to the hotel when I was finished which was highly appreciated. That would cost 150 drh max per trip and as a black woman and a solo traveler it made my excursions really easier and safer.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,erikasands wrote a review Aug 2018,50,"Oasis in Marrakech, the affordable way!",This is called the ES SAADI RESORT which usually means there is a super luxurious palace and then more affordable sister hotel. We stayed in the hotel for 10 days and we did our research prior to booking so yes you have some pictures of the palace and some of the hotel together on some web sitesbut if you google the hotel you have the right idea.  The hotel staff is amazing in every way! The Morrocan hospitality is famous but the hotel staff is really going the extra mile! A special thanks to the second floor manager ABDUL!He is an incredible human being and manages the housekeeping staff efficiently and in a very friendly manner. Also well done to the pool staff especially Anes. They make sure that your sun lounger is ready with a towel and parasol if desired. Regarding a reception staff it is a mixed bag! We find the female staff borderline rude on the other hand the concierge and the male staff of the reception namely Asim and Hachim were so nice and courteous with perfect English.  The downside of this hotel is they do not provide any free drinking water. We felt embarassed carrying 5L water bottles from the nearby shopping centre entering a 5star hotel. Also for a 5 star hotel you would expect a coffee making facility in the room. So travel kettle at the ready if you stay at this hotel. We forgot ours and our floor manager Abdul very kindly provided us with an electric kettle.  The air conditioning is very poor in this hotel. Only for lovely Abdul who provided a powerful electric fan and made sure that the aircon filter is properly cleaned we were able to sleep comfortably.  There was a small fridge and safe in the room. Also we asked for a quiet room with a nice view which was provided. The pool area and the gardens belonging to the resort are beautiful. The breakfast provided was continental with a possibility of hot food prepared for you. The standard of the breakfast was in tune with the hotel rating.  The room size was adequate to the star rating of the hotel. The room balcony was small but nice. The WiFi is available in the rooms gympool area and is easy to connect to.  The fitness area is state of the art gym and fitness suite accessible to the hotel guest in the Palace section. I never encountered any issue entering the beautiful Palace areas when saying I am a guest staying at the hotel part of the Es Saadi Resort.  One of the best features of this hotel resort is its security. The security staff is exactly ‚Äú on the ball‚Äù while being courteous to the hotel guest.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Bee Foodie wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Best place in the entire city!,My sister and I decided to visit Marrakesh for a week. Being from the North West of England we were looking for the best places for clubbing - we came across the casino in Es Saadi which wasn‚Äôt really for us as we don‚Äôt gamble. However as you walk through the casino there is a bar at the back. We were greeted by the manager who is not only stunningly handsome but gave us a really warm welcome. The entire staff especially a guy named Youssef just couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. The live band there was like no other we have ever experienced. Stunning bar with stunning service music and drinks - couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough. If there was one thing I could take back to England with me it would be the bar through the Casino (along with the staff DJ and drinks)! Haha. We will definitely visit again.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Molly S wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Over priced and stolen ciggerettes,We had a good time trips through hotel were a good price and very fun and informative.  I thought it was certainly over priced for what it was in morroco but we had fun  The very much down side is they take your bags and alcohol from air port on entrance to.the hotel. Our bags got held for nearly one hour in a room we couldnt see them whilst we check in -being searched.  On our last day we hired late checkout in one if the rooms - in this time 800 molbroo ciggerettes stolen from us - as soon as i got to the airport (my bag hadnt left my side) opened my case to get a jumper out and they had left the reciept but taken the ciggerettes.  I notified the hotel they said with cameras everywhere this did not happen. I explained it 100% had happended so of course it happend in our room and was locked up so.clearly still a staff issue.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Ana C wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Complete rip off - Scam after Scam.,We have no words to describe this hotel-resort... but we will try: fraud and really bad experience. I will start with the booking process... they advertise it as a 5* resort with some nice pools and infrastructure all the photos and comments they provide correspond to the ‚ÄúEs Saadi Palace‚Äù -which is not what you are actually bookings. So since they think it is ok to mix them both my review will also be of both hotels. Once you get to the hotel you have a worn down building that would not even get 3* in the 60s; dirty walls prison-grade bathroom sticky carpets cleaning-product smelling shampoo/lotion. The whole installations (both of the ‚Äúhotel‚Äù and the ‚Äúpalace‚Äù) are covered with flies... just nasty!  The pools again... horrible experience. To get a towel in the advertised pool you‚Äôve got to pay 500MAD per person per day the staff of both the pool and reception (‚ÄúPalace‚Äù) have the worst condescending attitude looking down to guest and making extremely rude comments. They aggressively laugh at your face... this is NOT a 5* treatment the whole treatment is just dreadful.  The SPA... after paying +1200MAD per person most of the steam rooms were not working again... no advise.  The bar another nightmare you‚Äôre either completely ignored by the staff (Palace) or they serve you a drink of a much lower quality (Hotel) than the ordered and they still pretend to charge you 240MAD per glass (when not even the full bottle is 150MAD) - note that they don‚Äôt inform you of the change on the product until after it‚Äôs poured and served! you only notice if you actually know your champagne! We clearly refused to accept/pay for it.  The taxis they arrange for you also a fraud! Extremely pushy drivers and very old cars for gold prices (I guess aligned with the whole philosophy of the resort). They took us to places we didn‚Äôt ask for (random shop in the middle of nowhere) and then pretended us to pay for that.  Every segment of the day (morning afternoon evening) you are jumped with a new unpleasant surprise. From having to pay ridiculous prices for basic services ill-mannered staff (with a few exceptions like the room cleaning lady/guy) to shattered rooms rusted bathrooms patched lobby...  The 1* of this rank is given to the bed (quite comfortable) and the grounds of the ‚ÄúPalace‚Äù (which would be very nice if you get rid of all the staff).  Conclusion: bad bad bad we would NEVER come back.,Date of stay: June 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N6716NUanac
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Jellysnook wrote a review May 2018,10,"Dishonest, rude, fraudulent staff - AVOID",My husband and I stayed here for a few days in May 2018.    The good:  -Room was a decent size and with a balcony with pool view.  -Nice bar by reception with a decent range of drinks (we recommend the espresso martini and gin fizz) great bar staff;  -Great food (amazing steak and chocolate mousse in particular) and service at the Saadi restaurant at very reasonable prices;  -Surprise birthday cake biscuits and fruit brought to the room for my husband which was a really nice touch;    The bad:  -When the time came to settle our account we noticed several room service charges which we did not understand. It turned out that staff had been both forging my signature on room services receipts and adding to our accounts room service receipts which neither of us had signed for (see pics attached). These related to breakfast delivery (see below). I was shocked by this level of blatant dishonesty (forgery in particular is never acceptable); however reception staff were pretty blas√© about it. The charges were eventually taken off our bill;  WiFi was terrible: pretty much non-existent in the room and kept cutting out in other areas such as reception and by the pool;  No tea/coffee/water in the room which we thought was very strange and highly unusual these days;  The breakfast set-up was highly confusing. Our booking included a ‚Äúcontinental breakfast‚Äù. According to the menu (pics attached) it seemed to be that the options were (a) 180 dirhams (about ¬£15) for buffet breakfast in the restaurant or (b) continental breakfast (bread yoghurt cereal etc.) in the room. As our booking included continental breakfast we went for that option but we discovered by chance on our last day that we could have had the more extensive buffet option each day at no extra cost. In addition the hotel tried to charge us room service charges for these continental breakfasts. Firstly they were meant to be included in the room rate and secondly nowhere on either the breakfast menu or the room service menu is a room service charge mentioned. I have no problem with paying charges which I am aware of but I do have an issue with hidden charges.  -My husband‚Äôs card was pre-authorised when we checked in. Unfortunately what this entailed (i.e. ~¬£400 ring-fenced cash with a four-day wait post-checkout for the money to be returned) was not adequately explained at check-in. When we queried this a couple of days later once the ¬£400 were showing as ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù on my husband‚Äôs account the reception staff were incredibly rude and even said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not my problem‚Äù. They were incredibly unprofessional.    To summarise: facilities all ok and mostly decent staff horribly let down by blatant dishonesty and rude unprofessional reception staff. Avoid.    Once the trust between hotel and guest is broken there is no going back. Were it not for the fraud forgery dishonesty and blas√© attitude to all of the aforesaid I would have given three stars. However the staff‚Äôs attitude and the hotel‚Äôs business practices actually disgusted me.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jellysnook

Easy 15 min walk to Koutoubia Mosque and the Souks and 5 mins in opposite direction to mall with Carrefour supermarket and easy dining options etc.Hotel gardens are gorgeous and if you like outdoor pools there is one huge unheated and one smaller heated at the sister hotel the Palace which you can use for 500 MAD.Well worth it. Resort Hotel pool is more crowded not so good in my opinion. Palace hotel nice to wander round but probably not worth the extra to actually stay there. Stay at Resort Hotel and use Palace facilities. Spa at Palace very nice had a great Hammam scrub followed by clay wrap and oil overpriced but hey a bit of luxury when you are on holiday why not? This time found some new things to see in the city Maison Tiskiwin Berber exhibition very good Badia Palace and Jewish quarter the Mellah interesting.

This resort should be a 4* not 5*.    Pros  - Beautiful room very spacious. We booked a suite as we were staying for two weeks with a baby and needed the extra space. House keeping were excellent.  - Great pool options incl a heated pool and beds/cabanas for lounging.  - Breakfast is included and very good. Lots of options of cereal eggs pastries bread etc.  - Resort staff esp breakfast and pool staff were very friendly and helpful.    Cons  - Pool food options are limited and rubbish for vegetarians.  - Bedroom towels and pillows are terrible quality for a 5* resort.  - On one occasion a pool staff denied me a third towel because they had a lot of guests they needed to service?! For a 5* resort they should always have unlimited towels!  - Reception staff (two females) very rude. Our AC stopped working for two days and we were informed that the hotel turned it off completely - again it's a 5* resort!  - Concierge; unfriendly and pretty useless.  - The resort does not provide irons or kettles for tea/coffee (strange) in rooms.    In the middle  - Restaurants were good but not excellent.  - Room service food options are limited esp for vegetarians (but we were staying for two weeks so for a week it's unlikely to be an issue)  - I emailed the resort prior to arriving regarding sterilizing baby bottles. I was told they had sterilizing machine. On arrival I was told it was broken and arranging alternative sterilizing was a big struggle. In the end Farah did arrange for us to use their microwave once a day to do all our baby bottles - thank you!

The hotel has a large pool area with a pool side bar and garden eating area with approx 80 deck chairs. The breakfast selection was good they have continental and hot breakfast. The hotel also has 4 shops which is great if you need gifts magazines sun cream toilettries postcards argan oil crisps chocolates etc.  The rooms are very comfy and soundproof every room has a balcony. I had the pool view room.    The hotel also has a huge underground nightclub which is fab as other guests dont hear the noise. It also has a casino.  The average price for a bottle of water is ¬£2.50 the average price for pasta at lunchtime from the pool bar is approx ¬£7.80.    Wifi is strong and free the rooms all have a minibar and safe  No tea/coffee facility in rooms.    If you go to reception they will give you the available exercions and day trips that are available. i did the Chez Ali trip for ¬£50 which included pickup and drop off 3 course meal a dinner show with a variety of dancers followed by a horse show.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Lorr1961 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Great Hotel,My husband and I are just back from Marrakesh yesterday. Here is my personal review    1) STAFF - were great so friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough to help you a credit to the hotel I needed to visit a dentist and the concierge went out of his way to help me kamial [ sorry for spelling your name wrong) was amazing    2) HOTEL- first impressions were pleasing bright spacious and airey our double room overlooked the road at the front of the hotel onto a derelict hotel but wasn‚Äôt an issue. If I went again I would get a room overlooking the pool area much prettier and sunnier.    3) ROOM was lovely clean and decent size with plenty of storage and drawers the bathroom was okay as well with a slight smell didn‚Äôt put us off just kept the door shut. There was a television with BBC world news. There are no coffee or tea making facilities so take your travel kettle or use room service. Our room was cleaned every day and again staff were very friendly    4) BREAKFAST - excellent choices we had freshly made omelette every day again staff were excellent    5) DINING- we ate by the poolside a few times and in the a la carte restaurant. I can vouch that the food was very good we enjoyed everything we had no upset tummies either. I loved the Moroccan mint tea but without sugar.    6) DRAWBACKS-only one and that is they allow smoking in the hotel in the lobby and on the one evening we ate in the resort a la carte restaurant someone was smoking towards the rear of the restaurant this spoiled it slightly but thankfully we had eaten our dinner so we just left.    7) POOL-great poolit was clean and large and very pretty staff are great    8) SPA- we used the spa for massage facial manicure all treatments were great. I felt spa rooms were a bit tired and could do with refurb. All in all a pleasant experience    9) OTHER POINTS TO NOTE  . Daily tourist tax of appx 57 MAD applied to all bills  . Everyone speaks French so brush up on this before you go  . You can get MAD at airport cash machines but not allowed to take them out of country and can only spend at airport on Moroccan products only so use them up before you get to the airport  . Recommend using a guide to take you for your first visit to the Souks and you really have to haggle on prices  . Recommend getting the hop off/on tour bus especially red line  . Agree taxi fares before you get into the taxi    There is another hotel on the grounds which you can use Es Saadi Marrakesh Palace much newer than the resort and more affluent bigger pools and gardens they have a casino and disco.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,cbjsks wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Nice place but you have to pay for it.,The hotel and the grounds are really well done and very pretty. We got a kick just walking around. The pool area is very active and seems to be well served by staff. The bar next to the lobby however is a different story. We sat one evening for 15 minutes with four people working behind the bar and must have been invisible. We had intended to get wine and a meal there but walked away unserved. The rooms are very nice at the hotel and clean. I can't account for the Palace but I am sure it is very nice too. We got served very well at the hotel dining room when we went as an organized group. The food and service there is very good. One night we ate at the Casino international restaurant by ourselves looking for something not cooked in a clay cooker and received mediocre food and service. Warning... do not order fish & chips! How could anyone screw up that one... they did with over-done mini fish fingers and a cup of fries.

I felt bad for that bellboy. After that I went to pool side and the waiters helped me to charge the shaver.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,duckiepoos wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Varied stay,"First of all i want to say that you need to be careful when you book. The photos of the hotel and palace are merged together making the hotel look better than it actually is these are 2 separate places linked via the gardens. Hotel guests are not allowed to use the pool at the palace (which is much nicer) the drinks are overpriced on resort even by London standards and the bar staff cannot make a cocktail to save their lives and we had the same guitar singer singing the same songs every single night (he was good but there are only so many times you can listen to Kayla in one week). We had to haggle at the shop which I think is rodiculous ""on resort"" but someone was trying to charge me about ¬£6 for a packet of crisps which were priced in a shop round the corner for ¬£1.50 - still cheaper in a London supermarket. There are also 2 spas one in the hotel and one in the palace side and the gym doesn't open until 8 - also on the palace side which makes an early workout before breakfast impossible if you want to get out early. Also the older gentleman with glasses on the concierge was the rudest and most unhelpful person i have ever experienced in my life and I have no idea why he's even in hospitality. The rooms on the hotel side are also very dated and the walls and doors are thin. Luckily I sleep with ear plugs.    Now the positives!! The pool staff and waiters were very helpful and friendly. The other man on concierge and the ladies at the spa the maids and reception were all fabulous. The rooms were cleaned very well and much more frequently than any hotel I have ever stayed at before and if you do take the small walk to the Palace side there are some cool bars (where they can make cocktails) and restaurants in particular we liked the Epicurian and the live music was excellent. The doormen were also excellent and helped us not to get ripped off by the taxi drivers. The security is also very tight and you certainly feel very safe.    Would I come back?

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Sajerelli wrote a review Sep 2017,40,50th birthday celebrations,So after a 3 hour delay at the airport we were pleased that we were able to check in on arrival despite being before 2pm. Airport transfer was expensive and I feel that the taxis charge what ever they want and even more so when you haven't got a clue on prices! 200 dirham which is just under ¬£20 for less than a 10 minute journey. despite being advised by the hotel that we would pay only up to 160 dirham going back to the airport we were still charged 200 dirhams.  Hotel reception staff were pleasant and helpful rooms are spacious but are a little dated and could do with a freshen up. Keys to open the bedroom doors are a pain as it could take a while to navigate the pins into the correct position to open! We weren't the only people to struggle with this as I assisted another 2 ladies who were struggling with it. Hair dryer in the room fridge of which you could put bottled water in etc was filled but we didn't drink anything from it as unsure if it was chargeable we didn't ask as only there for 3 days and had bought pop and water from the supermarket. Downside no tea or coffee making facility which for a 5 star hotel I was surprised at. We went down to breakfast at 9am the first morning and it appears no one replenishes the food which was disappointing so you got whatever was left and as breakfast finishes at 10.30 the omelette won.    We ate in the hotel restaurant service was ok and as tipping appears to be the norm the waiter was non too pleased with my gesture we had run out of cash as we had been to the square and the bank in the hotel was closed as it was late so it was only a small tip the waiter snatched the folder from the table and walked off tips shouldn't be an assumption by staff so perhaps a few lessons in manners wouldn't go a miss.    Within the grounds of the hotel/palace resort is a casino and restaurant/bar and a night club. We went to the casino and the bar Epicurien great night entertainment from Melodee and her band but the downside to this was it was rammed (which is great for business) but every time we went to sit down we were moved as the table was booked and in came another group of people. The one guy was extremely rude on every occasion he moved us there was no need a please and thank you would have sufficed. it took us 2 nights to work out that you could book tables for a minimum spend of 1300 dirhams (how this changes over a weekend I don't know) and you got a bottle of spirit of your choice had we known this at the start of our holiday we would have booked a table! Alcohol is extremely expensive and would have saved us a few pennies! A lady at the reception desk in Epicurien called Yasmina was lovely she spoke English and explained to us how the tables and booking worked. The restaurant club is a must however ask about booking a table as it's well worth it particularly if you are a group of girls.    Overall the hotel is nice the majority of staff were polite and accommodating the brochures in the room suggest you can use the facilities at the palace however We were told we couldn't.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,LouMji wrote a review Aug 2017,40,"Beautiful hotel in the ""new"" part of Marrakech",We stayed here back in September 2014 but only just got my Trip Advisor profile! Hotel Es Saadi is a beautiful hotel with big luxurious rooms and great views. We asked for a pool view room both times we stayed here and weren't disappointed! The pool itself was tranquil and tropical and the bar staff are attentive. I would recommend taking your own towel down as sometimes there was a bit of a wait for clean ones. The breakfast was amazing - but terrible for your waistline!    Es Saadi is in Hivernage which is the newer richer and less traditional part of Marrakech. We spent a couple of days here and then a couple in a Riad in the Medina so we could have the best of both worlds. Whilst in Hivernage you can walk to several good restaurants (Comptoir Darna was our favourite) and there is a supermarket within walking distance also. Taxis hover about outside the hotel and will take you to Jemaa El Fna but just have your wits about you and do your research about how much to pay.    Our only criticism for this hotel was that it took aaaaaages to check into our room and we kept having to walk back to the front desk to check how long it would be instead of them giving us any indication. I would stay here again though!,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouMji

Breakfast staff are nice and well mannered staff by the pool are slow and it's very hard to get their attention. The staff in the spa are lovely.    The rooms are outdated - the rooms in the Palace are much better.    We had the unfortunate issue of a very expensive handbag going missing in one of our rooms which miraculously reappeared after making a complaint. The guest relations manager was meant to get back to use regarding the issue but he did not meaning we had to leave the hotel before resolving the issue. I've called the hotel since my stay to speak to the general manager of the resort and have still not had a response although they have all my contact details and have claimed to call me (my phone has yet to ring nor have I received a voicemail).

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Seagull2005 wrote a review Aug 2017,50,"FUNCTIONAL, FAMILY, FABULOUS",Marrakech is an oasis of architecturally splendid hotels sophisticate in interiors and most with lavish gardens. These hotels consistently win global top hotel awards. This hotel is not one of those hotels. It is more a functional hotel with value for money. Its like a coming home to family kind of experience. You wont find more friendly reception and concierge staff anywhere. The rooms are tired but to compensate they are spacious super clean and always smelling of the perfumes of roses. Beds are large and comfortable. I dare you to find a better value breakfast anywhere and you get to eat it in the surrounds of an immaculate colorful garden of roses palms and citrus. Though its a destination hotel for many because of its proximity to the Marrakesh Casino and its extra large outdoor pool for lounging around and the indulgence of its Haman and Spa its location in the heart of Hivernage makes it a perfect choice to embrace all the restaurants etc in this famous area of Marrakech. The hotel's restaurant Gastronomique prepares a menu of fine dining from the family's organic vegetable garden just outside Marrakesh. And if you feel like a light room service I highly recommend the Chef's creamy vegetable soup,Date of stay: July 2017,,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seagull2005

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,TheRegni wrote a review May 2017,50,Perfect relaxation,We've just had a week in the sun here just to relax and wind down - this is the perfect hotel for that! Very attentive service room on 2nd floor not poolside still had a pleasant view and we weren't worried about paying for the mountain view as we weren't in the room much anyway. Breakfast sitting out in the sun our tea brought promptly every day without having to ask for it and a good range of hot and cold food - Moroccan pancakes  and omelettes made to order by cheery ladies. Poolside seating offered a range of sun and shade towels draped for you by the poolside staff and lunch and drinks from the poolside cafe. Pool kept very clean although wimped out of dipping more than a toe in but other people did swim in it.  We had dinner every night in the hotel restaurant as we didn't want to go out - although it would be very easy to do so. Reasonable choice on half-board menu but a shame you couldn't pay a supplement to eat a la carte (more choices) or in the restaurants in the Palace hotel (in same grounds)mas would have had more variety.  Excellent service also from the room staff always got a warm smile and checking you are all ok and knowledgeable concierge.  Piano bar in evening was a pleasant setting - daily variety of nibbles with your drinks including vegetables olives and crisps.  Not far to walk into old town or taxis seem to be a set price with no hassle.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,JPA38210 wrote a review Apr 2017,40,HOME FROM HOME,Although I had dined in its restaurant during the mid-1980s I first stayed here in 1993 and it has remained my Marrakech base ever since. Yes it has altered over the years but very much to the better. Many 'old faces' among the staff have retired but although there are many younger faces this is still a 'family' hotel. Currently run by the second and third generation of the founders and I still encounter personnel I have known for 25 years. One of the biggest changes has been in the breakfast area. There is now a large indoor as well as a much larger terrace. It is a buffet offering a full range of fare including Moroccan. Generally I find buffets impersonal but I was looked after very well receiving a warm greeting when I turned up and a discreet but very efficient service. I like the self-service but my pot of coffee always turned up without asking. The two young life guards round the pool knew where I liked a sun lounger and made sure it was ready and waiting for me. I come here to chill and think. The WiFi is very efficient which was just as well as I was unindated with work at one point. The grounds are a delight and I never tire of the view from the balcony - I always have a room with a pool/mountain view. The sister hotel the Saadi Palace is part of the same complex. Mainly built this century it is well worth a visit. The Saadi Hotel celebrates its 50th birthday this year.

Lots of noise from the Casino every morning around 5.00am with people leaving the Casino.

Every request was carried out efficiently and with a smile.  The house keeping staff are just as helpful. (Abdul is a a complete professional).

They stand there chatting to each other and ignore guests until they are finished.    We were given a room with two singles instead of a double one of them was broken and they refused to move us.  It was only when Abdul stepped in did they change their mind.    The rudest of all is the pregnant lady on reception. When I told her the aircon in the room was not working her reply was they had already moved us once and it is not her problem.    The concierge was an exception. He was a complete professional.

Otherwise service / guest engagement was hit and miss felt like half bar pool and restaurant staff were positive the other half seemed to almost try and ignore guests at times.    The hotel is a 60's construction generally in good condition and appearance but very different to the more contemporary Palace next door (which has a great pool you can only access at 500 dirhams each - not Es Saadi's fault but we were misled on this in booking process believing we had run of the resort. Not the case there's a clear class divide). Hotels pool fine but pretty crowded space. Food was okay but in our opinion not up to the quality easily accessible outside.    The bar was a little disappointing more like an airport lounge than a typical 5 star so worth the short walk to the Palace bar which was stylish and more intimate with warmer service.    Overall it was okay in some ways the building retro style is attractive if service had been more engaging it would have been a much more convincing experience.

Contemporary and luxurious the hotel combines comfort and style with location and authenticity. Recently renovated the hotel features 135 rooms and 15 different suites each with a balcony to enjoy the atmosphere of the city of Marrakech.

I stayed at the resort hotel for one night and was happy to have a standard room with a king size bed. I loved the design of the hotel as the natural saffron and ochre colors throughout paid homage to the Moroccan culture. The atmosphere was warm comforting with a contemporary vibe that made me feel astute. The team at the hotel were a delight as check-in was simple and quick.    Experiencing everything Marrakech has to offer is simple with the Clefs d‚ÄôOr Concierge service available any time to help with any request. The team at Es Saadi hotel is happy to assist and the service is wonderful. The location of the hotel is awesome as it‚Äôs close to everything in the heart of Marrakech. This makes it convenient to stay and get around and with the help of the concierge you can pretty much find anything.    My room was exactly what I needed to unwind after a day of exploring Marrakesh. The bed was large and comfortable and the linens were soft and very clean. I loved the view from my balcony which overlooked the large pool and gardens. Beautiful!    The room was spacious and with a sitting area and table king size bed and desk it never felt cluttered. If the Es Saadi Hotel wasn‚Äôt part of such a beautiful resort I could have stayed in my room all day.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Mehrnazuk wrote a review Jan 2017,40,nice hotel and wonderful staff,my 3 lady friends and I spent four nights at the Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel although not as glam as its neighbouring Es Saadi Palace the hotel had a comfortable room/bed and the concierge could not do enough to help. Special thanks to Kamal who was lovely and extremely helpful. So were many of the other staff. one of my friends luggage did not arrive to Marrakech with us and the hotel could not have done anymore in trying to trace its whereabouts.. The breakfast was great and plentiful. We had such a great time that we have booked another trip in October and I cannot wait to spend another few days in beautiful Marakech. if I had to make a few suggestions for improvements it would be kettle/tea/coffee facility in the room air conditioning so that guest can control during hot days.

I hope its OK to mention just a couple of names Mustapha Parvis and the two Khalid's (one with hair and one with no hair) Ha Ha ! They have all been so nice and at the same time professional.    The pool is lovely the room was comfortable and spacious a nice powerful bath/shower excellent buffet breakfast a tranquil spot walking distance to centre Marrakech a good SPA reasonably priced and accommodating.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,AlanaDidWhat wrote a review Jan 2017,20,Sleep Deprived in Marrakech,I hate to leave a two star review but a hotel at a minimum should be a place to sleep. We pre-paid for a junior corner suite with a pool view through the hotel's website. When we arrived we were taken to a pool side bungalow (not what we paid for) which sounds quite luxurious: it is not. The room was dilapidated my bed sagged in the middle and despite blasting heat I was frozen all night. We requested a new room the next day and were assured by staff that the room they were showing us was on par with the bungalow but again still not the room we paid for. The room was very nice. A huge improvement! But we were in for a surprise: because the room was not pool facing we heard the party outside our window that raged from midnight to 5am full of honking cars and loud voices for the next 3 nights as the hotel was fully booked. 2 stars for a friendly staff a nice breakfast and well maintained grounds. I would recommend ensuring you book a pool view but apparently that's not enough to guarantee your spot.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanaDidWhat

Then started the ""ping-pong"" between the hotel & us to be able at least to discuss with someone really in charge & deciding.  At the end of the day & all ping-pong talks the hotel argued that it was stated (in very small letters no one never reads) in the cleaning form a reimbursement of 5 times the price of dry-cleaning (8 euros) in case of issue.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,dutchie2009 wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Puzzling,Puzzled by exactly what this hotel is trying to achieve. It was historically a casino and then added on a hotel. The grounds are beautiful and the hotel itself is beautiful but I'm not sure how it defines itself as 'luxury' by anything other than the price tag.    The rooms are very dated shabby paint work flickering lights uncomfortable mattress. There was also no complimentary bottled water which I found baffling at the room price - only option was to purchase this from the mini bar. Additionally no kettle?    I was put on the street side of the hotel despite the hotel being practically empty; it was so noisy I didn't get a good nights sleep at all.    The breakfast room is lovely with good views of the pool however the chairs and floor were dirty with old pistachio nut shells. Great breakfast spread.    I forgot my plug adaptor and was asked to pay 15E for a replacement (for a 3 euro piece of plastic this was a shocking way to take advantage of forgetful travellers particularly as no shops nearby and travelling as a solo female).    Lovely roses in the room however the scattering of rose petals across bed and shower each day resulted in me having to pick them all up and put them in the bin each night. The flowers would have sufficed.    Customer service was good staff weren't particularly chatty but friendly when approached. I spent an evening in the piano bar which was excellent - great live music and good cocktails (London prices - 10 euro a cocktail 9 euro a glass of wine). Some of the bar staff friendly.    Safe area within a smattering of high end hotels about 20 mins walk to main square.    This hotel has a lot of potential but attention to detail is lacking particularly at the price point they are trying to position themselves. It did seem like they were trying to rinse guests for every penny which was a shame. Little touches would make a big difference.    Next time I'll stay in a luxury riad I think.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dutchie2009
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Alexandru L wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Only average,The position of this hotel I have stayed with for four nights in November this year is quite good. The view is also ok except maybe for the unfinished or deserted building in front.    But once you get inside things are not that nice and they are certainly far away from the 5 stars you see at the entrance.    Firstly this place is quite costly. Secondly the furniture an the room itself are quite old with lots of visible wear. The hot water was absent during noon and not that hot in the morning/evenings. The shuttle they arrange for the airport is paid separately from other hotel services and only in cash. The pool is quite little.    Could be a bargain if you know all this and know what you are paying for.    As regards the resort it has a casino a night club and a live music club. In the latter the music is good but the alcohol on the expensive side (10 EUR a small beer),Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Brasov, Romania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552alexandrul

There seems to be no one else staying here at the moment either so it‚Äôs hardly to keep the crowds out.  When we spoke to the lady on reception she was very rude and dismissive.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Kelly M wrote a review Nov 2016,10,"Disrespectful, rude and uncaring",We booked this hotel 6months previously for a 3 night stay as a short honeymoon. However when we arrived we were told by hotel staff that they had cancelled our booking due to a large conference in the city this week. Crestfallen we told them this was our honeymoon and we have been looking forward to this all year we begged for them to not cancel it. They advised they were now fully booked and there was nothing they would do. Having booked through an agency; last minute.com we asked to use their phone. Due to the conference all hotels in the city were fully booked or thousands of pounds.....after four hours of tears in the hotel reception our agency had sourced us a riad 40minutes out from the centre of Marrakech and we would just have to fork out the extra for a taxi. The hotel staff then asked us for 700dirham for our phone call and 30dirham for the glass of water that I had asked for to calm me down initially. Following more hysterics and tears the director eventually stated that we did not have to pay and that he thought it was good luck to have an awful honeymoon! Being so far out now we have no money to return to the centre of Marrakech and we are stranded for the next few days. Worst honeymoon imaginable and no-one at the hotel seems to care......

Good food. Drinks a little pricey. Attentive and friendly staff. In general I thought the staff were great and couldn't have been more helpful or attentive. Some of the best hotel staff I have encountered.  One negative comment - the disco from the neighbouring Es Saadi Palace was uncomfortably loud and went on far too late. Still noisy at 4am. The loudest music I have ever heard. It would be a major consideration for choosing this hotel again.  Otherwise a reasonable hotel in a decent location but avoid weekends.

The hotel was classically designed so generally the overall feel was nice as you walk in and all of the staff were amiable and accommodating. On closer inspection the feel was disappointing. Our room wasn't great - we requested a double but actually got two singles pushed together the bathroom was a bit shoddy - the shower head was broken (though fixed as soon as we notified the hotel) and a lot of the tiles were broken. The balcony was pretty small with a bit of a rubbish view of the roof and road and most of the furniture looked like it had been there since the hotel opened in the 60s. I understand classic design but the whole place needs completely refurbishing - a good lick of paint at the very least. On another delightful note we had protesters (presumably disgruntled ex-workers) chanting through a megaphone and banging drums right outside the hotel from our 3rd morning (our room was roadside so this was a unwelcome alarm clock in the mornings as well as throughout the rest of the day. I mentioned this to the front desk they just said it was ""nothing to do with the hotel"" (the protesters were pointing the megaphone at the hotel) so I asked if they were going to be moved and they said ""we will talk to them"". Joy of joys the next day the chanting starts again I called down to reception as we could hear it very loudly through the balcony doors so they could hear and they said someone would call me back they didn't call back. Next morning again the banging and singing starts again. So naturally I asked the hotel AGAIN if they were going to do something - they checked and moved us rooms to a pool view room great but too little too late in my opinion. Breakfast was ok but unless you eat eggs theres nothing hot to eat. Most of the staff were very friendly and really lovely though it was tainted by the fact that a couple of them were lack lustre and very slow. I found the cleaners to be the most friendly actually. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel at all mainly because it was so expensive. The local bottled beer was 65dhm which I find outrageous. I'd like to state that the pool was lovely and we always had a sun bed and the pool staff were very friendly and good. The hotel is about a 3.5 star maximum not even close to its 55 year old 5 star rating.

The location is fab 5min walk to some local restaurants 10min walk to the Menara Mall 15min Walk to the Souks 5 min Drive to the Airport 7min drive to the Osiria water park 10min drive to the desert safari. Everything is local.  In the cab u must haggle.  The rooms are large clean with complimentary toiletries bathrobes slippers and AC. The pool view is a good room as you can hang your clothes to dry.  The shower is so strong ( better than mine at home)  Every room has a mini bar and a safe and a balcony.  On day one I had a hammam and a facial at the Oriental spa at the resort. It's a fab treatment for 45 min it exfoliates your skin and removed dead skin all over.    The staff are very kind all the reception staff always welcomed me with a smile even 3am in the morning. They are helpful and very welcoming. The food and drink manager (can't remember his name but began with D) came up to me and asked me how I am if I am ok and if the stay is ok. The bar staff called Maria was very sweet and helpful.  The poolside is large there was approx 15 flatbeds and 80 sun loungers. Enough for everyone.  As a solo traveller I took a frisbee with me to the pool side and in 10mins 12 people joined in so it turned out very fun.  Definitely go to the casino but drinks are rather pricy. They have a live band from 1am which a definitely worth checking out the dress code is smart. In the casino underground there is a very big nightclub.

Drinks were the cheapest here of any where we had been. Outside the walls of the hotel grounds were restaurants in walking distance and it felt safe n the streets here.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Deniz A wrote a review Aug 2016,30,A mix of amazing and ridiculous,"Pros: free entry to arguably the best club in Marrakesh which is located in the hotel complex: Theatr0 (normally 300 dirhams)    Cool relaxing pool with some nice girls running around and friendly staff    Can get some great last minute deals for this hotel at reasonable price    Casino bar club restaurant combo makes the complex rather attractive to outsiders and busy all around    CONS: really weak over priced massage treatment at the spa. Entirely skip the spa of this place as it s a total joke. There was a morrocon girl as the masseuse who was shy to see a man (me) in swim shorts. You have definitely picked the wrong profession girlie. I should have refused to pay this fake massage a single penny but I was too covered in argan oil to get into a debate and later at checkout they tell me I shouldnt have agreed to the bill while it was happening. It s completely unethical to charge your hotel clientele with amateur overpriced services and advertise yourself as a top class hotel. The management should know better.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Stacey D wrote a review Aug 2016,40,Lovely hotel but room service needs a bit of work,Over all the hotel was very nice and clean. I stayed over a weekend. Staff were friendly and happy to assist with any questions. I didn't really speak much Arabic but found most of the staff - guest relations to housekeeping spoke French and English.  Lots of places to eat and drink at within the resort.  I found room service to be either hit or miss. One day I had an amazing breakfast spread the next day I did not and they forgot my cereals. I also ordered lunch from room service a vegetarian sandwich it arrived with chicken inside so I sent it back only for the same sandwich to arrive with the chicken pulled out of the sandwich. I did eventually receive the right sandwich complete with an apology rose. I ended up ordering from the hotel restaurants after that.  If you are looking to browse in the hotel gift shops think again. They will pounce on you like the shops within Marrakech.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Angela R wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Lovely Holiday,We spent 5 nights at this hotel. It is definitely not a 5 star standard but we did not pay 5 star prices. It's location is very good. Quiet residential tree lined area with a number of good hotels and restaurants within walking distance. 10 minute walk to the Medina. It was a really pleasant holiday destination. The rooms were dated but clean. Bed was comfortable. Small balcony (but too hot to sit outside really). The gardens were really beautiful and well kept. Food in the restaurant was good quality well presented and the staff were professional and efficient. The pool and pool area was clean and well maintained. Attendants very helpful and there were sufficient sun loungers and brollies.    The things that could do with improvement are the lifts (hit and miss whether they were working or not and as I had a bad leg whilst there found it difficult walking up the stairs). We enjoyed eating outside beneath the trees but the breakfast menu was boring (same limited food on offer everyday) and although plenty of staff on each morning the dishes often needed replenishing. Staff would always be willing to get what you wanted once they were asked but this shouldn't have been necessary. Small whinge but something that could be rectified immediately is to use boiling water for the tea!    All in all a good hotel but in need of a little updating.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,HayleyTett wrote a review Jun 2016,20,Wouldn't visit again!,Myself and my friend booked this hotel for 4 nights when arriving we had to wait almost 2 hours without our luggage and passports because they were taken by staff & our rooms weren't ready. Was just told to sit & wait.    Our room wasn't bad for what we needed it for which was just sleeping although we were facing the back of the hotel which becomes very loud with the hustle & bustle of people honking their horns constantly. The room had a funny smell to it especially in the bathroom couldn't quite work out what it was can only describe as stagnant water..?    On the website also it said nothing about us being able to only have use of the one pool on the resort the photos and page can be a little deceiving in the sense of it shows you all what's there and the pools that was a let down.    Breakfast was the same options each morning which became slightly boring although everything was labeled well So I knew what I was eating.. I didn't want to eat because was constantly flies over it.    The staff at breakfast were actually very kind as soon as they saw you heading their way they were already asking what you'd like to drink.    One of the staff members at the snack bar was extremely rude brought us the wrong drink we had ordered when told it wasn't correct it was slammed back on the table and told that it's now been opened so we had to pay for it!! Isn't much option on food for vegetarians.. I ate pasta for days which didn't give me the best beach tummy I was hoping for on holiday!! Haha.  They said at reception we could eat at different places on the resort handed a piece of paper and sent on our way.. We found those places eventually.. But was told we couldn't eat in them.    We actually found a supermarket in the end brought our own food.    Ordered room service one night.. Waited 4 hours and we fell asleep still waiting for it. Spoke to reception about the problem and was told they'd look into it.. We're still waiting for that to be looked into!!

On arrival the hotel staff where very helpful and polite.The hotel is like paradise. everything i wanted in a resort.  The hotel has a large pool area with a pool side bar and garden eating area with approx 80 deck chairs. The breakfast selection was good they have continental and hot breakfast. The hotel also has 4 shops which is great if you need gifts magazines sun cream toilettries cigarettes postcards argan oil crisps chocolates etc.  The rooms are very comfy and soundproof every room has a balcony. I had the road view.    I stayed at this resort for 4 nightS and i will be back this Summer.    The hotel also has a huge underground nightclub which is fab as other guests dont hear the noise. It also has a casino.  The average price for a bottle of water is ¬£2.50 the average price for pasta at lunchtime from the pool bar is approx ¬£7.80.    Wifi is strong and free the rooms all have a minibar and safe  No tea/coffee facility in rooms.    If you go to reception they will give you the available exercions and day trips that are available. i did the dessert trip for ¬£53 which included jeep safari camel ride 3 course dinner on dessert and shisha.

One of the many hightlights of my stay was breakfast in the garden. It was so relaxing to start my day with great coffee under the purple bougainvillea and listen to the birds singing. The pool area is great and I can really recommend the Oriental spa and their fantastic massages. However for me its got to be the gorgeous gardens and the fact that you can also wander around the Palace Hotel next door. It is something else and belongs to the same family.

The pool area is clean and a lovely place to sit with a glass of wine early evening. The piano bar was relaxing and welcoming. Good choice of drinks and snacks too if you wished.

Great casino and one of the best night clubs 'theatro' in its back garden.    The pool is bland. Uninteresting. Didn't tempt any of us. We went elsewhere for pool use.    Cocktail menu was meh and small amounts of alcohol used it seemed.    Front desk concierge female staff her name escapes me; quite rude and unhelpful. Unwilling to go the extra mile to make you feel well looked after; compared to other hotels. They do the bare minimum.    On check in we were not given a tour or pointed to where we can find things or a list of facilities available reiterated. We had to settle for a rolled up paper of welcome on our bed    The phone in room had no contact numbers for concierge extra... And Nothing in any of the leaflets hanging about.  I asked the lady at the front she started to try and get paper to write them down she gave up and just told me to ring 51 and we would get directed onwards.    The only highlight of the hotel was our housekeeping if my memory serves me correctly his name was Ahmed. üôà he was helpful attentive efficient and friendly. We were happy to see him each day. The majority of house keeping and restaurant staff were helpful And friendly.. Those women  Who cook our pancakes and omelettes and those in-charge of admin front of house etc...

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Anthony W wrote a review May 2016,40,A lovely hotel which requires just a little effort in some areas,I have visited the hotel many times before and always enjoy my stay. it has the great advantage of having a heated swimming pool. There are a couple ol areas where they need to raise their game. The air conditioning in the rooms is only set at one temperature so that one cannot easlily get comfortable. The air is really not cold enough to make sleeping at night comfortable. Which is a pity since I do like to sleep when I go on holiday. Sure those lower temps cost the hotel money but the hotel Meridien does not have a problem keeping the air temp at a regulatable and low temp so why should the Es-Saadi ?    At lunch I mentioned to the pool restaurant manager that the Caesar Salad was a bland and without taste. He laughed a little and asked me not to look behind me but mentioned that they had two Michelin starred consultant chefs dealing with the issue. Sure enough these two cogniscenti were seated at a table behind me and the table was piled high with spices and sauces so they obviously realised their own food needed more taste. However it is not rocket science to get food to taste right. Grated parmesan cheese works wonders ! And try grilling the chicken with some Teriyaki sauce. That works very well. I have no complaints about breakfast. That is always good !    But the thing the really makes the difference at the hotel is the friendly staff. They are invariably happy and I do like to served by happy staff !,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Coppet, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2516HNanthonyw
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Donna186534 wrote a review May 2016,30,worn rooms some unfriendly staff,We booked a pool view room at this hotel which was more expensive than a city view room. The rooms were large with a small balcony but in desparate need of refurbishment. The bathroom was also large with a separate toilet however ithe bathroom didn‚Äôt feel particulary clean. The carpet in the room had an iron burn on it that nonoe had attempted to cover up. Considering what we paid i felt that was a bit out of order. Also the towels and bathrobes were a hideous mustard colour agin making the place feel unclean. The reception breakfast room pool and gardens were lovely. We had lunch 2 out of the 4 days we were there. The first lunch was ok however we had to sit at the bar as all the ables were in use. The service was a bit slow. The next time we had a table. We ordered a Greek salad a tuna pannini a beer and a bottle of white wine. The wine and food came but no beer so my partner asked for his beer again. It was brought and just dumped on the table the waiter seem to have an issue of some kind he was a bit cocky. For some reason I opened my pannin to find chicken and not tuna as someone who hasn‚Äôt eaten meat for 20 years I was angry. I lifted my plate and went straight to a manager with it. The manager was apologetic and brought the correct order quickly however he said there were a couple of pannins waiting to go and the waiter picked up the wrong one. I appreciate mistakes happen but something as basic as that should not of happened in the first place it wasn‚Äôt that busy. The Greek salad looked nothing like any Greek salad my partner or I had ever seen before. My partner is a Head Chef. Probably the most annoying thing was that 2 waiters came to the table basically asking for tips for the poor service.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna186534

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,JPA38210 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,AN OLD FAVOURITE,I first visited Es Saadi in the mid-1980s to dine. Since 1993 I have stayed there many times. In the early days it was second to La Mamounia but of course in recent years there have been a plethora of hotel openings in the city but I have remained loyal to Es Saadi. Over the last 23 years the hotel has changed enormously - for the better I hasten to add. The rooms are well appointed the pool area is spacious the gardens of the hotel and its sister hotel the Palace are always good for a stroll and the buffet breakfast is a mini banquet with smooth unobtrusive service. OK I am part of the furniture and am bound to say its good. Rest assured I would not stay there if it was not! It is run by the second and third generation of the founding French couple and in the unlikely event that you should spot something that is below standard mention it to the staff and it will be put right. I asked a friend who stayed there what she thought 'I felt I was on a glamorous James Bond movie set' was the response. OK it is a 1960s building and is retro as opposed the a faceless contemporary building without a soul. But that's its charm!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,roystonoxendale wrote a review Apr 2016,30,Cosy hotel.... but needs work,Please note that there are two hotels here the palace more luxurious and modern which is also Moroccan themed and the Es Saadi garden this is the original hotel. First off can't fault the hotel for the airport transfer brilliant service however the hotel its self is cosy but needs to be brought up to life the rooms are dated and prehistoric some what. One major bug bear is that there is air con in the room but you can't control the temp which makes no sense either boil in the heat or freeze to death by air con. The Morning buffet is an ok selection (same thing every day) and there are good food resturants throughout only problem is that on a few occasions we ordered lunch by the pool and we either didn't get lunch or took two hours to get to us. The concierge weren't the best either our booking was for a double bed in which we had two single beds and asked on three different occasions to change which didn't happen and we ended up pushing the beds together. Bar that garden is lovely to walk around. We also notice that some of the staff did make more of an effort if you tipped them excessively and were sarcastic about the service they provided if you did not tip which we thought was rather would!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,julia wrote a review Apr 2016,20,"Old fashioned hotel, rather 3-4 stars than 5 stars, needs renovation",We were supposed to stay at the new Radisson hotel in Marrakesh but as the construction work wasn't finished on time they had to find another hotel for us which was Es Saadi Hotel. We got an upgrade to a pool/atlas mountain view room which was nice. The balcony was rather small and not very clean. The room was in a rather bad condition very old fashioned style (red and yellow colors) not so clean especially the bathroom. Once we walked in on the cleaning ladies and found that they had put the bed covers and pillows on the floor (on the dirty carpet!) and after that put them back on the bed! In general the place doesn't seem very clean and kind of run down it urgently needs a renovation to justify these room prices... The breakfast buffet was ok but every day the same the vegetables and fruit were slushy and didn't seem very fresh. The egg/bread station looked quite disgusting the cooks there touched everything with their hands not up to European hygiene standards and not nice to look at. By 10:00 most of the food as gone especially the good bread.    I do have to say the waiters especially the staff at breakfast were extremely friendly and trying very hard. The reception and concierge staff were not very friendly and seemed aloof. They didn't make much of an effort to help us with anything and the prices they give you for trips etc. include a high mark up don't book anything they offer you...    Also the WIFI didn't work very well especially in the rooms lobby was ok but it went on and off a lot.    What was nice was the resort the gardens and the proximity to the city center.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Imogen S wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Really fabulous hotel,This is a fantastic hotel we stayed for 5 days as a family in two poolside bungalows (room 13 and 14) which meant we could walk straight out of our rooms and be beside the pool easily which was great with young children who when they got hot were able to go in and out of the rooms and we could keep an eye on them. The staff here are absolutely amazing the pool staff bring you a towel for your sunbed and if you have children who aren't great swimmers the staff stand near the children so you can sunbathe in peace if you want. The staff in the bar and dining rooms are attentive and welcoming. One night we bought a bottle of wine from the bar to share on our patio and when the staff saw my husband bringing the wine to our patio rushed over with a wine bucket with ice and little plates of olives and snacks. I couldn't believe they were making sure we had what we needed even though we were sitting on our patio now THAT is service! On our last night my daughter got a sickness bug and we were worried about flying home with her ill a resident doctor came to see us at about 10pm he was on site checked her over arranged a prescription for us and the hotel staff rushed off and got tablets etc to get her well enough to fly the next day. This was a massive comfort to us. There is a lovely terrace bar/lunch area where everyone goes to after a morning sunbathing for a light lunch. The hotel restaurant itself is excellent serving delicious food. This isn't a cheap hotel and it wasn't a cheap holiday but it was truly worth every penny with the outstanding staff environment and location. Also it is just 10 mins walk to the JemmaEl Fnaa square which is handy. Got a bit fed up being hassled constantly by people wanting to sell you stuff but hey that's Marrakech. No likey don't go. The one and only downside was the noise from the Casino nearby which starts at 12midnight and goes on till 4am. We were very close to the noise but shut the bathroom door and bedroom door and stifled the noise. We aren't particularly noise sensitive having 3 bolshy children but it might be an issue for some. Also the showers are absolutely to die for superb drench showers and the beds are really comfortable. We are already planning our next visit next Easter cannot wait!

It is a very nice hotel dating from the '60/'70 and it still breaths this style. The lobby restaurant and pool have been renovated but they kept the ""retro"" style. The rooms are a bit out dated but everything is in working order and ofcourse clean. One thing: the climat control can only be turned on or off and you cannot regulate the temparature your self.  The staff is very proffecional helpfull and kind. Everybody speaks English and other languages as well. Breakfast is served in the garden as well which is a wonderfull way to begin the day. Lunch at the pool - salads pasta fish or meat the choice is very good. For dinner there are many nice restaurants closeby. The hotel has its own restauarant but we did not eat there becuase it was not so busy and a bit too stiff for out taste.  We did make use of room service which was very efficient!  The night club is open untill 5pm and you can hear the music bit....this is not that bad but at 5.30 when everybody is leaving the club the cars/taxis are honking their hoorns and that does wake you up.

The hotel is 15 minutes walking to the Medina which makes it easy to get to the center. Once you visit the city center you will like to be a bit isolated from the worldly noise center. The distance to all the monuments and places to visit will not be more than 20 minutes walking. The pool and gardens are fantastic and well cared. The service offered was excellent they all are very helpful and kind pleasant to help you in all your doubts. The only bad thing we must state is that the rooms are old and they should be restored. However the equipment inside them and the room-cleaning make it better and you will forget about it. Wi-Fi is free in the rooms and all the places nearby the hotel.    We offer our compliments and our sincere thanks!,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reinus92
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,SarahHart wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Bar and pool areas closed due to filming!,We only stayed one night after a busy week travelling in Morocco. The hotel lobby was very dark and crowded with film crew. We were 'shushed' by film crew for talking at reception. Outside whole areas were cordoned off for filming.  We had a reasonable lunch and swam and then went up to our pool view room. The bathroom basin drain was smelling terribly and although a man came up all he did was spray air freshener everywhere. The other problem of a pool view room is the noise from the casino. As the customers leave at 3am there is a huge amount of noise people shouting cars roaring etc. Maybe the money made by being a film location will be used to improve this hotel. The gardens are lovely and the staff pleasant.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Gloucestershire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahHart

The bed was average the worst part was that there's no air conditioning! The room got super hot at night and I couldn't open up the windows to my balcony in case of swarms of insects invading the room.  On the flip side the pool seemed OK although a little small for the size of the hotel and the breakfast was pretty good.  The location is perfect and the casino / nightclub is next door.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Liz B wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Filming location nightmare !,Disappointing stay overall.  We arrived at 8pm to a chaotic reception ( another guest was ranting about the disruption he was encountering) I became aware of a lot of people milling around the receptionist told me there was filming taking place  but it would be over the following day. No apologies for the disruption.  And there was a great deal of disruption ...areas of the ground floor were sealed off to get around we were stepping over cables. ... No health and safety guys here!  We were stopped from going through to the pool on several occasions whilst filming was taking place and told to be quiet! Access to the gardens was not allowed at various times it was sealed off as was the dining room  bar and other areas.  The filming lasted 3 days we were only there for 4.  At no time did anyone apologise for the disruption even putting a sign in reception would have been a start.  I understand that film crews often prefer to pay and take over the whole hotel so it wasn't their fault. The fault lay with hotel management .  It was though as a guest we were treated as unimportant .    Once the film crew left the hotel was calm and restful...but our stay had been spoilt.  Not a 4 star hotel quite worn in areas good location food average. Lovely cleaners and room service staff too.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizbQ6889QF
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,colombiafeliz wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Not a 5 star hotel,This was our last hotel on a 2 week trip to Morocco....and we stayed there for 3 nights.    Let me start with the bad: hotel is a bit outdated lobby and rooms smell of cigarette smoke (which is terrible if u have asthma like I do) bathroom smelled of public restroom (read rancid pee!!) and when we asked them to fix it a guy shows up with a bottle of yellow liquid smelling of cheap perfume 3 hours later sprays it everywhere-no scrubbing- and leaves! Made it much worse.    When we were checking in they were filming a movie so we had to stand silently for 40 mins before we could get the keys- somewhat entertaining but not ideal after a 7 hour drive through the mountains.    Now the good: the staff is very friendly and always willing to help the garden/pool is really pretty location is convenient and food is good.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,427eladd wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Day of joy,Arrived only for a day from Casablanca where we live. At first we we're sure we booked at the palace because some of the facilities are joined and the photos on the Internet are the same. That didn't make a big difference though and we got to our hotel which was on the other side of the resort. We checked in easily and went to our room. The room was nice had a safe which was very simple to use unlike many other hotels we been to.    I had a 50 minute massage and my wife set on the poop and had a drink. Massage was nice but very pricy. Not big difference to what you get for half the price in a non luxury resort.    Anyway after that we searched for something to eat and there was not even one place to eat at the resort since all the restaurants open at 19:00 and it was 17:00.    This was very disappointing for a resort like this that has a few places to eat not having even one open. But we got the reception to open the kitchen for us and we ate on the bar which was fine but again very pricy.    The casino is ok I don't understand why in Morocoo playing roulette it's like in the most expensive casinos in the world for minimum bet and why they have so many different slot machines to any other casino I've been to but besides that we had a lovely day and evening spend good time also at the club down stairs which is like a pick up club for old man and young local girls.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Tony S wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Fabulous Hotel; great value for money.,This hotel is really well situated. Not too far from the markets and other local attractions which you can walk to but far enough away in a quiet neighbourhood to get away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. It is also a 5/10 minute walk from a Carrefour so you can pick up any stuff you need such as water and snacks if you don't want to pay for your mini-bar etc If the weather forecast is good whether you are on your own or with children get your sight-seeing done in the mornings and leave a good few hours to relax by the pool in the afternoon.    On our trip there were four couples two of whom got rooms in the main hotel overlooking the pool and the mountains the other two got bungalows on the ground floor just off the pool. This was really handy when we were sunbathing in the afternoon as they had a terrace with chairs we could all sit around and have a drink.    The staff were fantastic. Extremely friendly and efficient. We had a couple of birthdays there and they made a real fuss..a basket of fruit then a big cake in our room when we got home that night. They also sang happy birthday at breakfast which was fantastic by the way; a really varied selection of hot and cold food available.    The only things you might want to be aware of: I don't think our A/C was working in our room which meant we had to keep our window open to let cool air circulate. This was around 12th/13th February but it was still approx 25 degrees during the first few days. Later on in the year this could be a real problem when the temperature is a lot higher. It also means with the window open some people can hear noise from people leaving the casino behind the hotel..cars beeping their horns and people talking which seems really loud at 3am!; the casino - we went in there out of curiosity to have a game of roulette. It is not like Monte Carlo! It's actually quite small and a bit seedy and it stinks of smoke. Put it this way there are better ways to spend ¬£50 in 15 minutes!    Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. I read a few reviews from people who had visited a couple of months before we arrived complaining about staff and saying the place looked tired. What is important is that the new hotel manager (he started a couple of months ago also) took the time to respond to those complaints and apologise stating he mas making some changes and improvements. He was visible most days in the lobby and at breakfast and I think he has had a huge effect on the hotel by raising the standards of service. The place also looks like it has had a bit of a face lift.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyS715
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Cee M wrote a review Mar 2016,10,WORST EXPERIENCE EVER - STAY AWAY!,Firstly This hotel as many have stated is 3 star at max. It is outdated and requires renovation - also the size of the pool is relatively small compared to that of the palace (which you will not be able to use unless you want to pay 500DHS per day of usage).    WIFI - NON -EXISTENT IN ROOM'S FINE DOWNSTAIRS BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO BEAR WITH THE FUMES OF SMOKE FROM CIGARETTES    Anyway; when you enter the hotel during check in - you will be notified that you will have to pay some tax apparently a government tax; which is 30.00DHS per day so depending on how many days you stay it will be added on (per day). This will be demanded from you before you have even been given the keys - many of those who work behind the counter lack basic understanding of english so when you try to get them to explain as to why there is a tax it is very difficult. Since I pre-paid everything online I did not like this experience at all - as I just came back off the plane and wanted to go straight to bed - so I had to convert currency which was of course inconvenient in order to pay this tax bill    The hotel it self is dated and requires to be modernised. One main problem I have found with the hotel is the allowance of smoking near the pools inside the bar area restaurant. If you are a non-smoker the fumes of the smoke will annoy you as it will get up your noise; your clothes if you sprayed cologne or did not spray cologne will smell of cigarette smoke; also smoking is allowed in room's so it gets up in the hall-way and you will smell this when you are trying to get to your room. I could see this being a major problem for families and for those who care about their health (passive smoking).    The Hotel resides near a Casino and a nightclub (theatro). At night you will find it hard to sleep as there will be car's revving up and down the road many of the people enter the club around 1PM and leave 3-4 so it will be very noisy around this time and you will hear screaming and shouting.    Bed-and-Breakfast is standard and is nothing of special and lacks variety many consists of croissants and orange juice/tea - I stayed for 5 day's and have had that for the past 5 days.    Outside the hotel - if you leave the resort/hotel will be waiting taxi's. Please be warned these taxi's are opportunists and will harass you for a lift even if you just went out for a walk/stroll. Also notice these taxi's remain there for many hours in hope for a big punt from a customer so will charge you Min 50DHS for a 2-4min drive (which usually cost around 4-6 DHS) so you will feel like you have been ripped off; Thus it is best to walk away from the hotel resort area and seek from a street away in which you may find a taxi driver who may treat you fairly.    The maid's or house keeping people consist of many old-aged workers; who you cant help but notice look under-paid and over-worked they will tend to strike conversation with you which I found not to be a problem; so it is important to tip them so they are rewarded for their hard work even if the hotel are not treating them accordingly.    The main problem with my visit at this resort/hotel which led to me to give the rating 1/5 is due to the arrogance incompetence of the management team and security when it came to checking out of the hotel. When you are checking out of the hotel you will be given a further bill. This will include many extra's which you will have to pay upfront such as the cost of mini-bar in your room room service and for my case (600 DHS late check-out charge) My flight was due in 1/30min so when checking out I was asked to pay this; for which I refused as I was not made aware of this and found to this to be an unreasonable amount. I had to let the ignorant manager's aware that my flight is due and I would need to leave the hotel; I did not hold the amount in cash with me; so as I was walking away from the hotel; the security prevented (by force) me from leaving the hotel via keeping my luggage away from me - preventing me from getting into my waiting taxi. All this due to a small amount of cost which could of easily be waived as I did not seem to do anything wrong. I was then forced into a room near the entrance (where they kept all their guest luggages) and man-handled by approx 6-security big men all of which used insults in arabic in which I insulted back; I was then spat at in the face by one of the security men. This did not come as a shock as it is part of their culture for this to degrade an individual so it was seen a necessity by the security for which I requested the police to arrive. It took more than 1 hour for the police to be in contact hotel reluctant to call them ASAP ( you will soon realise that many local moroccans and businesses fear the police also the police are arrogant and unreasonable do not take verbal argument/confrontation lightly so be warned) The security men confiscated my phone away from me to prevent me from recording the incident withheld my passport and held one leg in the air (twisting motion as if they were trying to dislocate it and gripped both my arms one security for one arm). All this was conducted smartly in a small room where I was put where luggages are kept to prevent other guests from witnessing or to generally minimise the number of witnesses/cameras. I was then greeted by a tall figure (european french) senior manager who spoke decent english but still was arrogant; believed their group of staff were heaven sent and asked me whether I would like to catch my flight as it was still 30mins from my flight departing; I disagreed to this; as my suitcase was damaged and my glasses was snatched from my face during the incident in which I was man-handled. Police eventually did arrive however they sided with the locals (this is mainly due to the fact the police do not speak a word of english so can only hear one side of the story this automatically leaves you feeling powerless and allows for them to get away with this treatment; their is also an air of collusion between the police and the hotel resort altogether; and their is a lack of law and order so be warned.    All in all I was taken to the police station along with 2 representative of the Ess saadi resort Managers (both refused to give me their names (although one I believe to be Omar) and police were reluctant to help with my enquiries) - I was told I would have to stay in Marrakesh for a further week if I wanted the matter to be investigated in which I would have to stay at the station or to find a hotel for the night in order to catch the plane in the morning.    Please understand that if their is any confrontation or misunderstanding's or if you feel their acting wrongfully and inappropriately and you try to challenge or merely disagree ; they will change their approach to one which is more forceful one in which no witnesses will be present and one in which you will be treated like DIRT! in which the managers will order many security guard's to detain you out of sight from any potential witnesses and cameras.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,ichii_feet wrote a review Feb 2016,30,Pleasant hotel a little way from the centre of Marrakech,As a five star hotel I can't argue with the service! From the welcome to the restaurant to the general attitude of the staff we were made to feel valued and welcome throughout.    We were on a half board deal which was decent - breakfast buffet was plentiful and well run with a hot spread and the usual cold meats/breads/cheeses etc. The evening meal was a la carte with a couple of traditional Moroccan options from the menu. My girlfriend being vegetarian (pescatarian anyways) often went for the fish option of which there was at least one a day but there were a few vege tajines during the stay. Alcohol was expensive so we only had a bottle once but I always think it's a bit odd drinking in an Islamic country so it wasn't too much of a sacrifice.    The hotel was pleasant if a little worn around the edges. Our room had a blocked toilet from the off which kept blocking up while we were there. The shower was a bit of a hazard as it leaked and sprayed all over the bathroom every time we used it. The bed was comfy and the room generally was pretty nice.    A few reviews complained about proximity to the road and our room was near the road but we didn't find it too bad. Also we were there out of season so perhaps we got away with not having the noise of the on site entertainment which sounds like it could be a pain.    Other than that the outdoor pool was great the gym - which is in the more premium 'palace' wing - was well stocked and run. There was a good looking spa which we didn't use and there was live music in the evenings which was pleasant.    As a base for exploring Marrakech the Es Saadi is a little away from the centre a 15-20 min walk into the old town/Jemaa el fna and a 10-15 min walk to the new part of town. Perhaps this is a good thing for peace and quiet but there aren't many restaurants/cafes on the doorstep so if you want to eat out you need to get a taxi or walk a bit.    If I was to come here again I would probably just go for bed and breakfast and eat in the middle of town each evening as it is cheap varied and lively.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ichii_feet

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,548gem wrote a review Dec 2015,30,Don't confuse Es Saadi Palace with Es Saadi Gardens & Resort,"Where do I start. My wife & I were with Globus Tour Group when my wife slipped on the stairs on way to dinner she slipped & broke her leg. The lighting was not that good the polished travertine was slippery & no handrail. No one from the hotel came to our aid yet they advertise ""Medical Facilities"" on premises. My wife had surgery next day & was in hospital for three days. The tour group left & we were stuck at Es Saadi Gardens for five more days. The tour director said he arranged with hotel manager to give us Globus price but they didn't. The manager of hotel advised he could arrange transportation by cab to Casablanca Airport for 3000 dirhams. My cab driver said he would take us for 1000 dirhams. Where's that 2000 dirhams going? My phone would not work. The wi-fi was very poor. The fax machine did not work at the Es Saadi Gardens or the Es Saadi Palace. So I walked to Sofitel two blocks away to use theirs to send paperwork to insurance company. There is no private area to conduct business. I was not getting emails sent to the hotel from the insurance company being forwarded to me in a timely manner. Receptionists were aloof & uncaring. I think the receptionists believe being aloof is ""professional"". They have a lot to learn. From the first day I had what I thought were mosquitos bites on back of both my legs. The last night of our stay I discovered a bed bug in my bed & took a picture of it. Also the manager whispered to me that he removed the telephone charges on the hotel bill as a favor. The phone charges were still on the hotel bill. Thanks for absolutely nothing.  Okay now some good things. The Berber greeters at the front door the people cleaning our room the food servers the concierge & bartenders were gracious & friendly. I thought the food was excellent having room service in the room several times & the daily breakfast.  There is some noise late at night but it did not bother me. The casino is equipped with old machines & seems very antiquated compared to casinos in Nevada. I was told by a casino host when you are gambling that they provide free drinks they charged full price. Needless to say I didn't stay long.  This is not a four or five star hotel. It is a three star sorry. I have since learned there are many hotels in Marrakech.

The rooms are nice clean and cosy. The pool is also clean and relaxing sunny all day long.    In terms of food we only ate at the pool restaurant and were pleased with the quality of the food. The continental breakfast buffet is also great with lots of choices.    The hotel itself is quite dated and feels more like a four than a five star hotel. Although I wouldn't pay the full price we got a good rate when booking the room which ended being great value for money.    Also be aware they do not provide irons in the rooms. The only way to get something ironed is to send it to the laundry service which obviously isn't free ...,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sof-E1

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Kenneth M wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Fantastic place to rest and relax,We arrived after a 3 day trek in the mountains and this was the perfect level of comfort and all-inclusiveness we were looking for. The room was very clean and comfortable with good Wifi reception in the room. We ordered room service and it was delivered promptly and we were very happy with the quality. The onsite restaurants can cater to many different tastes if a bit more on the expensive side. The staff were incredibly inviting and helpful in setting up spa appointments and welcoming us through the whole resort area.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Traveler2179 wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Wonderful hotel but staff trying to steal,The property is beautiful and the accommodations very comfortable- however one of the staff are trying to steal from their guests. I was there for a conference last month and myself and my colleagues have all received notifications from our credit card company of fraudulent charges being made on our cards. Since the only place that I used my card was at the hotel to pay for my room charges one of the staff is trying to steal from the guests. I would suggest that anyone who has stayed at the hotel in past month take a very careful review of their credit card bills. Also- hopefully the owners/management team see this review and can conduct their own investigation.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,EmsCornwall wrote a review Nov 2015,40,A good hotel in a convenient location.,My first stay in Marrakech so I wasn't sure what to expect. The hotel is in a particularly convenient location being only a short uncomplicated walk to the souks. I had no trouble finding my way back after exploring on foot by myself. The room was large and comfortable. I was overlooking the road so was expecting noise to keep me awake but this was not a problem. The pool was small but adequate and quite warm. Lunch was expensive and 'westernised' but plentiful portions. My only complaint is that there was no tourist information available on the front desk whatsoever. When I asked if they had a map (I was about to set off to the centre of Marrakeche on foot on my own) they replied 'We have just given it (!) to someone else'. Not at all helpful. I had to buy one from the little shop on site at an extortionate price.

The gardens were lovely and the staff were very helpful. A good sized heated pool with plenty of beds and very attentive pool staff. The room was a good size the beds very comfortable and the bathroom had plenty of powerful hot water. It was easy to get into the heart of Marrakesh - either an easy 20 minute walk or a 30 mad taxi ride. The half board menu was a little limited though (especially the deserts) and the main courses lacked the authentic taste of Moroccan spices. Breakfasts in the hotel were very good.

It was an oasis of comfort good food and delightful staff. Dinner on our first night was a group dinner around a large table and the food was excellent served by well trained staff. Lovely bar area with a singer/pianist. Our third and last evening at the hotel was free for us to enjoy the restaurant once more and we weren't disappointed. The food was of a very high standard both international dishes and Moroccan and as a non-meat eater I was very well taken care of with beautiful vegetables with goats cheese and a very flavourful fish tagine. We lingered in the bar and enjoyed the music.

Got there late both receptionists where smiling and friendly we went through the paperwork with minimal headache my friend didn't understand something which both receptionists sorted out. The room (121) was good clean everything worked alright. The breakfast is buffett with with wide variety of options again all staff friendly. Pool is small however it's adequate. At the back of the hotel is Es Saadi Palace which is more luxurious hotel with much bigger pool which you can't use however we had a wonder around no problem. The hotel also has a night club and casino at the rear which has free entry especially the club for residents.    The overall decor is a little tired however is more 4 star.    I didn't eat at the restaurant so can't comment.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,GMP41 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Hotel and Staff Very Good,Went to Marrakech for a wedding and stayed here for 5 nights. We were upgraded to a suite which was very nice with plenty of space (friends who hadn't been upgraded also said their rooms were spacious and comfortable). Yes you can hear some noise from the Casino in the early hours but not overly so and I would still recommend a pool view room. The pool was more than adequate with lots of sun beds and an attendant who would bring towels over as you sat down (and remove them from beds not being used). Poolside bar was great for drinks and snacks during the day as was the Piano bar at night. The Gastronomique Restaurant served lovely food and we ate there on two evenings. We didn't feel that food and drink prices were expensive for this type of hotel. Breakfast offered a great choice of hot and cold food. The grounds were well kept and you can stroll around from the Hotel to the Palace - where they have a (bigger) pool and choice of restaurants/bars - we were happy at the Hotel though. Didn't get chance to use the Spa but the prices looked reasonable. All staff were all helpful and attentive. We were approx. a 20 minute walk to the Medina which can be reached by walking through some pleasant gardens. Be aware though that if anyone offers friendly advice/directions when you are out and about they will expect to be tipped!,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMP41
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Rob B wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A great hotel with fantastic staff,"I stayed here for 3 nights while attending a friend's wedding it was recommended by my friend and it was easy to see why.    From the moment I arrived at the hotel the staff couldn't have been more friendly polite and helpful checking in was a breeze. Arriving in my room I found it was spacious clean modern and well decorated with all the normal mod cons. I had a room with a pool view and the view is definitely worth the tiny bit extra per night.    On the first night we ate in the hotel restaurant Gastronomique and I highly recommend it - the prices are reasonable and the foot is superb the fish tagine was sensational.    The hotel swimming pool is nice not huge but plenty large enough for a swim to cool down. There were plenty of loungers around the pool and finding some free was never an issue the pool attendant was always on hand with fresh towels as well.    The poolside bar/eatery was very good as well we had lunch there every day we were there and the food was delicious plus the service was excellent (a running theme at the hotel).    The hotel grounds are well kept and lovely to take a stroll through you've also got the casino and nightclub close at hand should you want some late night entertainment we didn't venture into either as we had other commitments but I'll definitely try them out next time I visit.    The breakfast was very pleasant a good range of fresh fruits well prepared and a number of different cakes all freshly baked and all delicious. There were hot options as well but I was very happy with the fruit and cakes.    Overall the hotel is excellent beautifully decorated spotlessly maintained and with everything you could possibly ask for entertainment wise. The location is less central than some but for me that was a good thing as it was very pleasant to escape the mania of the medina to the comparative tranquillity of Hivernage plus it was no more than 10 minutes from the airport by car. Walking to the medina took 20 to 30 minutes via the rather lovely Cyber Gardens although a taxi would take a few minutes and cost barely anything if you didn't fancy walking.    Special mention has to go to the staff who were without exception outstanding - polite friendly and oh so happy to help. The star of the show was the concierge who's favourite refrain was ""I'm at your service sir"" and he genuinely meant it - nothing was too much trouble anything we needed there he was with a big smile and an eagerness to help - if you read this Es Saadi hold onto him he's an absolute diamond.    I'll definitely return to Marrakech at some point to explore some more and I can safely say that this is where I'll be staying very impressed indeed - and very highly recommended.",Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Woking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Physic77

The staff were all amazing and nothing was ever too much. My girlfriend and I arrived a bit early and our room wasn't quite ready but we were sat down and brought some Mint Tea while we waited. After a short wait we were shown to our room which was great. We paid for a pool view room and I would recommend this especially as you get the evening sun should you wish to chill on the balcony before heading out for the night. Location wise about a 10 minute taxi from the airport and about 20 minutes walk to Jemaa el Fna and the Medina.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,bellamanning wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Lovely setting but beware of noise,"The hotel is in a very good location set in lovely walled gardens next to the Es Saadi Palace and various private villas within the gardens. Our room in the hotel was perfectly adequate although I must agree with another reviewer that the towels were hard and should be replaced with newer ones. We were on half board with a Saga group of 10 and we were all delighted with the food we received for the evening meals. There was a limited choice but everything we had was very good and nobody was ever left with ""nothing suitable"" to eat. The desserts trolley was excellent. Breakfasts were pretty standard and not a particularly good selection but again it was adequate and the freshly cooked eggs were nice.    The pool is crowded with sunbeds and is relatively small for a hotel that size especially in comparison to the Palace pool which is amazing. The hotel's own web page does show the hotel pool but many agent's web pages e.g. booking.com do not. They show only the magnificent Palace pool!    My main complaint was the noise at night. I had already seen from previous reviews that the pool view rooms also face the casino and nightclub and were therefore much noisier. We were lucky in that ours overlooked the road - with a limited view of another building. However on our second night there we were all rudely awakened at 5.30am by revving cars road racing around the block shouting as if in a riot horns and loud music blaring from the road which went on and on. Needless to say few of us could get back to sleep after that. Our guide said it may have been a wedding but I think it could have been revelers from the casino and night club. If you want a peaceful nights sleep especially at the weekend look elsewhere.    Also there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which would have been nice.",Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bellamanning

BUT the swimming pool is very small and the food at breakfast could and should have been better. The spa is way over priced and is definitely not worth the money. The food and drink is also very expensive. One of the beds had to be changed after one night as it was not to standard.

The Palase is 5 Star The Hotel is 3.3/4 at best and in need of a re fit but we feel this is reflected in the price which makes it very good value and a very satisfactory hotel to stay at and we would stay there again. The location is very good with an easy 15 minute walk to the square and souk's. If you want to spoil yourself there are some very nice restaurants bars and clubs near by. One tip the cafe across the road is very nice with great food at a very very reasonable price.

Be careful when you book as the information that appears on all booking websites is misleading. The info is still misleading when you get there as what receptionists say is still not clear at all. When you book for the hotel you are NOT allowed to even swim in the pool you saw in the pictures that actually belongs to what they call the Resort Palace. You are however allowed to walk in the gardens and envy people that swim in a 10 times bigger pool than the hotel's -which you will be told is the biggest in Marrakech-.  But in no way are you allowed to even dip your foot in it UNLESS you pay a minimum 50 Euros fee PER person PER day. After paying for this fee you are labelled with a bracelet saying in bold letters LIMITED ACCESS making you feel like a second class guest.  Waiters are polite and smiling but receptionists are average and well below 5 stars expected standards. Rooms are clean and spacious -for the hotel- but can be noisy if you got a neighbour coughing or flushing the toilets.  Food and spa treatments inside the hotel are ridiculously costly.  IN SHORT:  - can be noisy  - service not top  - expensive food and spa  - mislseading pictures and info the pool you see there is from the palace it is not yours!,Date of stay: September 2015,,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonPDubai
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,L1am29 wrote a review Sep 2015,30,"OK, but overshadowed by the Palace and not to be confused with!",If you are like me and always research your hotels by visiting their own website then do not get confused with the hotel's big brother - The Es Saadi Palace. The website only shows pictures of the amazing Palace and not the hotel. Easy to get confused with and likely to be very disappointed with if you expect what you see on the website. I figured this out a few weeks prior to arriving which was a shame as I would have happily paid the additional to stay at the palace.  However review of the hotel! - This hotel is fine but clearly overshadowed by the Palace. I expect that a few years ago this hotel would have been quite grand but it appears to have been stripped of its Moroccan Grandeur and all moved next door to the Palace! You would not think you were in Marrakech until you go next door. I kind of felt sorry for the hotel the staff were helpful but nothing really grabbed you with this place or stood out about it. Breakfast was fine but there was very little effort put into presentation. That said we had a Suite room on the top floor and it was twice the size of a normal and very nice. There were always a lot of staff around and clearly it was being maintained well but it was just tired and a bit 90s'ish!  Warning though - The Palace's nightclub appears to be the place for the cities rich to hang out at. It finishes at 4am and then the streets are filled with high powered cars revving their engines and street racing (by the sounds of it!). The hotel is directly opposite the nightclub and I barely got 3-4 hours sleep each night of my holiday.  To summarise - this hotel is fine and you can't really fault it in terms of bad things to say about it (Apart from the noise) but both the hotel and the palace are 5 Stars!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Amanda C wrote a review Sep 2015,30,A tale of two hotels,We visited the Es Saadi last week for a long weekend with friends. The grounds are shared between the Garden Resort (the original historic hotel - Keith Richards and Jagger stayed in the 60s) and the Palace. Guests can use the gym and restaurants in both however we found out on day 2 that guests staying in the Garden resort are not welcome in the Palace pools.    We raised this with the concierge given the blurb on the hotels say there are a number of pools at guests disposal to be told that the people staying at the Palace had paid a lot of money and it was only for them. If it was advertised as such then fair enough but it is not. I usually stay at the Sofitel a hotel also split in two but there is no segregation of guests in Sofitel. A poor attitude and very misleading Es Saadi.    Moaning over the hotel is pretty good. It does need refurb but given its in its late 60's it's in good shape. A little tired but still attractive.    The amenities are good. Nice bar and an excellent a la carte restaurant. Pool side service pretty good too though sometimes they forget you have ordered.    Staff in the restaurants are very pleasant and friendly. Reception is somewhat aloof though.    We had a good time but we will be going back to Sofitel in future. They have a much more agreeable attitude and do not have the audacity to separate guests by their perceived bank balance.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaK505

The main Resturant is high quality French cuisine steak flamb√© at the table my first choice and the poolside Resturant offers a wide choice with particularly good salads.

The decor of the hotel and our junior suite reminded me of an exotic Arabian palace with just a nod to days gone by when sumptuous and exotic interiors with exquisite attention to detail were possible. The atmosphere of the hotel and spa was gloriously relaxed and my husband and I were both able to unwind and fully re-charge. In short I thoroughly recommend a visit to this glorious hotel and look forward to visiting again very soon.,Date of stay: June 2015,,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kim1201234

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,seanpeter84 wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Good hotel in a good location,This is an overall good hotel in a great location.    We stayed in June 2015 the hotel is clean the staff are very good and helpful and the pool area is lovely.    We stayed half board and the food was above our expectations. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. Due to the hotel not being very busy we had a set menu to pick from every night we had about 3 choices for starter 5 for main course including vegiterian and a Moroccan dish and plenty of deserts to pick from. The service was also very good.    The room was always kept clean with clean towels sometimes being changed 2 times a day.    There was a few minor reasons why we didn't rate the hotel 5 out of 5. The main one being that there was no hot water available between 11am-16pm. It wasn't a major issue but did mean I had to shower by the pool if we had trips booked for the afternoon.    The hotel and Palace was not busy there was a handful of guests but we was not allowed to use the Palace pool. Not a major problem but didn't see why there was an issue especially when the hotel and palace was so quite.    We also felt that the hotel was slightly overpriced for lunch by the pool. An example was that cheese burger was 150 dirhams at the hotel pool bar but just at the end of the street there was a nice cafe selling the same cheese burger half the price for just 75 dirhams.    Would we stay again? Yes we would. It was overall a great holiday at a lovely hotel. The main square was within walking distance. The hotel has the potential to move up the trip advisor rankings towards the top if some very minor details are addressed above.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanpeter84

The staff were friendly and couldn't do enough to help the hotel was wonderfully located the facilities and restaurants were fabulous and we will most definitely be coming to stay again!    The staff were extremely efficient prior to arrival and responded promptly and kindly to all of my emails. They arranged Spa treatments for my partner and I at the times that suited us they also organised transfers on arrival at Marrakech airport to the hotel which was extremely comfortable and made the arrival seamless    We ate dinner in the hotel the first evening and the food and waiters were faultless and both the quality and variety of food was wonderful. Breakfast each day was great and lunch at the pool was also delicious.    We visited the Oriental spa whilst at the hotel and had Morrocan hamman and massages as a couple which was lovely and relaxing. The facilities were on our doorstep and could not fault them at all. My partner also visited the gym at the Es Saadi Palace each day and he said he had the gym to himself and it was great!    The team at the front desk were extremely helpful in coordinating taxis whilst we were there and also very accommodating in allowing a late check out for our evening flight nothing was ever too much trouble and their English was perfect.    Without a doubt we would stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone else planning a visit to Marrakech. .,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amy_v_Lewis

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,popsielady2013 wrote a review May 2015,40,Good hotel for the price,"From other reviews I was worried about what state and cleanliness the hotel would be in but on arrival we could see it was perfectly clean and serviceable. All rooms have minibar decent bathroom and balcony. The only difference between standard and superior rooms in this hotel is that standard are by the roadside and superior are poolside. My friends stayed in the roadside rooms and did not experience extra noise in the night and also had a view of the Atlas mountains so don't see the point in paying extra for the poolside rooms really. The Pool was good and hotel spa treatments were too with lots of availability and reasonably priced treatments. Plenty of selection at breakfast and they would also make omelettes and pancakes for you if requested. But what actually makes this hotel so good is its location. You can easily walk to the Medina from here probably the best nightclub ""Teatro"" is in the hotel grounds and it is also near to other great places to eat/go out such as Comptoir. This all avoids the extra cost and pain of haggling with taxi drivers. The only downside at the hotel was the attitude of some of the staff. They did not seem very happy to help most of the time and some were quite rude on occasion not what we were expecting. Someone should tell them a smile costs nothing and if they were expecting a tip that's not the way to get one. This is the only reason why I have given this hotel 4 stars and not 5. The WIFI availability here was excellent by the way often better than you'd get in the UK.",Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/popsielady2013
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,LinseyS25 wrote a review May 2015,50,Lovely hotel,We booked this hotel for our last night in Marrakech after returning from Essouaira before flying home. We fancied staying outside the medina and we got a really good price. I was really impressed with the hotel. People have said they think it's dated but I really don't agree. The only thing is the colour scheme in the bedroom was a peach shade which I usually associate with the 80s! However as about 99% of all buildings in Marrakech are that colour it seems totally appropriate colour scheme! We had a standard room which looked out over the pool and had a small balcony. The room was a really good size and was clean. There was a big selection of food at breakfast. The pool area was really nice and plenty of sun loungers with attentive staff bringing towels and moving the umbrellas when you need more shade. The only complaint I would say was the key to get into the room was very fiddly and you had to have a knack for getting it to work sometimes we did but other times we needed to get a member of staff to help us!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Aspire E wrote a review May 2015,50,A great experience!,I stayed here in the second week of May 2015 with 7 other friends (all male). I like to give as honest as a review as possible. We booked well in advance and paid approximately ¬£112 a night for a double pool view room. The rooms were a bit dated but so is the whole of Marrakech the room was clean and room service was as you would expect of a good standard. The rooms lacked an Iron (laundry service) and toothbrush etc. However I came prepared so this didn't really bother me. Rooms had a safe at no extra cost and a mini bar. I have to say the wireless in this hotel was excellent we had proper coverage inside rooms lobbies and outside in the pool and garden areas. This is a big plus point for me. The pool isn't as big as the one at the palace but was big enough for me. We were told we had access to everything in the palace except the outdoor pool but I didn't see anyone that would have stopped us. We had full access and wandered around the palace but preferred to stay at the hotel resort. This was mainly due to the excellent and welcoming service we received from the staff. Breakfast was good with a variety on offer the concierge chap (kamal) was a great laugh and very helpful night staff were friendly Omaima and her colleague at the pool bar were absolutely spot on and did an excellent job.    We visited the casino once I wasn't impressed (probably due to the smell of the carpet) the door man were not that great too. There is a nice sheesha bar next to the casino which was a nice place to chillax. Theotro was free entrance but not really my scene 555 was much better.    Overall I would stay at this hotel again we had no issues with billing or anything else.    thanks guys,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aspiree
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,33JohnMcC wrote a review May 2015,50,Quality Close to Major Sites,My partner and I stayed at the Es Saadi Gardens hotel in Marrakech for three nights on a half board basis as part of a group travelling through Morocco. The room and an en-suite bathroom were very clean and fairly spacious with a small balcony which had a view looking from the front of the hotel. The double bed was very large. The included safe was large enough to accommodate a large tablet. Dinner was served in a large dining room with waiter service. We had a large group of thirty so at times some of the food orders got a little mixed up but this appeared to be due to language problems rather than incompetence and it all remained good humoured. In Morocco a little knowledge of French is definitely an advantage. There was little to complain about regarding the quality of the food and this standard was maintained over the next two nights. Breakfast was buffet style in a separate dining area and this was also of a very good quality with plenty of variety. Service was swift regarding hot drinks to the table and tables were cleared swiftly. The Es Saadi has beautiful gardens to the rear pleasant to lounge in or have a post breakfast stroll. There is an outdoor pool and snack bar in the gardens that we made use of during our stay. There was plenty of beds and pool umbrellas and when needed assistance from the pool staff. It is a twenty minute walk on the flat from the hotel to Djemaa el Fna and you can pass the Koutoubia Mosque on the way. Sure you have a couple of fairly busy roads to cross on the way but we managed to do this at night without difficulty. If you need a hotel with good facilities close to Marrakech‚Äôs major sites the Es Saadi could fit the bill.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33JohnMcC

We also had a small secluded patio from which you have easy access to the pool restaurant and front desk.    Everything seemed to work but for the remote for the TV. There are very colorful bath robes that match the towels and a large closet.    Breakfast was adequate. Morocco has great bread but their selection fell short more than making up for it was the very good variety of Moroccan dates figs apricots and other fruits.    The pool was very nice with plenty of chairs and umbrellas; the staff was attentive.    There is a casino and theater on site. It is like being in an oasis.

Nice to get away from the hussle of the Medina and the gardens here are lovely and tranquil. Rooms are a little dated but are a good size and the rooms facing the pool have a great view over the mountains. The pool area itself was great and the pool was heated so able to swim. There was also a pool bar and outside eating area which served huge salads at a reasonable price just a shame that service was a bit slow as the waiters seemed more interested in some of the older wealthier customers who would probably tip more!    The buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of choice but didn't eat in the main restaurant at night as too expensive. There isn't a lot to do in the surrounding area but did find a really nice restaurant a few mins walk away called Del Cafe.    There was also some noise early in the mornings as people came out of the next door casino and nightclub but all in all a reasonably priced option outside the old town.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Quorn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenw354

However upon check-out we had a very difficult experience. We originally booked through Expedia and paid in advance of our arrival. Upon checking in we were informed that we would be charge a nightly fee per person per night (which was absolutely no problem since this was included in our documentation when we booked our stay). We signed our contract and proceeded to our room. Upon checking in out we were informed that we would be charged additional fees. After reviewing our Expedia documents and the final bill form the hotel the charges didn't line up so we explained this to the receptionist. She stated that even though we weren't informed of them we would still have to pay them. We were confounded because we just didn't understand where they were coming from. We asked to speak to the manager who came over and actually yelled in my face. This was very unnerving exacerbated an already confusing situation. The manager told us that our problem was with Expedia and not with his hotel and then proceeded to threaten us. We also asked the receptionist if we could see the contract we had signed the night we checked-in and she refused telling us it was ""confidential"". The manager told us that if we did not pay the additional charges he would keep our luggage call the police on us and threaten to deduct the charges from the receptionist's paycheck! He also told us that he would hold us so long at the check-out counter that we'd miss our train. I've never had an experience like this anywhere in the world.

We had a junior suite facing the pool as we had been reading reviews which said the rooms facing the road were noisy. Unfortunately the pool rooms face the casino and we were wakened at 4 or 5 every morning with shouting and car horns as people left the casino. We ate in the hotel quite often both in the bar and in the restaurant and again the food was lovely. The hotel booked us a couple of tours and they were really good Atlas mountains/ 3 valleys and the palaces (you just say where you want to go and the guide will take you.) Word of warning crossing the roads near the main square is like a leap of faith! The pool was heated you could see the steam rising off it first thing in the morning and I watched from our balcony before going down to breakfast and watched them cleaning the pool and poolside every morning. Very clean. We both agreed we would go back and that it was the most relaxing holiday we'd had for years. It was only spoiled by the fact that when we got home we discovered that my husband had left his music player behind. We called the hotel and were put through to housekeeping who confirmed that they had it and we have been trying to arrange its return since then. We have sent 3 emails spoken with reception and concierge several times but still no further forward after 10 days. Shame the after service is not as good as the service you get when you are there. That said my husband should have been more careful and we would still go back. I'd take ear plugs for the mornings though to get a full nights sleep.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,dilly476 wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Fantastic Hotel,We spent 3 nights at the Es Saadi and absolutely loved our stay. The room was spacious and well equipped with a small balcony looking out at the mountains. Our top floor room was on the road side and we did suffer from disturbed sleep due to all the traffic noise so if I was to visit again I would definitely make a point of requesting a pool side room. The bathroom was large had plenty of hot water and various complimentary toiletries although there were not enough towels for the number of people in the room. We asked for more towels which were promptly brought up to the room for us. There was a safe in the room and a mini bar which was well stocked (and not too pricey in comparison to other hotel mini bars). Wifi was available in the room. There was a cash machine in the lobby (bearing in mind that all currency must be obtained locally). On our last night the roof leaked during a particularly bad rainstorm and flooded the bathroom. This didn't cause too much problem for us as we were due to leave the room that morning anyway but upon advising the staff they were very quick to act and came straight up to the room with towels to mop up the water.    We had breakfast at the hotel each morning and were very pleased with the amount and variety of food available mostly continental style. We never had a problem finding a table.    The communal areas of the hotel were smart and well presented. The layout of the facilities was far more compact than I had expected so it was easy to get from the room to the pool or the spa or the restaurants/bars. The spa was wonderful and well worth a visit. We booked various treatments we didn't need to book prior to leaving the UK just popped in on arrival and made reservations for later during our stay. The treatments were excellent value for money and there were lots of nice little touches in the spa that made in feel more special. I couldn't recommend the spa highly enough. The swimming pool was nice if a little cold and there was a nice walk through the grounds over to the Palace section of the resort. The Palace is worth a visit to have a look at how the over half live! We booked an afternoon tea there which was reasonably priced and allowed us to sit in the sumptuous surroundings listening to live mandolin music.    The hotel was only a few minutes by taxi from the airport (costing approximately 100 dirhams including tip) and a short walk to the Medina. There were a few restaurants nearby but we found the restaurants on the Medina better value for money and had a more authentic feel. The bus stop for the hop on/hop off bus was just round the corner from the main entrance as were the horse and carriages.    In conclusion I would highly recommend a stay at the Es Saadi Hotel. It has quite an international chain feel to it but the staff couldn't have been more welcoming the facilities were excellent and the few minor hiccups we encountered were dealt with very promptly and efficiently so as not to affect our stay in any way. For the price we paid the quality of accommodation and service received was exceptional.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dilly476

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Lizzie__C wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Relaxing stay in well appointed property,We got a very good value package with Easyjet Holidays and didn't regret our choice. Because the hotel was under occupied (I presume) we even got a room upgrade to one that faced the pool - lovely and tranquil.    The room was reasonably large and had a balcony so was fine for 'just hanging out'. The balcony was also a sun-trap so even though the temperature wasn't that high you could sunbathe there. We were actually glad to be outside the Medina area because from what others have told us there is a lot more space in hotels outside. It was reasonably near to the centre and we often walked in and out even though taxis weren't particularly expensive.    Breakfast was really great. Lovely fresh bread and they always had a different local speciality available each morning so that it rose above the generic. The green tea was also a cut above most served in the town.    The downside of being in this quite expensive area of town was that there were very few reasonably priced dining options near at hand. The one place that is reasonable was called Extrablatt which served mainly Italian food sandwiches and snacks at a regular price. The hotel food was very nice (some things allegedly organic from their own farm) but very dear. Fine for a couple of meals but it would have been nice if there had been more available nearby and we wouldn't have had to travel so far for a meal every time.    We didn't always really always get meals right. We didn't want to go with touts but sometimes spent hours trying to find places we'd seen on tripadvisor only to realise they had been mapped incorrectly (usually on google maps). It's so easy to get lost in the medina a strong recommendation is to use a smartphone with data off and download the special tripadvisor Marrakech app to use just with GPS. That got us out of trouble a number of times. Of course it's always fun to get lost sometimes and go with the flow but the touting does make it useful to have at least a nominal destination.    Oh and finally the hotel were very nice when I was ill on the last night. They made lots of sweet suggestions for remedies and looked after my husband at breakfast the next day - bringing him pastries and asking after me. That was very nice and that personal touch is really what makes a pleasant and memorable stay.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizzie__C

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Rod W wrote a review Jan 2015,40,A week in January,We stayed from Jan 13th-20th in the hotel set in extensive grounds containing also a casino a 'palace' hotel & luxury villas. The hotel - lounge areas bar and restaurants - was very comfortable and all service excellent. Our bedroom had a balcony. Most bedrooms do. We stayed half-board and evening meals (in a restaurant overlooking the pool) were set menu which always included a Moroccan dish such as a tajine. A good buffet breakfast was served in a room overlooking the grounds down a few steps from the bar. We did not ourselves use the swimming pool or spa adjoining but on the couple of fine days we had people were sunning themselves on loungers. It is an easy 20 min walk to the Medina (old town) although taxis are cheap providing you negotiate the fare before getting in.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Abergavenny, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodw326
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Aisha P wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Brilliant stay .... But beware...,ENGLISH - KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU.    From start to finish of our stay our stay at Es-Saadi was one of great relaxation. Rooms were spacious buffet breakfasts were amazing the pool and pool-side were very relaxing. The staff were extremely friendly and always willing to go the extra mile. Cleaning services were great and often we'd find flowers or chocolates left when we came back up to our room! :)    The location of the hotel is great not too far so the main square Djema-Al-Fna is within walking distance as is the Al-Koutoubia mosque but not too close that the hubbub of the market and souks can be heard from the rooms. Overall our stay in Marrakech was spectacular!    Our problem occured 30 minutes AFTER we left the hotel.    We had been waved 'Goodbye' by the concierge and all other staff at the reception foyer at the time (and our bags even put into our transport vehicle by hotel staff) where 30 minutes later my family back home in England recieved a call asking to speak to us. Obviously with us only having reached the Marrakech hotel at the time we were unable to take the call.    The following day we again recieved a call from someone claiming to be the concierge who was demanding to speak to us regarding a 'room tax' we had yet to pay. Being very wary of this I was sceptical of paying this. My father had agreed to call them back once I was available to further discuss a method of payment.    A few hours later I called up the hotel (using the number I was given) and was told by three different people that I was not required to pay any amount.    I then recieved a call again from someone claiming to be the concierge asking to discuss to payment methods with her. I related the prior conversation to her to which she became very aggrevated and used religion to try and blackmail the money out of me.    Having spoken to the booking company I was advised NOT TO PAY ANY AMOUNT.    Overall the stay at the hotel was brilliant a real relaxing place to take a holiday but beware of any phone calls from the concierge asking for money. DO NOT PAY ANY AMOUNT EXTRA.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gloucester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aishap2015

If you are interested in Casinos and Nightclubs you can go to the palace side of the hotel.    The main square is just 15 to 20 mints walk from the hotel. and its a very pleasant experience. The front desk arranged us a one day trip to Atlas mountains and it was worth a visit even if our driver didn't speak English.

The staff were very helpful and friendly in a professional way.  The food was delicious but make sure you ask for the half board menu as the waiters gave us la carte meals without asking what board we were on.  The room facilities were good and clean every morning with fresh flowers. The view from bedroom window of the city was pleasant and exciting with plenty of palm trees.  The hotel is only 4 minutes to the main square by taxi and Kurtobia Mosque. If you decide to walk it will take you 10 minutes.  The small taxis will charge 20 dirhams and the large 50 dirhams.  The views of the Atlas mountains can be seen all around Marrakech and definitely worth taking the excursion to the Atlas Mountains.    The pool was clean and the lounge areas were spotless. The main buffet breakfast was tasty and plenty of variety. This hotel does not have buffet for dinner or evening meals and people tend to go to jeme el fina square to experience the moroccan food stalls and night life.    We could also use facilities at the Es Saadi Palace which were awesome very Grand.    I will definitely book this deal again!

The hotel is really close to the hustle and bustle of the old medina and also the main square but offers tranquility and serenity at the end of the day. The hotel is really good and the pool is really lovely for a quick dip after a long day exploring or to lounge around all day as a lot of families seemed to do comfortable loungers and beach towels put out on a chair of your choosing. (ignore other reviews the pool is fantastic large and ornamental the pool they are referring to is the pool at the sister Palace hotel which obviously you can't use as you're not staying there) The gardens of the hotel are truly magical this hotel is a slick operation with beautifully manicured gardens a great pool and all round good service the rooms are a tad dated but immaculately clean and well serviced.The bar is nicely decorated and offers a vast array of drinks and bar snacks. The breakfasts are incredible and the manager of the breakfast service is truly exceptionally helpful and friendly a real professional. The hotel also boasts a spa which I enjoyed but was not too happy to be charged ¬£20 for a 5 minute sauna which I was asked to use as I was early for my appointment but other than that the spa is also good (don't go for the harram body scrub if you're at all modest though). The hotel is happy to organise tours and excursions and really nothing is too much trouble. The hotel is in a great location and has a number of good restaurants around. If you're staying here would recommend a pool view because Marrakech is truly the city that never sleeps and they are more peaceful.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,jplondon2014 wrote a review Dec 2014,20,Such a disappointment,Don't be fooled a stay at the Es Saadi Hotel isn't everything you would expect it to be...very soon you are made to feel like second class citizens! While the brochure for the Es Saadi Gardens and Resort gives the impression of a paradise resort in the heart of the city of Marakech the reality is somewhat different. What nobody tells you is that the sumptuous Palace pool and surrounds is 'off limits' to hotel guests; you only find this out when you go to use the facilities and you are literally turned away and refused towels. But of course they will happily take your money in the surrounding bars and restaurants! Bolshy argumentative reception staff seem to derive smug pleasure from telling you it's hotel policy! While other aspects of the hotel have been good (breakfasts in particular and the servicing of our rooms) the way the hotel handled the situation regarding pool access was appalling customer service at it's worst. In contrast the service and food we received last night at La Maison Arabe in the heart of Marakech was exquisite and amongst the best we've seen on our world travels.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jplondon2014

The staff at the reception are very nice and helpful. While staying there all our needs were catered with a smile. The Hotel management has done a great job of keeping The Morrocan sense of hospitality. Every detail in service has been thought through.    The Hotel facilities have been around for quite some time which can be felt in some details; however it has been been very well maintained. Examples of some details that can be improved are the room doors still use traditional metallic bulky keys which can get jammed. The bath tub does not have curtains making it hard not to flood the bathroom while taking a shower. Nonetheless the service is so fantastic that when I informed the front desk that I flooded the bathroom while showering they immediately sent someone to mop it.    Finally Hotel guests have access to the Palace amenities next door which are absolutely stunning (for the price of the Hotel room). I used the Palace's Gym which is very well equipped with TechnoGym machines and free weights (I just wish they had Wifi in the Gym). I also jogged in the lavish gardens of the Palace and visited the common areas which made me feel like I was in a Museum.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,JPA38210 wrote a review Dec 2014,50,THREE WEEKS OF BLISS,This was my 30th visit to Marrakech. I first went in March 1983 and first dined at this hotel in the mid-1980s. and first stayed here in 1993. Over the years it has become 'an old friend'. I saw all the surrounding hotels built as well as its sister hotel 'The Palace'. In recent years there have been considerable improvements at the Es Saadi and I have no hesitation in recommending it. The breakfast area was refurbished in 2014 and there is a very good terrace for breakfasting outside as well as a good area inside. The choice and quality of the food is excellent and the eggs are freshly cooked to order. There is a good gym at the nearby Palace hotel and the pool is excellent. By choice I always eat out in the evening but there is a restaurant though I feel it lacks atmosphere. In the past noise has been a problem from 'Theatre O' the hotel's nightclub as well as those in what was once a quiet residential area. However during my three weeks I was only woken once momentarily and I can only presume that this was by an external noise. The WiFi connection is free and generally works work well - when there was a problem it was soon fixed. I enjoyed my three week chill here - much needed after writing a standard work that has 562 pages containing a third of a million words and 538 images. It weighed 4-kilos when it came off the press. I took a volume to gloat at while I was there. Art lovers MUST visit the superb collection of Moroccan art at the Palace Es Saadi's sister hotel.

There is another hotel right next door with a similar name - Es Saadi Palace and Villas - with an even nicer pool with swim-up bar and a casino connected. This is five-star hotel - one star up on the Es Saadi Gardens & Resort. You can walk the grounds of this other hotel and admire the pool but you can't swim there or use any of the facilities except the casino. I think some people have been confused when booking and think they are staying at the five-star resort and end up a little disappointed when they find out they are not. The Es Saadi Gardens & Resort is still very pleasant although staff are not particularly friendly especially the front desk staff who seemed irritated by any questions or requests. Nevertheless this is definitely a place where you can relax and enjoy sitting by the pool in the sunshine surrounded by beautiful palms. But if ever I go to Marrakech again I would want to stay next door at the five-star Es Saadi Palace and Villas.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swhysall
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Clinton T wrote a review Nov 2014,20,Don't confuse with the palace next door,I don't normally bother giving poor feedback but I feel I must in this case.  We booked this hotel as it looked a good deal and the reason was this is not a five star on uk standards by far.  This hotel is set in the grounds of The Es Saadi palace which I can say would be a five star as far as I can see but don't confuse the two as they are chalk and cheese but as both are on the same website its so difficult to tell apart until you arrive that is.  I am still waiting for a response from the manager regarding a number of issues we had during our week stay recently and he did not respond before we checked out  very disappointing to say the least.  Probably not helped by the reception giving me the wrong departments email address  All I can say is in my experience you pay for what get -cheaper hotel cheaper feeling experience  We stayed half board while the food was edible we could only look on as we had a different menu in the evening and was greatly limited to what was on offer otherwise on the standard menu.  Don't be late for breakfast as things start disappearing back into the kitchen or just run out well before 10.30.  One good thing I can say is the wifi was free.  But as a non smoker I was was hugely disappointed as smoking was allowed in most areas and the lounge area became particularly fog bound which unfortunately seemed waft into our room above.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Quid wrote a review Nov 2014,10,Avoid this hotel,If you are looking for a 5* hotel don t choose that one.  Nice garden and inside but it does not worth that price. Furthermore staff at reception check in is not customer oriented. Especially the one who was on duty on the night of monday. Even if you place a guarantee for the rooms they ask you to pay directly for the extra's. I never experience this in a 5*.  Staff is not friendly at all in the front desk. Except for the concierge.  Make sure if they as you for the guarantee of the room that they put the exact amount. And they do unblock it during your check out.  Don t choose this hotel marrakech if you don t want to be disappointed.  Try to avoid the gentlemen called omar at the reception in the evening or keep record of his comments.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,wildwadi1 wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Es Saadi is... Amazing!,Es Saadi is... Amazing! One word to describe my experience at the Es Saadi Gardens & Resort - Hotel  I stayed here for 5 nights in November 2014 with a total of 5 friends  Bareing in mind we are in our mid 20s we really enjoyed our stay!    Everyone was made welcome from senior management to waiting staff!  Helpful and very friendly staff all round everything was neatly made  Always happy to help any question / query we had!  Staff spoke clear English and are also bi-lingual in Arabic and French!    Hotel D√©cor (In my opinion) was NOT dated despite other people saying so! It was quite eloquent  Room D√©cor (In my opinion) was NOT dated either! Just has a warm theme to it which I liked!    Breakfast was very tasty with a good amount of choice to fill you up! from 7:30am to 10:30am  Swimming pool was very clean and staff were very prompt on giving swimming towels    Adequate amount of lights and table lamps so no worries about room lighting  Bathrooms were clean and had a nice marble theme to it which I liked! Although we had an on-suite there were no locks but frosted sliding glass for the washroom so bare this in mind not a problem if you have children  Mirrors on all cabinets which was really nice getting ready TV with clear channels  Nice and peaceful corridors so no worries about any noises in the day/night  Balcony had a very nice view we got the city view which wasn‚Äôt so bad!    Room service = Very good staff were always greeting with a smile and no issues with personal items being moved/lost  Airport transfer were very prompt and very up to date we got picked up and dropped with a Mercedes 8 seater with electric sliding doors and enough room for all our luggage in the boot  GREAT wi-fi speeds in both our rooms speedtest app showed results of 35mpbs at one point and averaging at 5-10mb with 5mb upload speed which was very IMPRESSIVE! (non-peak and peak times respectively)    Hotel and Casino have a currency exchange with good rates and open till late  Breathtaking Garden Scenery for you to take in one of the biggest / nicest in the city!    Location wise = Good.. situated close to Madina / Guilez  Can easily walk to the heart of Old Madina City within 10-15 minutes  Can easily take a taxi to Guilez area within 10 minutes  Plenty of taxis around the area so good to ask for a few quotes before  We managed 5 persons in a S class grande taxi for 50 dirhams which is the documented min. amount    Taxi tip 1 : Any more ask for a better price or someone else will easily offer you... we paid 8 at first not knowing the going rate  S classes are known to be shared taxis however this did not matter as we had 5 persons which made it full so averaging 10 dirhams per person  Also can be seen to be old but honestly they are solid cars! Which is still not bad for the price not bad... still cheaper than the London bus!    Taxi tip 2: If you are in a small group then get a petite taxi these are great for going around city  We paid 20-30 dirhams for the same journey as the S class but because we had more people we would have needed two which is only 10 dirhams more not bad... still cheaper than the London bus!    My rating? 5 star (having used the AA hotel standard guide it is closer to 5 than 4)    Will I recommend friends/family? Yes!  Will I come back? Yes for sure!,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildwadi1

Everywhere was very clean and in good order. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. For those that like to swim there was an excellent pool with lots of loungers and a poolside restaurant and bar.The best thing for me were the gardens all 20 acres of them. There were many varieties of trees shrubs cacti and flowers with winding paths throughout the garden. There was an amazing wealth of bird life in the garden with lots of Common Bulbuls singing beautifully. Large flocks of Starlings and House Sparrows came in to roost each evening. Our room looked out over the garden and we could sit out on the small balcony to take it all in. The room was excellent and well cleaned daily.

Service was just okay though.  Rooms were very clean but towels taken away after the first day then not replaced - on second day we got lovely swan shapes made from the towels. Just not too consistent. Could have been a minor error.  Restaurant food was really good. Again the service let it down however. We had to wait a long time for the waiter to bring drinks and the food arrived in stages.  The Palace - a few minutes away looked more luxurious and the pool was very good. All can be used if staying at the hotel. I'd stay there again despite slow service.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Manon V wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Great days in Marrakech !,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel a few days ago for 5 days. It was a very good experience : the room was big and despite not having a pool view we had a nice view in front of gardens and another beautiful hotel.    The room is cleaned every day the bed is huge and comfortable (despite the pillows being too hard) the air conditioning was working just fine (we did not use it much as it was in October). There was plenty of room for the suitcase multiple chest of drawers and wardrobes big mirrors as well as in the bathroom where there was a bathtub which can be used as a shower. I personally love taking a bath in holidays even in such hot countries so I did not mind not having a proper shower as would some ""purists"". Only one ""bad point"" : the wifi is excellent in the reception but almost never working in the rooms or around the swimming pool.    We were not in an all inclusive offer we just had the buffet breakfast included which was really good and diversified : eggs omelettes merguez cheese ham and bacon for those - like me - who love salty food in the morning. But also fruit marmelade compotes crepes chocolate brownies Moroccan pastries etc... In addition fresh fruit juice and coffee tea or Moroccan mint tea are served by the staff at your table !    Concerning the hotel in itself I have to admit the pool is little but as there was not many people in October it was fine. The staff also put the towel for you on the seat you want to be which is always nice. The gardens of the hotel are quite big and beautiful with all the villas in it.There is also a gastronomic restaurant which we did not try (and other ones) but we tried the restaurant-snack next to the pool. Too bad it closes at 5ish pm and it is a bit expensive (5-6‚Ç¨ for a milkshake or smoothie between 9 and 12‚Ç¨ for a sandwich or panini...). The room service however is nice. Prices are between 9 and 30‚Ç¨ but are hot fast and served in big portions.    The casino Es Saadi of the Palace hotel is fine too. There are a lot of slot machines and too few poker or black jack tables. However we were there when it hosted the WPT and it was quite an event with special rooms diners parties (in the big night club the Theatro) !    In overall it was a really nice stay. Everything was clean and pleasant and the staff was always available for any questions at any time. They even helped us get taxis and told us the right prices so that we would not pay twice the price ! In addition the hotel is in the Hivernage near the Medina Majorelle gardens the Menara the souks the place Jamaa El-Fnaa and only 10 minutes away by car from the airport (which will only cost you 7‚Ç¨ to get to)... You can visit Marrakech without taking a taxi or a bus.

The rooms are are decent sized and very clean. The staff were pleasant and the hotel quiet. The air conditioning is marginal during the day and thank goodness it has only been in the 70's (under 25 deg C). You have no temperature controls in the room.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Lizzie Sabin wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Having a truly wonderful time,We are currently staying in the hotel and are having a truly wonderful time. There are some bad reviews on here which I find really surprising. We arrived early in the day but were allowed to go into our room straight away. All our luggage was taken up for us and we were then brought fresh flowers fruit bottled water and some local snacks. The service has continued to be impeccable for the two days we have been here. The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are lovely. Last night we wanted to go out to a restaurant which had been recommended to us. The hotel phoned to make a booking for us and we had the best seat in the house. They also sorted out a taxi for us to get there. In addition they're really helpful with maps directions and advice.    The rooms have been described as dated but we think our room is lovely. We have a little balcony and everything is fresh and clean. Every day the beds are made for us and new towels and shampoos provided. What else could we want? We also love the big yellow dressing gowns and slippers!    We have been to the spa which was amazing. There's nothing quite like a professional massage to help relax.    Breakfast is delicious. There is a huge range to choose from and you can go back as many times as you want. In addition you can request pancakes and eggs to be cooked right in front of you however you want them.    The one thing I would say is that when we booked we were shown a picture of the palace swimming pool and not the hotel swimming pool. The is not the fault of the hotel and rather that of the travel agent. But do just keep in mind that there are two pools and the one you're allowed in depends on which half of the hotel you're in.    We're having a wonderful time here and would recommend that our friends and family come and stay. If we come back to Morocco I will definitely book into Es Saadi Hotel. Thank you!

Our room was cleaned every day however one day we did not receive any clean towels. There was a ATM in the hotel however this was not in service for the entire week I was there which was disappointing. The food in the restaurant was average. I found the menu quite limited at times. There was a lot of cats around the hotel and as I am not a lover of cats I found the experience of eating at the restaurant stressful. The cats ran underneath the tables and I found this unbearable. I found the hotel to be quite expensive for drinks but the added touch of olives and cheese etc as an accompaniment to our drinks was a nice touch.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Julie B wrote a review Jul 2014,10,Terrible hotel with terrible employees!,We stayed at this hotel for one week from the 26th of June until the 3rd of July. I really need to share my experience as this hotel does not deserve more than 2 stars and if you are looking for a relaxing holiday- this is not a place for you:    Let me start with the details :    - we waited for more than 90 minutes at the airport for other passengers who never arrived before getting transferred to the hotel.  - once at the hotel I kindly asked for a glass of water and the lady at the reception told me that if I wanted water I needed to go to the bar and purchase a glass... what a welcome.  - we were allocated a terrible room with view on the street- smelt disgusting so I asked the receptionist for another room considering the hotel was almost empty. She told me we would need to pay extra for a room with a pool view- she ended up giving it to us after much negotiation. Please note the room was as bad (carpet weird smell very old furniture) it's just the view that was different. So far though... all okay.  - there are cats around the pool (around 7 when we arrived). This is not okay but what's even more unacceptable is that they come into the dining room at night. They apparently did try to take them away unsuccessfully.  - Every morning starting 7 am there's so much noise coming from the corridors. People slamming doors staff arguing.  - On the Sunday night a couple was arguing for hours in the room next door and at some point they started being violent towards each other which is when my sister called up security. After 20 minutes of arguing and noise they separated the couple. No apology was given to us who had to bear all the verbal and physical violence for hours.  - the last day was the most interesting : as we were packing and checking under the bed we had not forgotten anything we found cold cigarettes under the bed at which point I completely lost my patience. I went to the reception with the pictures (which you can find attached to this review) and asked to speak to Mister Raik Bouhmouch who is the Hotel director as nobody was taking us seriously. He was only coming back the next day at 9 am and we were leaving at 5 am for our flight home which made it impossible for us to speak to anybody. I then spoke to the restaurant staff who said -and I quote - 'We can't let the manager know about this we need to sort this out amongst ourselves'. Then everybody started speaking in Arabic. The F&B manager came to speak to us and looked shocked when we showed him the pictures. He then tried to explain the situation and offered us a tea as a compensation (!). I asked for Mister Bouhmouch's details and I was then told there was no point in contacting him as he is on holiday until the 1st of August and that he doesn't check his emails- big lie obviously since he is responding to the reviews on Trip Advisor.  The drama continues ... as I went to pay my bill (only drinks since we paid for everything else upfront) I asked the F&B manager for a commercial gesture (the bill was around ¬£50) at which point he started shouting at us saying that we were the ones who put the cold cigarettes under the bed- the fact that somebody could even think of doing this purposely is beyond my understanding. We were shouted at in front of everybody insulted and all the staff started speaking in Arabic so we could obviously not understand what they were saying. As we went back into our room the mess under the bed was cleaned even though I specifically asked not to remove it as I wanted to show it to the director and/or the duty manager (who coincidentally turned out to be sick that night as well!). We obviously did not sleep at all and the next morning cherry on the cake as we check out the guys at reception tell me 'Oh you're the people who were creating drama last night'. My sister literally cried in the arms of the Thomas Cook person who came to pick us up.    Please note that we gave all our pain-killers to those same people when they started Ramadan- which to be fair is something staff should never asked clients for but we are nice people and kindly gave our medicines to them.    I must say I have stayed in many hotels thanks to my job. I have been in the best hotels in the world but I have also stayed in some very humble places. However never have I been treated this way. A few members of staff are so arrogant rude and lack simple manners. It's a pity because that takes the shine away from some of the staff who are great!    These holidays were so stressful and we never want to talk about them. I am of course following this up with the company that sold us the trip.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebE9706BL

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Bevie21 wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Long weekend in Marrakech,After less than 10 mins by taxi from the airport a group of four of us arrived at around 10.30am on the Friday morning and although we hadn't stayed the night before the staff were happy for us to take advantage of the full cooked breakfast whilst we waited for check-in (we weren't charged for this). After check-in the hotel provided maps of the city and information on how to get around. Staff were professional courteous accommodating and provided a high level of service. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms were clean and we got the pool view we asked for (pool view recommended) the decor was authentic and well maintained though a little dated. All rooms have AC which is essential!    The pool was clean and well maintained and pool staff and waiters were always on hand to see to your every need and the Spa just by the pool was such a treat (full body massage was heaven).    Having the Es Saadi Palace next door meant that we could visit the on site art gallery and have dinner in the sumptuous restaurant. It was Ramadan when we were there which meant both hotels were lovely and quiet but some services weren't available and some shops closed until late afternoon/early evening and whilst this didn't really affect our trip I did feel for the staff who were serving us food when they weren't allowed to eat it. The Casino was open but hours were restricted.    There are 4 boutique shops on site if you forget anything you can usually pick it up there or ask the hotel.    We got a really good bed and breakfast deal on double rooms with twin beds which was made even better as we split the cost of the 2 rooms between us.    I would heartily recommend the hotel and would definitely stay there again. We were there for just two nights but that didn't stop us having a wonderful memorable time.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bevie21
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,GoCrows123 wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Great public and pool areas.,Stayed three night for a work visit. The public areas are really nice. The pool bar shuts at about 5 or 6pm which made for a quiet beautiful pool area in evening allowing me to sleep with windows open (on third floor) during nice weather in April. The view from room over pool toward Casino and faint outline of Atlas mountains beyond was lovely. Dinner in the French Gastronomie restaurant was delicious. Buffet breakfast was nice (nothing over the top) and overall service was perfect. If something could be improved it would be that the rooms are a little dated (they are not bad; just a bit dated) and the shower/bath with moving glass panel feels a little awkward/insecure.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Houston, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoCrows123
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Richard L wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Great hotel away from the hubbub,"This is a very nice hotel with a lovely pool. Plenty of choice for breakfast. The food in the hotel restaurant was very acceptable without being outstanding. The staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a good location within walking distance of Place Jemma El Fna. The room was attractive and very clean with a nice balcony. They even brought out a birthday cake to celebrate my wife's 70th and we had ""Happy Birthday"" sung in English French and Berber! Wonderful.  If you want to stay in the old heart of Marrakech in amongst the throng and noise stay in a Riad within the wall.

The hotel is very nice but it does not deserve its 5-star rating. There was a very noisy animation that weekend I stayed around the pool with music way too loud. Hopefully the hotel allowed guest to use the pool in the Palace area which was way more quiet. But overall I haven't felt I got the value I paid for.    They offer breakfast buffet with a mix of Moroccan and Western options so for those of you not willing to try you'll be able to eat ""like at home"". Haven't had lunch and dinner so I can't comment but it isn't cheap so you may want to go out and take advantage of the many dinning options.

Staff are more than helpful rooms are great breakfast is fab & it's fantastic value for money.  Although it's seems the majority of guests are French we don't feel out of place & every staff member I have met has spoken English.  It's a great base away from the hustle & bustle of the old town yet close enough to get there easily enough.  Breakfast is great huge selection.  It's not the cheapest for food & drink but still less than you pay in uk at a hotel.  Pool is lovely & there is no fight for a lounger.  Although the casino & nightclub is a stone throw away we have not once heard Noise from there in the evening.  Overall very pleased and would come back again.

The weather was perfect without mosquitoes. All the meals were good and breakfast had a large display hot and cold to choose from. Sitting outside poolside for our dinner was delightful. No loud music. Mainly French speaking guests some with children who were well behaved. The hotel is favourably located with good access to outside attractions in the area.

I spent 3 nights here and I never thought I would be so happy to go home. The service is terrible staff do not care and make you feel like they are giving you a favour no matter what you ask for. The hotel is part of a resort which I was told I could have access to any facilities but surprise when we got here we tried to go to the biggest swimming pool (the one on all the pictures on the net) but we were refused the access. Apparently you have to stay in the ""palace side"" to be good enough to swim in it.. When checking in the hotel i had been given a map with all hotel favilities but never had been told that I would not be welcome in some of them.  Service wise if you dont mind asking 3/4 time for water  salt & pepper etc... This place is for you.  Food just average.  Last day non of the satf was suprised that myself and 30 other guests were towell less by the swimming pool and I had to make a fuss for someone realising that maybe their towel guy didnt show and maybe they needed to take care of us.

Me and my wife just came back from 5 days in the hotel and I couldn't fault anything. Breakfast was served until 1030 we would usually head down around 10am and never had any issues.    The hotel is in Hivernage which is a quiet yet upperclass area. Its nice to come back to this hotel and location after the hustle and bustle of the medina. It's still central and the Medina is either a 30 dirham or 20 min walk away. Hivernage itself has quite a few restaurants bars and cafes.    The hotel rooms are nice and spacious the swimming pools are great it has a very good gym as well as sports bar and restaurant. It also has a cash point money exchange and the Saadi Palace and casino are next door as well if you are into that. Even if you dont like gambling it is entertaining and a good spot for some people watching. The customer service was really good as well never got any complaints when we asked for things and staff were generally nice and polite.

The resort connected with the casino give a full variety of activities for the guests. The location of the hotel is relatively convenient in visiting other major sites. The top of the roof sign with the name of the hotel gives a easy landmark to return back. Hence I shall give this hotel the best in location.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,JPA38210 wrote a review Apr 2014,40,RETURN TO AN OLD HAUNT,I had not been to Marrakech for six years. I was a regular visitor from the early 1980s and this was my 29th visit - I was running out of certain perfume oils hence the visit. I have been staying at the Es Saadi since 1993. This is a mid-1960s family-owned hotel located just outside the city walls that is run my the second and third generations. It is set in beautiful gardens and the estate includes a casino night club and the Palace suites-only hotel. Twenty years ago it was second only to La Mamounia but today the city boasts many luxury hotels and riads (the traditional Moroccan house in the old city). There is something special regarding the Es Saadi. The staff are very friendly and nothing seems to be any trouble. I stayed for 10 nights though a UK friend booked in for four nights during my stay. We both had rooms on the more expensive south side with views over the pool and mountains (when visible). The breakfast area was much improved as indeed was the fare. The lunch/snack service beside the pool was efficient. The hotel has a large dining room which offers a good choice but traditionally I have always eaten out as the city offers a wide choice of restaurants. Those who prefer to eat in will find it perfectly acceptable. It is ideally suited for the old and new towns. To me it is my Marrakech home. There is free WiFi. The only 'down' in recent years is that Saturday nights can be noisy as apart from the hotel's nightclub there are two others nearby. My younger friend had a room near the hotel's nightclub and his own music in his room could not drown the bass beat in the early hours - there was also noise from the street. I took a herbal sleeping pill and slept through the lot. A pair of ear plugs would be useful if you are staying over a Saturday night. Marrakech has to sort the noise levels around its night clubs (during my stay the main problem was the noise from the street near the two nearby night clubs). Would I return? Yes but with ear plugs in case of need!,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPA38210
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Pricetta wrote a review Apr 2014,10,Gave me salmonella food poisoning. DO NOT STAY,I think the title says a lot but unfortunately this wasn't our only complaint of the holiday. If you don't have time to read the epic tale below in a nutshell avoid this hotel like the plague.    My husband and I recently stayed at the Es Saadi Hotel and Gardens resort ‚Äì 1st March 2014 ‚Äì 8th March 2014.    Whilst at the hotel we ordered breakfast in our room on the morning of 4th March as this was part of the amended service whilst they were undertaking repairs to the hotel dining areas. Our breakfast arrived and unfortunately my husband wasn‚Äôt feeling too well so I ate two portions of the scrambled egg we were delivered. 3-4 hours later I began to suffer with cramps and diarrhea and had to spend the rest of the evening in bed. I couldn‚Äôt eat food so went to bed without any dinner. I deteriorated throughout the night and woke up the next morning feeling weak and feverish.    Not knowing quite what was wrong and assuming I‚Äôd had a bit of the local water by accident which had given me an upset stomach we ventured down to breakfast the next morning before heading into the Medina to look at some sights. Once in the Medina I suddenly came over extremely ill causing much embarrassment and we had to fly home in a taxi. I spent that evening shaking with fever all afternoon and evening couldn‚Äôt eat had a pounding headache and serious sickness. My husband was too worried to leave me to get some dinner so he had to order room service and eat alone. In the morning I was worse and now extremely dehydrated. I asked my husband to go to the pharmacy to get me something to help me rehydrate I was from losing so much water and nutrients. On his way down he mentioned his frustration and concern to the front desk who confirmed they had a doctor on sight who they sent up to our room.    The doctor visited my on Thursday 6th March at around 11am. He confirmed that I had severe food poisoning and put me on a course of antibiotics and 4 other tablets that I had to take 2-3 times a day for 5 days. He also said that I should try and eat something and that I would be ok to eat bread rice soup or plain vegetables. I stuck to this strict diet but it took me another 48 hours before my body would hold down food longer than 30 minutes. It was exhausting agonising and extremely unpleasant for both myself and my husband. It stopped us being able to go anywhere as I needed to be by a toilet all the time and was so weak from the fever and poisoning. It wasn‚Äôt until Saturday 8th March the day we had to fly home that I began to feel any better. I lost 5 days of my 7 day holiday.    All of the food we had delivered to our room (because my husband had to eat room service for 4 nights as I was too ill to be left alone) was cold. Appalling.    Had we not had this awful experience I would have been inclined to let the other complaints slip but as they already ruined my holiday for this year I will elaborate that we were not told about the renovations they were doing at the hotel. It meant that 2 of the restaurants were out of service we had to walk across to the Es Saadi Palace every morning for breakfast where it was over crowded and frankly unpleasant to try and fight the crowds to get some food. Furthermore we had to listen to drilling and banging all day. We were excited to have been given a pool-view apartment as they make it clear that this is the better level of room. Well not when you‚Äôre then overlooking the renovations. I had to spend 4 days in bed in my room ‚Äì and listen to the sound of renovations all day! Disgusting. What‚Äôs worse is that they didn‚Äôt inform us before we booked or travelled that they were undergoing renovations. Guests should have been notified and compensated yet we were only told when we were checking in giving us no option but to accept the situation.    If that wasn‚Äôt enough we also had to then contend with the sound of the club at the Casino all night through to 5am ‚Äì whenever the door was opened to let people in or out all we could hear was the bass resounding through the complex. So renovations all day club music all night. Es Saadi hotel is NOT cheap to stay in or to eat and drink in ‚Äì and for that price I am appalled at what we had to put up with. The icing on the cake was the room service. As I spent so much time in the room I got to experience just how many people and how many times the chambermaids come in and out of the room. Even up to 8pm at night when people were knocking on the door to give us towels. I once counted 15 times in one day. This is just unacceptable. Although most people would not be in their room all day so would not be privy to this happening I was because the hotel gave me food poisoning. We had to leave our ‚Äòdo not disturb‚Äô sign on all day in the end just to get some peace and quiet.    What more can I say. Awful awful awful hotel.

The hotel itself is ok room was nt too bad although patio doors did not lock properly and all bathroom lights fused 24 hours before leaving. These things are small concerns when compared with the appaliing and rude staff. Breakfast at best can only be compared to a bun fight disorganisation is the rule and staff ignore all requests for tea/coffee and any crockery and cutlery. So much so I finally helped myself much to their consternation and even complaints to the breakfast room manager did nt improve matters on subsequent days.    Further 'miscommunications' with other various staff ensued and be warned a hefty amount is taken off your credit card as a pre-authorisation on arrival. Apparently normal procedure is to refund this on check out and take the full amount at this point - I refused and we paid only the small balance owing in cash.    Only redeeming factors are the very nice grounds - again please note as 'hotel' guests you are 'barred' from the pool in the Palace area which also isn t made clear at check in leading to further embarassment and the one and only staff member worth any praise is the very lovely Fatima working the pool restaurant and bar at the lowly 'hotel'    There are lots of hotels in and around the area this one is in - do yourself a favour and stay at any one of those rather than this one.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,jonathan l wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Overall Happy 1st Stay in Marakech,Our first time to morocco. 4 Nights in Marakech & 10 nights in Essaouia. After scouring tripadvisor I found two hotels for a reasonable price with everything we were looking for but you never know till you arrive.    Our Marakech hotel was the Es Saadi Gardens & Resort. Upon arrival it didn't look to impressive to be honest but this hotel was cheaper than other hotels we have stayed at in other countries. I had read the reviews so was forewarned not to expect 5 Star service you might receive elsewhere in the world. So here we go my views.....    Service ranged from the exceptional to the average. Restaurants in the hotel seemed to have enough staff but sometimes service seemed slow. Sometimes in the morning you would have to get the attention of the waiter to order your coffee. Then it would seemingly take for ever for it to arrive (probably only 5-10 mins) The thing is you would be waiting and then you would see a little huddle of 2-3 waiters standing around talking and laughing. To be honest I think this seems to be the morrocon way as I have also found this at our second hotel. ( Didn't worry me to much to be honest but thought I would mention it)    Predominately the morrocons speak French and the majority of tourists I met were French but we never had any problems some of the staff at both hotels we stayed spoke very good English.    During our stay I good WIFI connection through the hotel including beside the pool and in our room.    I also used the Gym which was located in the Es Saadi Palace. One of the best Gyms I have used. All modern equipment ( TechnoGym ) Gym was also very quite.    The food was of a good quality although the breakfast which was a good selection buffet was the same every day. We booked bed and breakfast and found the evening meals A La carte and of a good standard.  we also ate out at a couple of restaurants one which I feel is worth a mention was the Azar. Described as a mixture of Moroccan and Lebanese food. Service and food was excellent.    One of the hotels outdoor pools was described to us as heated. It didn't feel heated is all I can say. Sometimes the pool area was busier than others but we always managed to get a sun lounger.    didn't use the Spa during our stay.    The hotel is in a good location with it being only a five minute walk from the old town and the hustle and bustle of the markets. If you venture into the markets be prepared to haggle hard. I found them completely overpriced. No bargains to had here.    one thing I found strange after now years of smokers oppression in United Kingdom. People could smoke when and where ever they fancied it. Although I believe the smokers during breakfast had to sit outside.    I found have found all resort food and drink expensive and what I mean by expensive is expect to pay more than you would in England. bottle of Local beer around 65 MAD inc Tax as of March 2014. Can of Sprite 35 MAD. Food follows along the same lines.    All in all a good experience and I would return to the hotel as it satisfied all of our requirements. I have marked the Hotel as Good Value mainly due to the amount we paid for the bead and breakfast option. If you stayed here with a family I feel the costs would ramp up with food and drink from the hotel.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanl460

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,cathda wrote a review Jan 2014,20,Be warned ....,Promotional images for the Hotel Es Saadi are actually of the Palace Es Saadi resort - the two belong to the same family but are completely different.  We booked the Hotel as it has a large heated outdoor pool and as someone who swims everyday this was of paramount importance. Upon arrival there was a notice on the reception counter stating that 'due to a leak the pool breakfast room and spa would be shut from 6th Jan.' When I complained about this the receptionist stated that our travel company should have told us. The travel company had not been informed. When we complained to the local rep he also had no idea. Basically no one wishes to take responsibility. So whilst the hotel is 'open' it is effectively shut.  Breakfast is taken at the Palace - fantastic and I should imagine much better than what would be available at the Hotel. You can use the pool at the Palace. The main big pool is not heated and therefore it's not possible to swim in that. There is another smaller heated pool which was perfect for the first 4 days but the temperature of this was dropped considerably and it was not possible to swim in that either by the 13th Jan.  At the Hotel Es Saadi workmen are in the pool and surrounding area 8-5 everyday digging up and replacing tiles banging drilling etc. The day we left scaffolding was being erected around part of the hotel and very loud work was taking place. One night there were men working in the pool at 1am! It is not possible to be in your room during the day if you are planning to relax. Effectively there is extensive work going on at this hotel.  The staff at the Hotel can be very surly indeed (at the Palace they are charming) and more interested in smoking or looking at their mobiles. Note: smoking is permissable all over the hotel including in the rooms ... so if you want to start smoking or even passive smoking this is the place to do it!  Upon arrival we were told we had to pay 3000 dh (about ¬£230) on a credit card as a deposit against any charges we might incur - bar room service etc. We said we would pay as we went. This wasn't deemed to be acceptable and we were asked to leave cash if we weren't prepared to enter a credit card pin number. We were told this was the same at every hotel because visitors left without paying bills. We are professional people not criminals. We refused to pay in advance and after some further discussion we managed to check in. When we met up with a local friend (Moroccan) who used to work on reception at The Meridian in Marrakech he was shocked and told us that this is not common practice. You need to stick to your guns.    Checkout time is reasonable at midday. Our pick up was at 2pm. I asked if I could change my clothes somewhere as I had been at the pool and was shown to what is clearly the (male) staff area and storage area. The concierge appeared to lock the door that I went through from the main reception but there were 2 other doors that accessed this area which was effectively a dirty garage storage space. I felt very uncomfortable changing in there but needed to change out of my swimsuit. I had just managed to change my top when 2 of the doors opened and a male concierge came through each one! VERY VERY odd and VERY VERY uncomfortable. Why there is not a hospitality room available for guests to change in is beyond me. I am sure that if I had slipped the concierge some money he would have found one but that is not the point. One should be provided for any guest that needs to change before travelling.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Economistmum wrote a review Jan 2014,20,It should be called Hotel Sad,The hotel is tired and needs renovating. The rooms are a decent size but everything screams old and in need of replacing including the inadequate lifts.    Despite the water being undrinkable unlike most Moroccan hotels there are no courtesy bottles of drinking water in the rooms only an over priced mini bar. I assumed that there would be a supermarket nearby not so. this is a residential neighbourhood with many hotels but nowhere that we could find to buy a simple bottle of water or anything else.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,David F wrote a review Dec 2013,40,A place apart,The Es Saadi Hotel as opposed to its big brother the Palace is a charming base for a break in Marrakech. A little old style glamour accompanied with polite and attentive service provide the perfect foil for the frenzy of The Medina. Get a room overlooking the pool and the Atlas Mountains. Enjoy the sunset. Not the most modern hotel in Marrakech but then that's not such a bad thing.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,mei-lingling wrote a review Dec 2013,30,Es Saadi using other hotel's pictures!,not what you expected! they used very nice pictures on every websites and mentioned that the hotel has plenty of facilities but we just found out on the spot that they are using the Palace hotel's pictures. es saadi and the palace are from the same hotel group and located on the same location but we were informed when checking in that we cannot use the palace hotel facilities except the for the gym. es saadi has only one small swimming pool that was always crowded and definitely not a swimming pool for children!    We had the bungalow next to the pool the room was nice and cozy. however the room service came to the room at least 5x a day to check on the room this is what i found very annoying!!! 1 guy maybe forgot to give fresh towels 1 guy came for hotel magazine and etc etc! in some point we were suspicious that they actually came to ask for tips. we stayed for a week in November after 2 days we were already bored with the breakfast it was average and always very crowded.    the casino and the lounge at the casino are nice touch but not the dungeon club guests and tourists are definitely paying more than the local. they were questioning you before you get in to the club and give different type of stamps on each guest you need to show the stamp on your hand before they come with the bill!!!,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mei-lingling
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,julia_trav wrote a review Dec 2013,30,NOT a 5*!,This review is regarding Es Saadi Hotel not the Palace. Es Saadi is an OK hotel. Definitely not a 5* more like 3*. Staff are nice and rooms are good. I would suggest getting a room with pool view and if you ask for a room higher up (4th floor) then you also get a very good view of the Atlas mountains. However i found room being incredibly hot and stuffy. We tried turning an AC on it wasnt helping much so we had to sleep with our balcony open to get some cool air. Breakfast is quite good with plenty to choose from!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,FHN21 wrote a review Dec 2013,40,"The hotel Es Saadi, not the Palace","I stayed in a double room on the third floor of the Es Saadi Hotel facing the swimming pool and was very happy with that. Breakfast buffet was included in the room price and given that this was during the Marrakech International Film festival the price was not outlandish. The room had a balcony facing the afternoon sun and was perfect for a sunset cocktail. The pool is heated and quite welcoming. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the room was kept impeccably clean. The owner a French lady who has lived in Morocco ""forever"" is constantly surveying the property and service and must be one of the reasons why Es Saadi by some is considered one of the best hotels in Marrakech.  The hotel was built in the early 1950 and therefore is not very modern even though the rooms have all been refurbished including wonderful matresses. It has a lot of storage space something one does not find in modern hotels. The rooms are large (35m2) and the bathroom has a bath tub. My iPad iPhone and MacBook worked fine on the the WiFi network accessible without any codes.  There is a spa connected to the hotel and further into the garden the only real Casino in Marrakech inaugurated in 1952.  Many travellers confuse the hotel Es Saadi with the palace Es Saadi. Both belong to the same family and in the same garden as the Casino. The Palace was inaugurated just about seven years ago and has only suites and villas and one of Marrakech's largest swimming pools and a fantastic new spa. The price for a suite at the Palace is more than double than at the hotel. If you can afford it stay ath e Palace. It is really palatial.  But by all means the hotel is more tha adequate and the Es Saadi complex is very well situated near the main sights but in a quiet garden area.  One small thing on the negative: The breakfast room next to the bar and reception needs a little uplift. It is ""cold"" and dark especially early in the morningt in the winter. The brakfast and service however is very good.

Travel Republic were a terrible booking agency and of no help at all once we had booked into the hotel (as it was a weekend they were unable to find anyone to help us and when on a 4 day holiday not the most convenient!). This is the hotel NOT the palace - if you look on the Es Saadi Gardens website it is very deceiving - not in a good way practically all of the images are of the palace - which is beautiful NOT the hotel. The hotel is extremely old fashioned and depressing albeit a good location to central Marrakech the Medina (around 5 minute taxi journey). The food was appalling we tried to eat in the hotel restaurant 2 separate evenings as had booked half-board but due to the abysmal food we had no other option than to eat at other restaurants every night in Marrakech.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,saraBirmingham wrote a review Oct 2013,30,OK but 5 star???,We chose this hotel after researching as it appeared to be in a good location and value for money. Well it was an OK location but we did not feel it was value for money.  The hotel is approximately 15- 20 minute taxi from the airport so that was convenient. Our room was on the first floor overlooking the pool. I thought this might get noisy but we stayed five days and it was OK. there was free wifi in the hotel and we had no problems accessing the internet even by the side of the pool!  Our room was OK bathroom OK. We were staying half-board and we did not like the food we found it tasteless and without much variation. There was no buffet but a set menu. after two evenings we ate out so that was a total waste of money paying half-board. Breakfast was OK the only advantage with breakfast was that it was available in our room until noon so did not have to get up too early just for breakfast!  The hotel is in a quiet location in the area of Hivernage unfortunately only one cafe (5 mins from hotel and a small supermarket about 10 mins walk- handy to buy water snacks).  The hotel staff were OK but only spoke French and Moroccan Arabic so they and we struggled!  a plus was that a tour bus stops outside the hotel...a ticket can be bought for 24 or 48 hours for hop on - hop off tour.  In general it was OK but compared to other five star hotels we have stayed in it would be definitely a good 3 star or average 4 star.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"birmingham, uk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saraBirmingham

The hotel is abot a mile or so from the Medina but taxis or horse drawn carriages are available. It is also well placed to escape for a day or more into the Atlas Mountains.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Jill F wrote a review Oct 2013,10,Overpriced and Pretentious,The location is an up-market area of Marrakech and close to the Medina but the area lacks cafes and restaurants other than in other hotels. The gardens are little more than bordered paths between the various buildings. The hotel feels very much like the poor relation to the Palace although the Palace does not live up the hype either.  The food in the restaurant was reasonably good but breakfast left something to be desired and was often served up in chipped china; for example on my last morning there I had to reject five cereal bowls before finding one without a chip. Hardly more than 2 star. Also the bath was horribly stained (see photos).  I had a room overlooking the pool which was supposed to be quiet but even so there was noise most of the night. The casino was close by and there was a poker tournament going on which probably increased the traffic. Vehicle noise came both from there and from the road and there was bass noise until about 5 a.m. every night  The spa was way over-priced. Treatments in the Palace spa were more expensive that at La Mamounia!  This hotel complex may aspire to be like La Mamounia on price but it is a million miles off course.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909jillf
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,CBurgoyne wrote a review Oct 2013,40,A nice hotel with its foibles,There is no denying this is a lovely hotel with nice rooms a lovely pool and gardens etc but some of the staff let the place down a bit. Over the course of our stay the quality of service was mixed the staff seem to fill a spectrum from really really good to not all that good! The negatives first; on the first morning we went to breakfast got tea and coffee at our table had not been sitting there that long and both got up to visit the buffet on returning to our table only a few minutes later everything was gone!! The staff apologised and replaced everything but it was still very odd! It was buffet tag team for the rest of the stay! On the first night we ate at the hotel my husband‚Äôs steak was chewy and my ‚Äòpasta with tomato sauce and cheese‚Äô was merely a poor attempt at macaroni cheese without an explanation for the lack of tomatoes! Thankfully in our holiday good humour we managed to find most of this funny. Positives; the hotel is in a fab location and we really enjoyed lounging by the pool the room was really spacious and the bed was very comfortable the fact it was on the noisier road side rather than the pool side didn‚Äôt bother us. A couple of the staff members were exceptional one concierge was always more than friendly and one of the restaurant staff who I think was perhaps the manager was brilliant on our last night. We wouldn‚Äôt rule out staying there again although we would probably price up hotels in the same area to compare.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Linz Harvey wrote a review Sep 2013,30,Dated hotel with dubious air con facility but lovely team of staff,"The website is rather misleading - the pool photo is better than the real experience. The ""island"" in the pool has a palm tree? It attracts a lot of pigeons and their ""deposits"" produce a certain ""aroma"" which rather detracts from the ambience. The rooms are OK - the bed linen and room service make up for the rather un-prepossessing balcony. There was no kettle in the room and the air con was a little lacking. The lovely people working there made the whole experience better. Nothing was too much trouble it seemed when we requested a change of room. The air con was better in the room we were moved to after the first night but still not great. The food poolside was delightful and the bar staff were helpful but I wondered if it wouldn't be improved by a little poolside service? Building work was in progress and I understand all too well that improvements need to be made but the noise on occasion was rather irritating. As a result of the building work breakfast was served in beautiful gardens to the side of the hotel. Sadly it was spoilt by the volume of bees and their stalwart disregard of our best ""shooing"" efforts. Luckily we didn't have anything sweet or fruity but they still made a nuisance of themselves. The toilet facilities were reminiscent of a dingy cellar and there was no soap or paper available. We had to ask for the fountain to be turned on in the pool each day - to mask the building noise - wake up guys! We booked to eat in the restaurant the menu looked marvellous but the young lady at the door was dismissive and oddly haughty in manner suffice it to say we cancelled the booking the following day. On the downside the revving of engines and speedway style screeching of tyres which ran from 1am to 5am was annoying but we were informed that the ""culprit"" was royalty so hey ho. On the upside the Thai spa by the pool was fabulous and the treatments divine.

I had a room with a tiny balcony with a rusty table and chair overlooking the pool and towards the Palace and Casino.    The best things about the hotel were the pool and the food in the Restaurant Gastronomique!    I was half board at the hotel and for dinner every evening there was a choice of three starters 3 main courses and a choice from the sweet trolley. The food was excellent and the vegetables were fresh bio (free range) and home grown. The service was also good.    However the breakfast was awful. The selection was in a room along a path in the garden with tables outside. The selection was poor and even though there was ham and Palma ham there was no bacon. The sausages were awful spicy little things. The waiters were milling around but not really wanting to know if you wanted anything and I had to really try hard to get an omelette and a pot of coffee. The worst thing was that one was inundated with wasps!    The people coming out of the Casino at 4.00am make a lot of noise and rev their cars and bikes!    The little boutiques at the hotel are very nice but very expensive!    The room and bathroom were clean but the carpet was a bit worn. The room was a good size with a very comfortable bed and pillows but was cleaned very late in the afternoon which was not really convenient.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,oktoba77 wrote a review Aug 2013,40,"Pleasant hotel, good location.","Located a 20/25 minute walk from Djemma El Fna Es Saadi offers a comfortable retreat from Marrakech. Rooms are large and spacious and staff very helpful and friendly. our room was cleaned daily and beds were beautifully comfy    A taxi to Gueliz or Djemma El Fna will set you back between 20/30d (¬£2approx) but expect the drivers to try and get 50/60d out of you - walk away and you'll soon be called back to pay the standard price (not much I know but who likes to be ripped off? And once someone senses you're gullible you risk being taken to any numbers of souks/restaurants). The walk was a bit of a pain but was relatively hassle-free (compared to Egypt if you've been) Two tricks to watch out for. One: more than once we were followed by someone who approached us and claimed to be ""from Es Saadi""; whilst situation didn't turn unpleasant it still took them 10 mins to cotton on that we weren't going to be led into restaurants and shops and those minutes felt a little awkward. Two: Chap approached us on our first day offering to be a guide and warning us of ""hassle"". Having been to several African nations we were fully prepared and found Marrakech to be easier than Egypt and Kenya; a simple 'no thanks' is all that is required.    Returning to the hotel we found the dining facilities for breakfast not to our liking staff appeared rushed and flies buzzing into the dining room and so we opted after the first day to order room service for breakfast at no additional cost (bar a small tip for the waiter).    Finally for great restaurants look away from Djemma. We found much better equally affordable dining in Gueliz on a road called Rue Yugoslavie. Whilst the road looks deserted there are a number of nice eateries who real charm is only to be discovered by exploring beyond the often disappointing frontages. It cost approx 20d and if you're brave enough (not that you'd be in any danger) it is a 20 minute walk back to Es Saadi.",Date of stay: July 2013,,"Alicante, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oktoba77

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,GemKH wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Nice in theory...,We stayed for three nights after seeing lovely photos (and it's pretty cheap coming from the UK!) so i was a bit disappointed on getting there to find a 5 story block hotel very 90s style and not in the best upkeep.    The gardens are beautiful but there was some quite noisy building work we weren't advised of and the enormous pool - which looks stunning - was empty and taped off with no explanation. The smaller pool we did sit by was great though but not the best view of the empty taped off adjacent pool.    There are a number of restaurants but we couldn't actually find most of them - the staff's English was fairly limited and we weren't offered any information on arrival there's also no map of the complex. We went to the pool bar for lunch which was fine not great and looking at ¬£8/9 for a salad more for larger meals - at the palace pool its around ¬£18 for a burger. They also wouldn't serve alcohol not sure why but i'm guessing for Ramadan which is fair enough but made where you could get drinks quite limited.    The hotel was pretty much empty and we found Hivernage very quiet too perhaps because its Ramadan though i'm not sure why there weren't more tourists. The city was bustling though and a great place to visit so we just stayed at the pool or headed to the city - its walkable or should be max 40 dirhams in a cab - haggling is key!    All in all the hotel was nice enough and a really good price for a short sun break but I was disappointed by the closures and the staff weren't hugely helpful but the language barrier was a bit of an issue - most people there were French.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GemKH

My schoolgirl french came in handy and I accept that although there don't appear to be enough sun beds on first sight the pool guys are always willing to find room for you and will produce a parasol from nowhere it seems! The bar food is always good value for money. The rooms are very pleasant big bed and the chambermaid always leaves it spotless. Ok balcony isn't huge but that's not a reason to down mark this hotel. We stayed on a B&B basis and the choice at breakfast is excellent and set in lovely surroundings. Our only reason for not giving full marks is the casino/disco next door at the palace. It seems that at 5.30am when they all go home the majority of the locals feel the road out of the casino is actually a pit lane and we experienced high octane revving from engines and beeping horns for about 1/2hr. Then it returns to the sound of birdsong which is lovely. As for taxis we walked round the corner every morning and picked up a petit taxi to get us into the city NEVER paid more than 20 MAD!

We asked to upgrade to a suite there wasn't one available in the hotel so they offered one of the bungalows opposite the pool. This was spacious and had a lovely large bathroom. The furniture was traditional but somehow made the rooms look dark. We were right opposite the pool which was ok but lacked a little privacy compared to a hotel room. It was extremely relaxing with the sound of water trickling in the pool and the birds singing amongst the trees. We used the spa so as to experience a hammam. This was definitely an experience! Good fun. The spa in the palace is luxurious but double the cost. We went into the palace part of the hotel....beautiful. The gym is situated here and is very clean and spacious. We went into the casino which can be very smokey but had an enjoyable time. The restaurant in the hotel is very good with excellent service not cheap but worth at least one visit. Breakfast was plentiful and very relaxing and you could enjoy it either indoors or in the garden.  We ventured away from the hotel to visit the souks etc best to take a taxi they can take you straight there this cost 50 dirhams. You cannot get maps free of charge so might be best to print some off before hand. Overall we had one of the most relaxing short breaks in a long time. We could not fault the hotel or the staff.,Date of stay: June 2013,,"Hereford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sparkle1966
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,loz61 wrote a review Jun 2013,40,You get what you pay for,If you are looking for 5* then you will be disappointed like most of the hotels In Marrakesh there is an 80's feel to this place BUT that seems to be the case for most of the mid range hotels in the resort.. That is my ONLY complaint of this hotel    we booked into an Atlas suite and it was so spacious we started to refer to it as a flat a small one mind !! we did take a peek in a few of the rooms and some had slightly better bathrooms but apart from that they were all very similar.. very clean and with spacious balconies.. The kitchen areas though needed some attention    All that said the concierge and the service in general was absolutely 5*. This hotel should pride themselves on their main attraction.. knowledgeable friendly staff and what felt like an extremely safe environment. The grounds are also stunning and the food superb in the evenings and just the ticket in the days!!    Be aware Marrakesh is only slightly cheaper than England though this isn't a low budget holiday an 5 days is enough there is very little to see there.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loz61
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Gavin B wrote a review Jun 2013,40,"Excellent stay, great hotel.",Honestly this is right on the cusp of being a five star review but I get the feeling our stay was so excellent because we went off season.    We stayed in the Atlas Suite on the corner of the hotel and thought it was overall lovely.    Positives  - The suite was massive and the cleaning staff were in and out every time you left to turn down the bed hoover and tidy behind you. Incredible service.  - The concierge staff were incredibly helpful polite and welcoming. The vast majority of the staff were but the concierge's and the restaurant staff spoke the best English.  - The bed was enormous. You could go with a friend and share the double bed without ever even touching.  - The restaurant was absolutely delcious half board would be a wise investment.  - The pool was kept clean and sparkling and pleasantly cool when you were trying to escape the merciless heat.  - The grounds were beautiful and use of the gym facilities in the palace was very welcome and extremely convenient.    Negatives  - the mountains were partially visible on a couple of occasions the room is advertised for it's stunning view of them but the air is constantly full of sand/heat haze at that distance and you never see them.  - There was an incongruously grotty kitchen in the room. Everything was rather plush and lovely and freshly painted then there was this little box of crap tiles and lino. It was actually quite funny in a surreal way.  - It's French Morocco so the staff speak Arabic (faarsi?) and French with English being a second language not really a criticism but it made ordering lunches by the pool a bit of an adventure.    It's definitely a five star hotel from the 90's or so but what do you expect in Africa? I can't even understand the one star reviews I've seen on here after having visited.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GavinB226
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,flowersof wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Fabulous gardens & friendly staff.,Es Saadi is set in luxurious immaculately kept gardens.  The staff are really friendly & charming-as are most Morrocans!  The hotel is a peaceful oasis only a ten minute walk away from the bustling Medina.  Go for a day into the Atlas Mountains-use a taxi driver as your guide for the day-agree your price first. Much cheaper than an official tour! Buy your souvenirs from the Berbers in the mountains-cheaper than in the souk-pay about one third of the first asking price.  Hotel mahmounia is worth a visit for cocktails but is certainly no more beautiful than the Es Saadi palace!,Date of stay: May 2013,,"Hereford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowersof
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,tahita wrote a review May 2013,30,Too Far from the action,The staff were nice and the breakfast area was very pleasant and a superb choice of food.. A very big complex with a variety of places to eat boutiques and spa area. Our room unfortunately let it down though as it was very small with a minute dirty balcony and the bathroom was not too clean with a cigarette burn on the toilet seat.    We had been told that the hotel was only 10 minutes walk from the Square and Souks but it was so much more than that and also along busy roads. We are fairly agile and fit but we did the walk once and got taxi's after that as it took so long and also was not a good walk to do at night.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Fordingbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tahita

We really liked this hotel but would probably class it as more of a 4 than a 5 star. It was clean and tidy and the staff were friendly and helpful with the possible exception of the pool area/bar staff who seemed very disorganised (too many managers not enough workers) - it took approximately 30 minutes to get 2 beers! We had one dinner at the hotel which was part of the tour and a fixed menu - pretty average. The breakfast is a great location by the pool but again average.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Discojo1 wrote a review May 2013,40,A brilliant short break!,We were a party of 5 ladies and we stayed in the Es Saadi for 4 nights in early May. It is classed as a 5 star hotel but as most foreign countries I would say it was a good 4 star. Staff on arrival v efficient and pleasant. The hotel has a faded grandeur which I liked Art Deco dotted around. We paid extra for a pool view room which did not disappoint  we had working air con a nice view and a clean bedroom with adjoining doors to our friends room next door.  The first night we ended up in the Th√©√¢trO nightclub on the sight which is free entry for residents. It was AMAZING a truly fantastic night. Drinks are expensive but then again everywhere in Marrakech is so the hotel prices were on a par with other restaurants. We also ate at the Casino on sight which was a beautiful place I highly recommend that!  You can walk to the Medina from the hotel in 15 mins just don't get an unofficial tour guide by accident! Luckily we didn't go where he wanted us to!  Breakfast was buffet style although they did have scrambled and boiled eggs on toast and you can sit outside which was v pleasant. The poolside lunches were exceptional lovely big salads club sandwiches and nice fries for aprox ¬£10 each. Pool manager was not a nice man though and quite nasty on occasion!  The place hotel in the grounds is truly stunning and although u cannot use their pool unless u get a day pass you can walk round the gardens and have lunch or a drink.  I have read many reviews on here before I went and can honestly say that some people complain about anything and everything. You get what you pay for and the price of the hotel room was not a 5 star price. My only criticism was that there were not enough sunbeds to go round and I suggest u move some of your eating area and put some more sunbeds on for residents.  Overall a great trip and I would recommend staying here!!!!,Date of stay: May 2013,,"Aberdaron, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Discojo1
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Helen R wrote a review May 2013,30,not 5 star,I have just returned from 1 week in the Es Saadi Hotel and gardens this is marketed as a 5 star hotel and I am sorry to say it is not 5 star. The room we had was comfortable and clean but we had birds nesting in the facia of the patio doors on to the balcony which made a noise through the first half of the week all through the night. The hotel was full so we were unable to move. The food was nice but expensive  but to be fair all food in Marrakech is expensive The service at both the restaurant and pool bar was hap hazard with staff arguing and not delivering the correct food etc or being really slow .What really let this hotel down was the pool area and the use of sun beds and parasols both of which there certainly was not enough of .Guests were in the pool and their belongings were removed by the pool attendant for other guests to use their bed which caused arguments with both staff and guests  the pool decking was breaking up and the centre island in the pool had a greasy line on the tiles that even though the pool area was cleaned every day the tiles on the island were never scrubbed. This hotel needs updating it is sold on the back of the Es Saadi palace which is 5 star and the gardens are linked you can walk through them and use the restaurants and club but the fabulous pool area of this hotel is out of bounds.I was really disappointed and by Wednesday wanted to come home as I was fed up of having to wait or fight for a sunbed . The souks in Marrakech were good but if I went again it would be to the coast or mountains or only for a 3 or 5 night break and I would stay elsewhere as this hotel was extremely overpriced .,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Man, West Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenR514
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,fashi0ngal wrote a review May 2013,20,Really disappointed in this hotel,We went to the palace side of the hotel at first and I was so impressed - but we were told our reservation was on the other side of the hotel. The staff transferred over our bags and took us over. We could instantly see a difference it didn't look like the hotel had ever been renovated it has a very cheap look about it. Our room wasn't ready and wouldn't be for another 15 minutes as we were meeting friends we left our baggage and told them we would return later. Once we checked into the room we could again see the how outdated and basic the room was - I couldn't believe we were paying ¬£125 a night and that this was a 5* hotel - felt a lot more like a 3*. The water was spilling out of the shower head and the drain made a gurgling sound every 30 seconds! Whilst I was taking an afternoon siesta I could hear someone in the hall way shouting expletives! The breakfast was also a huge disappointment - a very average selection which is cleared away at 10:30 on the dot not even a piece of bread remaining. I will definitely not make the mistake of staying here again despite the great location.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Marbella, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fashi0ngal
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Winco47 wrote a review May 2013,40,"""A week in Marrakech""",We arrived at the hotel in the late afternoon after a good flight with BA. The Es Saadi Gardens & Resort Hotel is only about 15 minutes from the airport so we were soon in our room (number 107 on the first floor.)    The room was clean and spacious. There was a small fridge/mini-bar a safe and a furnished balcony overlooking the pool. There was complimentary fruit flowers and bottled water in the room which was a nice touch. The bathroom had a bath with shower over and a wash hand basin. Toiletries and bathrobes are provided. There was plenty of shelf space. A sliding glass door led to a toilet and bidet. The air-conditioning was working fine and maintained the room at a pleasant 20 degrees. The daytime temperature outside was in the high 30s but this was unseasonably high and normally it would be in the mid to high 20s.    We were staying on half-board. Dinner service in the Restaurant Gastronomique does not start until 19:30 but the food was very good particularly the fish which was an option on the table d'h√¥te menu every night. For those with a big appetite please note that the portions are good but not huge! There was also the facility to eat in the Palace hotel if you so desired where there are two more restaurants. We slept well on the nights we were there and there was no external noise to disturb us nor was there noise from other guests ‚Äì it's just not that sort of hotel I am pleased to say! I noticed that some previous guests made reference to the noise from the cars and taxis leaving the Casino in the early hours. We did not experience this even though our pool-view room faced the direction of the Casino. Maybe they heard the noise because they were there earlier in the season and had their balcony doors open before the air-conditioning was put on. Other previous reports have mentioned a bad drains smell but we didn't experience this.    Breakfast was superb and was taken outside in very pleasant sylvan surroundings. We are not usually great fans of buffet breakfasts but this was without question really exceptional. Just about anything you could want hot and cold. The bread deserves a mention - it was lovely and fresh-baked every day and exactly what you would expect at a French-owned hotel.    The swimming pool (heated I think) was good although not quite as clean as I would have liked. The grouting around the tiles just under the surface was growing a black mould which needs cleaning off! Having said that we saw that every morning around 07:00 the cleaners ran the pool vacuum cleaner over the bottom and top of the pool. We did not see if or when the pool water was tested or chlorinated but the water did not have a chlorine smell. There were plenty of sunbeds and an adequate number of sun shades. Big towels were provided. The pool is a standard depth all over (1.4 metres) and has access steps. There is also a central fountain that sprays into the pool. All in all very nice.    The hotel is situated in large enclosed gardens and these are shared by the other more 'up market' hotel in the grounds called 'The Palace'. Indeed the nicest parts of the garden are around the Palace hotel. The only problem is that there are no comfortable seats provided where one could sit in the shade to enjoy them. The Es Saadi Gardens hotel is really the poor relation with its own smaller pool. Although we could use the 'facilities' of the Palace hotel we were not allowed to use their pool. I can understand this but it is irritating because their pool was three times the size of ours far nicer (and cleaner) than ours and hardly seemed to be used the week we were there.    There are a few small shops in the hotel grounds for postcards papers books and a few local crafts etc. There is also an ATM in the hotel lobby and a small bureau-de-change. I should mention that the exchange rates in Morocco are government controlled and are the same everywhere. There is no point in queuing to change money at the airport on arrival if you don't need it to pay for a taxi etc. If you are with a party then you will only be delaying everyone's departure from the airport and you won't be popular! There is also free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel even at the pool side which is a big bonus.    So far so good. So what did we not enjoy so much? Well generally the staff were great. Spoiled only by one or two who seemed a little 'surly' but you can get them anywhere. However it would seem that to overcome this you need to tip! Once you start doing this you will see the service improve no end!    Secondly you should note that this is essentially a French hotel. I would say that 85% of the guests were French 10% Moroccan and a 5% mixture including English. Understandably French is the language of choice in the hotel and if you speak French you do get better service. We were fortunate in that respect as we do.    That brings me to drinks. The bottom line is that they are very expensive in the hotel. For instance a very small bottle of beer 25cl costs 55 Dihrams or approx ¬£4.40. That is ¬£17.60 a litre or around ¬£8.00 a pint. Beer in the small shop outside the hotel and about ten minutes walk away costs 16 Dihrams or approx ¬£1.25 for 50cl which is ¬£2.50 a litre or ¬£1.10 a pint. That is some mark up even for a hotel and in my opinion totally unjustified.    We did attend the Morocco night during our stay in lieu of our dinner in the restaurant ‚Äì what a mistake! We did not enjoy it. The entertainment was far too loud. The tables were very low making it difficult to eat without suffering from indigestion! The candlelight whilst very atmospheric made it too dark to see what you were eating and there was far far too much food. A terrible waste. The food was also very bland. We expected Moroccan food to be a bit spicy but this meal was not. So I would not recommend the Moroccan evening in the hotel.    So would we stay here again? Well we would probably save up a little longer and book into the Palace hotel for that extra bit of luxury.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Poole - on the sunshine coast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winco47
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,takamine7849 wrote a review Apr 2013,20,Average,I stayed for 1 week at the Es Saadi. Not the most pleasant welcome on arrival and when I asked for a 5 Star hotel with my booking agent I was surprised to find myself in more of a 3 star at best.    Young lady at the bar (evenings) was a delight and pointed out the best restaurants Marrakech had to offer. All walking distance from the hotel which was a plus.    Rooms were basic The cleaners were very good and very friendly unlike most of the other staff at the hotel.    Wi-Fi was free in the rooms and around the pool which was great as I was working most days I was there. I went down for breakfast on the one occasion which I found tinned fruit and food I wouldnt give to a stray dog. Trying to get a coffee from the many staff was pretty painful at times also. Except if I asked in French then it would of been no problem at all.    If I did go back to Marrakech I would stay only at the Sofitel which I visited and was stunning to say the least.    If you want some nice weather in Easter though Marrakech delivered hands down.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,MOCKO_2 wrote a review Apr 2013,10,Rejected,The Es Saadi Hotel was to be the highlight hotel for our tour of Morocco in March. Despite booking the holiday months in advance on the day of arrival we were told a previous booking had overrun and our party were to be offered an inferior alternative. Eventually an out of town option was negociated (location not desirable) but we felt snubbed and unwelcome in what is a fine city. It also leads one ask rightly or wrongly what money was offered for them to make that decision.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,FarAndBeyond_13 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Fantastic Stay!!,Myself and a few friends stayed at the Es Saadi Hotel last week and were overall pleased with our selection of hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean. The rooms were cleaned on a daily basis and fresh towels and toiletries were provided also. The breakfast was great with a wide selection to choose from and once again the service was good. Dinner in the evening became repetitive but was still enjoyable. Yaya from the restaurant who is a real asset to the hotel ensured that we received a great service with a smile. The pool area was clean and there were plenty of sun beds to choose from. You also get free entry to the Club Theatro if you are staying at the Es Saadi which saved a few quid. The downside to the hotel is that the majority of the guests are OAP‚Äôs so you are guaranteed peace and quite if that‚Äôs what you are looking for.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,exmouthsharris wrote a review Mar 2013,10,An absolute joke!! 3 star at best!!,We have just returned from a 2 night stay here and can honestly say it was one of the most over-rated and over-priced dumps I have ever stayed in!  The hotel stinks of stale smoke and the rooms have a stench of drains.  The air conditioning has no temperature control and blows out hot air when turned on making for a really unpleasant sleep. We did ask about the temperature and were told it was hot because it was their winter (in March with 30¬∫) and if we didn't like it we should open the doors which opened onto a loud casino!! The next day we asked if there was a fan in the hotel that we could use but were told they had all been taken already by other guests! We found out later that the air con was broken and had been for months!  The hotel was also very tired and depressing and looked like a Spanish resort from the 70's with the price of a luxury 5* hotel in Dubai!  The swimming pool is not heated but ok as the weather was lovely and warm in the day so a dip in the pool was nice and refreshing.  There seemed to be a lot of staff around the hotel but none of them knew what they was meant to be doing and seemed to find the quietest parts of the hotel to avoid any kind of work especially around the pool where we found it very amusing watching the complete incompetence of their standard of hospitality and professionalism. That is until we tried getting some lunch which involved 2 wrong drinks cold food after 40mins wait guests leaving before their food arrived after waiting too long staff crying because they was being shouted at by the bar manager and wrong bills being handed out!  Breakfast is also very poor with buffet being offered all of which was cold bland and cheap especially the coffee which resembled some kind of luke warm chicory treacle sauce although washing it down with powdered orange squash (which in a country covered in orange trees seems ridiculous) is not a taste i'd recommend!  Overall I would highly suggest avoiding this hotel with it's useless arrogant staff and smelly hot rooms - it makes a Premier Inn look like a 7 star resort!!

Second time we had a room at the front overlooking entrance - VERY noisy from the street and the entrance. That room had a large rack in the bathroom handy for laundry and storing things. Each night we had to ask for additional towels to get to the standard 2 bath and 2 hand towels. TV with lots of channels WiFi best in the lobby. Extensive breakfast buffet either in the hotel or across the pool in the Palace hotel. Large beautiful grounds. Very good food in the restaurant (fish tagine was husband's favorite dish in Morocco) but service was a bit haphazard for our group of 14.

Our room was exactly as we had requested overlooking the pool and was extremely comfortable and spacious. The surrounding gardens were beautiful. Walking through the gardens you pass Marrakech casino and night-club and arrive at the sister hotel the Es Saadi Palace Hotel with its stunning gardens and enormous swimming pools. Note...you are not allowed to use the pool at the Palace Hotel if you are staying at the sister hotel unless you pay for a day pass or are a resident there.    Initially the service at breakfast and in the evening was sporadic...sometimes excellent but sometimes a little off the mark. However we did voice our concern with one of the managers and for the following 7 days everything was 100% spot on.    Breakfast is served buffet style and I think that if dinner was also served buffet style it would be much better. However the evening dinner menu was varied and very good with lots of choice.    The pool in March 6th-15th was really warm and kept at 17 degrees so no initial shiver on entering.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Jo D wrote a review Mar 2013,50,French charm in new Marrakech,We didn't do the traditional riad in Medina Marrakech experience as just wanted to chill for a week so stayed just outside in the quiet and upmarket Hivernage district near the glorious Mamounia Hotel. The Es Saadi Resort is split in two the stunning Palace with beautiful pool and landscaped gardens casino and Dior spa etc (worth it if you can afford it!) and the very satisfactory hotel. We stayed in a suite on the top (fifth) floor overlooking the pool with a view of the palm grove and Atlas mountains. The suite had a little kitchen area and lobby a large sitting room with desk and TV and balcony and a good sized double bedroom again with balcony plenty of wardrobes and a TV plus an ensuite bathroom with separate shower and separate loo. There was a big bowl of fruit waiting for us on arrival and flower petals scattered everywhere - a nice touch. There was some noise at night from people leaving the casino (I think mainly the concierge's yelling for taxis!) and the rooms were unbearably hot at night as no proper air-conditioning plus our european plugs didn't fit the sockets for some reason. But those little niggles aside our room was great and having a balcony you could lie on in the afternoon to get some privacy away from the pool was brilliant. The spa was great to - I had the most amazing hammam body scrub and massage - highly recommended. The gardens around the resort are beautiful filled with orange trees and huge palms. The breakfast room was a bit dark but food plentiful and was great when weather improved and we could sit outside by the pool. The restaurant for dinner was superb and we had some wonderful meals - top tip filet steak flambed by your table-side. All the staff are really friendly and helpful and as this is a French-owned hotel if you can speak a smattering of French that will be a big help. Loved Marrakech especially the parks and gardens (the Majorelle at 10am before the crowds get there is an absolute must and don't miss out of the berber museum there also). We really enjoyed a carriage (caleche) ride through the kasbah at evening when everyone gathering for supper and the sun is just setting. We paid 250dh for this... (about 25 euros) probably too much but that is the downside of Marrakech - you have to haggle for everything and negotiate a price before you do a thing even for a taxi. We got ripped off in the souks because we had only just arrived were tired it was raining we were splashed with mud and not in the mood for arguing over the cost of things we didn't even really want to buy! So if you're going souvenir hunting be prepared and make sure you know exactly how much your pound is worth! Will definitely go back as this is a great winter sun destination with culture scenery an almost biblical sense of history and atmosphere and good food and hotels. Top tip - restaurant Table du Marche near the Hivernage Hotel is a hip continental restaurant serving great French food with a Moroccan twist.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St Martins, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoD607

There does not seem to be anyone in charge of the waiting staff and they stsnd around waiting for someone to tell them what to do.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,janine B wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Charming hotel but restaurant poor,We just stayed in the Es Saadi hotel and on first impressions it does need a little TLC however whilst we were there several rooms were in the process of being painted and updated. Some of the carpets are threadbare in the lobby and the use of gas heaters there also detracted from the decor and the piano bar failed to induce relaxation as the music was far from in the background and it was difficult to hear conversation. Reception staff particularly the female are quite sullen though all staff speak good English. Rooms are spacious and clean with fresh sheets provided daily we did not have the problem of a bathroom smell as others seemed to have. We were on the fourth floor with great views of the pool Atlas Mountains and the city in the distance. The casino was opposite our room and we didn't notice the noise in the early hours as others did. The annoying problem with the room was the fact that it was far too warm and this was controlled by the hotel there is no independent ability to control the a/c also the tv channels have only 1 English speaking program. Each floor has its own member of staff in the evening to bring fresh towels turn back service and help with anything. The pool is clean though small and if the hotel is full sunbeds would be limited and these facilities cannot be used at the Palace also many prime beds are reserved by the attendant for those guests who pay him and who chose not to use them until early afternoon so either be early or take the chance of an available bed. Towels are provided.  Staff are very friendly and accommodating nothing appeared to be too much trouble. I celebrated a birthday whilst we were there and I was given a display of roses a beautiful cake and the whole room was decorated with rose petals. Though we did have fresh flowers daily.  The downside to the hotel is that the breakfast is served in the nearby Es Saadi Palace the continental choice was lovely with great variety of meats cheeses cereal and fruits however the hot choice was cold every day and offered the same limited choice - chicken sausage in congealed fat green beans potatoes tomatoes scrambled eggs. Also omelet or fried eggs are freshly made but takes ages.  We were half board and regretted this as the food was very poor in quality quantity and choice. The menu was limited to 3 choices of each a starter and main the starters were clearly all prepared though nicely presented and the mains portions were tiny and we are not greedy eaters we also found each chicken dish dry and unappetising. Dessert was always a choice of pastries however they were not replenished so if you prefer to dine later the choice is reduced. As in all the hotels the prices for wine and other alcoholic drinks are extortionate however the same bottles can be purchased for a third of the price at a supermarket locally.  Initially we contemplated staying at the Palace as it is new and more elegant however during our 7 day stay it was always deserted with no atmosphere. We used the gym which is also in the Palace ant the equipment was very good towels and water are provided.  Finally the hotel is within walking distance to the medina and the European shopping area though be careful when crossing at the major crossroads as anything goes.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rochdale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janineB440
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,telbay wrote a review Feb 2013,30,Not five star,First impression the staff are great the welcome excellent rooms are large take your own tea making equipment though as none provided. They are cleaned well and sheets turned down and room tidied at night. So far so good the food in the outside bar by the pool is good but they cannot cope if they are busy and get quite flustered easily the worst thing about this hotel is the breakfast this is chaos seem to be enough staff but they are not organised and guests can be seen foraging for simple things like napkins and cutlery don't leave your table un-attended as salt and pepper etc quite simply vanishes I agree with Steffen K's review breakfast is amazing- it is a frustrating and time consuming ordeal Mention this to the reception staff and they give an african/french shrug and say we know.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/telbay
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Edward D wrote a review Feb 2013,30,In need of a makeover,I stayed at Es Saadi Gardens 1st February to 6th February 2013 as part of a business conference. The hotel provides a fairly elegant impression on arrival but it soon becomes apparent that the Es Saadi Gardens Hotel is in a little need of TLC/refurb. The room was spacious and comfortable although I would recommend you request a pool view room as the alternative is less than inspiring. The decor of the rooms was looking a little tired but on the whole the room was clean and comfortable including table chairs and balcony. The breakfast for our group was provided in the nearby Es Saadi Palace Hotel which is a far grander prospect. The buliding is a lot more elegant and the quality of breakfast was very good (especially anything from the pastry chef outstanding); however this was let down by the ability to be fully open at 7am as advertised. For those breakfasting at this time there was the need to contend with the room still being set up. Service in the hotel was generally very slow compred to a standard I am used to internationally so a little patience is required when trying to catch the attention of a member of staff to order a drink or get a coffee at breakfast. My only real annoyance came on my final evening when I attempted to order room service. The room service menu stipulates that the full room service menu applies until 11pm; I was then a little surprised to be told at 6.30pm that the kitchen was closed and that I could only order a sandwich or cheese. I did then enquire as to why the information in the room was incorrect to which I never really received a credible answer. The saving grace for me was the hour or so I spent talking with Salima in the gift shop attached to the hotel. This is a little hidden around the corner from the hotel's pool but Salima's shop is full of all the gifts and nic nacs you would expect too find elsewhere in Morrocco but without the hassle of having to be dragged kicking and screaming into the shop. Please pay her a visit if you are staying in the hotel and help support her families long running business. On the whole the hotel was fine but for me if I was to return to Marrakech I would favour staying in a Riad.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled on business,Dubai,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G754OGedwardd

Tri-lingual staff made a real difference. Breakfast is amazing. We got a special rate on a low season package and were in room facing the main street which was a bit noisy and management would do well to install double glazing. Otherwise pay extra and get a quieter room overlooking the pool.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Lee G wrote a review Dec 2012,40,Great value for what we paid,Es Saadi Gardens hotel is not to be confused with the Es Saadi Palace Hotel next door but nonetheless a good hotel. We stayed in Marrakech for 4 nights here and the 15 minute walk into the main market square was great. It's a fantastic base for exploring the city. The pools are great and the service was fantastic from all the staff. We ate the breakfast in the hotel every day and went over to the palace hotel for a really fantastic meal on the first night and were treated like royalty. We got a good deal on Expedia so we found it to be good value for money but would not pay the full daily rate that we found on the back of the doors.    The only slight issue we had was that the toilet sometimes smelt a little sulphurous but nothing that closing the door didn't solve.    Bearing in mind it is a hotel in North Africa people need to realize that 5 star there does not = a 5 star in LA or Dubai.    We always try to stay somewhere new if we go back to the same place so we would not stay here again but we would recommend it to friends as a base to spend a long weekend in Marrakech if they got a good deal like we did.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Pitt Meadows, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeG994

It¬¥s a hotel with tradition not one of this boring standard hotels. I found the ambiance very charming and relaxing.  Every evening very pleasant live piano music sounded through the lobby so when I came home after a long working day or a tiring side seeing tour through the bussy city I relaxed strait away.  The food (breakfeast and restaurant) was excellent. The staff was ever so nice polite and obliging.  The rooms were calm nice and light flooded. The air conditioner is a dream (very silent).  Location: the historic center is within walk distance. If you are tired there are cabs in front oft the hotel.  So: no complains I really hope that this treasure will exist again for a long time.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Jonathan R wrote a review Nov 2012,30,You get what you pay for,Just finishing a 7 night stay at the the Es Saadi Hotel. Rating it as average is probably being kind but in this case I guess its my fault - I should have spent the extra money on a better place.    I work in the travel industry and this hotel is the kind of hotel I should know better. The website looks great and even on arrival the place looks quite impressive. But scratch the surface and you have a very average tourist class hotel. The kind that package tours thrive on.    The hotel is set in very attractive gardens and there is a nice (but very small) pool area. The lobby is also attractive but after a few days here you realise its not exactly opulent. just furnished with the kind of things that suggest classic oriental opulence. But it makes a decent first impression.    The hotel corridors are your first indication you're in a 3 star resort. The carpets are worn and stained and the place looks like it hasn't been renovated...... well ever.    Next stop - my room. Walls were freshly painted and there are nice-ish looking furnishings. But hang on.... whats that smell? The entire time I was in the room I had to keep the bathroom door tightly shut since I had the ever present smell of sewage emanating from every drain opening. Every day I would come back to my made up room and of course the bathroom door was open so the whole room smelt terrible. I had to seal it off open the balcony and air the place out.    Next even worse than the smell - the bed. I like a nice firm mattress but I can sleep pretty much anywhere. Anywhere that is until I tried these beds. Soft is not accurate. They're beyond soft. Where ever you put any pressure you would sink completely to the base of the bed. Turning over was difficult since you had to fight against the bed springs for purchase.    The rest of the room was ok. I had a nice balcony and the room was large and had plenty of room for storage. The key to this hotel is that it photographs well but photographs only entertain one of your senses and its the hotel's appeal to the other senses - touch smell etc. that leave much to be desired.    As far as facilities are concerned - the room service was good the breakfast adequate but certainly nothing special (although service at breakfast is trying). The rest I didn't use.    Location is good - its a 20 minute walk to the action of the souk etc.    Overall I should mark the hotel down for the bed and the smelly room but maybe I was just unlucky with the smell (since I haven't seen any other complaints) and perhaps other people don't mind soft (very very soft) beds.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Netanya, Israel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonorose
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,527Trees1 wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Christine,I stayed at this hotel during the first week in October 2012 on a half board basis. I was one of 6 women (60 plus). The hotel was in the Hivernage area of Marrakech. This is a nice area and close to the old part of the city.  The hotel gardens are very nice especially at night when the hundreds of ornate lamps are lit. It is nice to walk round to the 'Palace' and walk through the Palace interior and have a cup of (free) mint tea in the reception area.  We all found the hotel staff helpful and eager to please. Especially those looking after the bedrooms. All our bedrooms had been recently repainted and was very clean. There were nice toiletries and fluffy yellow towels and dressing gowns. We had fresh roses put in our rooms every couple of days. And there was always an excellent fresh flower arrangement of roses and lilies on the landing. Although pleasant and friendly the waiters appeared to need a lot of training especially those working at the pool snack bar (where lunch was served) and those serving breakfast. At the beginning of the week the were not organised and were 'hap-hazard'. Tables were not laid up for lunch until customers ordered food. They would return to the kitchen empty handed often appeared flustered when you asked for something and seemed unable to do or think about two things at the same time. consequently the service was often very slow. E.G. I was asked what I wanted to drink at breakfast and I asked for tea which was bought to me very quickly but had to ask two waiters for a cup! The second half of the week a new restaurant manager took charge and there was a distinct change. Staff were more organised and proceedings flowed as they should.  The pool was wonderful I have never been in a pool that was so warm. There was nice wooden sunbeds with thick foam mattresses. The pool attendant would bring towels and insisted on putting them on your sunbed. If you wanted to move he would move your bed for you. Nothing was too much trouble.  One night the hotel organised a free Morrocan evening this included our evening meal and an assortment of entertainment - Belly dancer acrobats snake charmer musicians and dancers.  When venturing out side and using either a taxi or horse and carriage you must arrange the price before you get into the vehicle!  If you take a trip into the mountains and visit a Berber Market and even if you don't need anything please please buy some jewellery/trinkets (that are very cheap) from the locals as they are so painfully poor!,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/527Trees1
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Robert M wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Excellent food,Four of us (60+ adults) stayed here mid October. The hotel is very well located in the Hivernage being a beautifully laid out and well-wooded area about 20 mins walk from the Place Jemaa El Fna (where it all happens at night) or 50Dn (¬£3.70) by taxi. The staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel is very comfortable clean and spacious.    Being very much a French-speaking city with heavy Parisienne influence we expected decent food and we were not disappointed. The cuisine was exceptionally good (even on a half board basis - well worth the nominal extra cost). We were out exploring the city or Atlas mountains most days therefore only took lunch by the pool once and it was very good and not expensive (approx 120Dn (¬£8.50) including a soft drink. Service was also fair but it depended on the number of guests all wishing to eat at the same time - moral?

The service however was terrible especially at the pool bar.Long waits for service even after ordering and a casual could not care less attitude of staff. Several mix ups with bills and it was all very haphazard.The final straw was a mixed grill with raw chicken and sausage in the restaurant. There was no concern expressed by the staff and I had to raise the matter with the restaurant manager before there was any acknowledgement of the seriousness of their failure especially in a 4* establishment.  The breakfasts were poor and suffered both from inadequate provisioning ( no yogurts on 2 morningsinsufficent cutlery esp for cereals) and inefficent staff apparently working without direction.Tea/coffee took 20 mins to arrive after ordering on one morning and waiter took a similar length of time to even take an order despite attempts to attract attention.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,RJT06 wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Great,Twenty seven of us have just returned from a three night stay at this lovely hotel. The staff were all extremely helpful and attentive. All of the front of house staff spoke very good English although the waiters didn't which wasn't a problem as they just went and got someone who did. The waiting staff were pretty slow and we felt the need to ask several times for whatever we had ordered but this is Africa and they are very laid back people.    The only 'complaint' is that we found the night times very noisy with people going to and from the Casino which is situated in the grounds of the hotel. We always carry earplugs and therefore had no problem so go prepared and all will be well.    We go as a group to a different city each year and this is the first time we have had a pool and we certainly preferred it. We had an excellent guide arranged through the hotel who was prepared to stay on with us for the afternoon as well as the pre-arranged morning tour.    We had a super meal in the hotel on the first night and then visited two restaurants on the other nights. The first was a French restaurant only five minutes from the hotel called The Villa Hivernage. It was SUPERB. The food the staff and room were perfect. It is a bit more expensive than the others but well worth it. The second was an Italian/Morrocan restaurant 10 minutes walk from the main square called PepeNero which was really good. They were very attentive from the first e-mail to the end of the evening. The only issue with this restaurant was that the portions were enormous and we simply could not finish what we had ordered.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"East Midlands, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJT06

The hotel is lovely clean and staff friendly and helpful especially the concierge who speaks fluent English. Most staff speak English but French is more common.    The pool is very relaxing with no loud music being played. Just the sound of the fountain in the background. Pool boy is very attentive and will move parasols and sun loungers if needed. Might not be very older child friendly in terms of teenagers wanting to play ball games or jump on lilos as this wasn't allowed but it was refreshing to not have loud booming music being played  all day!!    The hotel is about a 15 min walk from the Medina Walls and prob a further 10 min walk to the Square. Well worth a trip both at day and night. The concierge can arrange for you to have an English speaking guide should you want one (around 200d) and well worth it! Be prepared to haggle for everything and don't worry about offering a low price and offending - its part of the fun!    Trips - we did the historic bus tour and the oasis tour and hopped off when there was something we wanted to see or explore. Tickets are valid for 24 or 48 hours. We also took a 4x4 to the foothills of the Atlas Mountains and saw the Orika Valley - well worth it but tiring in the sun! The Moroccan evening was a bit disappointing but the food was very good...a bit like an African Wild West Show!!    We felt completely safe and did some of the walks ourselves as set out in the guide books but do take a French phrase book if your French is a bit rusty!    No upset stomachs food at hotel was excellent. We were half board so the evening meal was a 3 course European menu (choice of three starters & main with a desert trolley or ice cream). Alternatively you could have the Moroccan dinner of either a meat or fish tangine - whichever was on offer but delicious! We didn't have a bad meal the whole ten days.    We went to the Casino as it was attached to the sister hotel (the Palace) and this was a bit disappointing as it was very smoky full of men and they didn't speak any English. So for the beginner it was very difficult to understand what to do and how to play.    All together a brilliant time and we will definitely go back.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hadleigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763Alison
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Adam C wrote a review Aug 2012,30,Typical large hotel but not 5 star,In spite of booking rooms for 2 adults & 2 children on the morning of our arrival we had to fight to get 2 rooms together. Initially we were allocated rooms at opposite ends of the hotel and when we requested 2 rooms together or at least near to each other we were told that the hotel was full. This was in spite of there being availability only 2 hours before we arrived. When it was clear that the hotel were not going to budge we decided to leave and at this point we were offered a 'free upgrade' to adjoining rooms which were identical to the ones that we were initially offered?! It was not clear how they were 'upgraded' and is not the service expected from any hotel let alone a 5 star one.    We only ate breakfast here which was poor for this class of hotel. The staff were not particularly friendly and the hotel is worn and dated.    There is a large pool but you need to be up early to 'book' a sunbed otherwise you'll be sitting in the shade?!    The hotel is in a good location and there are local restaurants within walking distance and it's only 10 minutes to the Medina by cab.    Overall a disappointing 5 star hotel but as we were only staying for 3 nights we put up with it.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adam1630
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,simone6766 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Really want to come back,"I was a little concerned having read mixed reviews about this hotel however my teenage daughter and I are on the last day of a weeks holiday at Es Saadi Gardens and Resort Hotel and have both had a wonderful time and want to come back. The hotel is located in a quiet residential area away from the madness of the medina which trust me is a good thing. A taxi to the main square is about 20 dirham or it is a 20 minute walk.    One thing you should be aware of is that ""Hotel"" Saadi and the ""Palace"" Saadi whilst part of the same group and also in the same grounds sharing the same facilities (restaurants nightclub spas etc) have separate swimming pools for their respective guests. The Palace is a more expensive accommodation of the two and if you are looking for the ultimate in luxury and have the accompanying budget then go for this one. The only difference in your experience will be the room you stay in and the size of the pool. Other than that the service and facilities available are of the same high standard.    The best thing about this hotel is the food in the gastronomic restaurant which is exquisite. We came full board which I would recommend and so have eaten there nearly every lunch and dinner. My grandfather used to be head chef of the Savoy London many years ago and so I know my food. I had the best roast beef I have had in many years for dinner last night their home made ice cream is a delight and I could go on and on.. If you enjoy good food their main restaurant is a must even if you are staying elsewhere dine here as you won't be disappointed.    The staff are very polite and helpful (we speak French and this is the language we have been using)    The grounds are lovely and an after dinner stroll amongst the palm trees is a must.  There is also a lovely spa and a Casino and although I haven't been to the nightclub it had people from outside the hotel queuing up on a Tuesday night so it is clearly popular.    The hotel itself was built in the 1960's and the decoration is traditional and a little faded but the materials and used are top quality and it still has a sense of grandeur . The reception is mainly marble with a piano lounge bar and ample seating. We are staying in a Standard double room with a garden view which is good size and the air conditioning is set to a certain pre determined temperature so cannot be regulated but you have your own off and on switch. We are staying at the hottest time of year and we have been comfortable. There is a mini bar safe small balcony flatscreen TV small desk and wardrobe with plenty of space .The bed is very comfortable and big. The rooms are not high tech but are comfortable and I would advise a garden or pool view as opposed to city (road). The towels are changed daily and the maid has been charming and efficient.    The pool boys and pool restaurant staff are very helpful and the loungers are wooden with nice thick mattresses. The pool is a good size and clean. Unlike a previous hotel we stayed in there is full sunlight all day which is what we wanted. There are large parasols for those who are looking for shade. The pool is surrounded by gardens and palm trees.    The only two constructive criticisms I have relate to the buffet breakfast:  1.The pigeons at breakfast time as it is served outdoors. I have a bit of a phobia about pigeons I have to say and dislike them coming close when I am eating. I hope the manager will try and sort out this problem before my next visit as they are a bit off putting. A continental breakfast can be served in your room at no extra charge if booked in advance.  2. The breakfast is buffet style with waiters coming to the tables to bring tea and coffee. I think it would be more usual for a five star hotel to have someone cooking eggs (fried/poached/omelette) to order as opposed to pre cooked scrambled eggs.      These are minor points and there is a good range of sliced fresh fruit pastries salad and cerial sausages tomato and scrambled egges and mint tea tea or coffee and fresh orange juice.    We have had a splendid time and found it to be very good value.hotel with great service and excellent range of facilities with the chef of the gastronomique restaurant and staff making the difference between a good stay and an excellent one.

The food decent but breakfast out-of doors can lead to raids by songbirds that are a bit disturbing if not particularly violent.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hong Kong, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kowloonie
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Ihearttheusa wrote a review Aug 2012,20,Not worthy of 5 Stars,My partner and I have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Es Saadi Gardens Hotel and we experienced many problems.....  To start with my partner is a wheelchair user and having scoured Tripadvsior for 5 star hotels which are wheelchair accessible- we booked the hotel months before our trip. 48 hours before we were due to travel we received a phone call to say that the hotel wasn't accessible and we needed to upgrade to one of their poolside bungalows (at an extra charge of 20 Euros a night). Reluctantly and faced with very short notice we were forced to upgrade so as not to ruin our holiday.  Upon arrival we were shown to our 'upgraded' room and were very disappointed to walk into what could only be described as a sauna as the air condition was not working. With outside temperatures in excess of 48 degrees C the room was unbearable. We immediately pointed this out to the porter who didn't really understand. We immediately called reception and they promptly sent someone over. The member of staff fiddled around with the unit and claimed it was fixed. We were horrified to find it was now blowing warm air!!! We once again called reception and this time 2 members of staff arrived. They both fiddled with the machine and then left claiming it was working- still blowing warm air. We again called reception who again sent a man over- who then told us the water needed to be changed and to give him 20 minutes he never returned. One hour later and having fully cooked in the room we decided to insist on moving rooms. We were moved to another bungalow with 2 air con units- one in bedroom one in lounge. Bedroom unit worked- lounge didn‚Äôt. We reported this and yet another man came out fiddled around and left- 5 minutes later the unit stopped working- this continued for our entire stay.  In addition the air con saga- over the course of 5 days we experienced a number of problems and on our 5th day we asked the manager to come out to our room so we could show him our list of complaints -which were as follows;  1. air con problems ( as described above)  2. Bed sheets were not changed for 5 days!!  3. Bathroom only had 1 glass for 2 people and it was not washed for 5 days- full of toothpaste marks and stains  4. Light in hall not working  5. TV in lounge out of tune  6. Electrics very dodgy- some switches caused the power to go out in room and as a result room safe popped open on 2 occassions.  7. Problems with staff service in bar- placed order and then never got drinks.  Having brought the issues to the manager‚Äôs attention he was very attentive and apologetic. He immediately had the issues resolved; however air con could not be fixed. Following on from our complaint for the last 2 days our room was cleaned and bed sheets replaced every day. We were suddenly provided with slippers fancy soap fruit basket and fresh roses in our room. We thought this was as a way of an apology but having spoken to other guests in the hotel we discovered that they had been a standard occurrence and we had just been forgotten!!  Upon check out we expected there to be some sort of discount on our bill as an apology for the appalling service we had received but were shocked to see there was not. We however insisted on there being a reduction and 5 days upgrade charge was removed from our bill- reluctantly.  Overall the waiting staffs were attentive and friendly as long as you tipped them but as soon as you did not tip the service was poor- with the exception of Fatima who worked the Breakfast- who brought fresh pancakes to my partner every morning without him having to ask. On our last day- the staff obviously check who is leaving- and they swarmed around us trying to provide us with the 5 star service we should have had from day 1- obviously trying to earn their tip.  Restaurant Gastronomique was OK but quite pricey for what you had- 320 Dirhums per head for 3 courses ( about 29 euros) not including drinks. We found a nice place around corner from hotel 'Cafe ExtraBlatt' where we had 3 courses 5 drinks and the total bill was 380 dirhums. It had a nice ambience but was 'american' style menu.    In general the hotel (and waiting staff!) appear tired and in need of some TLC. With a little more attention to detail and care when it comes to the guests and their rooms the hotel could be good.  Don‚Äôt be fooled- this is by no means a 5 star hotel- I would rate this at most 3.  We are a couple in our 30s who travel a great deal so have experience of many hotels around the world.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swansea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ihearttheusa
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,mbidani wrote a review Aug 2012,20,how dissapointing!,My husband and I stayed at Es Saadi hotel for 3 nights mid July as a part of our honeymoon. Overall it was quite dissapointing . The rooms are clean  tidy and equipped just right although they would do with a refurbishment as it definitely was not 4* standard. There is no option to control the air cond temperature which left the room feeling quite warm  specially at night. room service was alright but extremely slow ( iron was delievered after 3rd call to the reception good 40 mins after the first call) the biggest let down of this place is the staff ( reception pool staff and waiters) . my husband is moroccan and the treatment and attitude he was getting from the staff was incredible to the point that he was having arguments with them as they would mostly ignore him or answer in a very rude maner.  One of the cases was with a young man who he asked to put pool towels in our sun bed but he refused to do for a reason he said it was too windy but when i came down the room and did asked for it it was done immediately the thing that seriousely let me down as being fake about guests . same thing with the breakfast waiters . only time the staff would give attention to my husbands re  quests is if i would speak to the them .  the hotel also does not have a shop which is a bit annoying as theres no shops within the walking distance.,Date of stay: July 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbidani
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,James L wrote a review May 2012,40,A hotel you can rely on,The beauty of this hotel is the fact that it has been family owned since about 1962 so the staff have experience and know exactly what they are doing when it comes to customer service. The hotel feels very welcoming. The food is good - particularly at the poolside restaurant. The more expensive interior restaurant was a bit touch and go. We had chateau briand which was frankly a bit of a disaster.    On the whole I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a worry-free break based on customer experience. You can walk to the main square too in about 15 mins.

We noticed that staff are both cared for and treated properly and were professionally patient with the odd rude customer. Better control of the air con should be planned for. Most staff have some english some are fluent; english classes for staff are run. The gardens with 50 staff were a delight and the pools just right to use.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,VirtueFor wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Magical Marrakech!,Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It delivered from start to finish.  The rooms were large with a lovely view over Marrakech. Clean tidy with the use of robes to visit the spa and pool. It was very quiet and we never heard anything from the casino or nightclub.    The spa is really good value and its wonderfully relaxing. I had a Turkish Bath with black soap scrub and a full body massage. I would recommend using the Spa as the treatments are good and a lot cheaper than in the UK.    The hotel is in walking distance of the main square but I would recommend getting a taxi (Check with hotel how much taxi should be as drivers like to make up prices) The hotel will arrange taxis tours guides and exchanging money.    Breakfast was good - choice of hot and cold items. When you relax by the pool you are offered oranges from the trees around the grounds of the hotel.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,trvlnfamily wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Beautiful hotel - great rooms,We spent two nights at this hotel and were very happy with our stay. The rooms were big and the beds were quite comfortable. The lobby is beautiful and the breakfast was the best we had in Morocco (you can eat outside by the pool). The hotel will exchange travelers' checks for you too. The hotel also has several shops which sells all sorts of essential personal supplies in case you forget anything. There was a very nice spa which we did not have time to use. The heated pool is great so bring your swimsuit.    The concierge and doorman were superb! They arranged for a driver to take us to the nearby Jardin Majorelle which should not be missed. The driver waited for us too which was nice. The Jemaa El Fnaa is within walking distance.    The only downside was the noise from the street at night but we were so tired that it did not keep us up for too long.

Reserved a Junior suite whilst a good size furnishings tired as was the rest of the hotel. Don't expect a good nights sleep woken up in the early hours each morning by the raucous noise from people leaving the casino and nightclub. Not helped by the extremely hot room necessitating having the windows open due to the lack of Air conditioning when this was mentioned to reception the response was to turn it off!  Breakfast was at times farcical having to lay your own table search for cutlery and the buffet was second rate one of the worse experienced.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,mark f wrote a review Oct 2011,20,Not Child Friendly,We stayed for 4 nights and found that there was nothing for children under 14 to do. They cannot play with balls on the property including the pool. The tennis court is the only facility and it is very hard to book as lessons for the general are held on it in the mornings. Service is very poor- very French in fact! The rooms are clean but somewhat dated and not very fresh smelling. The hotel is a 15-20 minute walk to the City and you have to cross at least four 4 lane roads with no lights or crossing! The only plus points are the reception is quite smart the beds comfy and breakfast is decent. I would not recommend - go for the Sofitel next door which looks superb!!,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,Marrakesh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markf820
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Auntsandra wrote a review Oct 2011,30,Good but could do better,My daughter and I stayed at the Es Saadi Hotel for just one night. The hotel itself was clean and well presented.  Our room was a standard room with a city view we had a small balcony with table bench and chairs. I personally felt that the city view was more interesting than overlooking the gardens.  The room was tastefully decorated with two large beds joined together. On our arrival in our room the staff bought in a vase of roses.  While my daughter lounged by the pool I walked through the gardens which are well maintained.  We had lunch by the pool and the staff were friendly and polite. Although they did forget to give us napkins.  On arrival reception had given us a plan of the site and told us we were welcome to visit the Gardens and the Palace.  After lunch my daughter and I visited the pool behind the Palace and whilst I was ordering tea at the pool bar my daughter was told she could not use the pool at the Palace. There was no-one in the pool and only four people on loungers around the pool. I could however purchase tea which was 10 dirhams more expensive at the Palace than at the hotel. I must admit at this point this grumpy old lady felt the urge to jump in the pool fully clothed just to see what the miserable pool attendant would do alas I did not.  The hotel brochure referred to bath robes but we did not have any in our room.  But my main gripe with the hotel was that I had order breakfast in our room at 5.00am as we were being collected from the hotel at 5.30am for the drive to the airport.  After chasing up room service our very small breakfast appeared at 5.15am which just gave us time for a quick cup of tea before having to leave.  What I saw of the hotel was good and the sun loungers at the hotel were in better condition than those at the Palace which had definitely seen better days.  The majority of the staff were friendly but the problem with breakfast annoyed me. Overall I would probably stay at the Hotel again.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntsandra
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,TracyTrow wrote a review Aug 2011,40,The poor relation of the Palace es Saadi but very good in parts.,First impressions of the hotel on arrival are that it is a little dated though very well presented. The welcome from the staff was warm and genuine. We booked a room with a rollaway bed (3 guests) but were given just a double. A bed was provided speedily but it was not possible to move around the room and to be fair to the hotel they offered to change the room before we ventured to suggest it. It was referred to several times as an 'upgrade' however and not simply what we had paid for. The air conditioning did not function well making for some very uncomfortable nights. We booked half board and ate each night at the Gourmet restaurant next to the pool and were never disappointed. Exquisite food and excellent service. Breakfast was an odd affair with the usual buffet selection supplemented by cooked but cold items - cold fried potato anyone? The tables were invadede at any opportunity by sparrows and pigeons who helped themselves to sugar etc between sittings. They would have been more useful eating the ants making their daily pilgrimage across the pastries. We were encouraged by everyone we met at the hotel to go and look at the fantastic pool in the same grounds - a huge affair the size of a small pricipality. Sadly when we went to join the (literally) half a dozen other people there to swim we were told in no uncertain terms that it was for the use of The Palace guests only. Walks around the grounds near to the private villas also elicited concerned questions form hotel security. A shame as the website boasts use of 20 acres of grounds and two outdoor pools. The Casino was mostly closed for renovations and the nightclub was never to be found. Not a problem for us as a family but not mentioned on the website. Our only disppointment with the otherwise excellent staff was with the pushy concierege who phoned the room several times to push the sale of excursions and several times again later in the week asking for payment.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Eric wrote a review Aug 2011,20,"YUCKY YUCKY, yuck yuck!","Horrible horrble trip. First be advised that the star system in Marrakech is not consistent with the rest of the world. I was expecting to stay at a 5* property. I have stayed in a best western that was nicer than this falling apart junky property. The shower handle came apart in my hand on my shower after checking in. I reported the problem to staff and they moved my room. The new room was not as bad as the last but had its problems. I tried to meet with the Owner at this point as I had conferred with tripadvisor after checking into the hotel - instead of before booking - big mistake!!!! After reading other reviews which stated the owner was around and available I tried meeting with the owner to discuss my problems as well as the fact that the 5* star property I booked was a run down 3*. The staff suggested the owner was unavailable the night I checked in. I tried to meet with her the next two days even making an appointment on the day prior to departure. Prior to meeting with the owner I asked housekeeping to let me into the first room I occupied. Sure enough the staff had replace the broken shower without fixing it!!!!!!! I brought the broken piece to the meeting. The owner did not show but the manager tried to put me in a suite a bigger lousy room to appease me. I wanted to discuss with the owner why they purposely marketing there property as a 5* when they know it is not. The manager actually said ""Stars stay at this hotel!!!"" I think he was talking about Bogie and Bacall when the property was built. The food buffet is gross! Even the omelette station food was nasty. The boxed cereal and day old leftover bread from the palace where the best bets.

There was a good breakfast outside round the pool and garden. We thought the dining room food and staff was wonderful.    We came to relax and sit in the sun as well as sightsee so the hotel and location were great for us - close enough to walk into the fascinating but mad old town but located in the beginning of the pretty and much more quiet new town. The room was a little tired with a bit of a chain hotel feel but it was spacious and comfortable. We were perfectly happy with it.    We wanted a good sized pool with loungers so we didn't want to stay in a riad and the hotels a level up cost the earth. The good hotels in Marrakech all seem overpriced but we came with a half board package deal that seemed reasonable to us.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,VirgoQualitySeeker47 wrote a review Mar 2011,40,A quiet retreat amongst trees but short distance to the hustle and bustle of central Marrakech,We spent a week here from late February into early March. The hotel has a calm elegance some would say dated but we found it a refreshing change from hotels that have gone ultra modern which are often uncomfortable and not practical. It is immaculately clean rooms nothing special but comfortable with enormous bed (larger than 6') balcony with bench table and chair bathroom-could do with updating we had to stand in the bath to turn the taps on in our room where there was an over bath shower not very powerful but they need to conserve water Large TV mini bar etc.  Breakfasts were good with excellent coffee most days it was warm enough to sit outside either in the sun or under shaded trees. Pool loungers were always available just a few people reserving them with various objects at the start of our stay but once the half-termers had gone this finished and wasn't necessary. Lunch can be taken by the pool and the food was good and service usually good - just slow at bringing the bill to sign afterwards. We ate in the hotel a couple of times and found the food and service very good and did not think it was overpriced for a hotel which are usually a bit more than a restaurant in town.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we would stay in this area again rather than in Marrakech even though the Riads there are lovely we loved having mature trees and gardens to look at around the pool. It is a short walk to the centre (with busy roads to cross) we usually got a small taxi for under ¬£3.  The only downside to the hotel is that the rooms with the Atlas mountain and pool view (which we paid extra for) are opposite the Casino and nightclub which could be very noisy when people were leaving between 4 and 5 am! people shouting cars tooting horns etc. This was particularly bad on a Friday night when we were there we had our balcony doors open to let in the air it would help if the hotel improved the air conditioning which just seemed to blow but wasn't very cool. You could then shut the windows and probably not hear the noise  We would however still consider going back to this hotel we liked the ambience and the piano bar where most nights there was a pianist and violinist. This probably appeals to a more mature clientele.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Australia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirgoQualitySeeker47

Although in some ways it is more like a 4 star hotel we preferred it to the more expensive anonomous chain experience. We had booked the cheapest room available but were upgraded to a pool view room perhaps because there was a small amount of building work going on at the front (hidden behing a tent and I never heard anything). We arrived in the early hours of the morning because our flight was delayed but were efficiently welcomed. Breakfast could be taken outside by the pool which was great. The gardens are absolutely beautiful and you are free to wander round to the Es Saadi Palace and the Casino which are all in the same gardens. Also ate dinner in the hotel on two nights and the service was excellent on one and ok on the second - food good on both - restaurant old school French in feel great pastry chef! The hotel was slightly dated (the Rolling Stones stayed here in the 60s) but it was clean comfortable and the service was five star. One or two people have mentioned noise being an issue but I never was disturbed and I'm a light sleeper. The location is also very good near enough to walk to the souk etc. but nice to come back to the relative peace here. I would also recommend the restaurant at the Hivernage Hotel round the corner (Table du Marche) more of a buzz / younger feel and more experimental cooking.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFE21

The Hotel is tired and up itself with no attention to customer service .    Rooms - - Small - dirty and what you would expect from a 3 star hotel. They need repainting - reflooring and defo new bathrooms.    Staff - in the restaurant very up themselves and dam rude . One of our party was a vegitarian and you would think that this was the first time anyone in Morroco has asked for a veg option.    Pool -- small crowded and the service from the pool bar Rubbish.    Cost - expensive for food and drinks and all served with a glare. PS Drinks all come with a nice bowl of stail crisps NICE.    Hotel front desk - we arrived at 5 PM only to be told the rooms are not ready so go and sit in the corner and wait - - no drink - no sorry - and as the hotel had some kind of converence on so the pool area was out of action - no bar to go to. The pool area was laid out for an evening meal for the converence - so we all got to spleep at about 2 am when the drunk delegates peeled off to the casino or bed. Great first night!!    Trip to the Atlas Mountains - we went on an organised trip via the front desk - basically it is a straight drive up into the mountains along a single road. You join all the other trips in a convoy stopping at rubbish shops on route and at good picture stops - were you are jumped on by the local lads selling crap. This happens all morning and into the aftrenoon. You then stop for lunch - we were all ill following this meal and three weeks on I am still off work.    After lunch (raw chicken - salad (probably washed in their toilet) - a rubbish veg dish and fruit) you push on to the end of the road. from here you have the option to walk an hour to a waterfall for stay in the village for 30 minutes. Well this was where things got intersting as the driver stated our options and most people in the Van said they did not want to go to the water fall - unfortunately a German couple and a Spainish Couple did - so a real fight broke out - long story short the driver lost his temper and we were all pushed back into the van a driven at speed back to Marrakech - what a waste of ¬£140 - (cost for 4 people)    All in all go some place else and save your money.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Worthing, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager809726

We stayed if I remember in room 13 - very lucky for us. It was right in front of the main pool (which I swear was heated) but we had privacy with our own veranda area shaded by orange vines. Over the course of the week I would have many a coffee here or be browsing the net with the free wifi right underneath those orange vines.    The hotel seems to have gathered some criticism recently for being dated and way past its heyday. Quite honestly I don't know what they are talking about. Yes the architecture is of a bygone era of the '70s but it is by no means an eye soar when once in the grounds and the rooms (or at least the one I was in) are throughly up to date!    Enter our room and you walk into a living room complete with a plush sofa and tastefull arab on the walls. Venture further in and come into a hallway complete with wardrobe space for couples used to travelling with 6 suitcases! The bathroom was very well equiped and clean with a fantastic waterfall shower....    The bedroom itself was also wonderfull kitted out with a nice flat screen tv and great super king bed. The deco throughout the room was fitting for the environment and location setting of marrakech.    The staff were very friendly and responsive particularly the chaps at the conceirge who happily helped and suggested us with tours restaurants taxis etc. The pnly complaint on the service side that I would mention to you would be the housekeeping department who while were friendly enough they did take ages to bring extra toilet rolls or towels and on one occasion it did take them more than 45mins to bring the iron.    Breakfast was very good. Full continental and local cuisine and served until quite late in the morning. We did not dine however in the hotel...... why would you want to when the whole of Marrakech is waiting outside for you?    So for myself and my partner a great experience in this hotel which is also a 20min walk from Jebel el Fna the world famous square so location is also quite good. Casino and clubs and bars are all within the immediate vicinity.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,FBD12 wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Home for home,Our first visit to the Saadi was in 1974 when the hotel was little more than 10 years old. We were enchanted by the place and have stayed there every year since then - often twice. Altogether we have spent more than 115 weeks (over two years!) of our lives there and we still love it. It is family owned and family run and this shows. The staff have remained loyal and we now regard them - as well as the family (we have known four generations) as friends.    We have always stayed at the original Saadi hotel although we did spend one week at the magnificent new Saadi Palace last year. Old habits I suppose but having the same room for so many years does make it feel like home from home.    With several restaurants to choose from we found the food superb this year. Like all hotels there have been lapses in the past but absolutely none this time. We have already booked another three weeks in October.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Oxford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FBD12

We were in hotel. With pools spa casino shaded pathways etc.  Comfortable rooms both pool and main restaurants served reasonable food but a couple of dishes rather experimental and needed refining. Waiter service not really 5 star but adequate with rough edges although very willing and friendly - mainly French speaking (as well as Arabic)  Had seen reports of noise but absolutely no problems in our case..

Immaculate spacious room magnificent pool and grounds no noise whatsoever. The desk service however was sub-par throughout the complex.

Quietly situated hotel that is slightly dated but that adds to the intimate and elegant feeling the hotel gives.  It is a very individual hotel that offers excellent service from the staff;fantastic cuisine in a sedate and timely manner. It is of an era gone by coupled with a quartet playing music in the bar most evenings.    The casino and club are excellent and at the end of the night you can retire to a spotlessly clean quiet room.    The oriental spa is excellent and very relaxing.

Pool was very busy so you had to bag your lounger early in the morning which was a bit of a hassle especially when people put their towels on the them and went away for most of the day and then came back for a quick swim!! We never ate dinner at the hotel but went to The Palace which was far superior unfortunately we couldn't use their pool though!! Casino was a bit of a dead loss and a bit grubby.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,cris1970 wrote a review Mar 2008,50,Recommended!,"I was a bit worried when I saw older reviews but I must say this is one nice place. Certainly not the most luxurious nor the most effective and definitely not a design hotel but the overall effect of the friendliness of the staff the rooms (clean spacious and in style with the city - a mixture of modern and old styles) the pools the garden and the great setting of the breakfast and much more makes it a great base for exploring Marrakesh. And the city is a truly great place to explore where tourism goes hand in hand with local culture and both Moroccans and visitors share many of the same experiences - an wonderful feeling compared with some other Mediterranean charter-tour destinations.    I stayed at the Es Saadi during Easter I was welcome with a smile by the porters and left with a smile seven days after. They certainly do make you feel a valued guest - for example when entering or leaving the hotel the porters do invariably open it for you without any smugness.    The pool areas (there are actually two pools one in what I understand being a newly rebuilt part of the complex) and the gardens are great - there's a lovely bougainvillea on the side wall and the sound of waterfall welcomes you to the gardens and the outdoors breakfast area greatly arranged under orange trees.  I understand the hotel has just being renovated in the pool area and some minor work was still going on around it but nothing disturbing or particularly noticeable.    Breakfast itself is a great experience visually - once you get the it that is: the morning organization is perhaps the hotel's weaker bit - it was a bit chaotic and the personnel was maybe understaffed so on occasion it could go some time before enough glasses were available or coffee was actually brought to the table. It can well just be the somewhat slower pace of the city. But again the maitre and most of the personnel were so courteous and service minded that made one forgive easily little mishaps that in other places and settings would never be condoned.    The room was spacious clean and stylishly congruent with the town from the choice of materials to the pinkish colors. Not perhaps to everyone's tastes but - let's face it - the entire town is pink and proudly so: you cannot go to the moon and complain about the sand. :-)    My room was facing the road and not the pool but as the Hivernage quarter is pretty quiet I had no noise problems to speak of (I sleep pretty hard tough). Got a fruit basket on arrival which was very welcome since I was starving. Room service is good - basically the same menu    There were a few hiccups - the TV remote was missing from the room the bathroom lights broke during one night but they were all handled swiftly and with a smile by the excellent staff - we got the remote the lights were repaired minutes after I made it known - so again really good service.    Marrakesh is a place where modern and old meet and go hand in hand: the location of the hotel allows to enjoy the best of both. The medina - old city - is a ten minutes walk away so I almost never took a taxi back and forth. The quarter where the hotel lies is modern visually regular and peaceful - something quite soothing after the vibrant crowded chaos and vitality of the old city. Also some of the best ""modern"" restaurant and clubs of the city are literally around the corner - it's not bad sometimes to actually come out in calm area after eating.    Overall a very recommendable place and one I may be going back to if I want to visit Marrakesh again and decide against the common alternative - a riad - which is an altogether different experience than a modern hotel.",Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sarpsborg, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cris1970

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,asucker wrote a review Oct 2007,20,Tired hotel - not a 5 star - by an international rating,The Es Saadi Hotel has had a remarkable history - and one would have though that they hotel would want to continue to capitalise upon its past successes.    However today you find a tired and dirty hotel. The investment in general maintenance and cleaning (especially the outside areas around there pool etc) was clearly lacking. The number of broken and missing tiles around the pool area was surprising. However the birds mess on and around the tables on the terrace (every day) was shocking.    We only stayed one week. We seriously considered moving to the Sofitel just around the corner which looked far superior and most importantly clean (inside and out).    The carpets in out room were threadbare the bathroom is so dated and had electrical sockets broken and loose in the wall the room door had no door handle - so opening the door was difficult - several light bulbs didn;t work either.    Really these things might sound trivial - and individually they may well be. But when you go on a holiday you do not expect this level of dirt and failed hygiene in a hotel that claims to be a 5 star.    The hotel spa/sauna and gym facilities are also small and disappointing.    Incidentally the hotel seemed only last week to be installing fire doors (BUT made of ply wood)!!!    The hotel restaurant food quality was good and the service there friendly and attentive - if a little quick.    The gardens at the hotel are very nice - well laid out and generally well attended to.    We had looked forward to staying in Marrakech but regret that our visit was marred by the poor standards of hygiene and lack of general maintenance at the hotel Es Saadi.,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asucker

This is not a 5 star hotel. When I read the reviews before going there I was a little bit afraid of what I will find.  But this is the only hotel we were able to find with 1 room for 3 adults.  The hotel would need a real refreshing. It is old and not in best shape. The room was fine and if you are only 2 this would be fine. You have about 15 minutes walk to the place Jamaa El FNa which is not bad at all. You are on a quite place but still close to the city center. The swimming pool has been cleaned every morning. Our room was on the 3rd floor with view on the casino and the swimming pool. It was pretty calm considering that we had the view directly on the casino.  It was in the middle of the Ramadan month and we did not suffer of it at all.  At the front desks try to talk to the guys working there as we did not find the girls very friendly in general.  Eating at the hotel is expensive and not really tastefull but all around you have a lot of nice places (you need to search a little bit as you will not see them from the street).

The fancy restaurant on-site offered either a full meal or a la carte. We each chose one in order to sample a maximum number of items. There is a casino which we checked out only briefly. It was fairly smoky (not our preference) but had lots of snacks and desserts out for the gamblers (totally our preference!). The cleaning staff was very friendly and eager to please.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Mike19Golf wrote a review Jul 2007,50,What a relief !,What a relief it was to arrive at the Es Saadi. I was uneasy travelling to the hotel because I booked it before seeing the conflicting reviews on Trip Advisor! If I had read these prior to booking I probably wouldn't have done so and would have missed out on a fantastic holiday. The hotel is truly a 5 star in every way and we are not old 'fuddy duddys' (40's) so don't believe a word about the clientele being old. Average age of people there was around 30-40 - a few children but not many.    The staff couldn't have been more helpful plolite and friendly. The service in the bar around the pool and in all of the restaurants was impeccable. Food was wonderful too. Breakfast outdoors under orange trees with fresh fruit pastries cheeses meats and omlettes etc. cooked before your eyes if you wished.- a wonderful start to each day. Linen tableclothes and napkins in all restaurants - even around the pool. Waiters in white jackets and bow ties - even water was brought to you in an ice bucket . Order a drink and a whole range of snacks accompany it - at no extra cost!    We just booked a standard room but this was large with a king sized bed and lots of wardrobe and drawer space. On arrival there was a massive gift-wrapped bowl of fuit and a gift-wrapped plate of Morrocan delicacies courtesy of the management. Bathroom was standard - marble sinks surround good sized morror and lighting and private toilet and bidet. Good amount of storage here too. Only one gripe - the shower head was too heavy for the holder and so didn't spray far enough out. Plenty of good quality towels however and bathrobes. New towels provied twice daily on many days and beds turned down for you at night. (hotel only half full when we were there so could be different when full) The gargens are fantastic with pathways lit beautifully by twinkling Morrocan lanterms. Didn't hear any noise from the disco though our room was overlooking the front of the hotel. Good sized pool - lovely comfortable sun-bed and towels provided. Good amount of large sun shades.    The hotel is a short walk form the Medina but you can get hassled by guides along the way. Beware of one 'bumping into you' on the way there and saying he is from the hotel - saw you at breakfast - don't you remember him? It is a con! He isn't from the hotel but is very slick. A few people were taken in by him and the hotel were very concerned and said they would inform the police.    All in all this was a superb hotel with supberb staff and food. I would certainly recommend it.,Date of stay: July 2007,,"Lowton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike19Golf

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,KazANDAsh wrote a review May 2007,30,Overrated as a 5 star,Just returned form a 6 day trip to Marrakech staying at the Es Saadi Hotel.    We have stayed in many 4-5 star hotels around the world and was a little disappointed in the Es Saadi for the amount that we paid per day.    There is one main restaurant in the hotel and a snack bar by the pool which we found to have little variety by the way of snacks.  The oriental Spa is not as good as one would expect and the staff are less friendly if you don't speak french........so great tip ....learn a few sentences in french before you go.    The pool was nice and big and kept very clean at all times.    The hotel has a casino with a few slot machines and tables for the more serious gambler. Next door is the Theatro disco which plays heavy dance music up to 5am we were on the 3rd floor and found it a bit loud at times.................try and get a room above the 3rd floor.    The hotel is situated in a lovely part of Hivernage (The new area) but be prepared there is alot of building works going on and can get noisy.    Marrakech is a wonderful vibrant city with a lot to see and do.......not for the faint hearted though. Make sure that you spend all of your dirhams before going to the airport as they only accept euros and pounds in duty free.    If youhappen to be travelling by Atlas Blue i hope you are only 5ft as its a tight squeeze.    Our overaall advice if you are expecting 5 star then i would say the Es Saadi is 4 star.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Sarong Queen wrote a review Apr 2007,30,Not a haven for golden oldies after all,"My husband and I spent a couple of days here before and after Easter encouraged by the reviews saying it was full of older French guests (ie hoping it would be quiet with good food). In fact it was full of 30-something French couples each with a minimum of 4 children. The poolside area is perfectly adequate for sunbathing etc but is not suitable for children running around shouting and playing. The parents were oblivious to the disturbance they caused anyone trying to read or have a chat.    The foodhowever did not disappoint. We had lunch each day at what the hotel calls a ""pool snack bar"" but was actually a lovely outdoor restaurant with big shady white umbrellas and linen tablecloths and napkins. There is an a la carte menu and a set 3 course lunch. This was far too much for us but you can order just the main course of the day (a choice of 3 or 4 dishes) for 170 Dirhams. We always had the fish which was beautifully cooked and presented. Even just a half bottle of white wine came in an ice bucket. The waiters were all very well turned out in white jackets - all in all a very stylish experience nothing like a snack bar.    The indoor bar in the evenings was pretty gloomy and unbelievably for anywhere purporting to be 5 star and have aspirations to style it had a TV tuned to sport. One night a group of Italians was literally screaming at a football match. We had to cancel our drinks order and the waiter was very apologetic about it - not his fault but where was the manager who is supposed to be aware of what is going on?    The Es Saadi is also the unlikely home of one of the hottest nightclubs in Marrakesh next to the casino. It starts up at 11.30 at night and continues till after 4AM. If you have an Atlas-view room (more expensive) you can hear the thump-thump of the bass. It kept us awake even with earplugs. We asked to change rooms to the other side and the management expressed astonishment that we heard anything and claimed that nobody else had ever complained. One receptionist even told me to shut the window and pull the curtain and ""then you will hear nothing"" - as if we had not done this... However when I was moving our stuff to a room on the quiet side with the help of a charming young porter he chattily told me that many guests complained about the noise! The Head of Housekeeping a wonderfully efficient lady called Samira was far more helpful and understanding about this than the front desk and sorted the move in no time.    The hotel is in a great location just a few minutes walk from both the Medina and the new town in the other direction. As long as you do not overlook the casino it is also in a quiet spot which is a relief after the noise and crowds of the traffic and souks. There is a huge building boom going on in Marrakech both in the new town where huge areas of old French villas are being bulldozed to make way for big hotels and also more alarmingly in the Medina where several acres are currently just a big construction site.

I found the treatments to be very good but the staff both at the hotel and the spa to be extremely rude and unhelpful.    It is also worth noting that that athough the hotel takes debit and credit cards the spa is not happy to do so despite assurances from the front desk on booking that payment could be made by card.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,TiredTrotter wrote a review Mar 2007,30,Not much bang for your buck,Having booked and only then seen some of the negative reviews on this site we were more than a little apprehensive. Yet Es Saadi is not a bad hotel at all - just a very expensive one given its age and the region it is in. And it probably does need to raise its game...    Despite a recent refurb the buildings are a bit faded though we found them perfectly clean and cheery. The air-con however was less than useless and our room was uncomfortably hot by mid morning. We had to sleep with the French window open which was ok (LOVELY birdsong in the morning!) but you could hear music on one of the nights til quite late which was midly annoying.    Staff were on the whole pleasant and helpful. We did not have any problems - between their rudimentary English and our even worse French. The restaurant served truly excellent food and we met very welcoming staff there. Our waiter spoke perfect English. Poolside bar/cafe less so though still good food.    All in all our four days at Es Saadi were okay. I've stayed in much less polished estabs in the developing world. But given the price (c.¬£100 per night) one might be forgiven for expecting more. (where were the little touches you'd expect of a 5 star eg chocs on the pillow at night whirlpool bath walk-in shower - even a kettle in the room?) I'd say the restaurant was expensive but worth it the accommodation expensive and to be honest overpriced. Maybe 3 stars and a rate about half the current one would be more appropriate?,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiredTrotter
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,RCPilot wrote a review Mar 2007,40,"Beautiful Gardens, Unfriendly front desk",As an traveler with extensive foreign experience I have lodged in three to five star rated hotels and have found that all ratings are not consistent.    On arrival we were given a room facing the entrance of the hotel although we preferred a room facing south (pool side) in order to have more sunlight. At first the front desk informed us that they will change it as soon as one became available. After three days the young man at the front desk informed us that if we really wanted to change it would cost an additional fifteen Euros. I asked him why he did not mention this before. No answer; blank stare. I speak four languages fluently; French Dutch German and English and therefore I would not consider language an issue. After agreeing on the increase we were moved to the other side facing the park not the pool. This room was quiet and was warmer that the previous one. The only negative was that the bathtub was not cleaned properly and the cover sheet looked like it was not changed. The overall condition of the rooms I would consider slightly above average since the hotel is showing it‚Äôs age.    On the positive side the restaurant was excellent the servers were friendly and the food was delicious. The hotel park was well maintained although there was construction in progress.    My rating: Hotel 3 stars Restaurant and gardens 4 stars Front desk 1 star.,Date of stay: February 2007,,Basque country,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCPilot
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,essexbirdie wrote a review Feb 2007,20,Hope you like disco music till 5am,We paid a supplement and booked poolside room. At 12 midnight the disco begins in the club downstairs and continues till 5.00 AM every night. !! So book street side rooms or you will have no sleep. People were taking medication to sleep which cannot be right. There is no mention of this disco and their answer is that they are no different to London hotels providing music for the young!! The staff at breakfast were inefficient and it took 15 minutes to get a cup of tea served or they forgot it altogether. The restaurant staff were much better I must say. The ATM machine was always running out of money and as you can't get currency to take with you that was a problem.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Chris W wrote a review Jan 2007,50,An excellent choice of hotel,I strongly believe in giving an honest description of my experience of this hotel. Having made the mistake of booking the hotel before reading the reviews I was somewhat apprehensive about what I could expect.  The entire experience was one of great comfort and satisfaction. I found the hotel and staff were superb the staff being particularly friendly and helpful. I did have one slight experience of a less than friendly response from the Duty Manager over a query with my room but to be fair and honest he was under a huge amount of pressure at the time and he resolved my problem with little delay and to my complete satisfaction and indeed was more than friendly when the rush of incoming residents was over. I cannot commend the staff highly enough. Clean polite well presented and very welcoming.  The hotel was spotlessly clean. The rooms (I experienced both a standard room and a suite) were very comfortable with a good standard of facilities. I used the Spa as mentioned in a previous review and had a traditional Hammam and massage treatment. It was quite simply one of the nicest experiences I've ever had. I cannot praise the staff in the Spa highly enough.  The restaurant was well deserving of a 5 star rating. The food was excellent the staff of the same high standard as everywhere else in the hotel.  The piano bar was a very relaxing atmosphere although someone should have shot the piano player (play it again Sam) but perhaps that's just because I am a pianist and a little hyper-critical! The complimentary snacks with the drinks was a lovely touch.  The gardens and pool area I just couldn't fault. Spotlessly clean very attentive staff with every desire catered for.  Perhaps I am easily pleased? I don't think so. I found the entire experience of staying at Hotel Es Saadi to be one of the very highest standards I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone and I will certainly stay there again when I next visit Marrakech in three months time.  Sadly I have been unable to upload photographs on to this review but rest assured it's beautiful.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,AsItReallyIs wrote a review Jan 2007,20,Are you sure this is the right one for you?,I recently stayed in the 5 Star Hotel Es Saadi in Marrakech (January 2007) - 5 Star rating on Expedia. It is located in a nice area quiet and peaceful. I would by far say that this not a 5 star hotel I have paid less for hotels in New York Mid-Manhattan Area which offer better rooms and service than Es Saadi does. In my view everything is overpriced oversold and exaggerated it‚Äôs probably more like a three star hotel.    For the non-french speaking most of the staff do not speak English and those that do speak it are reluctant to speak it. If you are trying to book tours/Excursions through the Concierge then a word of warning all the concierges quoted different prices for the same tour talking to other people on the tours they paid much less than the lowest price given by Es Saadi. Also having asked the Concierge that if the tour operator will have English speaking guides while they were making our reservation the blatantly answered Yes to that question. On the tour itself there was no English speaking guide in sight (they will lie just to sell you the tour).    The beautiful gardens they claim are over-glorified on there website and descriptions the Hotel does not have two clay tennis courts (have to use the facilities of another hotel). The air-conditioning in the room is absolutely useless even at this time of the year the room got very hot to sleep in at night. The casino was over-hyped it‚Äôs was very small and the machines were in French I have seen miles better than this at seaside resorts in Britain. Food is expensive for those who are Vegetarian there is not much you can eat in Marrakech advise you take provisions from home.    Tip for telephoning the loved ones call them from a payphone outside in the streets or a telephone Boutique shop give them the Hotel phone number and your room number and get them to call you (it‚Äôs cheaper to call Marrakech rather than vice versa). My parents tried for over 15mins to call me at the Hotel as the staff didn‚Äôt understand English and were finally put through. So I gave them my room number and the next time they called they got through pretty quickly as they asked for the room number.    I booked my trip through Expedia (which covered all hotel and flights costs and taxes) on leaving Es Saadi they said I had an outstanding bill (which I was not expecting) which they demanded to be pay. On that bill there was a mini bar item which I told them I ma not paying for as I took nothing from the bar. The other items were interesting there trying to tax me for seemed liked a tourist tax and some other tax per night per person. If you do decide to stay at this hotel do not pay this tax none of the other hotels seem to charge it if you have booked via Expedia Ebookers etc tell the Hotel to take it up them as that is with whom there contract is with.    My overall view of this hotel is that is overpriced for what it provides but is situated in nice location. Bear in mind there a lot of other hotels in this area like Sofitel Le Meridian Mirage and others which are worth taking a look at.,Date of stay: January 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AsItReallyIs
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,LondonTraveller1970 wrote a review Nov 2006,10,Es Saadi will make you Sad! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"Fellow Travellers:    This is by far and away the worst hotel experience I have had in 15 years of travel worldwide. Aside from the dated exterior and interior the facilities are simply not up to scratch.    I used the spa at the hotel on one evening and in particular the hammam. The hotel charges 5-star rates: my hammam (basically a sauna and therapeutic massage) cost 250 Dhirams (approx. GBP16) for 45 minutes. My partner chose the reflexology treatment costing 320 Dhirams for 45 minutes.    I don't mind paying for good service but the hammam was tepid - forget about steam there wasn't any. After asking and being told that this was a ""typical"" hammam I gave up and decided to complain to the hotel manager at the front desk.    I explained to the hotel manager that I would pay but that the hotel should ackowledge that the service wasn't as adertised. The manager - a French man with about as much charm as a rattlesnake - rather than empathise with my complaint decided to begin an argument with me in the hotel lobby. Rather than accepting I had a valid complaint (as I had later been told by one of the staff that the heat had been lowered for a previous guest) he insisted that one particular Moroccan guest had nothing to complain about. Bizarre line of defence appalling customer service and appalling manners. The manager managed only to spoil the remnants of my holiday - he is rude haughty and should if he was working for me be removed from his position.    This hotel does not deserve 5 or 4 stars. It may have once in the 11950s or 60s been deemed worthy of such an accolade but given the current state of the place (shabby/gloomy) the prevailing attitude of ""we don't give a damn just give us your money"" and the general look of unhappiness on staff faces - Es Saadi deserves at best a 2-star rating or 3 if I'm being generous (which I'm not feeling).    My modest suggestion is if you;re happy to pay around ¬£100/night plus all the frills go across the road to the Hivernage which is a new boutique hotel with a better quality of front-desk crew or the Sofitel. Better yet do what we did and stay in a Riad!

When I booked my wife and I into this place I knew that I had made a horrible mistake even before we got there.    Staff are rude and generally refused to speak English. To say the place is dated would be a huge understatement. I would estimate that the average age of guests was probably about 90. These people were obviously too old to go on a SAGA holiday. Everything smelt old - the pool the bedrooms the restaurant. Really grim.    Air con wasn't working in the bedroom. We complained and asked to be moved 4 times but nothing happened. We had an argument with the head waiter at the poolside restaurant who refused to let us eat our lunch by the pool although there were several others doing the same. Bewildering.    In fact the place was so disgusting we checked out after one night and moved to the Jardins de la Koutoubia. On checking out the staff didn't even ask us why we were leaving even though we were supposed to be staying 5 nights. Utterly useless.    Please please please do yourself a favour and stay well away.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,Gwen wrote a review May 2006,10,A complete nightmare,My wife and I were happy to springbreak in Morocco and all excited to go to Marrakech after spending a few days in the lavish and grand Sofitel Thalassa in Essaouira (now that's a real 5star hotel)....The Es Saadi has put us out of our good mood for the rest of the trip !    Now I don't understand that this hotel could be rated 5 stars after 1964 ! even before I'm sure that the abrupt and incompetent staff (took more than 24 hours and four complaints to get a bathroom bulb changed !) together with the horrid suburban building look cannot desserve more than 2 stars. Who awards the stars anyway ?    We were less than impressed with the food which is rather average and not subtle. Breakfast is a disaster with products that could be fresher and staff clearly not happy with their job. On the third day there was even a bit of a customer rebellion to the Maitre d' since it was impossible to get tea...then hot water...then hot water WITH tea. Lack of supervision and absence of care and customer service is key to this appalling experience.    Don't get me started on the gloomy and not so clean rooms that are dark and smalls. They're quite a booster to go out and visit the city which is wonderful.  Talking about hygiene I could'nt force myself (nor my wife) to put a toe in the pool... not that the greasy smell surrounding the pool at lunchtime was a great motive anyway    Not too enthusiastic either about the small garden advertised as 5 acres too....    Es saadi is a definite no go for anyone with commonsense. We're both in our thirties we did pay an awful lot of money to indulge in a comfortable and stylish hotel that can keep up with demanding XXI century customers used to polite and helpful staff and a committment to quality.

Sadly the fairly recent refurbishment of the majority of the rooms can do nothing to disguise its ?1960's vintage: they are rather small and dark. Balconies are not adequate for sitting out in comfort.    We found the continental breakfast service poor.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Hotel,jetlagged_in_Paris wrote a review Apr 2005,30,French women and men with poodles,Arriving in Winter we were meant to be staying in a little riad in the little of the medina. However the calls to prayer from the mosque next door at huge volume combined with the cold cold nights with no insulation and terrible heating quickly put us off the cute riad concept.    So we checked into Es Saadi one of the better known large hotels in Marrakech. It was very warm with large rooms and plush fabrics a big swimming pool and beautiful gardens but all looking a bit dated. They had beautiful gardens and spa beauty services.    At that time it was full of French women and men in their 60s and 70s many with little dogs which are allowed to stay here.    For all that though the service was exeptional and the food by the pool was also very nice with Western food available. I wouldn't stop anyone staying there particularly if they prefer things comfortable and a little old-fashioned.    There did look to be a new building being built at one end and I'm unsure if this was to be part of the hotel or a separate hotel.    If looking for something around the same price which is more stylish and younger check out Le Hivernage. Its just down the road with a little French cafe out the front brand new with gorgeous stylish interior little bar pool and beauty spa. This was more our scene and we checked in there instead. But had my grandmother been off to Marrakech she would have definitely been more comfortable at Es Saadi.,Date of stay: January 2005,,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetlagged_in_Paris
