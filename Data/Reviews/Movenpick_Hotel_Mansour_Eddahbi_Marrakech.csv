Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Nigel P wrote a review Yesterday,40,Nice place shame about the service,Hotel is immaculately clean and stylish. The food is excellent with a wide choice. The staff are polite & friendly but sadly the service is sluggish and unreliable.  Expect a long wait to be served and an even longer wait for your food or drink to arrive which it invariably does not. Over the 5 days I spent at the hotel I made 13 orders. 10 of the 13 missed items and all 13 had a lengthy wait (up to 20 minutes) to be served despite the staff outnumbering the guests.  The staff are a generally of a young demographic and I witnessed many of them arguing with each other and congregating in groups chatting when customers are waiting to be served. For this reason (ie the service) alone I wouldn‚Äôt return as the percentage of my break I spent waiting and chasing staff was not one I wish to repeat.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nigelpN2909LM

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,mcgringo wrote a review Mar 16,20,Over rated and lots of staff not doing much. Overpriced for what I received,I choose this hotel hoping that the movenpick quality would stand up in Marrakech however this was not the case. The check in was a joke 5 staff standing around not wanting to work and it continued. The room had not been cleaned properly especially the bathroom and cigarette butt's all piled up on the balcony in this non smoking hotel. Thankfully the hotel was quiet so finding quiet space by the pool was OK but I reckon in season it wouldn't be pleasant. The outside pics imply that the hotel has lots of space which is not the case 2 pools and that's it. ALSO be warned that taxes and fees were added to my bill that they could not be justified and said they were local when I asked for clarification they couldn't answer me. Fraudulent. My booking never mentioned extra fees and all fees had been included at the time of booking and payment.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcgringo
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Fearless91058 wrote a review Mar 11,10,Horrible,The service at the pool is the worst I have ever endured in my lifetime.  The staff ignore you then say I‚Äôm busy no time and so what and try to fight you.  Calling the manager is pointless as he just laughs at you.  Also I asked for an adaptor for my room and had to chase this up so many times  Even towels  The hotel has to be the worst service ever.  I would never recommend to anyone to endure such a terrible experience.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless91058

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,World_explorer579 wrote a review Mar 8,20,"Located in center of town, but incompetent staff",From the check-in process the staff seemed very disorganized although they were courteous. The whole hotel looked old/aged and needs a general refurbishment from the spa facilities to the room I was staying in. I called room service several times over my 3 nights stay for different requests (refilling of shower gel request for iron to the room etc.) which either took a very long time to arrive or never arrived.    What I am most unhappy and disappointed about is that fact that the front desk firstly decided to take a MAD 21000 security deposit from my credit card on arrival without informing me of the amount prior to attempting to debit me. I had assumed they would pass a charge for the room balance for my non-refundable booking and it was only after entering my pin and when additional authentication was required that I realized and challenged this. It was only at this point that I was offered the choice of paying for any amenities on demand or keeping a hold on my card.  Following this on departure and after settling all my bills I was told that the hold on my credit card had been released but this does not appear to be the case as the hold is still reflecting on my card after over 2weeks. I have called several times requesting to speak to the reservations and reception teams but people either don't pick up the phone drop the phone after it rings for some time tell me they are busy or that they will investigate without obtaining adequate information from me to look in to the issue and contact me back. One lady asked that I call the following day and ask for Mr. Abdoulate but I have not able to get in touch with him or anyone else competent enough to help. It feels like no one wants to take responsibility for resolving it.    The only reason why Movenpick is getting 2 stars is because they provided early check-in as requested. And also because the staff at the poolside restaurant were attentive and the food specifically by the poolside was decent. I tried the free breakfast buffet only once but the quality and spread was really poor so I decided not to go back and chose to eat early lunches by the poolside which came at an additional cost.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/World_explorer579
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,LovetravelZurich wrote a review Mar 8,40,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff",We came for a business conference here and have been very pleased with the hotel. The grounds pools lobbies and restaurants are lovely and beautifully maintained. All the staff are friendly and extremely helpful and professional. If there is a problem the crew arrives to fix it in minutes (thank you Jasine and Abdellah). The spa is super - ask for a massage from Bouchra - amazing. The only problem is that the electricity supply is a bit weak and the Wi-Fi can be annoyingly intermittent.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rueschlikon, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovetravelZurich

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,karoleigh wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Beautiful hotel!,This is a truly beautiful facility. The lobby is very large with two reception areas elegant sitting areas and a very attractive fountain.    Our first-floor guest room was comfortable with two twin beds and a fluffy comforter and pillows. The TV had 74 channels including those for various nationalities with four in English. The toilet was on its own room separate from the shower room with sink. The lighting was appealing with it being not too bright or too dim. After staying in some hotels with poor soap bars we were pleased that they had generously sized soap bars. Since we were staying for three nights they brought extra bars of soap on request.    The location was great. It was within walking distance of numerous restaurants a mall and ATM machine. It was recommended by a reliable source that we not use the ATM machine at this hotel since it‚Äôs controlled by a third party and if you have a problem with the machine you may have to wait until you can resolve it with that third party. Go to the Banque Populaire instead which is close to the hotel. This is what we used with no issues.    Breakfast consisted of many different foods as you would expect from such a hotel with many choices of breads pastries eggs cooked upon request plain and sweetened yogurt a self-service coffee machine fruit etc. There were many places to sit down so there was never a feeling of being crowded or having difficulty getting a table.    There was a very large outdoor pool with tables on the patio for outdoor eating and drinking.    The hotel definitely had a five-star appeal with its service amenities and decor. I would definitely stay here again if I were in the area.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,North Carolina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karoleigh

The whole staff was amazing but two individuals really stood out; Imad was so courteous and kind as well as a gentleman that helped us every morning at breakfast (I wish I could remember his name). He remembered our order and would have our table set for us. He was a more experienced server and would coach the younger staff on providing excellent service. He was amazing!!! We stayed for over a week left to experience another ‚Äúadult only‚Äù resort and was disappointed. There was no comparison so we checked out early to return back to Movenpick Marrakech.

The rooms on the surface as well until you notice things like broken toilet seats and the like.  The waiting staff and cleaners are super helpful and have a smile at all times. The same can't be said about the folks behind the reception counter who seem to fail to appreciate that they are in the hospitality business. Very stand offish un-accommodating and not very helpful.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Elena wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Great hotel,The hotel is beautiful and overall the stay was positive. The staff were very helpful and kind Noelle and Sana were lovely. The food by the pool at breakfast and in the Marcelona restaurant was tasty. The only negative about the stay was the music by the pool. When sitting by the pool the music was loud and did not suit the otherwise peaceful atmosphere. The pool music was also often played loudly at night even when no guests were at the pool. On one occasion we had to request at reception at 1am for the pool music to be turned down because it was very loud. Otherwise the stay was enjoyable and the chocolate hour was delicious.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Adebola A wrote a review Jan 2023,40,Experience at Movenpick Marrakesh,My stay at this hotel was brilliant . The only let down of my stay are the reception team both the day shift and the night ones. On arrival I met with Kausarat I think thats her name she was totally unfriendly for a receptionist . I checked in around 21:30 and base on how she was talking you could tell she couldn‚Äôt wait to leave for the day. I was checked into room Zidane 4129 . The room was lovely and the bed was super comfy.  Breakfast the following morning was a bit unorganised as all the breakfast team were just standing around no one communicated on how things work however if you go to them they would support with information which I feel shouldn‚Äôt be the case. The following days after that was brilliant I suspect this is due to the presence of one of the management team on duty. The gentleman in a blue suit on Sunday 22nd and Monday 23rd ensure everyone was doing what they should‚Ä¶ Breakfast was lovely with different selection of continental and Moroccan breakfast‚Ä¶. Super yum.  The superstars of the hotel are the housekeeping team for me. They were happy and full of smiles.  When I changed room to 2209 because I wanted to be close to reception as my husband couldn‚Äôt make the trip Khadeja supported with packing my bags which I appreciate greatly. She went above and beyond by calling concierge to pick up my bags and put them in the new room. Thank you khadeja! You‚Äôre a star. Every other house keeping team I met are almost the same as khadeja because they are all always happy doing their job.  I‚Äôll definitely recommend using the spa. I had a session with Najia and Indi and they were both very nice and welcoming.  Overall I think the hotel deserves a 5star the 1 star minus is because all my encounter with the reception team falls short of expectation of a 5star hotel. As someone with over 7 years management experience in hospitality I believe the reception team needs to understand warmth of welcome as they are the first point of contact. For example I‚Äôve met with Hind on 3 occasions during my stay and the only time I got a smile from her was when there were management team present at reception which was on the 25th after spending 5days.  One lady did standout though I think her name is Nezha I‚Äôm not 100percent sure of her name she ask one of the bellmen to take me to a nearby shop.  The ambience of the hotel is fantastic I love all the on art display and the location to the airport is less than 20mins,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adebolaa182

Sadly whilst the grounds and facilities are all you would expect the service leaves alot to be desired. Restuarant/ Bar staff appear miserable and unfriendly and slow to meet the needs of guests. Generally you are waiting around for someone to serve you and you are made to feel it's a hassle. Disorganised approach in restaurants and bar. On arrival we were given no information of facilities and restaurants etc and even getting a menu was impossible unless you have a smart phone. Selection of food in buffet poor given the apparent 5* standard of the hotel and not a great reflection on Moroccan hospitality. Housekeeping was good and standards v clean. Entertainment was very overpriced and a reflection on this was poor attendance by guests who could eat drink and party elsewhere for less money. Sadly we would not recommend and you would be better off spending your money in a traditional riad or hotel where the star rating may not be as high but the hospitality atmosphere and price are ten times better.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour822254

The restaurant did not offer us an authentic Moroccan menu which disappointed me as a first-time visitor to the country. Room service was prompt well-presented and tasty however.

Most of our interactions with staff left us inconvenienced and with the impression they are either very overworked unhelpful or untrained.    -Housekeeping was overworked and semi-responsive    -One staff member told me to go next door to heat up my baby food while said baby was crying; it would have been nice if they took the 30 seconds to do it themselves    -One staff member ""showed us"" where the spa and restaurant when asked by walking us all the way through the hotel before emphatically pointing and rudely saying ""reception""    -The front desk fully charged us for our dinner in hotel restaurant Marcelona and tried to blame us after I mentioned we had traveler's diarrhea (we lost an entire day in the bathroom) from the tap water in the gazpacho that night (they could have at least apologized)    -After reassuring us of the cost of a taxi to town concierge told us to get one ourselves ""just outside"" where the cost doubled...

The permaculture system in this hotel works well together with citrus trees that goes to the kitchen several pools for your relaxing enjoyment and landscaping where birds can fly free. The housekeeping staffs are excellent. In my experience Karima is very attentive. The breakfast buffet was marvelous. Even though it is always the same menu everyday we can choose healthy selections local delicacies with several different high quality honeys jams and preserves. The restaurant staffs are helpful particularly Bahija Fatima Meryem Youness Haoud Elrddy. The Morrocan tea station at the hotel entrance gives a true Moroccan experience with mint tea and delicacies and it was available until 6pm everyday by Ahmed ""the Man.""

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Devina Adelia wrote a review Dec 2022,50,What an amazing experience,It's one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at and definitely a great first impression as to what Marrakech has to offer. I stayed here for more than a week and it was wonderful from start to finish. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Despite the language barrier they always went above and beyond to make sure that I got everything I needed (and wanted).    The housekeeping staff was excellent especially under the supervision of Sana (thank you again for the birthday surprise). They always greeted me with a smile and made sure that we got some extra tea üòÜ    The breakfast buffet was marvelous. It's always the same menu everyday and indeed why change something that's already working well? The food is of high quality and I'm glad that they also offer some local delicacies it was quite overwhelming to decide what to eat every morning because I kept wanting to eat everything. There's also a tea station close to the hotel entrance a true Moroccan experience and it was available until 6pm everyday.    Another shout out particularly to the breakfast staff they were an excellent team. They always made sure that everyone at my table got everything they needed. They were always so quick in cleaning everything up right after we were done. Special thanks to Fatima Ezzahra and Said (my omelette guy)    The location of the hotel is quite strategic it's in an upscale area with many restaurants within walking distance. The train station is also nearby about 10 minutes walk. The medina and sites such as Koutoubia mosque and Saadien's Tomb are also easily reached. There are two malls in the area as well Menara Mall and Carre Eden. People can easily find souvenirs and such in both locations as well as a Carrefour Market.    I can definitely go on and on but this is already long enough. All in all it was definitely better than expected. The only minor issue I can think of is the fact that we had to basically update our key card everyday for it to work and the walk from our building to the lobby wasn't particularly short. Maybe the hotel can look into it and find a fix.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Bandung, Indonesia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevAdel

Bed comfortable.  TV not working.  Restaurant food - reasonable  Restaurant service - soso.    Front Office service is very very poor. Except for Ms Hanane & Nezha the other front staffs are very ‚Äúcold‚Äù and irresponsible.  1-Triple room with only 2 sets of linen. Despite repeated requests and reminders nothing done.    2-No morning calls for my group on Departure day despite prior arrangement.    The worst staff is Hassan (Reception) he has a very bad attitude. Does not believe in providing service to guests. I stay in this hotel with a contingent of 20 guest. I was responsible to provide information to my group. I asked Hassan many questions and directions he did not provide any. Has a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bother me‚Äù attitude. Very COLD attitude with Arrogance does not bother to explain clearly and poor command of English.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Roxa N wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Satisfactory,The hotel lobby and public facilities are very nice and well maintained. The rooms (our family had two rooms) were satisfactory but certainly not 5-star quality. The furnishings were a bit worn and stained. We were also disappointed that there was no furniture on the balconies which basically made them useless.  We enjoyed the swimming pool and surrounding lounge areas and ate several nice lunches at the restaurant next to the large pool. The concierge was very helpful in providing dinner recommendations and arranging an excursion to the Atlas Mountains.  The biggest area for improvement is with service. Upon arrival at the hotel it took almost an hour for us to check into our room. This was at the end of a long day of travel with our young children. Once we finally got into our room we realized there was no crib for the baby even though one was previously requested. We called for a crib and it took another 60 minutes to receive it. This is absolutely not 5-star service. Another area if service that was disappointing was that I was told I couldn‚Äôt order a coffee by the pool until the bar opened at 11am. I‚Äôve never stayed at a hotel before where I was just flat out told I couldn‚Äôt order a coffee.  We enjoyed certain aspects of this hotel but there is a lot of room to improve to actual make it a 5-star experience.,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxan2022

Queued 40m at front desk not ready. Told to come back at 3. At 3 told to come back at 5.  - wifi did not work in new suite impossible to stream a tv show or check in flights. Technicians came and went taking a up a whole afternoon no communication and no solution  - terrace door did not lock totally unsafe  - every interaction with front desk was dreadful taking one hour with queuing and nobody being trained to know how to deal with basic requests. Totally understaffed many people waiting and upset in line  - booked airport transfer to leave and it did not show up it was never booked we arrived late to the airport  - terrible service staff could not care less at the front desk about your experience and keeping you waiting  - hotel grounds are nice pool is good and breakfast we did a mountain tour that was very good but overall we could not wait to leave  Not 5*,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Southwest123

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Sandy M wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Not 5 star hotel. 4 star. Really friendly staff.,A good hotel but not 5 star. The staff were all lovely but there we're so many little things that just meant the stay was not as good as what it could have been;    - The cleaners left our door unlocked and open one day after cleaning  - Tv had poor reception in the room  - I paid extra for a room with a view but it was just of a palm tree outside the patio door. I was pretty disappointed. It was not a 'view' at all. I complained about this to reception and there is a clause in the booking that defines the view as the pool or the garden but I felt pretty ripped off here to be honest.  - One night we were kept awake from 4am because of a loud banging noise in the building. I complained to reception and they told me it was a recuring mechanical issue. We'd booked the Majorelle gardens for 8am and we ended up being late cause we were exhausted. To be fair we did get upgraded to a better room but it does take a couple hours to repack all your stuff and then move to the new room. Its not something you want to do on holiday.  - There was no iron or ironing board in the room despite that being on the reservation  - The lights flickered annoyingly in the new rooms ensuit and there was a damp patch on the roof in the walk in wardrobe area.  - The chocolate hour was good but there were no plates or cutlery. how are you meant to dip food into the chocolate fountains without making a total mess? Just common sense - put down some napkins and forks!    Food & drink;    - the first night we arrived it was late and we ate in the main hotel restaurant. we sat down to get given 2 QR codes instead of menus. we didnt take our phones so we asked for physical menus but they didnt have any. Maybe this is something inherited from covid but what '5star' hotel doesnt have menus in the main restaurant?! We then had to go back to the room to get our phones so we could see the menu. When we did see the menu it was pretty pathetic. It is a tapas restaurant and some of the meals barely have any descriptions or pictures or both! We got 4 tapas which were average. One plate was a mixture of cheese and ham no dressing or garnish. It cost us like ¬£15 or something. I was disgusted. 4 tapas and 2 beer between us and it was ¬£50. absolute joke.    The menu situation is the same for all eateries in the hotel. There are no menus which I find bizarre. most of them lack a description of the meal and some of the pictures look dreadful. It doesnt sell the food at all. The room service one is the worse of all 2 of the meals it says 'Breast of Chicken' or 'Beef steak' or something like that and thats it! no photo! How can you order a meal not know what it is!! Not to mention its like 250 dirhams (¬£22).    We ate out of the hotel most nights as we just couldn't face the restaurants. The food wasn't great at all. On more then 1 occasion food arrived that wasnt ours etc. At the main pool bar we ordered chicken club sandwich but it arrived with ham in it instead...    Lots of annoying little things but again the pools were good there was ample beds and the staff were all really nice.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandymU2927KA

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Traveller M wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Not a 5 star hotel,We stayed at Movenpick Marrakech for 7 days and were overall disappointed with our stay. Even though the hotel is rated as a 5 star the service we received was very poor and definitely not one of a 5 star.  We noted several issues during our stay none of which is the fault of the staff working there (the cleaning ladies were very nice and always happy to help) or but more a reflection of how poor the management of the hotel is:  - bathroom towels: There‚Äôs clearly a shortage of towels across the hotel which meant all towels and washed and redistributed in the evenings. Times where we would come back to the room and werent able to take a shower. We called reception on a daily basis to get towels and they would sometimes take up to an hour to bring the towels delaying our plans for the day - we even ended up using the bathrobes as towels on 2 of the days.  - toilet roll: again on several occasions we were left without toilet roll. We called housekeeping at least 4 days out of 7 to be given toilet roll as this had not been replenished. Once requested this again took hours to come.  - water bottles: in a 5 star hotel in a country where it is 30-35degrees water should be free & readily available. We were given two 33cl water bottles a day and could only get more on request.  - milk: even 1 star hotels have free cream available to be able to make tea or coffee in your room. In this hotel they didn't have any creamers available and we were informed a glass of milk to make tea would be an additional ¬£5 charge  - bathroom standard: the toilet lid in our room was half broken - it would close itself once sat on the toilet. This was very offputting and something pretty basic to get right for a 5 star hotel.  - hotel restaurant: we arrived around 8pm on the first day and decided to get food at the hotel. The only restaurant available was a tapas bar in which the food was not only poor but very expensive. We had to spend more than ¬£60 for 2 starters and 2 mains which we didn't enjoy. The hotel has at least 4 different pools but only restaurant of overpriced bad food for dinner.  - breakfast: coffee and tea should be served at the table in a 5 star hotel - in this hotel you have a coffee machine where you make the coffee yourself.  - reception: if you have any queries for reception expect to spend at least 20mins there.  - check-out process: not friendly the staff didn't ask us how our stay was we were just given our bill and asked to pay.  - the only upside to this hotel was the staff at breakfast the cleaning ladies and outside of the hotel (pool & hotel entrance): they were all very nice and were always happyto help and we're grateful to them  Overall having stayed at several 5 star hotels we can guarantee this is not a 5 star. Save your money and stay somewhere else.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveller5162

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Ladybelle wrote a review Oct 2022,10,This is more like a 3 star hotel,This hotel should not be parading as a 5 star hotel. The hotel is run down the carpets in the rooms corridors and communal areas are worn some areas have grey tape to cover up things stains everywhere. The sofa in my room had stains on it. The service in the restaurants is awful - given a basket of bread that had a half eaten bread roll in it. The resort is quite expansive but unfortunately nothing is really sign posted so you could spend ages looking for the gym the main restaurant etc. I booked a twin room but was given a room with one bed. The breakfast buffet was awful - coffee and tea machines for hot drinks (very tacky and not what you'd expect for 5*) fruit and veg completely abysmal. Had they presented as a 3* hotel and adjusted the daily rate then I'd be hailing this place as great value for money. Only redeeming feature is the staff - very friendly. If you are expecting luxury and top notch service then give this one a miss save your money and stay in a riad or even a tent in the desert as that would be better value for money.,Date of stay: October 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Worldtraveller2197

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Jonathan C wrote a review Oct 2022,10,Horrid Experience,We checked in to our deluxe room and it was a horrible stay. First off the deluxe room building is the furthest building away from the hotel and by the time we get to our room the view from our balcony is of a construction site and parking lot.    Our room had a particularly strong vinegar smell to it and we asked to move rooms. We were told that every deluxe room was sold out and we would be able to move rooms the next day. Next day comes around and we didn‚Äôt hear from the hotel. Every call to guest services took at least 3-5 minutes until someone answered or called back. We also came back to our hotel room unlocked and it seemed housekeeping didn‚Äôt truly close our door when they cleaned it.    On our last night the A/C didn‚Äôt seem to work. We called guest services and the lady I spoke to told me that it was turned off for the whole hotel. When asked why or when will it be turned back on she abruptly interrupts me and says I‚Äôm transferring you to the front desk. I waited for at least 2 minutes on the phone before someone from the front desk to answer my call and he informs me that someone will come check our A/C.    We love staying at different hotels in different countries and had no issues with other hotels in Marrakech however our stay at Movenpick was very underwhelming and staff didn‚Äôt seem to care at all.    This has been a very awful experience and hope that the hotel management can make a much better experience and improvement for others.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7777ZSjonathanc

Second part of the trip is now a short vacation and hotel‚Äôs central location and ease of taxi access has been great for exploring greater Marrakech.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Rabia R wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Very impressive,We spent 5 nights at the hotel and couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything more for our first time in Marrakesh.    Due to a conference the hotel couldn‚Äôt fulfil our final two nights and we we transferred to an alternative hotel. However the hotel more than compensated us for the inconvenience with an upgrade to a fabulous suite and a half-board stay.    The service and hospitality of the staff was exceptional with a particular thanks to head concierge Rafiq Ayoub from Jamra Hamza from the main restaurant and bar and Hassan at pool side. The hotel was beautiful and clean and we really enjoyed our meal at the Spanish restaurant as well as Jamra. The hotel is a short drive from the Medina and not far from key sites such as Koutoubia. We really enjoyed the excursion booked via the hotel to Oureka and spending time with Ismael.    If we had to be really critical the only think that would have improved our stay would be having more options for traditional Moroccan cuisine at the hotel but clearly this was aplenty a short walk away so really not a problem.    Thank you for the wonderful service - we look forward to returning.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Dastan wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Excellent service but property needs some TLC,The hotel and location is very good but the property would not fall into 5 stars or anything luxury. The rooms need some TLC and touching up. The pool tiles/drain needs to be looked at. My toe got badly injured and on the first day as coming out of the pool which meant I couldn‚Äôt use the pool anymore with my kids with an open wound. I pent half a day at the local hospital to stop the toe from bleeding.    Breakfast was very good. Excellent eggs freshly squeezed orange juice and fresh pastries but they need to sort out the earl grey tea supply and stop people from taking 20 tea bags (yes some guests were literally filling their pockets with tea bags as if there is a tea crisis).    The hotel grounds are stunning with gardens and fruit trees like it is all over Marrakech.    What makes this hotel amazing and make up for the minuses is the service. The staff are super friendly and attentive. Right from the concierge (super amazing) to housekeeping. They will cater almost any requests you may have and I would like to send a super thanks to the lovely staff at Movenpick.

Following morning I rang reception for bath towels 1 hour later still no towels ended going look for towels myself and had to help myself from the store room went to the reception in the morning to change the rooms was told someone would come and show us round the new rooms before we moved waiting 15-20 mins on reception no one came got fed up and went back to my room eventually a gentleman showed up outside my room and took us to our new rooms.    We are still on day 2 of our holiday.    To conclude  If you are after the 5 star Jumeriah experience this is definitely not for you as customers seem to be at the bottom of the pecking order also been told the music situation is a daily thing if you are an early person or have young kids who go to sleep early or before midnight you may need to think again if you expect quick service ie need towels in 10-15 mins again you need to think again personally am a service person the service I have received so far I would not be coming back to this hotel as am only here for 5 nights and had so many issues already.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Adarah wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Recent Movenpick Hotel Stay Review,I liked the Movenpick Mansour hotel very much. It is centrally located in the Hivernage district; Other lovely hotels cafes and easy transport links. The roads are so clean there as well. The route from the airport is so close.  I was surprised at the modern architectural design as well as an unusual discreet entrance. It is a bird in the cage/ garden and fountain style entrance with a huge bronze/brown automatic curved door. The floors are so glossy and scent throughout the lobby is filled with the fragrance of fresh roses! I understand why they have a five star rating!    The check-in was swift attendance to take the luggage and proceed to the bedroom was also on point. I had a first floor superior room with small terrace front facing the garden/side pool area; Just as expected as requested with the booking. No complaints at all regarding this or with the standard of luxury. The king size bed was comfy; The setting for the air-conditioning was good. Only the Spanish dinner meals at Marcelona was limiting not Morrocan cuisine.    The Breakfast buffet wos high quality with amazing range of dishes and variety of drinks.  Staff friendly and service is fast.  Bahija was serving my table mostly according to my preferred seated area and she was friendly helpful and polite. All the staff generally are constantly moving about ensuring guests are catered for; Pool side bar area and lunch buffet is optional expensive but also high quality food and service.    The only thing disliked was that there was very little entertainment for guests; Only for people who booked their own private functions. I was expecting some live music playing during dinner at least in the weekends but there was none. They have a music hub with microphone but no player. Perhaps this is planned for busiest time of the year.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,69Pete wrote a review Jul 2022,50,On the up and up,Stayed there 3 years ago when it was a beautiful hotel ruined by incompetent management.  Mercifullyand rather unexpectedly the top management has been replaced the staff now feel and act a lot happier and this time we had a fantastic stay.    Rather oddly some of the in-house restaurants have not yet reopened so worth checking exactly what is open now. But the breakfast is to die for the pools are exceptional and the staff are now friendly and cooperative. The concierge is fantastic the Moroccan tea delicious the Spanish restaurant delightful    The position is a little incongruous. In one direction is a shopping mall ( air conditioned Carrefour supermarket) in the other the roads area bit derelict. But the neighbourhood is actually very safe and the people you pass are friendly and sociable. Moroccans are usually extremely well mannered like to try their English but respect your social space.

Yet again I was incredibly impressed.    The breakfast staff were extremely attentive taking great pride and care in their job and were such hard workers. In particular My Youssef ( the breakfast manager) and the waiters; Mohamed skiriba Mohamed kabaj and Bahija who served us could not do enough for us and If we wanted anything they would immediately try to meet our needs as quickly as possible and treated us as if we were royalty. These workers take hard work and dedication to another level and put it into perspective onto how little we have it in the Uk. These staff put great pride into their job and it shows in every single thing they do for us and the quality of their work and I would appreciate it If the efforts of these fabulous staff was recognised. Such amazing service and hard workers I have never been to a hotel where the staff are as motivated and caring as this !  Thank you to all the breakfast staff for your incredible efforts :)    My breakfast experience at the Movenpick was a truly satisfying and out of this world experience every morning to the point it being therapeutic due to the relaxing atmosphere there.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,ChiColoTraveler wrote a review Jun 2022,40,"Nice Hotel, But Not 5-Star",We stayed at the Movenpick for three nights and enjoyed our experience overall. The hotel is beautiful with modern Moroccan style especially the entrance and lobby areas. The pools and manicured grounds offer a lush oasis in the hot desert climate and the daily breakfast was plentiful in selection and quality (freshly made sfenj Moroccan donuts and fresh squeezed orange juice!). The female concierges were delightful and very helpful in answering questions about Marrakech assisting with dining reservations and transport.    Unfortunately this is not a 5-star hotel. The rooms are quite worn with stains/tears on the carpet and bathroom tile and fading and dirt on fixtures (lamp shades bathroom towel bars/mirrors). The front desk staff were highly unfriendly each time we sought assistance or wanted to exchange currency.    Would consider returning to Movenpick but are more likely to seek other accommodations for our next visit.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiColoTraveler

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,N1992 wrote a review Jun 2022,10,Realistically a 4* Hotel AT BEST!,I created a TripAdvisor account specifically to warn you against visiting this hotel. I wrote this review after visiting the hotel but it had been sitting in my review drafts since ny visit! There are so many problems associated with this hotel that I just can not mention them all. We stayed here for 8 days. I have split the review into Accommodation/resort dining and service.    I will start with the accommodation/resort: The main pool was ridiculously overcrowded and freezing cold. I have no idea why they did not turn up the heating a bit more. It was really unpleasant to swim in. There was another pool near the Abou Faris buildings that was even colder than the main one! Absolutely freezing! It was also filled with lots of dead bees floating on the water. The suite was good spacious and the Moroccan theme adopted throughout (including the furniture colours) was very nice. This is where the positvies end. The bathroom door was broken and did not lock properly. The layout of the building was ridiculous; directly above us was the penthouse's wooden boarded balcony. This penthouse was filled with 20 Party-lovers. You could hear them running around junping in their plunge pool and shouting as well as playing music. After a few sleepless nights and multiple complaints we were moved to another suite. This was the same suite category but much much larger this left us wondering why they had not given us this earlier!? (As it was the same suite category not an upgrade). Build quality here was poor too which meant (broken bathroom door again) we frequently saw spiders and large numbers of other unknown insects from the building.    Dining: Absolutely terrible! First day ordered room service and we were charged the 5 star hotel price of ¬£20 for a burger with chips and ¬£4 for a coke. But the problem is the burger tasted horrible! The inside was red (having told them well done wanted) and uncooked smelled really bad. I would not be surprised if it was donkey meat! Then we tried the 'Dada's diner' cafe/restaurant. This was nothing special the food was 'okay' at best yet still 5 star hotel price. The breakfast was okay. Good choice and variety but actual quality was rubbish (don't go near the hashbrowns or sausages). The breads and Moroccan breakfast (pancakes?) were good. The Marcelona restaurant was okay nothing special we did not like the tagine at all though. Jamra was okay.    Service: By far the worst of the three categories. Horrendous. Poolside service = RUBBISH had to ask 4 times for a menu. Asked for ice cream and changed our mind for a different flavour the attendant rolled his eyes!    Just avoid this hotel if you're expecting a 5 star hotel. We went the nearby Four Seasons for dinner a couple times and it seemed much better though they were charging more than The Ritz London which seemed silly.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N19923

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Dr Hakan Yildirim wrote a review May 2022,50,Best Staff and Hotel in Marrakesh,It's my fourth visit in Marrakesh and my second stay in M√∂venpick Mansour. I've been traveling around the world and I always like to stay in classy and stylish ho√§tels and this hotel really really is one of my favorites.    Especially the staff here is one of the best I ever experienced.    The head of the reception Mrs Laila is definitely my favorite staff member. She always has a smiling face no matter what I ask for: upgrade for a better room more service going to the gym when it's already closed suggestions where to go for dinner or a to have a drink: she takes her time and she really cares about her guests to have a good time here in Marrakesh at the M√∂venpick Mansour. She really is a total professional. So whenever you need help: ask Mrs Laila.    This is arabic hospitality at its best.    The M√∂venpick Mansour has a large pool very nice gym and high class restaurants. I'm sometimes high maintenance but this hotel definitely surpasses my expectations.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drhakanyildirim

In particular I‚Äôd like to say a big thank you to a lady called Hannan at reception who truly went over and above to rectify the issues and in fact more than make up for it! Because of her efforts the hotel eventually exceeded our expectations. Staff members like her are a real asset to the hotel. That lady really deserves a promotion!!

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,chetan t wrote a review May 2022,50,"Visit this hotel, you will LOVE IT!",To help your decision of reading the rest of this review I will summarise. IT WAS AMAZING! Now on to the details.  When you arrive you will be greeted by a gorgeous lobby and the scent of jasmine flowers definitely Instagramable. Help yourself to some mint tea if you wish. The check in was quick and efficient and we were soon off to our room which was a garden view. Not the most amazing view but I wouldn't complain. The room is spacious and well equipped. The decor is classically modern with moroccan style oozing from every corner. It has all the essentials you would expect 24 hour room service conceirge etc.. it has 3 pools all of which have their own appeal. A lively pool next to a bar and cafe which serves hot stone-baked pizza on demand and then two smaller pools one for families and kids and another calm and quiet pool for adults only which is adjacent to the spa. We didn't visit the spa but I am sure it would be very nice judging by the rest of the hotel. The hotel grounds are very nice to walk around with tall structures surrounding you and palm trees. The hotel offers a great buffet breakfast with a lot of variety so everyone will be catered for and if you're feeling cultural then they also serve a traditional Moroccan breakfast. Would be nice if they switched up the hot food items but with all the variety in the other sections you definitely won't get bored. There are two other restaurants in the hotel one was closed which I'm sure will open up if the hotel got really busy but the other one is a nice dinner retreat from the hustle and bustle of the Medina.  We booked a few excursions from the hotel which a private car and guide. A little pricier than the other online or 'high-street' options but worth it because the private driver will stop where you like and will even haggle on your behalf if you ask nicely. The Medina was an intense cultural slap in the face that you must subject yourself to otherwise you can say that you've visited Marrkech. The Ourika Valley is okay I guess. Pick another mountain destination. The camel ride in the Agafay Desert with dinner under the stars is definitely worth it a deal Moroccan experience. Thank you to Rafiq and Mohamed for arranging this for us.  Overall it's a lovely hotel which caters for your every need while you are a guest. We had a lovely stay and would definitely come back.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/851chetant

Even when walking into the hotel during the day you have a man making mint tea and greet her all guest.    Car parking: excellent valet service and also underground secure parking with an attendant.    Good location 15mins to the medina away for the crowd.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Karl wrote a review May 2022,50,Magical city,We spent 10 days in this magical city. We stayed at the M√∂venpick hotel which is very central to all the amenities in Marrakesh. Our room was very large and the balcony (facing the French consulate) had a large terrace/balcony.  The room was immaculate clean and this is all thanks to Salma who took good care of us everyday. We specifically wanted to point this out and had the chance to speak to Amina (in charge of housekeeping) who really seems to have everything under control regarding this important function in a hotel. Salma you made our stay so pleasant and we are so grateful for all your efforts when coming back to an immaculate clean room every day! We would also like to thank Hassan (the SPA pool) for his great service skills and also Abdelharim at the restaurant for his great experience and speedy service.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,KLK174 wrote a review May 2022,30,"Be warned this is really a conference hotel, not holiday resort",Positives: the hotel was clean our room was large and well appointed great breakfast. Location is great as you are out of the bustle of the old medina but it is v easy to get a cab there - just haggle on price.  Negatives: While we were there it was taken over by a huge conference. The main pool was unavailable as it was set up with food stations so all the loungers were squashed up in the middle pool. The top bar was also reserved for conference attendees. A lot of the loungers were broken cushions dirty. They were also SO understaffed -this could just be a worldwide problem in hospitality post Covid - but again we think probably because of the conference. The two nights we tried to eat in the hotel only one of the restaurants was open. Don't be fooled by 'Garden View' - we were on the 5th floor and could only see a corner of garden if you hung over the balcony. Otherwise the view was onto back streets and cranes. I tried to dispute this but was ensured this was considered a 'garden' room.

Hotel has good facilities with very comfortable beds however the level of customer service is certainly not worthy of 5 stars.    Few examples:    - Long wait at check in in excess of 20 minutes not ideal after a long trip in the heat.    - Pool staff unwilling to source suncream.    - Main pool shut all day while they re-fill with water surely this can be done at night?

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Asmae A wrote a review May 2022,10,Worst Hotel Staff (receptionist) Ever,I have booked this hotel for my parents and I have paid the total amount including taxes through Ctrip. When they were checking out the hotel stopped them saying that the paiement didn‚Äôt go through and that they couldn‚Äôt leave. I spent almost 2 hours between talking to Ctrip operator and the hotel receptionist because she was claiming that there was an issue with the paiement. In the meantime she didn‚Äôt want to let my parents leave until the issue gets fixed even though she knows that we already pre-paid the booking. As a 5 stars hotel I think the least thing they should do it to not include the client in these matters and maybe review and fix their paiements before the check-in or during the stay. Beside that the receptionist was extremely rude and totally unprofessional.  This experience was one of the worst situations I have been through and I don‚Äôt suggest this hotel for anyone they should at least train their receptionists to behave in a professional way and to learn the BASICS of tourism industry.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asmaea228

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Daniel F wrote a review Apr 2022,20,Pretty on the outside only,Read the negative reviews. They are reflecting the truth.    Quality if the hotel:  The hotel looks amazing from the outside. The lobby is incredibly beautiful. At first sight this continues throughout but then scratching only very little under the surface you will find that it was extremely poorly maintained. The loungers by the main pool are all broken. Their mattresses seem intact but never cleaned. The day beds once had cloth shades that now are all damages so that only very few even have them and those that do rather resemble little make shift tents than day beds. The number of umbrellas by the pool is very limited and most stands are damaged and not properly maintained.  Even in the rooms the toilet seats have scratches. House number 7 is facing a night club and the music there is so loud that sleep is impossible to be found. This however staff rectified quickly by giving us another room in house number 6. An upgrade to a suite which we appreciate unfortunately still affected by the noise of the night club.    Service quality  Most staff are friendly and polite. Unfortunately often not very helpful. I once ordered a wine while resting by the pool. Apparently they had run out which is fine. What is not fine is that they instead of informing me about this they just never showed up anymore until i chased them up. More than two hours later i finally got a wine. Thanks for the effort but two hours is too long.    Restaurants  There are several restaurants some of which appear to be closed. We had dinner there one night which was alright but not great.    Spa/Hamam  The Hamam is undergoing renovation. The staff apparently doesn‚Äôt know for how long as it‚Äôs in conjunction with a rebranding exercise‚Ä¶ the Spa unfortunately also fell off as some staff was improperly trained and the renovation noise from the Hamam prevented a relaxing experience.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,san2728 wrote a review Apr 2022,40,Comfortable stay,We stayed here for 5 nights in April and extended it because of relaxed atmosphere and location. This is our second visit to Marrakesh first time we stayed in the Medina but chose this time to stay outside and it was a correct decision. The area around Movenpick is calm and open walking distance to most touristic places. The hotel itself grows on you ; when we first arrived we didn‚Äôt like it and found the staff aloof but soon we started to like it and enjoy. The breakfast at the hotel is excellent and the staff are very helpful; right from Fatima who serves delicious mint tea to chef Walid and Nora who makes good eggs and then Skiriba to name the few made every breakfast morning memorable. We will stay here again when back to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: April 2022,,Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/san2728

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Steven Y wrote a review Apr 2022,50,First time at Movenpick (and Marrakech) and not the last!,This is our first visit to a Movenpick and to Marrakech itself!    What is great about the hotel:    - Breakfast is great and the service is amazing!  (Shout out to the staff that looked after us - especially Moulay Yousef Skiriba and Karim!)  - Great location we walked to most restaurants in the evenings  - Good sized pool  - Good sized rooms  - Good bar area we were able to watch the football  - Staff very helpful and friendly.  - Front desk made some great recommendations to local spas.    Minor improvement area would be that the hotel could do with some minor updates as you can see some wear and tear. But this is very minor given COVID.    So well done to the team for making our stay a memorable one!    Best  Steve (Room 2302),Date of stay: March 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveY1969

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Silvia B wrote a review Mar 2022,50,Nice hotel,I would definitely recommend staying here. It is well located with a nice variety of restaurants within walking distance. We felt perfectly safe walking after dark. My most important consideration is cleanliness and the hotel is spotless. The breakfast buffet is excellent and I love the espresso/coffee/hot chocolate machines. My espresso was very good. I also appreciate having a robe and slippers. It is things like that which elevate the experience.    Some VERY MINOR suggestions to improve. The lighting in the bathroom is not adequate. There is a nice magnifying mirror for makeup/shaving but the light is on the other end of the counter so it is un-usable. Things like hair dryers should be checked and working. The built in was not functioning and they had to bring me 3 (yes 3) others before we got one that worked. Everything worked out and the staff was very nice and I would still stay here again as well as recommend to others.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silviabS1825XR
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,ajp2002 wrote a review Mar 2022,40,Nice Hotel,We stayed at the Movenpick for a week mid February and overall we had a good time. There was an issue regarding our rooms when we first arrived but this was quickly resolved by Hanane who was extremely helpful throughout our stay recommending restaurants and places to visit etc.    The hotel is located in a lovely area Hivernage which is just a 5 minute drive from the City Centre Medina etc. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance from the hotel which are very good Le 6 Dameh and Dar Rhizlane we always felt safe walking to and from the restaurants in the early evening.    We ate at the Spanish Restaurant in the hotel on our last evening and I have to say we were very disappointed. We live in Spain for 6 months of the year and it was possibly the worst Spanish food I have ever tasted. My husband ordered the seafood Fideua which was tasteless I had salmon fillet which way overcooked and again tasteless. After eating out at some very good restaurants in Marrakech we were very disappointed by the Spanish restaurant in the hotel.    Breakfast at the hotel on the other hand was very good lots to choose from and fresh omelettes / eggs made to order. We were looked after extremely well every day by Mostafa and Skiriba (Mohammed) nothing was ever too much trouble for them and they worked very hard to ensure we always had everything we needed.    The rooms in the hotel were very nice and spacious but I have to mention that as nice as our cleaning lady was the standard of cleaning of the rooms and bathrooms wasn't very good at all. It does pain me to say this as our cleaning lady was lovely but it is an area I think definitely needs attention for a 5 star hotel.    Overall we had a nice stay at the hotel the location is perfect for exploring Marrakech and we would stay there again. x,Date of stay: February 2022,,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajp2002

If I may give a recommendation it would be a big plus if the GM Mr Saladin would reconsider that the hotel have again the same restaurant as in 2019.

Breakfast could in some way a little bit better regarding the choice (smoked salmon baguettes smoothies gember fresh red fruits etc...)

What a wonderful team of people with a strong culture of hospitality. They went out of their way in every respect and we are truly impressed by their consistent service.    We had dinner at Marcelona and Khadija continued the welcome with her courteous and attentive service providing us a very satisfying dining experience. The food was outstanding as was our lovely server and we look forward to returning later in the week. We ordered fried anchovies paella and Sea Bass and everything was tasty and well presented.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Anna B wrote a review Oct 2021,50,Amazing,Our 5 days at the Movenpick Marrakech were absolutely amazing . The hotel is very big and gorgeous as we wanted. We were so happy to wake up there every morning . The pictures on internet do not show all the beauty of it as we were absolutely WOWed by it when we arrived and saw it in real life.  It has got a good location lovely restaurants 3 pools and a spa .  The service was top class. We felt like celebs.  The breakfast was really good big choice and stuff was helpful.  I want to thank Nezha at the reception as she was extremely kind and helpful and upgraded us straight away for a lovely room with a terrace and a nice view for my partner‚Äôs 30th birthday. We also received a nice cake to our room for the same reason which was lovely.  At the SPA I would like to thank Najia for my most relaxing massage and a great pedicure - she made my time at the spa unforgettable. Also huge thank you to Hind for an amazing Hammam experience.    Just a minor negative thing I would like to mention is that the pool restaurant stops serving food at 6pm and the only place to eat is the Spanish restaurant. It would be better if they kept serving at least wood fired pizza in the evening. The rooftop bar/lounge was closed and we didn‚Äôt really have anywhere to go for a drink .,Date of stay: October 2021,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annabD7486KQ

BUT. The location was excellent. The room was beautiful and immaculately clean. The lobby/foyer was magnificently decadent. The pool staff were lovely and very attentive. The spa was great staff were friendly and we had very relaxing treatments.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,savvy_dave wrote a review Sep 2021,50,Excellent Stay,A great place to stay in Marrakech. This is a palatial property with beautiful well kept gardens and large and comfortable rooms in several buildings. As Accor Gold member was upgraded to a Deluxe room at check in. Room was huge with a large balcony that was great for either relaxing or dining on large bathroom with double basins huge walk in closet and Nespresso Machine.    All the staff we met were friendly and attentive especially the restaurant and bar staff. Despite the Covid situation and 9pm curfew the hotel does its best to serve an excellent buffet breakfast and all day meals and drinks by the pool.    I particularly liked the spectacular lobby the gardens filled with olive trees. rosemary and lavender the bathroom amenities and the wonderful breakfast enjoyed al fresco in the garden.    Taxi drivers outside the hotel refuse to use their meters and over charge outrageously but walk a few steps and flag one down on the main street like the locals do.    I would happily return to the Movenpick and would warmly recommend it.,Date of stay: August 2021,,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savvy_dave

We checked in and within 15 minutes we were taken to our room and shown were breakfast the pools and kids clubs were.  We chose to stay in a Prestige Suite and wow we were blown away by the size of the room the modern clean decor. The suite has a large living washroom bedroom with a walk in closet and a huge bathroom with a lovely bath in the middle and separate shower and toilet. The balcony had both a relax sitting area and dinning area. This has to be the best room we have ever stayed in! We really didn't want to leave the room!    As it was my birthday the room was decorated with red roses (my fav) and also a cake was provided thank you Nezha for arranging this over email. The service she gave on email was excellent.    We enjoyed our time by the pool Anas Mohamed and Othman really looked after as well and they work so hard especially with the heat being more than what they are normally use too.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Farhan S wrote a review Aug 2021,50,Moroccan Excellence,We simply love the Movenpick hotel here in Marrakech and we would not choose any other hotel. We travel to Marrakech for our business regularly twice a month  on average and we always stay at the Movenpick. The hotel is conveniently located being around 10 minutes from the airport 10 minutes from Gueliz (the shopping area) and around 15mins to the main market square. The hotel is beautiful as soon as you pull up to the entrance you can see the lovely architecture of the hotel whilst being greeted by the door staff and a Moroccan tea. As you walk through the foyer you feel a sense of tranquility and calmness as the flowing water features in the hotel bring you peace. We'd like to make a special mention to the wonderful staff at the front desk namely Leyla and Hanane both wonderful ladies who are very professional at their job and provided us with a first class service from check-in to check-out. They ensured any request we had was met to the highest standards and in a prompt manner. We will always return to this hotel as we feel this is now our home in Marrakech.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,David Z wrote a review May 2021,50,You must stay here when visiting Marrakech!!!,This place was beyond amazing! There are soo many facets to discuss on why you need to stay here when you come to Marrakech. First you are welcomed by the most stunning property with luscious gardens ample space to relax and multiple pools to enjoy. The location of the hotel is excellent as well close to the hustle and bustle of the medina but not too close that you can have time to relax and get away from the craziness. What really sets this hotel apart is the staff. The staff every single one of them accommodated us almost as we were their own family. A special thank you to Nezha Abdellatif and Mr.Khalid from the front desk and Mr.Omar from the restaurant they went beyond our wildest expectations. Throwing us a party with a cake when they found out there was a graduation in our group as well as assisting us with multiple things.

The dinner at the restaurant was so incredibly delicious. The hammam spa and massage was everything I wanted after our trip to the desert. There are touches all around our room that made us feel like we were at home away from home. And finally the safety measures instilled in light of COVID from the hand sanitizers all around the hotel common areas to the small bottles provided for each guest‚Äôs personal use made me feel safe to stay here during a pandemic.

During our check in we were welcomed by lovely Ms. Hanane at the reception who helped us with everything we asked for. The rooms are large newly renovated and though missing some amenities the exceptionally large marble bathroom and the well kept hotel grounds made up for it. Our stay was during the Covid pandemic and the hotel had plenty of hand sanitizing stations scattered generously both indoor and outdoors. All the hotel staff wore masks and the restaurant had signs on the floor and barriers to keep guests at a safe distance from each other.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,n0mad36 wrote a review Apr 2020,10,Being beautiful is not enough,There is no doubt this hotel is beautiful but for the amount of money I paid it was sub-par. First do not book any excursions through this hotel. I booked an excursion through them and paid more than booking through the tour company. They scam you into booking tours and excursions with them and take a huge cut. Honestly don't use the hotel.  Second the staff is lazy and rude! The bell boys stand around watching people and talking. When we asked for directions to the square the guy was so vague and nonchalant. He told us it was a 10 minute walk... It is not! The man at the Chocolate Hour asked me if I was staying at the hotel while I was helping myself. Excuse me? The worst was when the AC didn't work at night. My mom couldn't breathe and it was like a sauna! We called numerously and one person hung up on us!!! We lost an entire night of sleep and we were wrecked the next day. Of course management was no help and didn't make it right. Save your time and money. There are a lot if beautiful hotels in Marakesh.

I got the hands and feet treatment done by Najia at the Spa in Movenpick Marrakech. She took her time and did not rush. I would recommend asking for Najia as she will do it with care and pleasure. The 1 hour treatment was worth the money.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Ed C wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Pretty much as advertised,Our tour started with 3 nights in this hotel. Considering how tired I was after first a long flight and second after a day of touring the only things that I was really interested in was sleep and recharging batteries for my electronics. As far as sleep goes the hotel was very good - I fell asleep quickly and slept soundly. Recharging however was another story. Like many of the hotels outside the US the room's electricity was disconnected when you took your key-card to leave the room and as a result all recharging stopped. I solved this problem by asking for a second card which more or less worked except when the maid removed the card while I was out during the day. Since it was part of my tour I have no idea of how much we paid so I can't assess its value.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Arlington, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edc338

The hotel's facilities are also impressive and you can tell that each area is well maintained. They have 3-4 pools including one calmer and more private perfect for people with kids.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Rachael S wrote a review Feb 2020,30,Nice experience if you can even get in,Me my boyfriend and his mother (on holiday in Marrakesh) tried to access this hotel on a day pass to use the pool and restaurant area. When we arrived we were told by reception when we enquired there was NO ROOM and we would not be able to get in the pool because it would be so full.    One member of staff rudely dismissed us and directed us to someone else.    We then just booked the pass online which we would have done before but we thought it would have been better to book face to face at the hotel and make sure everything was in order with the deal. Once presented with our booking She then eventually admired us entry but said we would not be able to get in the pool.    Once inside the pool area and loungers were basically empty expect for a few families and couples sun bathing. We were shown to a day bed area and enjoyed our time their a lot! The food was great fresh pizza by the pool. Sampled local Casablanca beer and the life guard was very friendly. Such a shame that such a great experience was ruined by prejudice fount of house staff. No large party arrived until 6pm which is when the day pass ends anyway. Either way they did not take up all the space in this massive hotel!!!,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachaelsW3217DM
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,NKP30000 wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Beautiful resort with Brilliant staff,We are a very lucky family we have stayed at some beautiful hotels. But the Movenpick in Marrakech is simply one of the best. The hotel is stunning there's incredible art work in the reception area and you are greeted with beautiful sofas in stunning colours and it's obvious that this is a classy hotel.  Our room was beautiful  it was incredibly clean and very modern and we had a lovely terrace which overlooked the well kept gardens. In the afternoon  I would sit on the terrace and I would spend hours enjoying the absolute peace. The bathroom was great and had the most fantastic shower. The WiFi was excellent there was a very strong signal. Breakfast was a wonderful treat. There were so many staff who would constantly make sure you had everything that you needed. The food was lovelywe really looked forward to Breakfast. All of the staff were so welcoming and always smiling. There was a wonderful lady who would prepare your eggs. Every single staff member was brilliant. We had lunch at the hotel and the food was very well prepared. My family used the spa every day and even had beauty treatments. They said the spa was one of the best that they've ever used. Well done to Fatima Fatin and Ghizlan  my wife said they were excellent. Mourad worked at the reception and he was happysmiling and always willing to help. He's very good. They've got a wonderful steam sauna and open air jacuzzi. The resort has a number of pools and they even have a heated swimming pool. Great facilities and very welcoming staff in the pool area. Well done Movenpick Marrakech we have all said that your hotel is one of the best that we've every stayed at. Brilliant hospitality and brilliant staff.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,3DMatrix wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Very enjoyable and comfortable stay,Upon our arrival the reception was full of guests waiting to check-in and most appeared to be tired and somewhat frustrated. Our check-in process was overly long and it appeared the front desk staff were overwhelmed. The chap who checked us iin was a bit of a smart alec who was speaking down to us until he was taken down a peg by me. I am annoyed that I failed to note down his name.    We also didn't feel the usual Moroccan warm welcome there was no mint tea (or any beverage) offered upon arrival. In addition of the 4 rooms booked only 3 were ready and it took 2 hours for the fourth room to be ready. We eventually had to make a fuss and were given a complimentary dinner at the hotel's top restaurant the Urban Brasserie for later that evening.    The hotel's interiors are phenomenal interiors everywhere you look there's a picture begging to be taken. Sufficed to say the Instagram aficionados amongst us went on a picture taking spree for the duration of our stay. The rooms and bathrooms were generously sized but then again that's what we paid for. The first thing we did was to fill up the large bath tub and take a soak. with some wine. We both really enjoyed that.    Dinner at Urban Brasserie:  - Lovely service  - Attentive staff  - Delicious meal  - The only minus would be that the main hostess appeared to be a tad full of herself.    Daily breakfast at Saray Restaurant  - Extensive selection  - Delicious  - Looked forward to it everyday of our stay    Cocktails at 54¬∞ Steak & Bar:  - Pricey  - Not quite sure the barman knew what he was mixing    In terms of hotel staff the cleaning ladies deserve a mention as they where lovely warm and always full of smiles.    To summarize the hotel was great for what it was with mostly good staff other than the odd annoying git.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Jim wrote a review Feb 2020,40,"Great service, nice resort but with tiring amenities",We stayed a week in January 2020 here as a family of four.    The service at the hotel was near perfect. From the pool staff through to the restaurant staff and especially our room cleaner - Mina - they were excellent. For example the kids loved to come into our room and find how their toys had been set-up that day by her. All were very attentive and kind.    In terms of the rooms and amenities the resort is looking a bit tired. From mosaics coming away from the main pool floor to a number of faulty lifts it is in need of a little tlc. Equally we got adjoining rooms but they were connected by an antechamber that then had a separate door onto the hotel corridor which made us feel a little vulnerable with the two young kids in the next room. Our room had a balcony overlooking either the generator or incinerator that would lead to a low thud early in the morning as it kicked it alongside a smell of burning if the wind blow in a certain direction (though this wasn't all the time).    Location wise its in a nice but quiet neighbourhood. The downside is that their aren't too many eating options outside of the resort unless you walk for more than 10mins.    Overall we would stay at the Movenpick again because of the staff but would be more careful about the room we choose.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamessV4032GU

There are also a couple of swimming pools.    The food was pretty good considering they had to feed about 550 people 3 meals a day plus coffee breaks. Mostly it was buffet so it did get repetitive after a couple of days but breakfast was always awesome and a few of the dinners were quite good.    My room was quiet clean and spacious. It had a mini fridge and water bottles were replenished with maid service. Huge bathroom with a large shower (no bathtub) robe slippers good towels etc. Just no wash cloths for some reason.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,LJGMJLAJAI wrote a review Jan 2020,30,Too large to feel authentic?,We stayed in a variety of accommodations in Morocco and this place was the least welcoming. This might have to do with its size however as far as large hotels go we also stayed in an all-inclusive and in another luxury hotel and these two were VERY welcoming. You know have a seat with the mint tea upon arrival. I chose this hotel as I thought the photos made it look rather exotic. Quite the opposite. Again just too big. Lastly though the staff was very accommodating in keeping our two rooms within close vicinity of each other we ended up in a wheelchair accessible room and it was not very comfortable: ie. stationary shower chair is right underneath shower head difficult to shower. Fabric desk chair was in bad shape - quite filthy. For the price everything should be pristine rooms comfortable.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,IRENE S wrote a review Jan 2020,10,Staff attitude and service horrible,I and my husband joined Insight Vacations for Morocco tour. We arrived in Marakech on Dec 25 2019 and stayed there for 2 nights. Our Tour Director handed us the room key and confirmed that our room was twin bed as we strongly requested upon booking the tour. We were shocked the room given to us was not twin instead it was double bed. The staff then re-arranged twin bed for us. However when we opened the door someone was still occupying the room with her stuff all over the bed so we quickly closed the door and informed the staff. They did not seem to show any concern or apologetic at all. Thereafter the staff again re-arranged another twin bed for us which was away from the group.    On the same night at around midnight after washing my hair only then I realised the hair dryer was not working so I called the receptionist/front desk to get the replacement and told him that I need it urgent as my hair was wet after having waited for 15 min no one came so I called again the receptionist informed me only 1 staff was working that night however he promised to ask the staff to attend to my request first before attending to other calls. I waited for almost 1 hr still no one turned up so I came down with my messy hair to approach the front desk it was about 13-15 minutes walk from my room (2 ways). When I checked with him he didn't respond instead he quickly made a call using his cellular phone after waited for over 5 minutes I interrupted him to ask if he has got the replacement hair dryer he asked me to wait as he was checking with the staff on the phone only after almost 10 minutes he showed me the photo on his phone that the hair replacement dryer was already hanged on my room door handle. When I left my room it was not there. I felt very frustrated and furious with the staff attitude. I should say almost all the staff are not friendly and helpful. Someone from our group also complained that front desk didn't pick up her call another said she asked for iron board but didn't get it. No doubt that probably it was during holiday season where the hotel was crowded and the staff was busy but in the hospitality industry this kind of attitude is definitely a no no...,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IRENE0010
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Fabienne M wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Excellent hotel and excellent service!,"We travel almost every month to Marrakesh. I stay for the first time at the Movenpick together with my husband from December 8th till 12 2019 at Movenpick Hotel in Marrakesh and we have been very satisfied and surprised about the quality of the hotel and the excellent service by all the Staff.    Mr Mohssine from the reception and his colleagues where very professional and very helpful. Since my husband is an Accor Platinum (now Diamond) member the ""Reception Staff"" ( Mr Mohssine and also two very kind and helpful ladies) treated us accordingly including the room upgrade. Check-in and check-out were quick.    Since 2013 we stay always in another 5 star Accor hotel at Hivernage in Marrakesh.    We both had a wonderful time at the Movenpick despite our short stay because we were most of the time outside the hotel and couldn't unfortunately not enjoy of all the facilities the Movenpick offers.    The food at the restaurant was excellent and the staff at the restaurant are very professional .    Breakfast could in some way a little bit better regarding a larger choice of the buffet and bread such as the famous ""parisienne or baguette""  smoked salmon fruits fresh smoothies etc where missing.    The room (building Aboufaris) was very nice and clean.    My husband had some problems with the Wi-Fi at the moment of our stay but the reception told us that next time the problem will be solved.    All the personal have been so helpful and friendly during our short stay.    My compliments to the Management and complete Staff.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Sunshine J wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Fantastic hotel!,I normally stay at the Sofitel when I travel to Marrakech but due to the hotel being fully booked for part of my stay I decided to try Movenpick for the dates I couldn't stay at the Sofitel. Well It ended up being such a blessing! As Movenpick is now a new favourite place that I will stay when visiting Marrakech! I had a wonderful time! Everyone was so lovely especially beautiful Nezha at reservations she was extremely professional helpful and very sweet and she would always greet me with a big smile! I would also like to thank a few other special people like Taha my waiter he's truly an amazing guy he seemed to genuinely love his job! Also Kamal the chef ibtissam and Mahdi they both did the most amazing omelettes for me!! The lovely cleaners Noura and Fatima and finally the fantastic spa staff like Imane and especially the manager Amal Mimbane I stupidly hurt my toe very badly and blood went everywhere in the spa it was totally my fault but I was so shocked at how fast the staff acted... I couldn't believe it..... within a few minutes they got a doctor to look after me and help clean my toe. I didn't get the doctors name but I would like to thank him too!! I felt very embarrassed but they all made me feel better very kind caring spa staff!!    My only small criticism is that the breakfast should be more varied after 6 days there it got a little boring seeing the same things most days. If the chefs could mix it up a little more it would be amazing!!!

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,sadLsore1 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Excellent hotel,We stayed at Movenpick Hotel for 4 nights over Christmas and came away very happy with most aspects of the experience. We arrived a couple of hours ahead of the check-in time of 3pm but our room was ready for us and the check-in process was handled quickly and efficiently.  The hotel is situated in the new part of the city and some distance from the Medina and main tourist sights so you do need to think about using taxi's or tour company's to get around as its a long walk otherwise and there is not much to see nearby.  Our room was one of the classic rooms but it was spacious clean and well-equipped and the only negative aspect was that our room in block 2 was overlooking a service area with the aircon units and this was periodically very noisy if you had the balcony door open.  Breakfast was excellent and offered just about everything you could possibly want - except English tea. As a large percentage of the guest were English it would be nice to have this option for those who don't like local tea (coffee drinkers had every option imaginable). We had evening meals in Dada's bistro and Manso Tapas bar which are in the hotel and the food in both was very good and reasonably priced although the service in Dada's was a bit sluggish. Also the pizza's from the pool bar were excellent.  We really liked the Movenpick and despite a few minor niggles it is an excellent hotel with wonderful multi-lingual staff and I would happily stay again if visiting Marrakesh.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Godalming, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sadLsore1
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,GenevaJules wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Excellent place to stay in Marrakech!,One quick story first to tell the sort of place this is:  We were a group of 6. We booked 5 nights + half board. Upon our arrival we found out that our half board plan entitled us to one restaurant only (the brasserie) and that this restaurant was serving Italian food mainly. We like Italian cuisine but hadn't come to Morocco to have anything but Moroccan cuisine. We complained about this to the reception whilst we were checking in. We saw the Head of Reception Leila taking our disappointment in earnest and doing her best to address our problem. Minutes after this we received confirmation that the Chef Tarek would cook special menus for us. And so he did! We had 5 fantastic dinners cooked specially for us by Tarek and his team. One of the best couscous I ever had a great fish tajine a slow-cooked melting lamb shoulder ... all really good made from quality ingredients and very nicely presented. Frankly making a special menu every evening just for the 6 of us was the sort of thing you only rarely see and for sure a special attention which we won't forget. A big thanks to Leila + Tarek and his team again!    Pluses:  - Professional and friendly staff trying its very best to make your stay a memorable one. A few members really stood out: Leila at the Reception Tarek the Chef of the restaurant the team of waiters at the brasserie restaurant and many more whose first names we can't recall. Everyone will smile at you and try to help.  - Real 5-star experience nicely decorated and clean hotel. Nice and clean rooms very good beds.  - Great spa and fitness facilities  - Outstanding cuisine from Chef Tarek  - Good breakfast    Minuses:  - Location is convenient to reach from the airport but you'll have to ride a cab to get to the medina or other landmarks. Expect to pay 50 DAM every time you go to the medina and another 50 when you return.  - There's no free hotel shuttle from/to the airport  - Fruit salads at the breakfast could be better. Same applies to coffee.    We'd definitely consider staying there again.    Tip: a few good (official) taxi drivers often park in front of the Moevenpick. Try to hire Laarbi (see attached picture) and ask him for a day tour of Ourika + Plateau du Kik + Asni + Lalla Takerkoust dam. Laarbi speaks perfect French knows the history of Morocco like he were a book and was super friendly to us. Ask him to make a stop in Asni to Brahim's.

Very chic but comfortable. The staff is incredibly attentive and want to do everything to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. I was collected from the airport by the hotel transport that is outstanding. It went flawlessly as it was my first time visiting Marrakech and didn't feel comfortable taking a taxi right away. The cost was affordable for such service. We drove up to the property and I instantly knew this was going to be an experience. Once checked in I was greeted by Asma who invited to show me around the hotel at my convenience. I'm glad I took her offer and got to learn a lot about the brand and the hotel.    To my surprise I was upgraded to a suite which was truly magnificent for my ten day stay. So how do you beat that? Well the staff continued to be pleasant and helpful the entire stay especially the concierges Bader and Amine! These guys are true professionals and gave great recommendations and insight about the magical red city! For such a large hotel you don't feel lost in the crowd. Oh and the bar is super cool you have to have a visit even if you don't drink alcohol. It's just beautiful to see.

The hotel has a few pools spa yoga restaurants bars etc.    On checking in Hanane was very welcoming and set the scene for a lovely stay. She was caring and made sure our room was spacious enough for our family of 4. She was also there on checking out to say her goodbyes.    The hotel has a lovely kid's club where we were able to leave the kids for hours while we had a relaxing holiday. The club is managed by Nehza who was absolutely caring and looked after the kids like they were hers. They were well fed and engaged in all sorts of activities (all free) The kids kept wanting to go back there all through thr holiday. I was very comfortable leaving my 3 and 5 years olds in the capable hands of Nehza and her lovely team.    Breakfast won't be the same without the lovely Nassima who welcomed us with a smile and lovely conversations. The fantastic Med Amine who was constantly checking that we had all we needed and for keeping the kids occupied while we grabbed breakfast and the lovely lady who made the best eggs every morning always rembering our usual orders (sorry I can't remember her name but you can't miss her lovely smile).

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,walshemf e wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Nothing to critisize-everything to praise,We stayed 7 nights for a golf holiday. No matter where you stay you will always find something to critisize but really I cannot think of anything at all we were unhappy about. It is a massive hotel arranged in blocks and as a result impersonal. After 7 days we did not really know any of the staff at all but that was fine. Remi on reception was very helpful indeed as was every single staff member we met. They could not have been more helpful respectful and kind. The breakfast is superb the best we have had anywhere and the impressive boss of that service runs it like clockwork and clearly commands huge respect from his staff. The rooms sheets cleaning pool etc etc were without fault. We relaxed poolside late afternoon and whilst it was crowded at times there was no problem finding a spot to relax and read. It was December though. The hotel is about 2 km ish from the Medina which is a perfect escape from the frentic city . We walked to the restaurants in Gueliz nearly every night- well the same restaurant as often as we could (plus 61-cool excellent etc ) . We had not been to Marrakech before and did a lot of research on taxis as we were taking them to different golf courses each day. We booked the hotel transport from the airport which was the right decision to avoid the hassle of the taxis late at night- but very expensive- we knew this in advance and it was the right decision but only for our first visit. There is a taxi rank outside and we found our fabulous man in Morocco on day 2 who looked after us the whole time. We negotiated the price before we set foot in any taxi- the legal meters were nowhere to be seen. I got ill whilst there with a rotton cold. I wish I could remember the name of the wonderful young man in the back bar who brought me a fabulous ginger and honey drink when he realised I was ill-thank you. We loved Marrakech and hope to return in 2020-we looked at some other hotels whilst there for future planning- we will be rebooking the Movenpick without hesitation. Thank you. Absolutely Excellent. We also had the addes glamour of the wonderful film festival when we were there. Well done to all.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Galway, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GalwayWalshfamily

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Vlogs by Salma B wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Not 5 star service,If your looking for 5 star service then this is not the place. We stayed there for 6 nights and had multiple issues during the night our shower went off by itself multiple times. I told the manager Amin who was very hard to get a hold of then finally when we did speak to him he was very dismissive of the issue and didn‚Äôt have any empathy of the fact that we both had a sleepless night and as a result told us we could change rooms with no upgrade offered this was on day 5 so we asked him to send a technician to fix the problem which was fixed finally. He then offered us a drink at the bar I was horrified by his response and refused that and said you should be offering us a lot more than a drink he then went onto say well you can have a meal. I‚Äôm sorry but if I can afford to stay in a 5 star I can for sure afford a drink and the meal the way it was presented to us was as if he was giving it as charity and did not properly invite us to have dinner at the restaurant so we didn‚Äôt go. He never followed up to see if the shower was fixed. Worst service I‚Äôve ever received. The only thing this hotel does have is great breakfast the chefs were amazing and the location is great too. I‚Äôd personally avoid it and stay in an all inclusive like the be live collection hotels.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Adnan H wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Fantastic family hotel & great location.,We stayed here for 5 nights as a family with half board for my daughters birthday. Location was great located centrally in Marrakech all the touristic sights were 5-10 mins away by taxi. Hotel room and layout was superb staff were all very kind and really attentive during our stay. Breakfast was excellent a wide variety of foods to choose from great selection for kids too. Pool and gym facilities were good and the small lounge restaurants nearby were convenient for grabbing a small snack during the day.    If your looking to relax and unwind from the madness of the medina then the Hotel Spa is where you want to be its fantastic and my wife loved her treatments there would highly recommend it.    The kids club was the best thing for my 4 year old daughter all the team looked after her really well and we will never forget their kindness and affection during our stay.    The hotel staff including the room cleaners and restaurant dinner team did a surprise room decoration and birthday dinner treat that my daughter really loved. We really appreciated this and would like to thank them all for making our stay very memorable.    Our only negative point of our stay was the half board menu! We literally had the same menu several times which was disappointing considering we paid a lot of money for it. The hotel should do more to look after guests that upgrade to this service.    Special thanks to the following    reception team including saied and hanane for sorting out our late checkout for free. Kalsoum at the SPA. The dinner team at urban Ahmed mahmood Nissim & Sara and the rest of the guys. Breakfast restaurant team including brahim and the lady chef by the name edissim amazing omelette flipper. And finally the ladies at the kids club Touria zahira and nena were all fantastic and we were made to feel at home. Hopefully we meet again in'sha'allah.    Ps. There is a taxi driver outside the hotel with a large ssangyong best avoided as he is a serial over charger!

Its a quick walk to the mall and to the bus station. The breakfast is amazing and the artwork is breathtaking. When you enter the lobby the smell is lovely and everything is just perfect. However the best part of the hotel was the staff on our second day we visited the Medina and I left my phone in the taxi. We attempted to chase down the taxi to no avail. I had lost hope but later that evening I went to the lobby and the three girls (Nezha Afaf and Hind) helped me track my phone via Find my phone in addition they used their personal phones to try and ring my international number. Story short two additional guys one named Faisal and the other guy who translated for my husband also helped. Ultimately with the help of the staff and tracking down my phone I was able to get my phone back!

You would probably want to take a taxi to the Medina and back if you want to visit it It is a resort style of a hotel and there were a lot of families there.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,NadineMojo wrote a review Nov 2019,40,International chain with a Moroccan twist,Positives about this place:  - Impressive entrance and interior design which gives an image of Moroccan grandeur  - Large selection of food at breakfast buffet which stays till 10:30. I sincerely appreciate the young gentlemen who prepares the eggs (he can make a very delicious omelette).  - Clean and spacious rooms  - AMAZING and highly resourceful concierge. Mr. Amine is truly a gem in this place. He truly presents a 5 star experience with his positive and warm attitude. He is very attentive to all guests and the Movenpick is truly lucky to have him on board.  - Great location. Safe in the Eglise area of Marrakech.    Negatives (potential to improve):  - Slow check-in and check-out (they really need to improve their reception service)  - Huge property. We were not aware of this! Our friend ended up staying in a different building which was not a big problem but it would have been nice to know prior to our arrival.  - We had some insects in our room (we noticed them on the curtains). This could be because we once left the bathroom window open. However it is something to look out for.    Overall it is a great place to stay in.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Bright0nian wrote a review Nov 2019,30,Nice Hotel with lots of potential but not five star,There is a lot to like about the Movenpick Marrakech - Superior rooms are of a good standard. Breakfast is excellent. The pool area is spacious. Pool and cleaning staff are extremely conscientious and friendly. We had nice meals at the various Resturants. Notable employees included Ghizlane from the cleaning staff Hind at reception and the lady who made the Omelettes.    However there are a number of things which lets this hotel down badly but notably Reception staff - genearlly have little attention to customers needs. On one day we asked for assistance about a tour to the Majorelle Gardens and was told to look at the internet or come back the next day when the concierge would be available. Even worst on checkout we were asked to stand in a separate queue and were left waiting for over 10 minutes to be allowed to check out - there were others behind us. When we finally caught the attention of a member of staff the young man was surly and appeared to be having an argument with his female supervisor and other members of staff. This continued throughout the whole check out process. I have never experienced such a poor check out process in any hotel. Several days we noticed people having difficulty at reception from surly staff (usually the same staff) and waited until more friendly staff were available to seek assistance eg Hind.    Overall this is a good standard four star hotel. Standards would jump significantly if the reception staff had a customer focused mindset.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Brighton, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bright0nian

Plenty of pools from large to small. Breakfast is amazing difficult to restrain oneself from eating too much the fresh made orange juice and Moroccan pancakes where my favorite. We had dinner at the hotel for our first night too tired to go out it was exceptional especially the service. Special thanks to Hasna in reservations the front desk i wish i got his name he was so helpful and accommodating. Not to forget the head of housekeeping Samira who was very helpful as well.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cannes, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909klausl
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Isabella wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Lovely decor,Lovely hotel with lots of hidden treasures by way of art work and decor of the public areas. Just loved the ambiance of the hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Stayed in the main block and the lift was a bit hard to find initially - all part of the fun!. My room didn't quite live up to the rest of the hotel. Despite being a non-smoking room it smelled of stale cigarette smoke and was rather small. Loved the rest of the hotel so much I didn't really mind. Truly awesome breakfast spread with a wide array of continental and Moroccan dishes. Nice pool area with a resort feel which could get a bit noisy during the day with the loud music played by a DJ. However there were several other pools including a quiet one near the spa. Several different eating options available within the hotel including a vegan restaurant. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay,Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isabellao597

The rooms are spacious and the beds heavenly! Gorgeous black marble bathroom with separate loo. Also the hotel is very quiet. We had a massage which was lovely the spa and gym facilities are beautiful. As you walk through the hotel you are surrounded with gorgeous smells. It‚Äôs about a 10 min taxi ride to the M√©dina there were always taxis outside. There is a street next to the hotel that has modern restaurants and a supermarket.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Salvador L wrote a review Oct 2019,30,Beautiful Nice Hotel with Unfair Service Treatment,The hotel it's impressive from the arrival. The architecture and the forniture and decoration it's amazing in all corners. But to check in with a non smiling reception staff that takes 350‚Ç¨ from you credit card as deposit without warning firstly it's not a good start. Another collegues travelling with me were taken up to 900‚Ç¨ this while our accomodation was previously paid. So they charge as they feel with the excuse that this way you have money in the room account to pay any orders at the bars or restaurants.  This is another point to review. The prices of the food and beverage it's simply too expensive. 9‚Ç¨ for a glass of house wine or 7‚Ç¨ for a local beer it's too much in a slow and not smiling service.  About the service as low is the job position as more as they smile and polite are. The rooms keepers are lovely and always saying bon jour with a smile. The woman cooking the omelettes at the breakfast bufe is an artist and charmy. But concierge and receptionist are not that much.  The breakfas bufe is just enough (5 over 10). For a hotel with pices like the ones they charge they should have a look into Gran Melia Hotels breafast for example as this hotel is the range of prices as Gran Melia Palacio de Isora for example.  The room was amazing nice and the bed was one of the best I ever sleep on.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Dana S wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Large hotel with beautiful grounds,I came here with a Gate 1 tour and was very impressed by the grounds and public areas. It's beautiful to walk around and discover all the art work and decor. The room was nice mostly average with weak air conditioning. The bed was very comfy. I did the Royal Hammam treatment in the spa which was a unique experience. Not totally relaxing because it's a serious exfoliation but the spa set up was lovely and the attendant gave good service. My only gripe was the service at the pool bar as it was slow and not attentive. I had to finally get up and ask for the check at the bar because the server never came back. I did get a margherita pizza there and it was pretty tasty. I think you'll be pleased to stay at the hotel and only a couple minor adjustments would make it 5 star.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Orlando, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misseattle

The guys on the front door to the hotel can advise a ball park figure for what you should be paying which is handy. Make sure you agree the price before getting in the cab.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,travelclub wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Marrakech 2019,Booked as a 60th birthday present the hotel went out of their way to make it a very memorable experience. We arrived late morning but recognising very quickly that we would have caught an early flight and would be hungry Mohammed (Manager) from the restaurant treated us like guests in his home. Despite the breakfast service being over with he served us everything he thought we would like.    On arrival our room was upgraded to a suite and during the stay the hotel had arranged for the room to be decorated and a cake to celebrate.    Waited on like royalty every morning by the waiters at breakfast and the staff at reception always offering exceptional service there was no single thing one could fault or complain about.    Thank you to all at the hotel whose path we crossed helped in every way possible and making this a joyous and happy stay / occasion.    Ps. The Moroccan doughnuts served at breakfast are a must.    + Marrakech has a history and with that plenty of places to visit (Ouzoud Falls/Atlas Mountains Jardin Majorelle Koutoubia Mosque and Bahia Palace)    + Opportunities to relax and enjoy the sun.    - The hustle and bustle of the M√©dina (snake / monkey charmers) and the taxi drivers full of empty promises (including those outside the hotel).    - Ben Youssef Mosque closed for 2 years for restoration.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelclub77

I want to point out specially every morning in the Restaurant when I was having my Breakfast a waiter a very young nice looking man approached to my table and a very polite way he introduced himself as Mohamed Skiriba. He asked me how are you Madan ? And if I want a coffee. For the three mornings that I have a breakfast there he with his kindness really made me feel like at home. This Hotel itself is amazing beautiful comfortable relaxing but with the upstanding service by the charming and friendly employees like Mohamed this Hotel is over the top. I extremely recommended .

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,clairethetraveler872 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Long overdue review,Excellent service here! The front desk agents (Nezha & Souhail) and the restaurant staff at Urban Brasserie were friendly and helpful. The pools were never crowded so it was plenty relaxing. We had two adjoining rooms - with a lot of space and a back patio for each room. Bathrooms were extremely spacious I could do yoga in it. The only thing I would be wary of are the taxi cab drivers that linger outside of the hotel looking for someone to overcharge for a ride to the Medina. With careful bargaining you can avoid the switch and bait. However this should not deter Western travelers from enjoying this beautiful place (it's only a small nuance which you'll laugh about later).,Date of stay: July 2019,,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairethetraveler872

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,TravelerBAW wrote a review Sep 2019,30,"Customer service, timeliness and 5 star standards",I am on my 6th out of 8 day stay at the M√∂venpick Marrakech. The hotel‚Äôs entrance is quite grand which gives a good first impression to guests. However the standard goes downhill from there pretty quickly.    1. 4 out of the 5 staff at the Jamra restaurant are rather abrupt. Service is very slow and inefficient regardless whether busy or not. That was my first stop to grab a light lunch after I had checked in. I returned the next day for a quick bite in between outings. Same experience: forgotten to set my table whilst I was waiting. Had to go and get salt and pepper from another table olive oil from the main counter..I have not gone back there since. Visit was @afternoon of Sunday 8th September around 3pm and again on Monday 10th September at the same time. Needless to say I have not been back there and will not go back during the rest of my stay.  The waiters and the duty manager could benefit from customer service training. Service standard is definitely not what can be expected from a 5 star establishment.    2. There have been very long queues at the front desk; 90% of the time. Just inefficient    3. BBC world news has not been available for 3 days. It is still not available. I have never stayed at any hotel claiming to have satellite TV where major news services are not available. I have travelled to other African countries; the Caribbean and Latin America. I have never experienced this before....One of these days there was no TV news service whatsoever; I don‚Äôt think any of the other channels worked either. I had made several calls to guest services with the promise someone would come over (starting the first day when there was no TV service); but no one came until the third call I had made. By then CNN was being transmitted; however I shouldn‚Äôt have to watch a news channel I don‚Äôt particularly like. The feedback from the person who came to look at the TV connection was that there is a transmission problem with the BBC news international service in all the rooms. Again how is this 5 star standard when the issue is left unresolved for 3 days I wonder....    3. Breakfast buffet lacks variety by 5 star standards. It‚Äôs more of a 4 star. Quantity doesn‚Äôt make up for quality or better standard.    4. Interesting experience I had not encountered anywhere else in the past (and I have travelled across the globe). This was my first time in Marrakech.  a. I am of mixed heritage and I was questioned by one restaurant staff ( he appeared to be the manager) when walking in to the breakfast buffet. Whether I was staying at the hotel etc.. he didn‚Äôt even take my room number. You either ask all guests whether they are staying at the hotel or when they go for breakfast or you don‚Äôt. Staff should not be questioning people based on what their heritage might be. This is quite offensive and disrespectful. I did not see him do that to anyone else.  b. Secondly one of the times I came back from a city tour; and made my way to the main entrance; one of the security guards chased me and questioned me. I had been in and out a couple of times before and this had not happened. Again either make everyone be stopped at the entrance or you don‚Äôt. There was nothing particular about my attire. Normal outfit over knees skirt and top with sleeves ( if I was inappropriately dressed I would have accepted it).    5. I would however like to thank all the staff at the Dada‚Äôs diner. All the ladies and gents there were most courteous pleasant welcoming and polite. The waiters from the Jamra restaurant might benefit from shadowing that team to learn what good customer service is.    6. The front desk staff are generally helpful with varying levels of approachability. Unfortunately some of them seem unhappy to be there. Perhaps because they are generally very busy - can‚Äôt say.    Having said that Mohssin has been very helpful in providing me with information on the various local activities to do. He is always welcoming with a smile has been most helpful patient and courteous when answering my various questions.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerBAW
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Jessica VM wrote a review Sep 2019,20,Not my kind of 5 star hotel,Not sure how this is considered a 5 star hotel but it doesnt fly by my standards. I met 2 friendly staff members and thats about it. The hotel room is small okay however the shower pressure or just the shower head was so poor that my head was basically against the wall in order to get water on my head. The hose that is next to the toilet was broken and broken on the wall as well. The toilet stopped working at one point and didnt flush and my biggest concern was the the sliding door (we were on the first floor) didnt even shut / lock. I couldnt sleep the entire night knowing that the door was just open. zero security around the premises (unlike the four seasons). Our suitcases were lost so we had to keep calling out to call our credit card company and airline and we had to call the reception everytime in order to do so. At one point they would just hang up the phone on me when I would ask and it happened multiple times. When I asked for an iron it never came. These are all scenarios that I would not expect to happen at a 5 star hotel. The breakfast was alright.. eggs were all under cooked and by that i mean raw. While the spread was huge the quality was not. Needless to say i cancelled my next night and stayed at the fours seasons. I will give it this much it is very close to the medina and the mall. so for location purposes its good.,Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicavF4070ED

Most of the staff are friendly but don't ask for anything one minute past their ""closing time"" because you won't get it... I had to beg for just a glass of wine after a long day of work and literally one minute past their closing time of 6:45 pm.  We had dinner at their restaurant one night - it was buffet style and all the left overs that we had been served for lunch that same day.  Housekeeping is never consistent and comes at all different times half does your room and then comes back again. I never get the coffee / sugar / cream supplied in the same fashion every day. There's always something missing.  Worst of all we got 2 rooms in the very back of the hotel (paid for superior suites!) and as they overlook the road and a night club we are woken up every single morning before 5 am by the noise of people shouting and cars honking. It's ridiculous and not ideal when you're here for work (or holiday for that matter!).

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Amar Y wrote a review Aug 2019,20,Avoid,Me and my friends stayed here for 4 nights in the junior suites.    The hotel is in a great location scores of restaurants and the mall close by. It is also close to the airport around 10-15mins via taxi which is great after travelling all day so you can get to your room and relax asap. NOT in our case we arrived at the hotel around 8pm and our rooms were not ready. I found this absurd as that room would have been empty when the previous guests checked out at the very latest 11am that day. Reception simply told us to wait in the lobby. I was not happy and after complaining was offered a drink. I said I'm hungry after a long day of travelling and to the hotels credit they gave us pizzas and drinks by the pool free of charge.    The junior suites were incredible inside spacious luxurious huge balcony with comfy sofas and tables stunning lounge area huge bathroom with 2 sinks and extra toilet and sink in a separate area incase the bathroom was occupied. The downside is the walls are paper thin so you will be disturbed constantly if the suite next to you is occupied. DO NOT use the mini bar as each drink is extortionate instead go to the shop across the road and stock up on drinks. You would have thought that at a five star hotel staying in a suite paying what we paid for the rooms that the drinks in the mini bar would be complimentary. My friends who were also in a suite aircon did not work very well. They asked reception to fix this and eventually complained but this was never sorted.    The hotel is huge and does not have enough pools or sun loungers to accommodate the volume of guests. Although you get towels from the pool staff they allow people to leave those towels on the loungers and go back to their rooms. People had to resort to putting towels on the grass next to the pool to sun bathe.    Overall I had a less than satisfactory stay. I really did love my suite when of the 4 days 2 days were quiet as there were no occupants next door. Breakfast was standard average. I would not recommend staying at this hotel as there is always a long wait at reception as there is clearly not enough staff and you will always struggle finding a sun lounger. Air con not working seems to be a common problem as We saw and spoke to a few other guests experiencing the same issue. The mini bar prices are a joke the amount added to our check out bill was insane ¬£6 for a can of Coke Zero as an example. This hotel has a long way to go. Me and my friends have fallen in love with Marrakech and are coming back in 2020 but will definitely not be staying here.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Preston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amary2013

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Ninham wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Not a 5 star at all!,This hotel should never be a 5 star. Maybe maybe it should be a 4 star. All over booking places it says family hotel that‚Äôs ok because it‚Äôs lots of pools. So you think that‚Äôs no problem. But this hotel should be named to Movenpick KIDS hotel. Way to many kids. And the hotel is big. There is not enough sun beds at all! People wake up at 8 in the morning and ‚Äúreserves‚Äù the beds even the swim guards reserves for family‚Äôs and they get paid by them! This is very annoying and the hotel just accept it!  The breakfast is the same every day!  The rooms are old the aircoindition in the rooms sounds like a jet engine. It‚Äôs a a lot of loud music at night. I recommend this hotel ONLY for family‚Äôs with kids!

The 5 minute steam followed by a series of vigorous scrubbing and rinsing left years of dead skin on the cool marble slab I was lying on. Julia had firm hands and a ready smile which added to the whole relaxing experience. Now I just need to add hammam to my beauty routine regularly!

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,John wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Friendliness,I have stayed in this hotel many times during the past 3 years this year for several weeks.  After 43 years in aviation and close to 100 hotel nights per year this hotel is certainly on my top 10 list with regards to value for money.  The facilities and restaurants are hard to match but what impresses me most is the friendliness of the staff.  Aspecially the pool staff but also cleaners reception and waiters appears to be top motivated and always receive you with a smile. Whatever you need they will provide it always with a pleasant attitude and some kind words.  I can most certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially frequent travellers.,Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnfryd
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,traveler4k wrote a review Aug 2019,20,No air conditioning and lots of noise,PROS:  The hotel and grounds are lovely. The staff of the restaurant and restaurant was extremely good. Unfortunately those positives end there.    CONS:  Where do I start? There were two major issues with this property.    NOISE:  Until about 12:30am there is extremely loud banging that goes on from the music they play downstairs. This music wasn‚Äôt that much of a bother to me because I stay up until late and it happens at other properties. If you are a light sleeper DO NOT stay here!    HOT ROOMS:  Marrakesh tends to be pretty warm in the summer. The first room I had 1303 was extremely hot. They sent in engineering which brought the temperature to 25C (about 78/79F). I stayed the night and while touring I asked my tour manager to call and ask them if the issue was solved. They said it was and it was not the case when coming back.    DO NOT DISTURB:  I placed the DND sign on the door as I usually do and care back from my all day tour to discover that the sign was removed my bed was made and they folded up my dirty underwear and left it on top of the sheets. I was a little upset they handled my dirty underwear I left. It was pretty bad.    At approximately 6pm on day 2 I asked if the AC would be fixed and it just couldn‚Äôt. I asked to speak with the GM who came and spoke with me apologized and then we decided it was best to move rooms. I packed my luggage and was hoping for a good room when I got back.    We arrived back at about 11:30PM. I went to my new room 1137 which was much smaller but totally OK by me. The air conditioning wouldn‚Äôt cool here either which I thought was a terrible coincidence. I called them a few times and they said they would send a fan which I was fine with. 30 minutes later no fan. I called downstairs again and they wouldn‚Äôt answer the phone.    I again asked to speak with the manager on duty who came to my room with an engineer at my request. The manager stated there was a problem and they would not be able to resolve it. It was 3am and I was hoping to sleep at least 3 hours before my wake up call. To his credit he apologized and said the GM should have checked the new room would not have an AC issue. We had to use Google translator as he only spoke French (possibly Arabic too).    If you don‚Äôt mind a room that cools down to 78F (25C) or really loud noise then this will not be an issue for you!    The staff was mixed up all over the place. The service ranged from excellent to poor. The staff at the dining room was great and did an excellent job but the rest of the staff fell short including the GM who dropped the ball with fixing this issue.    The other rooms in my group cooled fine and were able to work but there are many that will only cool to a certain point and blow air that is only slightly above room temperature.    After all the different Movenpicks I have stayed at including the recent Nile River Cruise on Movenpick‚Äôs Royal Lotus this is likely the last one I‚Äôll voluntarily stay at.    With all this said I truly try to avoid poor reviews (look at my history). I wanted this to actually work out and felt that after speaking to the GM it should have worked out. He should have checked to make sure the second room would cool down.    There was also a medium length black hair in the soap and shampoo area. That doesn‚Äôt gross me out as much as other people but since I‚Äôm criticizing them it‚Äôs something that others would be bothered by.    I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone unless you feel like suffering and not sleeping for a couple of days!    Despite their affordable rates and pretty atmosphere - DO NOT STAY here or you will not be looked after and terribly uncomfortable if you like air conditioning.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Beverly Hills, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,stormingnorman wrote a review Aug 2019,20,Disappointing experience,I am staying here on business. the hotel on first sight looks nice enough with separate buildings and a pseudo Moroccan architectural design. The interior is a strange mixture of oversized furniture and bizarre decor. There is a large and smaller swimming pool with bars attached the problem is the larger pool is dominated by a sound system that plays continuous loud music throughout the day and night! It can be heard from 200 metres away and means one can't have the window open without the incessant noise ruining one's time off. It seems bizarre such a hotel that appeals to everyone has this policy more suited to a 20-30 something age group. I'm only glad I'm not paying to stay here.  Other than that things are okay the staff are nice but it took an inordinate amount of time to change rooms with numerous calls and finally a visit to reception along with two unsuitable alternatives being offered. A rather disappointing and frustrating experience as a whole I wouldn't stay at a Movenpick hotel again based on this experience.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stormingnorman11

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Aoife wrote a review Aug 2019,30,"5 star setting, 2 star service",I‚Äôm writing this review halfway through my current stay that itself speaks to something. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the setting is beautiful and our room is well kempt. But appearance does not make a hotel 5 stars. The place is teaming with staff you‚Äôll never see more employees in one space but the service is beyond slow and on several occasions already they have attempted to overcharge for drinks etc. The hotel also advertises several restaurants that do not in fact exist. As I‚Äôm writing this I‚Äôm sitting in my hotel bedroom nursing an all day bout of food poisoning which I am positive I got from here as it is the only place I‚Äôd eaten in the 40hrs before the illness started. Worst of all for me the brand prides itself on ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù. This is the most unsustainable establishment I‚Äôve ever stayed at worldwide. All drinks are served with two plastic straws for decoration all poolside cups are served in plastic cups with plastic lids all glass bottle beers are served with plastic cups alongside them all pizzas are served in single use boxes and not once have I seen a metal spoon all plastic. A sign in the bathrooms states ‚Äúin order to save water hang your towel on a rail if you want to reuse it and place on floor if you want fresh towels‚Äù. Our towels have been changed every single day despite hanging them neatly daily. Also this evening (rooms are cleaned in the am) a cleaner entered our room while myself and my partner were both nude post shower no knock proceeded to walk into the bathroom not appearing to do anything walked out and then repeated these actions a second time!! Bizarre. Also I‚Äôve never known a hotel to hold such a huge deposit upon check in 70% of our weeks stay. Not just card on file full amount taken. This better be returned promptly upon check out.

Why ?    Housekeeping is of good standard and our suite was always cleaned to a high standard...    There is not much to do around the area of the hotel  handful of restaurants a basic shopping mall and a small shop across the road with high prices .

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,MasudQ wrote a review Jul 2019,10,Avoid! Not worth the cost!,I don't enjoy writing negative reviews but our stay here was way below the standards of a 5* hotel.    On arrival the staff at the hotel looked utterly miserable and helping us with our luggage seemed as extra work to them. One of the bellboys dropped a few of our bags upto the room spilling some contents and didn't even bother to apologise let alone help pick the contents up.    The rooms were fairly well equipped however one of our rooms had a broken toilet seat broken locks & a crib bed rather than a proper bed. We promptly complained to the manager who arrogantly refused to do anything about this. He also refused to give us his name. We spoke to our booking agent and they reported that the manager had offered us a different room which was an obvious lie as we would have gladly accepted the offer. We found out that his name was NOUR from the staff.    Nothing improved during our stay and we did not want to waste our holiday arguing with the staff. On a plus note the breakfast was brilliant and on site pool & spa did not disappoint.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Lierbag Derdnik wrote a review Jul 2019,20,Beautiful Hotel with Subpar Service,Currently visiting the beautiful country of Morocco with my girlfriend attempting to enjoy our first time in Africa and we have been repeatedly served with mediocre service from every staff member here. From the time we checked in we have been rushed from grabbing a drink at dinner to laying out ordering food at the pool. I was told today that I needed to hurry up and pay for a check in order for the attendant to ‚Äúwatch a match.‚Äù We obliged and attempted to pay with a debit card the card declined and we were told ‚Äúdo you have another card?‚Äù in a very accusatory tone. We asked whether or not it may have been the machine and when he ran the SAME card with a NEW machine TRANSACTION APPROVED.    After we paid we wanted to continue to enjoy our day by the pool (still here) and not once have we been checked on or asked whether or not we wanted to purchase something else.    . . . . . . still waiting,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oakland, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabekindred
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Mia S wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Very poor service,I am currently staying at this hotel my boyfriend and I have had both drinks at the bar and lunch at the pool. Both times the service has been below average. We are constantly being rushed and quickly asked to pay right after receiving our food. Today at the pool our server asked us if we could please quickly pay so he could go watch a soccer match. Then when trying to pay the card machine would not work and he insisted that there was a problem with my card. I asked him to run my card again and the machine worked. We are trying to have a relaxing holiday and this has made it somewhat unpleasant.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Lucy wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Mixed experience - CHECK YOUR BILL!,We got a great deal on secret escapes - ¬£300 for 3 nights which we thought was good for a supposed 5 star. The hotel has an impressive reception and lobby area rooms are fairly standard but the bathrooms are nice. Our room was advertised as ‚Äògarden view‚Äô but overlooked a couple of trees and the bin area. Breakfast was good lots of choice and the lady serving the omelettes was lovely however every morning the omelettes were quite undercooked with a fair amount of raw egg in the middle. The location isn‚Äôt great for the M√©dina - about a 30 minute + walk. Pool area good plenty of sunloungers and the majority of the life guards were very attentive in getting towels and umbrellas when needed. The night prior to our departure we asked if there was anywhere we could store our bags and freshen up - check-out is quite early at 10am and our flight wasn‚Äôt until 6pm. The man on reception kindly offered us a complimentary late check out until 1:30pm which was a huge help.    On the first night a chilli con carne (185dh) was added to our bill instead of the Mac n cheese (50dh) we had actually had - hmm. This was quickly rectified when mentioned.    Our main issue came on check-out when as many other customers have mentioned we found that random items had been added to our bill. We had lunch at the pool on our second day - 2 cheeseburgers and 2 beers. A salad had also been added to our bill which was on a separate check and had been ordered half an hour prior to us ordering our lunch. An obvious mistake which we asked them to remove - after a little to-ing and fro-ing (having to ring the poolside cafe etc) the receptionist explained this was their mistake and removed it from the bill. We paid and went to sit on a nearby sofa to decide what to do for the next few hours until our flight. The receptionist then approached us again with the supposed check for the salad which bore our room number surname spelt incorrectly and a forgery of my signature. We were outraged and explained someone had clearly fraudulently attempted to copy our details - we suspect it may have been a member of staff who hadn‚Äôt obtained a signature from another guest who had actually had the salad but obviously this is just speculation. The receptionist shrugged in a very accusatory manner - I asked to speak to the manager and he disappeared for 40 minutes. I went to the desk to see where he had gotten to as we wanted to go and get some lunch (it was now 2:30pm) - the man behind the desk pointed behind me and I turned to see the receptionist jump behind a pillar and out of sight?!? Extremely bizarre behaviour. I confronted him and he just said ‚Äòwhat? What?‚Äô and disappeared again. Eventually the ‚Äòmanager‚Äô (coincidentally the same person who had served us at the pool the day prior) came and apologised and agreed it was a very concerning issue that they would look in to.    The levels of customer service at the hotel unfortunately don‚Äôt constitute a 5 star and the hotel in general needs a bit of a facelift to bring it up to standard - missing pool tiles stained and broken sun loungers broken toilet flushes etc. Unfortunately issues with the bill and dishonesty seem to be a recurring theme at the movenpick and until they sort this out we won‚Äôt be returning.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucymercer7

Lifts and pool area have a lot of wear and tear mold broken tiles and carpet and look more up to 2* standard.  Morning buffet is also very basic minimal selection of food. The hotel is terrible value for money. For the price they charge you can be in real 5* somewhere in Dubai or in amazing All Inclusive in the best resorts in Egypt.

Also guest services staff is not attentive or responsive. We had to call and go to the desk 3 times for a simple request to be handled. Others in our group had similar issues.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Ann F wrote a review Jun 2019,20,Mediocre Movenpick Mansour Marrakesh !,My husband Peter and I stayed at the Movenpick Mansour Eddahbi Marrakesh from the afternoon of the 9th June until the morning of the 11th June 2019 . We were travelling as members of an Insight Vacations Group Tour visiting Morocco. Our time at this hotel in Marrakesh and subsequent enjoyment of our tour was ruined by the incompetence irresponsibility and totally unprofessional attitude of the management and staff of this hotel . Not only did the porters fail to deliver my husband‚Äôs suitcase to our room after our arrival  the management there denied receiving it and blamed the company we were travelling with for its disappearance . Mr. Badr who was in charge of porterage  was most unhelpful  and hours after the suitcase went missing  having been given a full description of the case  it‚Äôs colour size and written labelling  was unable to recall what it looked like . The manageress a M. Layla  was impassive and equally reluctant to take any responsibility for retrieving the suitcase . She too denied all knowledge of its existence and blamed our tour director and driver for its disappearance . Our tour director gave us full support in trying to find my husband‚Äôs case by reminding the two members of staff mentioned above of their duty to guests in maintaining the reputation of a five star hotel . He was met with hostility and unwillingness to take the loss seriously . I asked them to search rooms to find the case as it was urgent to retrieve my husband‚Äôs medication  and they agreed to look in a few rooms that night  My husband and I accompanied Badr and Layla on a brief search of just three empty rooms late that night to no avail . My husband was in the clothes he had worn all day  he was not offered even a toothbrush that night .The following day he missed the excursions  spent six hours waiting in reception to hear the results of an examination of CCTV footage  and then he was given no direct evidence that the suitcase had been stolen  just hints that it had not been received or not shown by the cameras . He was not shown any of the CCTV footage . The hotel staff strenuously denied all responsibility or knowledge of my husband‚Äôs suitcase . It was presumed stolen . We were left  late afternoon  with no choice but to shop for a long list of replacement medication ( in school French ) .A kind Morocco representative of the INSIGHT tour company  a M. Najib  accompanied us to the pharmacy and then to the door of a local shopping mall . We were left to find replacement clothing  underwear  socks swimwear etc trying to communicate in a mixture of French Arabic and English to try to find the correct size ...my husband is not of average build ...We were exhausted  hungry and fairly stressed by this time . There was no offer of any sort of compensation or comfort by the hotel management . In addition earlier that day staff on reception had given me an additional key card with the wrong room number written on it  so I was unable to get into the room ! Our tour director Simon very wisely insisted on staff searching that room too but to no avail . We had to leave next day with our group for Casablanca  without my husband‚Äôs luggage  and with his newly purchased worldly possessions packed into a temporary carrier bag!  We received not one kind word from the staff who acted as if nothing had happened .Peter had to leave Movenpick  Marrakesh like a refugee  clutching a carrier bag . As you can imagine the trust we all felt as a group  in the ability of hotel staff in Morocco generally to safeguard our luggage  changed as a result of this unacceptable attitude to being almost non existent .We lost faith in porters and management .  We travelled on to Casablanca where my husband and I  in our late sixties were forced to race on foot across chaotic roads to the Medina where we bartered in sign language and Franglais for a replacement suitcase . There followed a search for a stall to purchase replacement chargers and cables for the phone and camera . Thank god we always pack money  passports  and phones in our hand luggage . We made it back to our coach in record time clutching our purchases .but no time to enjoy browsing for souvenirs or admiring the architecture . Our free time disappeared as we tried to replace Peter‚Äôs basic possessions . It was a nightmare .  We left North Africa for Spain mourning the loss of his favourite and unreplacable white linen jacket his favourite silver hip flask  and all his treasured possessions .  Five days after arriving at the dreaded Movenpick Marrakesh  we were in Tangier when word came indirectly that Peter‚Äôs suitcase had been found in an empty room on the same floor  by a new guest arriving that day . Not a word of apology and no offer by Movenpick to express -courier the suitcase to us before we left North Africa for Spain . A whole week after the suitcase was reported missing it finally joined us in Grenada . Although we were highly relieved  and somewhat amazed to receive it with contents intact  the unnecessary hassle  totally unnecessary expenditure on replacement equipment and clothing  and having to purchase additional baggage allowance for our return flight really adversely affected our holiday . ... but above all the anxiety and stress we felt was made so much worse by the totally rude indifference to our plight shown by this sadly mediocre hotel .    .,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Holmfirth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/755annf
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Zippywrx wrote a review Jun 2019,20,Awful Service,Stayed here the weekend of the 7-06-19 for 3 nights.  I‚Äôll list the things as I seen them.    Check in: Basically very poor levels of service the 2 x people on reception didn‚Äôt understand English yes I know I‚Äôm in a foreign country but I have never had an issue in any other country in 5 star hotels. We eventually got told at 10:00 am no room was available till at least 14:00 we had no problem with that but at 14:00 was told still no room what seemed to be a senior staff member who could actually understand English then got involved and got us our room. The first experience of a couldn‚Äôt care less attitude.  They then gave us a cheap photo copy piece of paper which was meant to be a map and drew 2 circles 1 which I believe was reception and the other was where our room was.  No explanation or offer to take our bags they have a little bell they use nothing happens when they jingle it quite funny really and they just leave you standing in reception we found our own room which is a fair distance from reception. 2nd couldn‚Äôt care less attitude.    The room: nice clean and tidybed was comfy bathroom was nice.    Pool area: nice beds and most of the pool guys where nice and helpful BUT they do not ask you if you want anything at all you have to find one and try and get his attention when they walk past.  The guys in the red shirts where very good to be fair sorting umbrellas and towels out and where very polite so thumbs up to them the rest of the staff could learn from them how to treat guests.    Restaurant: Tried calling from my room several times down to Reception and no answer again great service !! went to reception who then sent us to the concierge desk and he looked at us like why are you bothering me other reviewers have stated how wonderful these guys where but I‚Äôm sorry they where aloof and not very helpful at all.  3rd couldn‚Äôt care less attitude.  Eventually he told us that he couldn‚Äôt book us a seat in the restaurant as nobody was answering the internal phone ( this I knew about from my experience from my room)he then told us they don‚Äôt have a central booking system ( What ?) and they would leave a message and put a note in our room to let us know if the reservation was made guess what ? no message was sent and we walked into the virtually empty restaurant no more than 10 metres from reception and got a table at 7:30pm by ourselves with no input from reception or the concierge who had clearly lied to us at 10:00am as they had no booking request from our room number from the concierge.    We ordered 2 x Lamb tagines and my partners one had 3 x large bone chunks in it with no meat we called the waiter over who agreed that there wasn‚Äôt any meat in the dish and he would get another !! Why did the chef in a 5 star hotel release this as a meal when it was a bowl of bones ?  4th could care less attitude.    15 minutes later the replacement arrived but by that time dinner for 2 had become dinner for one at a time again poor service.    The waiter did apologise but the girls who show you to your table etc who seemed to be playing at being restaurant managers paid no attention. 5th couldn‚Äôt have cared less attitude.    Breakfast: Very good selection and choice however having a single person making omelettes in a 500 room hotel isn‚Äôt good planning the toasters are also a waste of time as they take far too long to warm not toast your bread.    Hotel Bar: Drank in here 2 x nights of our stay BUT they had NO Vodka Brandy or Coke Zero so a 5 star hotel over a weekend period didn‚Äôt have what I would deem to be basic requirements for any bar !! All I can say is wow.  They where also playing Christmas songs in June on the Saturday night ( very strange ) but once again a couldn‚Äôt care less attitude was evident from the staff.    Check out: Not as easy as you would imagine they take ¬£168 from your account on arrival as a guarantee for extras etc on check out they presented us with a bill for ¬£186 I told them I would pay ¬£18 difference between the 2 x amounts they tried to tell me the original ¬£168 was only a guarantee when I could see it had left my account 3 days earlier!!! I shall have to wait till the banking system catches up and find out if the ¬£186 also came out of my account.    To summarise:    I have been as honest as I can be with my review of the hotel and I‚Äôm the first to compliment good service but I will also take the time to write an honest review of hotels we stay in.    Nice enough hotel in a reasonable area of Marrakesh but for me it‚Äôs not a 5 star hotel as too many things are not up to scratch.    It seems they have adopted an attitude or IT WILL DO which isn‚Äôt good enough in 2019. It could be so much better if the staff where trained correctly in customer service reading other reviews there is a pattern here all mentioning the poor service yet clearly it isn‚Äôt being addressed.    Managers walk around the hotel regularly but not one makes eye contact with you or makes any effort to say hello etc this maybe a cultural thing in Morocco but having stayed in many hotels around the world I have never experienced this anywhere else where most managers make an effort to say hello and introduce themselves.    We spoke to several guests who also said very similar things to us and ALL mentioned poor service and we where recommend the Mamounia hotel if we wanted proper 5 star treatment and service if we ever return to Marrakesh.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zippywrx

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Love_Travels_2015 wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Nice,This hotel was nice and very modern. I stayed in the King suite with my hubby and baby and must say enjoyed it.    The bathroom was nice and big with his and hers sink. The balcony was lovely to sit out and chill.    There was an issue with the kettle not working. This was a nightmare as I couldn't make up my babies bottles. The staff were very reluctant to give a new kettle until right at the end when they realised after 6 attempts the one we had was broken!    Nevertheless. Despite this everything else was pleasant.    The suites are a bit out from the other rooms but it is quiet and no one disturbing you.    The strange thing about the suite is not having many plug sockets. They were either used for the kettles etc or on the skirting board which meant my UK adapter couldn't fit through...    The breakfast was good. But the outdoor pool I found overcrowded and not as good as the savoy.    The entrance is very dark gloomy but grand looking. However the smell of saffron or whatever it was.. was so OVERPOWERING! Made me and my baby nauseous. Its too strong especially if you are waiting in the long que to check in or out.    It isn't as convenient like the savoy with the mall right next door or being able to walk out to the restaurants but for relaxation this hotel is nice to end your holiday in morroco.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love_Travels_2015

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Pamela M wrote a review May 2019,50,Excellent hotel!,As soon as we walked into this hotel with its gorgeous lobby we felt great about choosing to stay here! The hotel lobby is stunning and the rest of the property pool etc. are equally grand. We were also very satisfied with our room with its black marble bathroom and luxe linens. The staff was very helpful providing change for our larger denominated bills. The breakfast buffet is incredible - extensive and delicious. We ate dinner at 54 Steak. The ribeye was cooked to perfection. Service was superb. We also ate at Dada's Diner which was a nice option for quick casual meal.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,MrsandMrH wrote a review May 2019,30,Definitely not a five star hotel,We are on day 3 of a four night stay and would like to share our feedback to assist anyone else considering this hotel.    We arrived on Saturday after a long journey and were not given the rooms we had booked. My daughter and I are sharing a double bed and our friends are in tiny single beds next door. We were not provided with any refreshments on Check in (despite previous reviewers receiving this service)    After checking in we were guided to our basic room in a worn out building with no mini bar no iron no hairdryer and no WiFi !    The tea and coffee in the room is not replaced once you have used the two sachets provided and there is no turn down service in the evening.    Breakfast is very basic and on our second day we were not even offered any drinks from the lady serving in the indoor area. This service was replicated during lunch at the pool bar when we waited 20 minutes for our drinks and then had to poor our own wine.    There are plenty of staff around the pool during the day doing nothing. They told us we couldn't have an umberella moved down to the smaller pool as it was too difficult so we moved to the larger pool and were given an umberella which collapsed. When I advised a member of staff that it was dangerous he put it down and then walked off. It is nearly 100 degrees today and there are not enough umberellas the pool area is cramped and there is no drinks service offered.    We have stayed in five star accommodation in Marrakech before and all these services are a given.    The concierge at the entrance to the hotel and one guy in the breakfast room all deserve a thank you for raising the bar.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Merseyside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsandMrH

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,buttunz1977 wrote a review May 2019,30,Okay,My recent stay here was ok but not as great as I thought it would be. On arrival the lobby is grand with huge sliding doors and we received snacks while we were being checked in. Lovely! However after the walk past the stunning pool area on the way to my room my expectations took a hit. The elevator was rockery and frankly very tired with faded and patchy carpet. The room was just ok with no iron in the room (had to call the front desk for that) and a shaky toilet. When I turned on the air conditioning in the room it was so noisy.    On the positive side the breakfast is good with many choices and the restaurant by the pool has excellent food. The pizza and burgers were delicious and the bunnies hopping around were a fun eclectic touch. In addition the staff is very helpful.    The location is convenient but I am not sure I would stay here again unless they upgraded the rooms.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Bridgetown, Barbados",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buttunz1977

Great buffet breakfast includes freshly made Moroccan pancakes and mint tea ceremony .  ample space in pool area it can get crowded.

No real effort was made for the fact it‚Äôs his birthday. Which is fine but we have stayed in lots of five star hotels that have made a big effort out of no real special birthdays.  The staff are lovely. Work so hard and really nice and caring especially the waiters in the evening. They recommended such nice food and wine for us which we appreciated over just telling us to get stuff for the sake of it.  We only got to spend one full day at the hotel as we did an amazing private tour on one of the days recommended by the hotel he was honestly such a good tour guide made our trip to be honest. On this one day we  obviously wanted to sit by the pool. The sun beds are limited  not the fault of the staff and they try to move reserved towels for people who have left them for ages and not returned but we waited for a long time for this to happen we were sat on the grass !! (I‚Äôm sorry but in a real five star hotel that isn‚Äôt a thing) and my sister suffers badly from hayfever. Which obviously was made worse by this. We eventually found our self a bed and they brought another over which was nice but we watched as those who just turned up tipped them to get beds which worked.. we all pay the same for the hotel and I just think that‚Äôs a bit unfair.  The rooms are good nothing special but the beds are very comfy and the bathrooms are nice and the over all cleanliness is 5 star.  Overall really nice hotel but not quite five star.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rudiih
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Globetrotter7707 wrote a review May 2019,40,Awesome place to stay with the most amazing staff and breakfast!!!,I accompanied my husband on a business trip as the company he represents also organizes a spouse program with visits and activities which allows to discover the place pretty well. When we first arrived at the hotel we were amazed to see the staff outside greeting us as we got off the bus. We were even more amazed once we entered the hotel which is not only beautiful but had the most sumptuous flower arrangements all over!! We were of course greeted with typical tea and sweets which you tend to have about 10 times a day in Morocco as it is DELICIOUS!!! FYI if you wish to purchase their tea do so in the Souq or at the mall don‚Äôt wait for the airport you won‚Äôt find the kind they serve in the city.  We were escorted to our rooms in one of the blocks closer to the pool so we got a nice walk and were able to see much of the hotel. Our room was on the top floor of our block and we had a very nice view and also appreciate the call to prayer sounds early in the morning the bathroom was clean and the bed were extremely comfortable. The next day we were greeted by the most amazing breakfast there was something for everyone! A lot of typical Moroccan things and also the typical continental breakfast choices. We attended the opening ceremony at the convention center which is connected to the hotel which is why the company chose Movenpick. In all we had an awesome stay the rooms were very good and the entire stay was very pleasant. We didn‚Äôt get to go to the pool but it was very tempting as during the day temperatures vary from 10 C to 25 C around the time of year we went. I strongly recommended!!!,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globetrotter7707
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,SunriseSki wrote a review Apr 2019,40,"Great, big, well run hotel",After travelling through Morocco mountains desert and all we chose this place for a few days of relaxation before heading back home. Very good choice it was. The hotel already stuns you with one of the nicest and impressive lobbies ever.You can immediately feel it is nicely run. It is a big establishment (seven buildings?). We got rooms in one of the farther ones which felt more like a serviced apartment so spacious it was. Everything seems quite new and very well taken care of (cleanliness landscaping etc.). The pool area is nice and on nice days the number of sunbeds seems limited. Might need to go early. The pool bar is great has some dishes for a quick lunch break. The gym and SPA are also well equipped and the staff very helpful. The breakfast area somehow feels like cafeteria style one place too big too crowded too loud. Selection is good may be there could be more diverse healthy options (fruit). We also tried the two restaurants (one is actually more like a bar) in the lobby-building for dinner. Mixed assessment. While they are very nicely decorated and cool the staff is fast and nice the selection is interesting on the other side the quality of the food is not up to par especially the meats. Also being where they are they tend to be overpriced but this is to be expected. Last point there is good WiFi and accessible from everywhere. In any case overall we enjoyed our stay and would certainly come back when in Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,Singapore,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunriseSki

Hotel amenities are great - good breakfast beautiful pool lovely staff. Why is there always a ‚Äúbut‚Äù? Yesterday after my room was cleaned I had no hand-towel or bottled water. Having only been here for one night so far I asked at reception if water was supposed to be replenished daily. Yes was the answer. Also my kettle didn‚Äôt work. I had to ask at reception 3 times before I received a working kettle a hand-towel and a bottle of water. Today my room has been serviced and at 3.50 pm I have absolutely no towels at all and my used coffee cups have not been cleaned. Maybe it is retribution for asking 3 times yesterday! I have already dried my hands on a bathrobe and have phoned guest services to request towels but so far no luck. I am here for another 4 nights. By then I may have used all of the pool towels!    For those who need to know this hotel is situated about a 20-30 min walk from the centre of town (main square).

Service was attentive and the staff would walk with you to show you where to go. The location is on a main road which was pleasant to walk on and see the train station and royal theatre.

The life guard Anas is an absolute treasure and as always looked after all the guests superbly. Anas remembered us by name after our last visit in July and the time before that in September 2017. We were also very pleased to see that Jihane the pool waiter was still working at the hotel. She is by fair the most attentive member of the team there. She is always watching and checking that the guests have everything they need and when delivering food she lays it all out neatly to ensure the guest has the best experience.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,rasmusb344 wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Worst ‚Äú5 star‚Äù hotel i have ever stayed at. Service and food quality is of the lowest possible.,I seldom do reviews - but after spending 5000 eur on this nightmare it deserved one.  lets start with the positive - IF you buy a 600 eur per night suite - rooms are relatively large / clean - and in generel all people are friendly and breakfast is decent.  But - Forget any pictures you see on their website - was probably taken in 1999.  after 2 hour wait in reception upon arrival as rooms were not finished on check in time - without any offer fro water or any other gesture - we recieved one room out of the 2- well after asking 5 times in reception whats going on as no one comes to you to assist.  In insane amount of groups and package tours are slamming check in so you can get an extreme wait in generel at reception area.  After 4 calls to reception and another 15 hour wait from the one room we got - our second room was ready on a different floor than our children despite having asked and advised.  They forgot to put the extra bed - and we tried to contact reception an unlimited times per phone - but NO ONE pick up the phone... so 5 min walk back to reception as hotel is huge and ask whats going on... they will send someone they say... no one comes ...  i go back and ask for a manager... they refuse and say not available... after preassure mr. ‚Äúmanager‚Äù comes out and we sit. i explain in details and he says no problem he will talk to all and fix all - and i say so how do i contact you if it doesnt happen - he says it will all improve so dont worry... 5 days trying to reach ‚Äúconcierge‚Äù to book a transport or an excursion and never once called me back...  ps. manager never once contacted me after our meeting to check on things...despite he knew it was an extremely bad sotuation... 5 STAR service ??? - you cant even order room service at times as again NO ONE pick up the phone..  i can keep on explaining in details - but let me put bullet points:  - ‚Äúconciergeservice‚Äù 2 people to 500 rooms - you do the math.. if you ask to help with reservation - they call the place and pass you the phone so you can make you own reservations :-)))  - childrens pool missing half the tiles  - food at pool is probably worst hotel food i have seen ever.. one home made printed menu in french so table can pass it around as they dont have more print out from the black and printer :-)... mcdonalds would be better option for food quality..  - same goes for the ‚Äúelegant spanish inspired‚Äù restaurant...ZERO taste... its extreme how its possible to cook that bad.. it almost takes talent to be able to have a pizza taste like air :-)  - view from SUITE was to the garbage area and junkyard  - sunbeds and some common areas are super run down and not maintained...  All in all - if you think you are going to a 5 star hotel with great service - think again... expect nice people - smiling - a decent breakfast and large groups of company guests and an abundance of screaming kids at the ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù pool ... and thats about it...  I have never spent 5000 eur on a more deceptional way.  An amazing private riad would be better option..

The taxis have nothing to do with the Hotel so the latter not to blame if you get caught out. Stayed with 2 adults 2 kids in a small suite perfect for our needs. Staff welcoming and super friendly big thanks to housekeeping team.    Breakfast a bit chaotic from 9 to 10 better before and after. Waiters under pressure to keep up supply of knives and forks and napkins. Good breakfast selection not the best we have seen in a 5 star but good all the same thumbs up to the omelette  and traditional Moroccan pancake teams.    Other on site food options a bit limited really. Pool side by day ‚Äì best to eat in the restaurant at the back of the pool sun bed service hit and miss around lunch time not staff fault think they are actually slightly understaffed at busy times. Super helpful and friendly pool team all the same also the outdoor pool is heated just the ticket for the April break.    Night time its best to go out. They have two restaurants one is ok and makes a good effort very welcoming team the other ‚Äì the main bar area - has an interesting menu but two or three times this space was out of bounds to hotel guests at night due to private events.    They are short a space for hotel guests to have a drink at the bar when this happens they do offer an outside terrace but not conducive to staying put there on a cooll evening. There is a self service spot as well but we think that was for specific groups. Also wine and spirits extremely expensive on the Marrakech scale.    These are only minor quibbles this is a super spot for kids and has the best kids club we have ever come across the unsung hero‚Äôs of this Hotel to be honest. We will definitely return to this spot next year.

Things to be aware of taxi drivers over charge & drop you off to waiting guides. Be careful when taking photos or you will have to pay. There is constant pressure to give... The Medinas & Souks are exciting a great experience they may hassle you but they have a great sense of humour and mimic you.. Essaouira is beautiful... a must to visit. Argan oil products are good but shop around as prices vary. Seeing goats up trees is jaw dropping. The food is good... coffee excellent & Moroccan bread & honey M‚Äôsmen is yummy.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Muzammil_MM wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Beautiful Property,Stayed here for 3 nights and booked 2 classic rooms. One of the rooms got up graded to a junior suite. Anyhow we loved both the room and the suite. The only setback was these rooms are far apart as ours was in front of the main pool whilst our children were in the suite block at the end of the property.    Breakfast and dinner were both great. Good food with loads of choices. The location is also good as you can easily walk to Menara Mall in 15 minutes being maximum.    It is a huge property as there‚Äôs a convention centre next to this hotel. Staff are great too!

Dined in on two occasions which is unusual for my wife and I as we usually dine at venues outside our accommodation. The tapas at Marcelona was good though the big screen sport is a bit loud. Buffet breakfast in the Saray Restaurant was probably the best we experienced in Morocco. And Ayoub always got us good coffees to start the day.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Michelle P wrote a review Mar 2019,20,Disappointing stay,We were so excited to stay at the Movenpick before we left Marrakech. I little bit of lux & relaxation from a the medina before flew back. What a disappointment we had. The 1st floor grounds lobby artwork & general design was beautiful but the service was atrocious. When you enter to check in the staff are not friendly or welcoming. They have a look on their face like you are bothering them. Minimal explanation of the grounds but you are given a half-ass map of the hotel which was barely helpful.  We attempted to go to the Marcelona restaurant which was supposed to have Spanish influenced food. Well don't count on it because they changed their menu & it was Moroccan than Spanish. The hostess did not crack a smile & she told us their was no table for 2 but pointed to the bar next door & said we could sit there & order the same food. A white man behind us asked for a table too she told him the same thing but with a smile & personally walked him to the bar next door. I started to notice this trend of inconsistent treatment throughout my stay here & I honestly think they are racist or prejudice against asians -and I'm only half!  Dinner at the restaurants could have been better. I had paella one night- looked & tasted like it came from a box. Other tapas were so mediocre I can't even recall what I ate.  To sum up the good things: breakfast buffet & only those servers the housekeeping toiletries & the aesthetics of the hotel are notable.    Don't consider this a 5 star hotel at all. They are in desperate need of hospitality service training. And I don't want the General Manager Thomas Gregory to send me a copy & paste apology & how they are going to take note of improving. He's clearly not doing his job in making improvements since they haven't improved.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Redondo Beach, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/940michellep
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Michael B wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Definitely five star,The Movenpick Hotel in Marrakech is a wonderful place. The cavernous and labyrinthine lobby is simply a delightful place in which to get lost and to explore. It really is a worthwhile maze with lots of art work and beautiful and stylistic furniture to experience; and there is always a helpful employee to set you on the correct path should you be in a hurry to find your room one of its restaurants or a convenient exit.  Our room was spacious clean comfortable and well-appointed. Complimentary wifi and a bottle of water were appreciated. Breakfast provided a great array of foodstuff from which to choose and with two efficient egg chefs there was little time wasted waiting for your individually prepared omelette or eggs.

The main (heated) pool and bar are busy but the lower (unheated) pool with its bar/restaurant was a calmer spot. Breakfasts are very good we dined twice in Marcelona restaurant and food was good and reasonably priced. Our standard room was clean comfortable and well serviced. I agree Reception could be understaffed at times they do themselves no favours by allowing you to quote any old room number when getting food and drinks without checks - thus we found a spurious dinner on our bill which took time to sort out. But concierge were swift every day in retrieving our golf bags from storage. We were there during a busy conference in the Palais de Congres next door and their gala night look extremely well done (possibly by outside event management company ).

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,I love travelling wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Average 5 star hotel. Needs improvement in service level.,The hotel is huge with rooms spread in many buildings. Of course there is no covered pathway from reception or the restaurant to the buildings housing the rooms and this is a problem when it's raining.  Reception is very very small and very slow.  Very nice lobby and entrance.  Very nice pool area but probably small for the amount of people in the hotel.  Gym is not bad though a bit small for a holiday destination huge hotel.  The rooms are nicely sized. The bed is nice and comfy. Decor is nice as well. There is tea and coffee facilities but strangely enough only 1 mug.  Bathroom is nicely sized with a big shower. Some of the towels were soft and nice others looked older. Toiletries were refreshed every day.  I had a very tiny balcony but as i was ground floor there is no privacy at all. 1 of the chairs had pigeon poop on it throughout the stay.  The restaurant is nicely sized though very crowded for bfast on weekends. Breakfast is not bad. Selection of food at the pool bar is small and quality not wow. At dada's diner the selection is a bit better but again food not wow.  Overall this hotel is nothing wow but not a nightmare.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Island of Gozo, Malta",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neverdullmoment
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Belkina wrote a review Mar 2019,20,Ruined holiday,Such a shame i have to post this review as i was really looking forward to our stay at Movenpick in Marrakech. I loved the design of the hotel the ambience and trusting the great 5 star service and worldwide reputation i trusted this hotel to enjoy our time off. Booked the superior room for our short 3 day break.  We arrived very late at night to the 5* hotel to discover our bathroom and bathtub were full of ants dirty carpet full of stains and the phone completely not working (our building was very far from reception about good 5min walk through outdoor area). Don‚Äôt get me wrong the room was beautifully decorated i loved the design and it was exactly what we wanted however I expected it to be properly cleaned and prepared for the guests. We had to go a several times to explain that we are not happy with the room as this is not the condition to greet the guests. Obviously there was no one in charge who was able to help they just sent the cleaners to wash the ants with water that of course came back again.  Long story short in the morning we were waiting from 8am for our room to be changed. With a solution of downgrading to standard room which was very unfair as we specifically paid more for superior. Finally at 12 am we were asked to come to reception and check our new room. All this waiting going back and forth to find out that at 12.35 the room was still not prepared. To this point we were so frustrated and upset that we are wasting such precious time during our holiday that we left the hotel immediately and had to book somewhere else. Very unorganised management who doesn‚Äôt know how to please guests that are upset. Once again we were not there to get any sympathy or upgrade for free. We simply wanted to enjoy our holiday and have a pleasant stay. Unfortunately I won‚Äôt trust movenpick again and wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone choosing this hotel because if the problem occurs it is unlikely they will find a solution for you.

Especially during the breakfast even though that it was too many people they could still find room for our family. The heated pool was great! The rooms had rather good size loved the spacy bathroom. Comfy bed.    On a negative side - the rooms are really outdated. The carpeted floor was very-very dirty the carpets should be changed immediately. It seemed that even after room service the floors were not really cleaned there was still dirt on floors. We had to wear shoes all the time as otherwise the feet/socks would get dirty. It was nice to have the balcony but there was almost no view unfortunately. The elevators were a disgrace. The button lights were not working you could not understand on which floor you were stopping as the tabloo was not showing the numbers. Old small and dirty elevators.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Ani wrote a review Feb 2019,50,AMAZING,To think I had almost missed this gem of a hotel. Upon searching for hotels Movenpick had not come up due to being sold out for part of my stay but I liked the look of the hotel thus had chosen to atleast for the four days here and elsewhere for the remainder of my holiday and I was not disappointed.    Arrival - check in was quick and efficient our room was ready and the receptionist was very polite.  Rooms - very clean modern comfy and not dingy looking like a lot of the rooms in other hotels in Marrakech.  Bathroom - beautiful showers were powerful and didnt leak too much like other hotels  Breakfast - a lot of choice fresh paratha and omelettes. Left satisfied everyday.  Pool - Amazing jacuzzi and sauna available too  Wifi - Good but sometimes cut off but nothing heartbreaking  Location - Everything was close Menara mall was like max 10 minutes away selection of cafes 5 minutes away and the stop for the hop on hop off bus was like a 3 minute walk away. Perfect part of Marrakech.    I could honestly go on forever but can you believe we went to our new hotel and hated it in comparison to movenpick so came back and requested if they had any room available. They had many large parties residing at the same time which is why it was sold out online initially. Nadia had very kindly gone out of her way to find a room for us and we ended up just leaving our other hotel and coming here again. No regrets honestly thank you soooo much you saved our holiday.    Thank you to Hind also for helping us with the excursions which we thoroughly enjoyed - Chez Ali day tour and quad biking is a must.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,DLkkkhee wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Simply bowled over by this hotel,What an incredible start to our tour of Morocco.  It was a spectacular hotel with a lobby floor that stretched into a labyrinth of decorated enclaves and art displays.  I think the Feng Shui is good as it has a grand water feature in front and a spacious lobby to let the good vibes in.  High backed sofa chairs greet our tired jetlagged bodies_ we had flown for 18 hours and coached from Casablanca International airport upom touchdown.  The rooms were so cosy and the beds luxurious. All the toiletries were arghan oil-based..  Although we went down late for dinner to an almost empty buffet we did not mind as we were more tired than hungry. The morning buffet was ample and the omelette chef took the trouble to decorate the plate.  The pastries were excellent_ loved the authentic croissants. Fruits galore. so much to eat.  Stayed here 2 nights with our group tour.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Simona D wrote a review Feb 2019,30,Not to impressed,The hotel is beautiful.  The lobby is impressive. The rooms are big. The spa is not too impressive.  The service lack in some areas.  I was charged twice however I already paid and once I told them I paid they still charged me..  The kids club lacks of activity done outside the club. My girls 5 and 6 sears old found it too boring. However they offer free lunch for children.  The swimming pool area is very nice however even if heated the swimming pool in December was too cold.  The restaurant service is not the best. Extreme long wait even if only 2 tables were busy and the waitress were very moody.  We arrive to the hotel with a rented car and they couldn't find the car when we were leaving.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,clarkUtvik wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Sad experience - stay away !,This is not a five star hotel as you know it. It's nice arrival but I get a feeling that they don't have control. The room is big but dirty. There is a large dark oil stain on the carpet floor and everything is worn. The mini bar is empty and there is a kettle for coffee but there is only dry milk left in the box. The internet is incredibly slow and I had to give up checking the news. On several occasions the reception does not respond when you call. I guess my expectations were bigger but this is just sad and not worth five flat ears.    The surroundings are nice and the breakfast was relatively good selection. But there were so many people but it was included which is always nice. If you are staying here I advise you to curb your expectations.    The pizza at the pool was ok but the waitresses gave my wife and daughter drinks which were juice - even though it was in the menu that they were alcoholic drinks.

The breakfasts however were magnificent and they had a waiter preparing freshly squeezed orange juice for all. The pool was also lovely for a nice dip to refresh.

The programme announced for the New Year dinner was a complete lie and almost nothing was respected starting with the duration of the party and ending with the programme itself. All above was consideredd by the hotel staff as an error!!!! Several errors amounting to 1000 euros. All attempts to have qualified responses failed.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,hotsyd22 wrote a review Jan 2019,30,A really nice hotel... 20 years ago,The Movenpick Marrakech is a very large hotel with hundreds of rooms. When you arrive the lobby is quite impressive but depending on where your room is it is quite a walk to the room.    Our room itself was ok. The room had had some superficial renovation (new carpets wooden trims paint etc). The bathroom however was original. The (separate) toilet needed replacing. Indeed the porcelain had cracks and there was scale which had built up over the last 20 or so years which was not befitting the rest of the room.    The common areas of the hotel need more than some basic TLC. The lifts are slow damaged and unpredictable. They need to be replaced. The paint in the hallways was scuffed and needs re-painting. The breakfast restaurant too had seen better days. In the scheme of things these are not large investments to replace for a hotel of this size and standing.    Our room package included half-board. The dinner was really good and we enjoyed it. It included a 4-course al a carte Moroccan menu. The breakfast on the other hand was disappointing. Not only was the breakfast restaurant tired looking the food was mediocre and the scale of the resort (with just one buffet area) meant it was was like a school cafeteria. Long lines crowds and it was not an enjoyable experience.    The hotel gym was really good. It was busy (not the fault of the hotel) and had a good selection of equipment. The pool was large. We did not use the spa.    Had our room not included half board I would have been disappointed with the US$250/night we had paid especially considering the choices available in Marrakech. That said I would probably not choose to stay at the Movenpick again. Although the facilities are reasonable (if dated) the staff service was consistently poor and without the warmth unlike elsewhere we stayed in Morocco. Not only was the service cold it was inefficient. For a hotel of this size there was just one person processing guests checking out. We waited 15 minutes in a queue just to check out. Retrieving our luggage from the luggage room was also an ordeal. The concierge was never there when we were looking for him.    Indeed the service was so off that the staff didn't even wait around for tips when you would expect them too - tips must be so seldom that they don't even bother.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotsyd22

The facilities like spa and gym were excellent the decor is often beautiful rooms are basic but they‚Äôre neat and tidy - I can‚Äôt ask for more basically. Moreover the location is excellent: 5-10 mins drive to airport and a 5-10 mins walk to train station and shopping mall (which includes McDonalds and KFC for those who can‚Äôt hack the Moroccan cuisine)  My only problem is the service. Any complaints u have with the room don‚Äôt expect them to sort it out. I had a lizard crawl into my room. Called the staff 4 times after 2 hours nobody came and I had to sort it out myself.  If u get locked out from your room don‚Äôt expect them to help you. There is no urgency at that hotel and even more worrying there is no sense of responsibility. From experience my mother was locked out of her room due to a faulty key card provided to her by reception. When she called staff nobody came to help her and when she called the manager he eventually hung up on her because he can‚Äôt handle a complaint. This is embarrassing and a testament to the lack of care the staff have towards the guests.  That being said there were a few exceptions. There were some excellent individuals that were so brilliant they almost compensated for my experience. Namely Mohammed Amine who worked as an excellent and highly excuberant gym trainer. He was keen enthusiastic and urgent when it came to helping me in the spa/gym. He was a great lad to chat to and one of the silver linings of this hotel.

The advertisement for the dinner buffet suggested we call to make a reservation which my partner did and was told that a reservation was not required. So of course we showed up for dinner...and guess what we are told we need a reservation. My partner called back the reservation number we had called earlier in the day while in the hotel restaurant entrance and requested to speak with management. Anyway nothing was done to rectify the situation. The sad part was that we are in the tourism business here in Morocco and was planning to book our future clients here.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,alifiyan wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Beautiful hotel close to the old and new town,We are a group of 8 adults and 8 kids and stayed at this property during the X mas season this year. It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel with a great location and ambience.    We had asked for connecting rooms as we have small kids however we were given two separate rooms with a common lobby in the middle. This was acceptable but may not be the best with very small kids.    An important thing to note here is that the elevators are small and very scary and we would not recommend using them. The sensors on the doors do not work and the doors tend to bang they also open up sometimes thus we would suggest to avoid using the lifts in the main building.    The breakfast spread is very very nice. They have hot meals fresh juice and other juices a variety of teas and coffees and hot chocolate for the kids as well as a traditional corner serving Moroccan tea and pancakes. Fruits and curds are not to be missed. A variety of breads cornflakes dates cheese and a live counter for eggs. The staff are very hospitable and ensure you have a good fill.    Would also highly recommend the Morroccan hamam at the in house spa. They are clean and great but difficult to get in without a prior appointment. Amal at the spa counter is tremendously helpful. Please be aware that though entrances are separate for men and women - you will see men and women walking around inside freely in robes and using the steam room and common facilities which may be disconcerting for some.    Beware of the concierge who tries to book you in the Riad by lotus spa and our husbands had an awful experience there !

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Maggie K wrote a review Dec 2018,40,"Lovely Staff, Comfortable Beds, Nice Pools, Best Massage",It's not a 5* hotel in the true sense: Things are slightly run-down; there isn't turn-down service; it can take a long time to get a response when you call for anything from housekeeping to concierge. Breakfast is fine not amazing. Terrible coffee! Food in general isn't the best.    BUT    The great stuff:    1. The staff from the restaurants to the spa to the kids club are wonderful. SO kind so helpful. Special shoutouts to:  Khadija from Marcelona restaurant who is so sweet and even gave my daughter a free couscous and veggies dish (off-menu special) one night.  Touria Nheza and Basma from the kids' club. They made my children feel so welcome. They both loved going there. One night I was late coming back from the Medina with my daughter (rush hour traffic) and Touria stayed with my son for nearly an hour past regular closing time for the club.  Khalid from the lunch restaurant. Always smiling and thoughtful. The entire staff from manager to waiters were wonderful at the lunch restaurant.  All the hostesses at Marcelona. They're lovely and sweet.    I got one of the best massages of my LIFE here. At first I was a little disappointed but as soon as I spoke up and asked for special attention to my problem areas my therapist took all the time necessary to get out all the kinks.    I will say that the front-desk staff was the least friendly and helpful compared to everyone else. I'm not sure why but they do not have the same open vibe as the rest of the hotel.    My children loved it here and want to come back immediately. It's definitely a family hotel. I don't think couples would enjoy it as much but it's perfect for a family.,Date of stay: December 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678maggiek

The hotel is a place of calm from which you can venture forth to the total confusion of the Marrakesh Medina. The hotel has 5 restaurants but I only ate the breakfast at the hotel.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Shez03 wrote a review Dec 2018,20,"Beautiful hotel, Terrible service",I‚Äôm currently staying here & it‚Äôs a beautiful hotel. That‚Äôs where it ends.  The service is the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. I‚Äôve been here for 3 days so far. The problems have been...    Electricity goes off in the room on Xmas day takes over 2 hours for someone to change the fuse. I‚Äôve called 3 times & even went to reception. The 4th time I start getting agitated with reception & within minutes it‚Äôs gitten repaired.    Key cards are awful- it stopped working the room was too far from reception so I called them to send someone to let me in. I desperately needed to get in & stated urgency but waited over 45 minutes. After many calls & then a huge rant they sent someone. - again I had to resort to being agitated before someone sorts things out. Oh & the best part- I asked to speak to a manger to complain & because I was angry at being kept waited & explained that to him he hung up the phone on me mid sentence! Never experienced such unprofessional an.    I asked for my kids to be out on the same floor as me- nope- On another floor. Even after numerous emails to request same floor.    Needed extra blanket called a few times but no one came!  Had a gekko in the room. Asked someone to remove it- no one came.  Asked for water cups - not had any still waiting.    1st night I put a sign for room to get cleaned- guess what ... no one came to clean.  Kids room had ants in the bathroom. That was sorted & they were moved.    I‚Äôm Here with family for 5 nights & ive never experiencd such difficulties it‚Äôs extremly upsetting & not relaxing at all.    The pool staff wouldn‚Äôt allow us to move the sun beds but 30 mins later someone else asked & they did for them?!  There not many sunloungers in this hotel- especially considering the size of hotel.    I‚Äôll try find positives the rooms are lovely- but beds actually are terrible- dip in the middle however  The best thing about the room is the shower. The best I‚Äôve ever experienced in a hotel.  Reception area is lovely but sorry to say this but the staff are not well trained & don‚Äôt know how to deal with any issues.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel to anyone. Stay elsewhere. There are others on this stretch that look just as nice- I doubt service there could be any worse,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stockport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shez03

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Robert C wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Perhaps the best hotel in Marrakech,"We had reserved seven nights at the near-by Le Meridien a hotel not worthy of this famous and fine chain. So we checked out the first morning after a very unpleasant ""welcome"" by a snooty and unhelpful staff and went searching after breakfast for another hotel. We were very fortunate to find this jewel the Movenpick on the same avenue and the lovely Hivernage neighborhood as the Meridien. Although quite a bit more expensive it was worth every penny! The public areas are grand but in a truly elegant way the room most comfortable with a state-of-the-art bathroom a charming balcony and best of all perhpas a superb breakfast included in the room rate. Special mention must be made regarding a breakfast room employee NAIMA who excels in her attentiveness to detail courtesy solicitude for every need and desire of the guests and her good English. This lady richly deserves a promotion and every consideration the chain can give her; indeed Movenpick is very lucky to have her on staff.

The best!!,We came to Movenpick to celebrate my husbands birthday we was greeted at the front of the hotel by the wonderful staff very professional. We fell in love walking through the beautiful entrance leading to the reception. The staff at the reception was so nice and friendly especially Nadia who was always willing to help with anything!    Checking in was super fast and went straight into our room. I was a little upset that the hotel did not do anything for my partners birthday as i already sent a request via email and also contacted booking.com to call the hotel which they did and Movenpick did send a email back saying a cake would be put out with a lovely surprise but it was not done.    Also the window in the toilet was broke so on the same evening within being in the room for 15mins we had to call reception and was changed into another room straight away.    I emailed booking.com about the hotel not staying to its word and booking.com contacted myself and the hotel the following day. The hotel then left use a lovely fruit bowl and decorated the bed and also came in with a cake 2 days after the birthday.    The breakfast is amazing with variety of choices to choose from.    The cleaning young lady was just Amazing she cleaned the room everyday and the shower spotless she should get paid more!! Shes so good!

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,noodlesverge wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Gate 1 Tour: Impressive but not Impressive,We stayed at the Movenpick Hotel Mansour for 2 nights as part of our Gate 1 Tour of Morocco. Overall the hotel looks very fancy and refined and it is for the most part but there were a few things that could be improved.    First off the property is huge many buildings many rooms a sprawling footprint. Even the main lobbies were a maze of hallways. We were placed in building 1 which is most likely their group building. Rooms were of adequate size maybe a bit small. We had a toilet that leaked water all night so we needed to keep the bathroom door closed. You will be happy to know the shower is Western! Best shower of the trip!    Movenpick offered free wifi but the wifi sucked--it was easy to connect to but slower than molasses. We did get good connections out in the courtyard and breakfast restaurant but it would have been so much better if it worked in the rooms.    Also there is not an ATM on the property. It was a about a 10 minute walk across the street to get cash. Make sure you have some with you or feel comfortable crossing the streets!    The included breakfast was the best on the trip with an omelette station and a full array of fresh breakfast foods. (Moroccan eggs taste just a little different from USA eggs!)    The highlight for us was the poolside bar. Lights were dimmed there was some background music and the external heaters were turned on. Service was a bit slower and prices were closer to $10 for a glass of wine and $13 for a cocktail.    Overall Movenpick was a pretty OK hotel a few changes and it would have been dynamite!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Silver Spring, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noodlesverge

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,esmeeluiken wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Very good,Last week my husband and I arrived in Marrakech for the first time. We travelled to Marrakech to get married and were extremely excited. The moment that we arrived at the hotel we were absolutely impressed because the M√∂venpick is such a gorgeous hotel on the outside and inside. The moment we were checking in the staff told us that our suite had a technical issue and that we had to wait. So we waited. After an hour of still waiting I asked the reception if we could maybe get some tea or coffee. That wasn't an immediate yes she had to discuss that with the manager. Ultimately we got coffee while waiting. After two hours I started to get seriously irritated because no one offered us anything we just had to wait. No communication at all.    After those two hours we decided to talk to a manager since the reception didn't felt the urge to take care of us. From that moment on everything started to get better. The manager immediately apoligized and took us to one of the hotel restaurants. There we met assistent manager Hafsa who completely brightned up our evening. We were offered a dinner and Hafsa and her staff did a great job. She was very professional and informed us on all the things that we could do during our stay in Marrakech. The whole staff there was interested in us apoligized again and the food and service were extremely good.    The rest of our stay was as good. Breakfast is good the suite was extremely beautiful and comfortable the housekeeping ladies were sweethearts and the day we celebrated our wedding there the hotel decorated our room in honeymoon style. I would recommend this hotel for sure just ask for a manager fast if something happens because the reception doesn't communicate very well and is not trained enough to deliver exceptional customer care.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esmeeluiken

Menara Mall is just 10 minutes away from the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants along Avenue Mohammed VI. I went for dinner at the Marcelona restaurant in the hotel food and service are awesome.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,windvalley wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Quite good but could be excellent,Stayed 7 nights at the hotel. Location we found to be very good - Walking distance to the markets in the old part of town but far enough not to be in it all the time.    The lobby of the hotel was very nice but oir building Zinade definitrly in need of some repairs. The elevator carpets had partially come off. Our room was on the 5th floor but the view of the aircon units and piping didnt make us want to sit on the terrace. For such rooms probably shouldnt even have a terrace. We found the room nice enough with a large bathroom. Two things about the room were not good: it got extremely hot at night (despite temps of max 12C) and there was noise from the machinery on the rooftop. I am guessing this also caused the heat in the room. Opening a door was not an option unless we want to awaked before sunrise by the minaret nearby.  The pool area is lovely and thought the pool area service was also good. The bar by the pool was fine but often no one can to take drink orders for 10 minutes.  Breakfast was sufficient and the personnel there extremely friendly and service oriented. We also loved the resident cats on the property and the ladies taking care of them in the kids room wonderful.  What made me actually take the rating down to 3 from 4 was the restaurant. We ate dinner on our last evening and the food was pre cooked not really warm and tasteless. The service was ok but the prices were way too high for this quality. They need to work on this.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,SmoothieBurton wrote a review Nov 2018,40,A chandelier that Sia would be proud of!,I have visited Marrakech a few times and always tend to try different hotels whilst visiting Morocco. Having heard a mixture of reviews my friend had booked this hotel and therefore I decided to stay here. The hotel is located within the Hivernage area of Marrakech and is walking distance from the station and the Menara Mall.    Without doubt the entrance and the grounds of this hotel are amazing. The artwork (Banksy style) makes it even more intriguing and adds to the large display of artwork around the hotel. The chandelier in the main lounge is simply beautiful and the concierge explained the names of each of the difference sections of rooms located around the hotel which I found interesting.    Unfortunately as many have explained the rooms were a tad underwhelming. My friend originally had a room booked in the main section of the hotel however due to an issue the room had to be changed and we were then moved to the outside section of the hotel. Which was fine however the room was quite small for a twin bedded room. I found the cushions to be too soft (however this is down to personal preference) and more hangers for clothes would have been ideal. That said the room was clean (thank you housekeeping) and had the necessary amenities that was required.    I did not use the gym whilst I was there however my friend did and was very pleased with the array of equipment that was available.    The breakfast in the morning in the Sarai restaurant was perfect. The display of Moroccan plates on the walls were beautiful and there was a large selection of food to cater to all your requirements.    The service provided in the restaurant was super! Mohamed Bachiri (waiter) in particular was amazing. Whilst I was there for my stay he really looked after me and other guests. From making sure we had tea and coffee in the morning to even remembering my breakfast routine! He always served with a smile and nothing was too much trouble. His customer service was amazing and even explained the artwork on the walls he is an asset to the restaurant within the hotel.    I unfortunately did not have time to have dinner in the restaurant due to being out quite late exploring Marrakech however I did manage to have late night drinks at the Manso bar. The bar was wonderful with dark mood lighting and upbeat music it was a great space to sit and relax after a lot of walking! The barman Hamza (wears glasses) was super! He really took care to make sure me and my friend had drinks and always had a big smile on his face. Hamza took time to talk and explain more about the hotel and his customer service was better than what I have experienced in London bars. He provided me with suggestions on places to visit in Marrakech and from start to finish nothing was too much trouble. He really is an asset to the hotel.    To conclude I agree with previous reviews on the hotel rooms could be revamped however the grounds and the super service of the staff in the hotel make up for this and would visit again.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smoothieburton

Everything went smoothly & up to the standards starting from the arrival & ending to the departure.    All staff was very blessed & hospitalized from the doormen concierge reception housekeeping restaurant in room dining call centre & gym.    I felt that I‚Äôm in my second home & enjoyed a lot.    Restaurant has had the most delicious Moroccan authentic food that I will never forget the taste of it.    The experience with the tourist tours was absolutely great & I enjoyed every moment either in Marrakech or even during our stay at Movenpick Hotel Casablanca.

The staff were extremely friendly 3 ladies named Touria Nazha and Basma looked after the kids very well and were always there to entertain them. Lunch was provided by kitchen staff who always had a smile on their face and stayed positive. Their programme through the day was impeccable it included cooking face painting dancing treasure hunting gardening colouring and much more.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Lin S wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Mixed review,We were a party of 12 chaps played golf and us ladies were there for a relaxing few days. We were in block 7 room 7407 lovely room not such a nice view of the car park. Balcony door didn‚Äôt lock.....The rooms in this block are noisy at night particularly early hours as the night club across the way closes early hours particularly bad on a Friday night/Saturday morning. Hotel accommodated 2 couples moving rooms but not all of us which was disappointing. We only eat in the hotel at lunchtime and breakfast unfortunately lunch was very slow although the food was good when it arrived. We also struggled to get an itemised bar bill early evening before we went out.    The breakfast area and food was lovely. You do need to do something about the coffee machine queues especially staff jumping in before guests?    You really do need to get cabs to get around always haggle with the taxis or they will rip you off!    Pool area was great.    The only other issue was getting a late check out. The lady dealing with us was rude and very unhelpful. I had to ask and then wait for the reservation manager for us to extend our room by 3 hrs you seemed to have to fight for anything other than the norm I did feel they could have been more helpful as we had spent 5 nights in a very noisy room!    Hotel grounds are lovely clean and kept well.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Camberley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/447lins
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Sharon R wrote a review Oct 2018,40,So much to like,Enjoyed a 5 night stay at the Movenpick. There is a lot to like about it. Rooms are spacious and quiet in building 7. Big balcony to enjoy and the bathrooms are quite large. Pools spa and main lobby areas are quite lovely. All staff are friendly and helpful. Two major setbacks stops me from rating it 5 stars. Room wifi was horrible. I asked for it to be checked but don‚Äôt think it was. The property is so large not sure they have enough routers. Perhaps an IT expert can check this for them. It was very annoying having to always go closer to the lobby area to get good wifi. The second issue was restaurants. For dinner only one good option for a large property. Would have been nice to have another option for guests who don‚Äôt want to leave the property. Other than that good hotel with potential to be great.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/159SharonR

The decor is so chic and the colors are so welcoming and as soon as we got in the staff and manager took great care of us we felt welcomed and comfortable which is rare these days. We ordered lots of food to share and taste and it was just delicious and had to order more just to try other dishes.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Florian254 wrote a review Oct 2018,20,"The good, the bad and the ugly",Location: In the middle of an area which is full of Hotels some 50-70 Dirhams away from the main attractions.    Room: The good a very nice room big and spacious a very nice bath and shower with nearly all in that you could expect. Serious problems with stocking/restocking the Minibar. The ugly: The room was in a building at the far end of the real estate and no umbrellas are available. Going from the reception to your room could get you soaked.    Food: The Spanish Restaurant had good food good drinks and good service. The breakfast is a mixed bag when it was full long lines for the coffee developed quickly. For a Hotel of that size nothing specacular. Room Service was fast and delivered good Quality    Public Areas: A large pool fo which 2/3rds are pretty flat otherwise a bit overdesigned but well kept.    Sevice: This is the main reason why only two stars. You want to have the minbar stocked up: Can take two hours to not get anything and two more to have only slightly more. You want to eat? Even the reception does not know that the buffetrestaurant is closed. Cleaning your table at breakfast? Randomly. You want to check out? Be Aware that there is only one person there to check you out and the other people at the reception don¬¥t do it. And do not expect the bill to be correct.    I had literally three employees at the pool area watching me while I was trying to get a sunumbrella up. And for two hours no person from the bar was able to walk around and get some orders.    All in all: I would not go there again.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Norddeutschland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Florian254

Having said that it is priced lower than other 5 star hotels in marrakech so you have to take that into consideration. We found the service to be excellent throughout especially the waiters at breakfast who always served us quickly and kept us topped up with coffees and freshly squeezed orange juice.

The rooms are great spacious comfortable and very clean. Pool area is lovely and well maintained. Breakfast selection is very good with great omelet station.    However the hotel is like a maze with no signage to find your way around. After 4 days there I was still getting lost trying to find anything especially in lobby area which is enormous and very confusing.    As many others have said the service here is not good. There are lots of staff but they don‚Äôt know what they are doing. Six bar staff and it takes 20 mins for them to serve a gin and tonic. I was close to offering to do it myself.    The most frustrating thing was that many people in our group had minibar charges on their bill when checking out not having used the minibar at all. It looked like the hotel added these charges (100-250 dirhams) on to most bills and removed them straight away if challenged on checkout. Unfortunately not everyone spotted the overcharge so they are profiting here. Not good!,Date of stay: September 2018,,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicknameIreland

It's a gorgeous hotel recently renovated with fabulous pools. Rooms are great too. But as with many places in Morocco it's the service that lets the place down.    From a disappearing concierge dismissive reception staff and impossible-to-find bar staff by the pool it became a bit of a running joke for us.    We foolishly forgot our sunscreen at the last hotel and with a 3 year old in tow needed some. Concierge says ""there is none in the hotel"". Ok where can we buy some? ""At the pharmacy"". Right where is that? ""It's a public holiday so they're all closed"". Any other suggestions for sunscreen? ""No"". Hmm not the service expected at a 5 star hotel.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Ghulam wrote a review Aug 2018,50,3 wonderful nights in Marrakech Movenpick,"Hi Guys picked the family up from our family home in Rabat and head over to Marrakech. Firstly we arrived early at the hotel so we assumed we will be at loose ends until check-in time. Reception could see we had kids so Kindly searched for an available room that will allow us to check-in immediately. They could have simply said ""computer said no"" but from the start you could see that staff want to be helpful and not resistant. Not only did we get an early check-in but also got an upgrade... what a lovely result.  We stayed in room 5002 which was a suite very clean and the bed was so comfortable you just sink into the pillows. I want to give a special mention to the kids club they were really friendly and really worked hard for the kids. I have a 6 year old boy and 7 year old girl and my daughter although at first reluctant was so happy there and let us chill out. There was 2 very small incidents that I hope the guys at the hotel will pick up on because the Movenpick Marrakech is a wonderful stay and it's the attention to detail which will make you stand out. The first negative point is the toaster in the breakfast area. I burnt my finger lowering the toast into the toaster using the button as the metal was exposed and the plastic protective cover on the slider missing. The second negative point was that my daughter cut her self in the small pool outside room 5002 on a broken tile in the pool on the steps coming in and out. One of the managers gave a very silly response when he said the pool was not for kids. Come on guys you can do better than that!!! Firstly it does not say that ""no kids"" secondly adults bleed and cut just like kids. Just own the problem and fix it. Please do not let these small points put you off what was a very nice and relaxing stay. I for one will 100% be booking again and I'm certain that there toaster will be fixed next time lol.",Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GH55110s

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,martynwlondon wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Excellent hotel and a memorable stay,At first I was a little hesitant to book this hotel after reading entirely different reviews. After long thought and seeing the beautiful interiors I went ahead and scheduled my visit. Please take into consideration that I visited during the low season (July) so the hotel was not as busy as it would usually be. Upon arrival the staff were very welcoming and directed me through to reception where I was able to check in quickly and efficiently. As I was guided through to my room the porter informed me of where the restaurants and facilities were on the grounds which came in use as the hotel does not have a directory or a map so there could be parts of the hotel that I never discovered.    I stayed in a classic room and was surprised by the size. It was very spacious and had an incredible shower room. I will note that as many of the reviews have already stated the carpets were awful and dirty. Mine was covered in nail polish and some very unsanitary brown stains. Other than the carpets the room was spotless and I love the little details that the housekeepers added every day.    There are quite a few restaurants on the grounds and every one that I visited was lovely. As it was the low season some of them were only open a couple of days of the week; I assume that this changes depending on the season. As you would expect from a five-star hotel the prices are on the higher side but when it comes to things like the Moroccan buffet you really can eat as much as you want.    I found the pool slightly disappointing. For adults there is only the one rectangular pool and I feel that the entire hotel centred around it. If you do not get a bed in the morning it is challenging to find one throughout the day. The staff are helpful and will manoeuvre umbrellas and beds for you but if you want food or drink you physically have to ask as they will not come to check.    The most significant let down of the hotel by far is the wifi connection. As I work remotely I have to check emails throughout the day and the wifi connection drops every ten minutes or so. I found that the signal in the atrium was the best but it also fails occasionally. I enquired every day and the staff swear that they know nothing about having a weak signal but it is a definite issue for the hotel.    Generally I enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it to visitors but if you are there for business be cautious about the internet connection.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martynwlondon
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Tayler W wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Lovely hotel but could be run better,I think the Movenpick was having a bad week when we stayed. Check-in was quite chaotic and queues were long. We were assigned the wrong room at first (a twin room rather than a double). A few other guests were having similar issues from what I could gather; I heard someone complaining to reception because they were given a room with somebody already in it!    Our room key stopped working intermittently so we were back and forth to reception a lot. Then the lift broke so we had to walk up and down 3 flights of stairs multiple times a day for our whole stay. Not too much of an issue for us but it did make me wonder about the disabled guests.    The air con in our room was more of a lukewarm fan (I assume it was faulty?) so sleeping was uncomfortable some nights. We asked someone to have a look twice but it never got fixed. Water from the hotel was a rip off - 50 Dirham (around ¬£4) for a large bottle.    All that being said the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff are all so lovely and can't do enough for you. The food in the hotel restaurants is good quality (particularly the tapas restaurant) and the rooms are big and stylish. The pool area is fab with really comfy sun loungers.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,cm19w5 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Best hotel ever!,I can say this was probably the best hotel I've stayed at! The reception was absolutely breathtaking and always smelled amazing. Our room was very neat and tidy the bathroom was big and clean. Overall the decor of the room was very luxurious. The staff were really welcoming towards us from the moment we stopped into the hotel they were really attentive and took very good care of us. There was also a breakfast buffet included with our room and it was just simply amazing they had a wide variety of foods to choose from and the food was delicious. On the hotel compound they had about 5 restaurants to choose from we ate the main one ( I cannot recall the name) and the food was amazing. I definitely recommend staying at this hotel you will not be disappointed!.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cm19w5
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,AnneSeymour66 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Summer Holiday with Sister - 16th July 1 week,This was our 2nd visit to the Movenpick and what was really lovely to be remembered by some of the staff there who deserve a special mention. Omar in the restaurant at breakfast looked after us so well and even delivered fresh coffees to our sunbed. And then there was Anas our pool butler so helpful and friendly. A little child was falling asleep on the sunbed so he went out of his way to find an umbrella and cover the sun so the little one could sleep - how lovely is that.  We also met Jihane one of the waiters on this trip who joined the hotel in March. From the minute we arrived on Monday afternoon she could not do enough for us her English is really good and she couldn't do enough for us during our stay. It was so hot on this trip and we were given buckets of ice for our water throughout the day. My sister and I are hoping to return next year.  The room was fabulous but did have a few design flaws in the bathroom which had caused some water damage (did not impact our stay). There was also a fridge a coffee machine and a kettle. Hairdryer available and of good quality. The AC was an absolute god send after an amazing day by the gorgeous pool side.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnneSeymour66
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Dan J wrote a review Jul 2018,30,Inconsistent!,Negative points.    Prior to arrival we booked a transfer via the hotel concierge to collect us from the airport. It never arrived! After 40 minutes of waiting we called the hotel to chase this & eventually a car was sent for us. Not what we‚Äôd expect when paying a premium for a transfer.    Shortly into our stay we heard from other guests that an event/ conference for 700 people was taking place at the hotel that day. This meant paying guests could not use the main pool or bar for the entire day.  In the evening as part of the event a party took place around the pool. Paying guests were not permitted to enter. The music was horrendously loud with heavy bass.    At 10:30pm I called reception to enquire  as to when this would end I was advised 11pm.    At 11:30pm the music continued I went to reception to ask again I was then told the music ‚Äòshould hopefully finish around midnight‚Äô. I asked to speak with a manager & was told a manager would call our room shortly. No manager called!    At 12:30am the music STILL continued my partner went to reception to complain. He asked to speak with a manager & was told there was no manager available. He was advised ‚Äòthe music should end soon this is not normal‚Äô. Shortly after the music finally stopped.    Not only did the hotel fail to inform us about the event but our room was situated very close to the pool where the party took place. This was appalling planning on behalf of the hotel.    The next morning my partner visited reception again as no manager had ever contacted us - as we had both been promised. Once again no manager was available. A member of staff called a manager & advised that my partner & I could each have a free massage as a good Will gesture for the disturbance the event had caused us.    Upon check out one of the massages appeared on the bill. We explained this should not be charged (as agreed) & We were told ‚Äò no this is not possible‚Äô after much back & fourth the staff eventually removed the massage from the bill my partner had to write a note explaining why this was & sign it. We felt this was terrible communication on the hotels part! Making our check out stressful & lengthy.    On one occasion we asked reception for water to be sent to our room - it never arrived!    On another occasion I ordered a beer by the pool 20 minutes later- still no beer yet staff were standing around doing nothing.    Positive points.    The hotel is beautiful the interiors & decor are stunning. It smells magnificent & is always very clean.    House keeping were great; polite ladies & room always well cleaned.    Breakfast is fab - lots of choice & fresh food. Special praise to the lady who makes the tasty omelettes & the pancake lady both were friendly & always smiling.    Chocolate hour 5-6pm everyday in the lobby is a lovely added extra. The men in charge of chocolate hour are always welcoming & friendly.    Tapas restaurant is very pleasant lovely setting great food & cheerful staff.    The Spa is wonderful. We had several massages all were to a high standard. The therapists are very good at what they do - better massages than any I‚Äôve experienced in the UK.    Summary.  Beautiful hotel.  Lovely Spa.  Service standards are not 5 star!  Sadly the high standards of some staff is pulled down by the inconsistencies of others.  Event hosting put a dampener on our stay;  1. Guests should be informed if an event is taking place.  2. Guests should not be prohibited to use facilities (which they have paid a lot of money for) during an event.  3. Guests should not be kept awake by an event!,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanJ1871
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Anaya M wrote a review Jul 2018,50,"Superb service from Khadija, Mehdi, Essef, Jessus and the Manager Jaouad",I arrived at the hotel on Monday and being a vegetarian didn‚Äôt find much on the menu to eat .  I was not very happy about that and conveyed my feelings to the waitor and waitress.  They then called Jaouad Eddajjani who was the manager who sorted all the problems out.  The chef called Jessus came out to talk to me and offered to make me whatever I wanted.  Jessus was very helpful and made many dishes for me and my family  which were all very tasty and wholesome and fresh.  He was very patient and sincere and made the food with much love and passion .  He took great joy in knowing that I was enjoying his food which conveys to me a very loyal and good worker.  The staff Khadija Mehdi and Essef were very accommodating  polite and kind.  .  They were doing their best to please and satisfy me which they accomplished to 100% and I can clearly say they are excellent staff as were very friendly genuine and hospitable and I have received this from them every day as I have been going back to the restaurant.    They have been showering me with such great hospitality and customer care which is genuine and sincere because it is coming from their heart and that is clearly evident.    I would recommend that these four members of staff be acknowledged for their hard work and genuine sincerity to please and accommodate the guest.    The manager Jaouad Eddajjani was very helpful and continued to do whatever he could to please me and my family.  He came and sat down and talked to me and my family with a genuine interest for what he could do for us to make our experience a good one.  Jaouad has customer service skills which are excellent and he was very professional and accommodating to our needs he is an excellent manager who has great skills in sorting out any problems and keeping the customer happy and satisfied.    I would recommend that these 5 members of staff be rewarded for their hard work and attention to detail in trying to please me and my family who were the guests at the hotel.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Morson123 wrote a review Jul 2018,20,Not Great,Having had our flight cancelled and turning up to this hotel we were expecting a very solid nights stay with top quality service and 3 meals that Easyjet had said we were going to have and the maddest few hours ensued.    We arrived at the hotel at approximately 10pm and a whole flight's worth of people got off and were told to go to reception to get allocated rooms. The people behind the reception desk were relatively good albeit quite rude but understandably so as having to check in nearly 200-300 people at 10pm was not expected at all until nigh on one hour before but still nothing much that could have been done so they could have been a bit less rude as no one wanted to be in that situation.    Once allocated the room and very quickly may I add I was pleasantly surprised with the room with a couple bottles of water a nice twin bed working air-con and a tv that's all that could be asked for after a cancelled flight. We went for our first meal that was complimentary and it was exceptionally good and sat outside to enjoy a few drinks before going to bed. This is where things started to go wrong.    Having been outside and wanting the bill the person serving us came back and gave us the total we asked for an itemised bill so that we could attempt to claim our expenses and this was a struggle in itself as this seemed not be the characteristic thing that happens but even so we would have wanted to see what was paid for. He came back shortly after and manually added up each of the orders and did not give us any itemised bill nor a receipt but did provide us with the ability to pay separately. Very bizarre especially after asking several times for an itemised bill. One of the people in our party then went inside to buy a couple more drinks and he saw approximately 10-15 people behind the bar standing around but the person who was sorting the bill out was pretty much forced to make the drinks even though other members of staff were available to do so which begs the question why are their so many members of staff in the hotel? The card machine signal was particularly poor not sure if that's common in Morocco as we had paid cash throughout the week but several failed transactions is not good and members of our party will continually check their banks to see if any money has gone out.    We were told that we had both breakfast and lunch provided for us so having decided to have a lie in we went to get lunch however after talking to reception lunch had not been provided to us which not sure if it was the hotel's or the airline's fault was pretty difficult and was even worse due to our moods after a cancelled flight.    We decided to buy lunch at one of the snack places. I had ordered first and my food came out pretty quickly along with my drink but other members of our party had a more difficult time ordering. One order was wrong completely giving us a club sandwich instead of a sandwich suitable for vegans one sandwich was completely stone cold along with the fries and the coffee order was wrong the service behind the cafe was an organised chaos with a couple members of our party standing around 10-15 minutes at the front of the queue trying to get served as 8 members of staff were running around like headless chickens trying to sort things out. Another member of our party was trying to get a refund after paying before the food came out and tried for a significant period of time to get a refund which is not acceptable at all. A simple remedy would be table numbers or to get the food from the cafe.    After checking out suitcases were left with the bellboy however there was seemingly no secure storage where we left them so they were just left behind a counter and some were left in the hallway or on trolleys it says something about a hotel that does this especially a 5* chain hotel that doesn't offer secure suitcase storage after checking out.    The room was nice however and the difficulty of a canceled flight might have made things worse but it doesn't take away from poor service.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Morson123

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,leochild wrote a review Jul 2018,30,luxurious overall but room for improvement,I just stayed for 3 days. Check in was brutal. Argument over extra person which was my teenage daughter. They wanted to charge me extra since the reservation did not include her by booking error on the app. Then came the room assigned. Moldy and not a garden view. Then tears more complaining. 1 hour later finally in my room which was booked as a king but ended up a queen. The room was ok pretty pool view which I guess was their version of an upgrade?? Said the manager finally tried to make me happy after they pushed me to a meltdown.  So besides a terrible check in the actual room was small It had a dirty carpet the bathroom counter was not cleaned. and some stains on the setee. The location of the room was noisy so beware and don‚Äôt get a room near an elevator or above the entry to the building.  Besides that the pool was amazing and the gratis afternoon tea and chocolate bar are great touches. The breakfast was very good. Lots of options and good quality.    Upon Check out the bell desk took 30 minutes and 2 phone calls. So when asked how was my stay I was honest and they did take off the meal I had. So thank you for that.  Overall I would stay here again because the decor in the public areas are stunning and I wanted a nice pool.  Staff English could be improved and maybe a deep cleaning on the carpets?

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,krevelyn wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Wonderful Babysitter!,My husband and I stayed at the Movenpick in Marrakech for 9 days. We came primarily for work and brought our 15 month old daughter with us. I was a little nervous about finding a babysitter in Morocco since she is so young but the idea of leaving her behind for one week made me more uncomfortable. So I arranged for a babysitter through the hotel. First of all the Moroccan culture is extremely warm and welcoming to babies and children so it felt right that I brought my little one along. But most importantly we had a fabulous babysitter at the Movenpick. Her name is Raouia and she is on the staff of the kids club at the hotel. She was so kind responsible helpful calm and easy to communicate with. She speaks multiple languages and put me at ease upon meeting her. My daughter loved her and the kids club is a great addition to the hotel experience for children. If you plan on traveling with a baby or children to Morocco I do not hesitate to recommend hiring Raouia during your stay.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krevelyn

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Viks J wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Good,Duration of stay: 7 Nights (23rd to 30th July 2018)  Type of stay: Couples holiday  Board: Bed and breakfast  Room Type: Superior King Size    Written on last evening prior to AM departure.    I have been fortunate to visit Marrakech 6 times now and have stayed at various locations throughout. This was my first time attending this hotel with a view of experiencing a mixture of a relaxing and leisurely holiday.    Staff: Throughout the duration of our stay the staff at the hotel in all areas; from the bedroom maid to reception staff were very polite and attentive to our needs. Some spoke English fluently but others who did not were able to understand my broken French and actions. In our experience we felt this did not hinder our experience with the staff or any requests. Although for others this may not be the case.    Room: Superior King size room in the Messaouda pavilion. The room was beautiful. Positives: Clean contemporary large balcony with seating area large bathroom with various washroom products large closet area fully working and consistent air conditioning system huge and comfortable bed that was more like a super King flat screen TV hot drink station and super comfy lounger. Room service was prompt at all times with good communication via the room telephone to reception.    Negatives: Wi-Fi within the room is seriously poor. The connection is inconsistent and disconnects regularly. Where it was at its strongest (at the door) wasn't a really convenient place to relax within the room. The location for us was at the far end of the hotel. I'm not sure if there are other rooms similar in size that are closer but the walk became frustrating at times. Being a young active couple it was bearable but I can envisage a young family with a young child or older visitors finding this a tad frustrating. We had trouble getting into our room on three occasions. In our pavilion there is no staff or telecom system to communicate with the reception. So instead we had to treck back to the reception or attend the Spa and request for them to call and bring us a new card again and again. Thankfully the staff were responsive and prompt but we had our hands full on one occasion and another had hot food with us which caused an inconvenience. The room does not have an iron or ironing board. A request was made and these arrived within 30 minutes.    Hotel Overall: We used the gym pool area lunchtime cafe and experienced some Shisha in the evenings. All of which were good. The gym is a good size with towels and water to hand and a variety of free weights and resistance machines. The gym has no air conditioning which isn't great for a publicised 5 star hotel. The main pool is a decent size with lots of sun beds around. The other two pools a lot smaller can be used for kids and are a lot quieter. The pool closest to the bar looks out date and even on the busy days there is hardly anyone there. Shisha in the evenings was nice staff regularly change the coal and are attentive. Price for an apple shisha was 195 dirhams. About ¬£15. The hotel cafe is pretty decent and does great fresh food. Although is only open between 1030 to 1830. The breakfast food is fair and there is a variety to suit all. But it would be nice to try a new range of food in certain areas (i.e desserts section). We both feel that even though we were given a little map of the hotel and it's layout signage is poor and there is a lack of information provided by the staff. An example of this is the location of the gym. Even two members of staff directed us incorrectly. It took a third try stopping someone and walking in several directions before someone walked us to the door on the first day. There is also a huge lack of direction for the restaurants and cafe as we had to try and explore ourselves to find them. Apparently there are 6 restaurants even to this day we know of only 3.    Overall this was a good experience. The hotel has the look and physical beauty of a 5 star hotel but there are still minor adjustments to be made.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Sophie B wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Excellent !! Recommended stay everything you need,I have just returned from a weeks stay at the M√∂venpick resort.    Grounds; lovely surroundings the lobby area is first class beautiful touches with the velvet chairs and water fountains. The entrance is very impressive huge attention to detail has been well thought of here !    Rooms; nice size and equipped with everything you need. Staff were very happy to give us two sets of brand new hangers when we asked for some and more and tea and coffee on request this was never a problem. Rooms are cleaned to a good standard.    Gym and Spa; used this most days. Excellent equipment in the gym with everything you need. My only reservation would be that the air con needs to be on and windows closed as it did get very warm! It also could be cleaned more regularly as the bin was usually full of plastic bottles and the carpet did need a good hoover!    Breakfast; EXCELLENT ! freshly cooked omelettes ( young girl who cooked them most days was very professional and presented the plates with special touches !) Ask for less oil as they like to add a lot!!!  You could not have asked for more fresh fruit pastries pancakes yoghurts cold meats smoked tuna and hot options ! There is an option to sit inside or outside and the staff were very attentive. They would be happy to get your breakfast if you asked!    Chocolate hour is fantastic from 5pm - 6pm we really looked forward to heading in the lobby area to sample a huge variety of chocolate chocolate drinks and biscuits freshly prepared by the chef ! You can go back as many times as you like!    Food; we didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel as we wanted to see the ‚Äòreal‚Äô Morocco however the menus looked good in both restaurants that were open! We thought 360 for the buffet bbq was slightly steep!  I would recommend some alternative restaurants called Nomad Barametre and Le Cusine Moma all excellent !!!    Pool; lovely and big really good sun loungers and plenty of them! Pool staff very attentive. The coffee shop inside the lobby does similar food for half the price so we ordered in there and brought it out for example and panini and chips is around ¬£4.50. However during Ramadam this opens from 2:30pm.    Points for the hotel ; I think some of the gardens around the pool area could have been better kept i.e plants trimmed weeded. Gym and spa could be cleaner. The roof top terrace closed ... not sure why ? we are still paying guests regardless of Ramadam as the hotel was quiet.    We had a slight issue with cocktails which are not cheap at ¬£9 + so for that you would expect a ‚ÄòLondon standard‚Äô we are not one to complain but the Kahula was not added to the expresso martini the manger of the hotel was very apologetic and the next day without asking he came with the manager of the bar and brought us the ones we ordered to the pool area which was a very nice touch! So thank you again.    Location; we never got a taxi as you really see the ‚Äòreal city sites‚Äô walking however there are taxis right outside the hotel.  The hotel is slightly out of the way but well within walking distance 2.5k to the Souks and mall is just around the corner with a large supermarket.  We got the number 19 bus from the airport however they didn‚Äôt really know where the hotel was so we did go round in a large circle! I would get a taxi as it was only 100 door to door do not pay any more!    Overall this is an excellent hotel and we have already told our friends to visit!  This is a honest review.

The Spa is fabulous and people are friendly  polite generous Professional.  Marrakech is a charming place!

Eventually was made to pre-pay money before hand . This is before we had even spent it . The icing on the cake was been told the money I don't spend can't be refunded as it's a ""chore "" for them . Basically robbing me .  Apart from the embarrassment of looking cheap the hotel is beautiful .  I would recommend staying there in a heart beat as you really have to see it to believe it .

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Henry C wrote a review May 2018,30,clean but staff need some polishing.,OK not a bad hotel by any means but some significant irritations during our stay which a little bit of staff training could resolve. There is obviously a culture of extracting cash from tourists in Marrakech and I get that. However the guy that took our luggage to our rooms didn't take it to the rooms for 30 minutes so we couldn't change. To add insult to injury I tipped him for all 4 couples but he then took a further tip which my polite brother offered.  The dining experience left a lot to be desired. Although the dining room was nearly empty we had to share menus. One member of staff repeatedly took the wine list away (perhaps for religious reasons?) but then when we did order a bottle of wine the cheeky wine waiter told us one bottle was insufficient!!!! - A new experience.  Overall though clean comfortable rooms lovely pool and reasonably priced. Just hold a staff meeting and get them trained!!,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Preston, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryc677

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Aleksander B wrote a review May 2018,30,"Beautiful hotel, poor service","The hotel is located fairly closely to the airport and a short taxi ride (‚Ç¨5-8) from the old town.    We stayed at the hotel for five days and had a ""family room"" (i.e. two adjacent rooms) on the ground floor of the Zidane building. The hotel lobby area and the grounds are beautiful and the rooms are fine although they feel a bit dated considering that the hotel was renovated fairly recently. Also the kids club (free and starting at age 4) is good and proved to be pretty helpful during the rainy days we had. Similarly the buffet restaurant offers nice breakfasts and ok dinners (although dinners are fairly pricey given the quality).    The main thing that lets this place down is the service. On the day of arrival I asked about a pressing service for my shirts and suits and was told that someone would come to our room to collect them. Nobody did so I called again the following morning. Again I was told this would be attended to but I had to call again an hour later and still it was a no-show. We wanted to go explore the city (rather than waiting in our room for the shirts to be collected) so in the end I just took the items to reception myself. I later found out that a few other guests had the exact same experience. Further on one occasion we asked for some warm milk to give to our baby son at bedtime and it took the staff more than half an hour to get it to us which is not ideal when you have got an exhausted little who only wants to fall asleep. Finally the shower design in the rooms is fundamentally flawed as any shower turns the entire bathroom into a wet room with very slippery floors which is problematic when you have little ones prone to falling.",Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AleksanderB470

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Kevin_Atterbury wrote a review Apr 2018,10,Not even close to 5 star,It is undoubtedly an attractive place but that‚Äôs where the allure ends. Food options are limited and the meals I had (Jambra room service) were bland and overpriced. It‚Äôs not hard to make a decent chicken panini...    I had to ask 3 separate people and wait over 24 hours just to get a kettle sent to the room despite tea bags and coffee being in there already. I had to ask a guy to show me how he would make a cup of tea before the penny dropped.    Check in and check out experience was too long badly organized and with staff more interested in talking among themselves and looking at their phones.    My company got me a basic room which had a wonderful view of an air conditioning unit. The air conditioning in my room did not work and just blew hot air around. I asked to have it fixed and was promised it would be done... by this point I had given up trying to get any customer service and just put up with it.    The express 1hr pressing service took 4 hours (still had to pay a 50% surcharge) there was a smell of cigarettes coming through the vent in the toilet from somewhere and there is no turn down service iron hairdryer no room service menu in the room terrible wine selections etc etc etc....    If I was on holiday and spending my own cash I would have demanded to move room and if not requested a refund and gone to the Four Seasons.

Also the only other thing which was amusing was that for some reason the Reception staff were the least likely to understand you! it took us some dialogue to communicate with this team although they were lovely - its amusing cause the rest of the hotel staff seem to understand all languages and get completely what your asking for! but it made us laugh a little cause they were all so nice!

MUST READ :),I and my wife would like to thank everybody at the Movenpick Marrakech for a wonderful stay we had here. From the minute we checked in to the day we left everybody was so attentive to all our needs.    The suite was amazing and had everything required for a perfect stay with great comfort and services. Mr Khalid and the reception made every effort to ensure we where welcomed into our suite with VIP experience and Emmanuel ensured our dining experience in the restaurants were spot on throughout our 5 nights. The concierge where always on hand and ensured we had all the information required and assisted us not only during our stay but before arriving also. The Spa team (I forgot the names) where very helpful throughout are stay and always smiling and pleased for a pleasant chat if nothing else.    I would like to specially thank Jihane and Mr Gregory also for making this all happen. i was delighted and will sure to be returning to Marrakech to have a similar experience once again at Movenpick.    The personalised service at such a large hotel was one of a kind and masks over any small issues as one of my concerns was the hotel may be too large and commercial however it did not feel like this.    The location is awesome and close by to everything with the Medina just a 30 dirham taxi ride away and all the clubs and bars very local.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Monica H wrote a review Mar 2018,30,All that glitters isn‚Äôt gold,Initially we were super impressed with the hotel. The grounds were beautiful and dazzling at first glance but once you got pass the initial wow it goes down hill quick. The staff at the reception desk were moderately friendly but it was clear after residing there a few days that they were overworked. It appeared that one young lady was at the reception desk for a period of over 16 hours. Our first room was less than what was expected for a 5 Star Hotel especially since it took 4 years to renovate. On outside of the elevator doors the dry wall was cracking and falling apart. The fine details were totally missed in this hotel and the rooms were lack luster. We had to change rooms three times because of the room conditions. One evening it took over 30 minutes for someone to answer the phone to get a bottle of water. I called the front desk house keeping and even guest services. I eventually had to leave the room and walk to the fitness center to try and find water at 10pm to no avail. Finally after all of that they answered the phone needless to say I was livid. I would probably not stay there again because I‚Äôm sure for the price you can find better more well kept accommodations. On a positive note the breakfast was great and had a good selection of food the wait staff were nice but again overwhelmed. The owners need to spend more money adding additional staff at front desk and expanding that area less bellmen and more attention to detail in the room as far as the decor and structure of the property. The hallways are shameful and this doesn‚Äôt warrant a 5 Star rating. I expected so much better. I hope it improves it has such potential.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4977ZEmonicah

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,L33smithy wrote a review Mar 2018,20,Great hotel but disappointing,I stayed here for 4 days last year as a relaxing end to 10 days spent climbing in the Atlas Mountains.    The hotel is absolutely amazing really clean and tidy with a very nice atmosphere and great facilities. The location is good also and within walking distance of both the new malls and food chains in one direction and the old town/ square in the other.    The breakfast options and service was also excellent.    However the hotel was let down by the staff. I was ignored/ left waiting to check-in likely due to coming straight from the mountains so being in scruffy clothes.. they then tried to make me pay upfront when I had already booked and paid via Amex. All in total it took around 30 mins to get checked in.    This was evening and the following morning I noticed that despite paying extra for a room with a Garden view I was overlooking a road and a car park with noise from a gate opening and closing all night as cars came in. I tried to discuss this at the front desk but their English was not great so gave up and stayed in the wrong room for my stay.    The other complaint is that due to being Easter holidays there were lots of kids left unattended by parents running and screaming around the pool between sun loungers and jumping in the pool. This is not what you would expect in a 5 star hotel and made the experience less than relaxing.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L33smithy

The WiFi in our room was unusable slow and unreliable- we told the front desk on our first day and while they said they would address it it was neither fixed nor did we hear back. Several rooms in our group experienced similar WiFi issues.    On the second day another group of friends checked in and they were given the room key to a stranger‚Äôs room. They found out when they saw a stranger‚Äôs luggage after brushing their teeth and using the bathroom.

Overall the stay was pleasant but we did have some issues with what we were told about 2 excursions we booked with the hotel seems the concierge and reception teams are not in sync and have their own people that they use for the trips and this caused confusion and some stress for us as we had to deal with the guides and drivers when what we had signed up to was different to what the tour people thought was agreed.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alkesha2018

Our view was nothing and I believe a big part of the rooms doesn‚Äôt have a big view as it‚Äôs closed in by the other hotels.  Breakfast was wonderful very diverse and tasty. Nice was also that just 50 meters from the hotel are the Medina bikes that you can rent. There are several stations in Marrakech mostly at the main attractions.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Yasser K wrote a review Feb 2018,10,Major Disappointment !!,Me & my wife went to Marrakesh for 9 nights for my birthday. We stayed at this Movenpick Hotel thinking we will be getting excellent service but apart from the birthday cake which the hotel provided I got to say we were let down from the start. As soon as we got to the hotel there was a problem in finding our booking so it was a good job I had my hotel confirmation with me and I showed this to the receptionist. Now to my shock I was asked to pay ¬£160 deposit for the room even though I had already paid my hotel in full. I knew that I had to pay tourism tax for the hotel but this I wasn‚Äôt expecting and as I only brought cash with this had affected our holiday. When we got to the room I noticed stains on the toilet floor and also a water leak next to the toilet. I reported this but nothing was done. The food choice in the hotel was a let down so when me and my partner decided to order out we were told that we weren‚Äôt allowed to do this apart from this one time. So its either their food at the hotel or no food. When I returned to the UK I noticed I was charged extra when I checked out. I had 1 cola can from the mini bar n also when I ordered room service I paid for everything there and then apart from 2 cola bottles. But I got charged for 2 cola cans from the mini bar n 4 cola bottles. All I‚Äôm saying is when you pay good money for a hotel you expect good service n clean environment. But with my experience this wasn‚Äôt the case and I would go as far as saying that this is the worst experience me & my wife have ever had from a hotel. Rude staff members who are just wanting tips without providing good service.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/541yasserk
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,BigMo2014 wrote a review Feb 2018,50,Brilliant Hotel,I went with my wife in the first week of February for 5 days. Even though the weather wasnt as we expected (it was 8 degrees with some wind and rain) we made the most of it. It's in a good location away from the hustle and bustle but within good within of the main attractions with taxi.    The hotel decor was amazing and the rooms were clean. The buffet breakfast was spot on with plenty to choose from. The staff were very helpful whether it be the reception cleaning staff or the restaurant staff. During our stay there was a Chocolate Hour at 6pm and wow the varieties/taste of chocolate were amazing. We asked for a room upgrade (to a suite) on the 2nd day and our request was accepted.    The only thing that bugged me was when we first went to check-in one of the receptionist was more adamant in showing us a book of excursions. Yes this is helpful but would it not be best to show us a map of the area i.e. where the closest mall is how far the medina is how much we should be paying for taxis etc.    Now in terms of paying for taxis we would be quoted 50 dirhams everytime we wanted to go to the medina (jemma el efna). This is obviously marked up but with gentle haggling it should only be 20-30 dirhams. Be aware of people (especially in the markets) trying to latch onto you and try to be helpful/friendly - these are the hustlers! They will try taking you from one shop to another and then demand money from you. Majority of the people are friendly/helpful its just a small handful who are not. Just a piece of advice if you want to ask for directions then go to into a shop and ask a member of staff.    Also if you go to the market/souk then get lost of purpose - that's the beauty of it. The places to visit are Jemma El Efna (Markets) YSL Garden (Jardin Marjorelle) La Mamounia Hotel Gardens Koutoubia Mosque Bahia Palace Atlas Mountains (aprox. 1 hour from Marrakech),Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigMo2014

I chose a hotel as I have stayed in a Riad before.    When you arrive at the Movenpick the entrance is grand and the smells are lovely the staff were friendly and easy to deal with. When we got to our rooms they were a good size we went for the king size bed.    As our stay progressed we noticed many inconsistencies our rooms were close to one another however a few of us had slippers in the room one so us had the extra pillows another had a card detailing who to call in emergencies etc etc... as time went on we found differences in the ways the rooms were cleaned and fresh towels were not provided a bath mat went missing toilettries were not replaced.    However the buffet does have a lot of variety and there are other places to eat if you fancy a change the lounge serves a good range of drinks and it's fairly quiet - but perhaps this was the time of the year we went.    The spa is always booked and I would have expected more the staff were also a little inconsistent with some being super friendly and the others being very 'matter of fact'... I would recommend they get more staff as space is not an issue - or so I was told.    It's based in the new town and very close to the airport there are some decent shopping centres near by and taxi there will cost you around 30MAD. The old town is further and I would suggest going to the souk and a few other tourist hotspots.    All in all i have given a average rating as there were some things which were great however some things could have been better and more consistent,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shabz23

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Rahul S wrote a review Feb 2018,10,The Moroccan Job!,The last thing you would expect while traveling is getting robbed which is what exactly happened with me during my stay in the hotel. An amount of USD 1500 was stolen from my room(most likely by the House Keeping Staff) while i was out. To make matters worse another burglary took place the very next evening with my colleague whose wallet mobile and watch were stolen while he was sleeping inside the room. This clearly reflects the audacity of the people involved.    After all this the only expectation you have is for the Hotel staff to be supportive and get into investigating the events. However the response was extremely disappointing and questions were raised whether the burglary actually took place.    What is more shocking is that Movenpick does not even have a proper CCTV network to look into footage's as there are no camera's installed in corridors.    Clearly the worst experience of my lifetime and i do not recommend this hotel to anyone.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rahulsK9447ZT

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Abir J wrote a review Jan 2018,20,A disappointment,We stayed at the hotel for almost a week. For the sake of providing a fair and balanced review I am sharing the positives and negatives:    Positives:  1) the hotel looks stunning and has beautiful decoration.  2) an amazing house keeping lady whose name is Kareema. She was amazing as she was committed dedicated and friendly. Our rooms were clean and we had everything we needed.    Negatives:  1) Key chains: we had to request key cards every single day. This was the first time ever that I had to change keys so often. That was a major area of frustration.    2) Wi-fi/ TV problems: wi-fi was consistently poor/ bad and on some occasions you will not be able to join the Movenpick network. The last two days of our stays the TV would stop working for hours. You report the issue and nothing is done about it.    3) Lack of key information/ key details in the room:  One room out of the three rooms we booked had an important phone list. It is lots of trouble to call the service center to transfer us to reception. We felt bad as we did not want to bother them.    Is there a room service? All three rooms only had a small booklet which had signature dishes. This was rather useless. Due to the limited information available we ended up ordering food delivery as opposed to making use of the room service.    4) The English of some staff is below average and if you do not speak French or Arabic you are at a disadvantage. Communicating in Arabic was also a struggle due to regional variation. Resorting to English did not help as some staff apparently do not Know any English at all.    5) old lifts: the lift at the Zaidanne building was so old and the carpet looked disgusting. Having more modern lifts is a good idea.    Some suggestions:  The name of the buildings are not easy to spot / see at night. Perhaps place a sign with the name of the building next to the steps leading to a building.    With the buildings being spaced out and far from reception it would be helpful if there is a phone in each building in a designated common area to be used in case of emergency.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Doha, Qatar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/414abirj

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,NCDiamond wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Comfy little oasis,I really enjoyed this hotel. Rooms were quiet clean and comfortable. The grounds were absolutely beautiful with several quiet relaxing nooks tucked away -- you would never guess you were in the middle of a city. All the food I had was pretty darn good especially the breakfast buffet and the Moroccan restaurant in the back. The location was fairly convenient -- there are plenty of options within a 15 minute walk and the Medina was just a bit further. Even though some of the streets were quiet at night around the hotel we didn't feel unsafe. Conference facilities were also great and the Palais des Congres is one of the largest meeting rooms I've ever seen.    Staff was friendly enough but I did not find them particularly helpful when I asked questions. Not bad it's just that part didn't stand out. Never checked out the gym so I can't comment on that. The pool looked lovely but I never made it in for a swim. The internet was fairly reliable most of the time. It's hard to think of anything that stood out as bad. There were lots of bees on the patio during breakfast I guess.    Rooms in the back -- in buildings with higher numbers -- will be more removed and tranquil but can be a long walk especially with luggage. (I heard some elderly patrons complaining about it.) Rooms in the front -- with lower building numbers -- are more convenient to lobby breakfast and hotel amenities.    From a Western perspective I thought this hotel offered great value for the money.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NCDiamond

So we decided to stop by reception on our way out to dinner to ask for those things again as upon our return to the room we would need to have a shower and go to bed. On our return only the towels were there but no bed for our dauther and as of today there is still only one cup (little detail I know but we do like having a cup of coffee and tea first thing in the morning without having to call for room service). Yesterday we were left again with just two shower towels and one face towel we asked reception and nothing has been sent up to our room.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Ayaz S wrote a review Dec 2017,30,4 days without peaceful sleep,We are a family of 5 so had booked 2 superior rooms for a 4 night stay after reading excellent reviews. First impressions are great especially the reception areas and poolside. Had to walk to the end of the resort to find the rooms on 2nd floor of building no 7. No inter-connecting rooms available in this building so asked for rooms opposite each other - this was not possible as all sold out. Had to make do with two rooms on same floor facing a busy road with a night club. Stayed up most nights with noise of metal garage door opening and shutting every 15 to 20 minutes - sounded like sound of metal shutters being shut next to the windows. Some nights also noise from night club traffic. Nothing was done about the garage doors despite complaining numerous times and room change was only offered on same floor still road facing. Second main problem was that room keys stopped working every day and had to be renewed. Reception staff were not very friendly.    Best feature of the hotel was the breakfast with lovely fresh food and friendly staff. Concierge was also good (Abdul Haq) and helped arrange trips and transportation.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/124ayazs

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,AasamAndMariam A wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Immaculate hotel and Impeccable Staff,"Movenpick Marrakech was an absolute delightful and fantastic hotel.  All the staff are very happy and content in the work that they are doing which makes the guests also feel happy and content.  The restaurants in the hotel are fantastic and provide an excellent quality of food and service.  The breakfast area is immaculate and there was always someone to tend to your needs.  The qualityquantity and variety offered at breakfast is second to none.  It's not just the facilities and location that makes a great hotel its mainly the people.  There were a number of people that made us feel like we were at home and gave us a homely feel and I would like to call out these people.  Mr Amin for arranging the whole experience from our stay's start to finish.  Mr Khalid Mowlad who gave us the utmost respect and treated us like a member of his family - and we even shared a coffee with Mr Khalid.  The omelette/fried eggs chef-who clearly not only loves her job she made sure that her plate was immaculately presented as if we were dining in a 5-star michelin restaurant.  Lastly but not least Miss Safae who (in fact I struggle to find words to represent her kindness) has shown the true nature of a decent honest and kind human being and treated us with so much love that words just cannot describe it. Her official title is Guest Relations Manager - but please just call her Safae-there's no title that can describe her.    The only problem was that me and my wife ""REALLY DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE""    Lots to do -  Menara Mall 20 minute walking distance  City tour Bus - outside hotel main road - 3 minute walking distance  Taxis freely available  Walking distance to restaurants  40 minute leisurely walking distrance to Jemm El Fnaa",Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aasamandmariama

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Nehal C wrote a review Dec 2017,30,"Fantastic, but my visit was ruined..",Mixed feelings about this hotel. The decor is amazing; it won‚Äôt let you down. Definitely luxurious. The ground staff (waiters concierge etc) are incredibly friendly. The rooftop bar and the pool areas are all amazing. This hotel spells luxury. Breakfast is amazing; the range is fantastic. A special shoutout goes to my friend Safae who helped me to find places to eat outside of the hotel and made my stay comfortable.    However there is also a lack of professionalism which exists within the management of this hotel. The rules and regulations are atrocious and totally illogical.  I had booked a Junior Suite and requested for my friend to come and visit me. We wanted to plan our days together and I thought we could sit in the living room and do this. However to my dismay and shock he was not allowed to come to my room. The staff outright refused. I‚Äôm assuming that there‚Äôd be no point in renting the penthouse which has a boardroom as I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to bring external guests. Very disappointing.    Another day the same issue occurs when the gentlemen from Pizza Hut arrives. The hotel does not have many good food options for vegetarians and all of the food they have is extortionately expensive. I had ordered a pizza and I had to walk for about 7 minutes from my room which is on the other side of the resort to come and collect it. Appalling. I would have expected a member of staff to come with him had they been so scared. The hotel was quick to deny things but not quick enough to rectify it.    The last straw was pulled during checkout an experience which was absolutely infuriating. I had spoken to the gentlemen at reception in the morning and he had told me that it was okay for me to check out at 5pm which is when my car was coming as I had a night flight. After landing in London I knew that I‚Äôd have to drive for two hours to get home so I thought I‚Äôd get some sleep in the afternoon. However at 3pm I received a phonecall from the management telling me to evacuate the room. When I spoke of my prior arrangement with the receptionist she exclaimed in shock ‚Äú5pm?! No no sir you must clear the room now I need the suite‚Äù it was so unbelievably unprofessional. I told her to check with her colleagues and then received no phonecall back however I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep as a result of this and so I felt very sleepy whilst driving back home that night. More than that after the phonecall ended I went online and checked Expedia and to my shock it said that there were five Junior Suites available to be booked for that night. So I didn‚Äôt understand the urgency for me to evacuate my room.  I expected a higher standard of service and professionalism from such an establishment but as per the above it is evident that these standards were not met.    Would I return to this hotel? Probably not seeing as when i visited Sofitel during my stay the service was impeccable and I couldn‚Äôt fault them at all.

The hotel could not be nicer and has choice of dining pool spa and what you would expect from a deluxe resort. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Little did I expect such mediocore front desk service from a 5 star hotel. The staff barely speaks any English totally ignored people waiting online to check in they all have similar ""do not ask me question"" expression when I first checked in and subsequently when I approached the front desk asked questions about the city or hotel facilities. The worst part is the room they gave us was in horrible shape. First they gave us a room with horrible sewage smell as soon as we opened the door then there was strong cooking smell from the restaurant next building when we open the bacony window. When I explained the problem to the front desk they did not even bother to apologize just simply gave me a key to a different room without even offer to move our luggages as if we are the ones causing the problem. The room they gave us subsequently was freezing cold one of the lamps was not working and the toilette did not flush properly.

While the public areas are very luxurious the bedrooms are a bit basic! I had to change rooms after a day because the shower leaked so badly it was flooding the carpet in my bedroom! When I went to lock the security chain on my door in the second room it just came off the wall!! To be fair though reception fixed it immediately and there were no further issues with it. The pool is lovely and warm and the breakfast selection was great. As a vegetarian the other dining options were quite limited.    Service could be quite hit and miss. Reception didn't believe me when I said my phone wouldn't make outgoing calls the TV didn't always work but had no English language entertainment channels the TV would turn on every night around 1.40am for no apparent reason. However the housekeeper Najat was amazing and really looked after me! El Mehdi and My Ahmed in the bar (along with a young man with braces whose name I didn't catch) were all lovely and gave outstanding service as well!

We will definitely be back next year!    Firstly we would like to say a massive thank you to some of the staff starting with:  Ayoub  What can we say Ayoub was so caring and attentive to our needs he made us feel like we are one of a kind! Always smiling and always happy and for that we thank him so much he is one of the reasons why we will come back to the hotel. He is very professional and always makes sure our drinks/food was there pronto!.    Hamza  He was always willing to please and will go out of his way to make sure the service was perfect for us even while extremely busy. He was very patient and attentive to our needs for that we would recommend friends and family.    Nadine  She was one of the best pool waitresses we have ever had she was so loving and caring and extremely quick! When she saw us at the pool she always went out of her way to say hello to us.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,PaulF007 wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Great setting beautiful **** Suggest Staff might need some training,Attending a conference next door I stayed for 4 nights at the hotel. My first room 3325 was disaster terrible smell coming from room reception and maid service unable to deal with it opening windows spraying something all to no avail. Moved rooms for the second night all is well. Very slow check-in and very slow if you needed any help from reception they seemed to spend a lot of time talking (and shouting) to each other to be avoided if possible. Maybe its a local way of communicating because the bar staff also spoke and shouted at each other something not often seen in European hotels. The food was excellent including breakfast great selection and fantastic setting. There is a small cafe type place near the front which sells very nice food one particular person I think her name was Naima was especially friendly made me feel very at home well done to her.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Oaq W wrote a review Oct 2017,30,Not moved at movenpick,Stayed at Movenpick Mansour for 5nights and it wasn‚Äôt all that.    A very big hotel so be prepared for the walk from reception to your room in the most part out in the sun. For such a big hotel the rooms were actually not as big as indicated.  Appears more suited for conferences than family breaks.  Buffet meals had a good variety to choose from at breakfast and dinner and the service there was ok though the staff often times appeared overwhelmed.  Housekeeping was quite good and our chamber lady Najal was very prompt and made sure our room was always tidy.  Ordering coffee and cake at the cafe was good but be prepared to wait a while as they might have to go all the way to the restaurant to get the cake.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,ben642016 wrote a review Oct 2017,20,All about fake / Terrible service,Located in the Hivernage district and neighboring the convention center of Marrakech this hotel has in theory a lot to offer for anyone on a business or leisure trip in Marrakech  The reality is totally different: the service is terrible and specifically inefficient extremely slow and light years away from the basics of customer service  The bathrooms in rooms (we tried several rooms after complaints all the same) are wrongly designed so that the water will flood your room rather than going the drain way.  Every single request takes hours to be dealt with probably because of incompetence more than bad will.

I was excited to leave a review here because I was so impressed with the service provided. All the employees at Movenpick are the most friendly and helpful people they are so lovely. There was a day when I was ill and one of the managers of the hotel wanted to know if I and my family were fine we had told him how we were feeling and he immediately assisted us. He took care of us in the lobby and ordered tea and water bottles. We met two managers of the hotel unfortunately I was not able to take their names they were both so approachable and lovely and made sure we were happy with our stay. Everything about the hotel was exceptional and I don‚Äôt give praise lightly. It was clean stylish. The room itself was well equipped and comfortable. The bedroom was very spaciousa and very comfortable. I could go on but suffice to say I was very pleased with my stay and although short and sweet this time I hope to be back for a longer visit in the future. We would also like to say thank you to Amine he really was very caring and always greeted us with a smile. He would always stop and have a conversation with us and the guests. I wish I was able to make a note of all the names of the employees to say thank you.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Sitolakis wrote a review Aug 2017,40,"Clean, comfortable, relaxing",This is a nice hotel well situated with large and clean rooms nearly of luxury standards overall. The swimming pool looked great as well. Breakfast was fine although the young cooks need some more training in order to learn how to make fried eggs properly...    The service at the bar of the hotel was extremely slow.  The concierge assistance for getting a taxi can be very tricky! Pay attention! Make sure that what you are told by the concierge is the same amount you agree with the taxi driver! Otherwise the taxi driver will ask you for the double (of what the concierge told you that you are going to pay).  Anyway the situation with taxi fares in Marrakech is unacceptable/ one of the most negative issues hurting tourism.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,karim_rc wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Great Stay @ Movenpick,We had a great stay here at the Movenpick. To summarise...the location is perfect as you are 10 mins from all the places you want to be: Jemaa El Fna Square Jardin Marjorelle Ben Youssef Mosque the list goes on. The thing we liked most is you were able to be in by hustle and bustle very quickly but equally we in the relaxation of your hotel very quickly. Two people we want to mention in particular are Ayoub in the Jamra bar and grill: looked after us all week nothing was too much for him. Abdelhaq in concierge answered all our questions and organised a couple of trips with no problems. The reason I have rated this 4 not 5 is there a couple of improvements I think could be made and they are only small: show you round the hotel when you arrive and make sure everything was good with your stay when you leave.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karim_rc

The hotel is very big so the walk from our room to the main building was almost a quarter mile but that goes past 3 swimming pools. They do a very nice job with water features throughout the lobby and hotel grounds. It is still in a soft opening stage so staff were inconsistent in their knowledge. No one had a map of the hotel so you had to learn where everything was on your own. The restaurants near the freeform pool were the best nice paninis and salads for lunch. This is a great location for meetings at the adjacent Palais des Congress but it is away from the Medina (maybe a 15 minute walk).,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Columbia, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidandMary82

I loved the Spa and its (free) Saunas and Huge clean Jacuzzi.

So Ms. Nezha in the reception that took the extra mile helping us in a personal matter and dear Mrs. Fatmah who took such a good care of us in her motherly manner during all our breakfasts.

Our room was a good size and very comfortable. I loved the pool area it had really nice loungers and no trouble getting a bed no matter what time you arrive. It's in a good location close to the airport and the medina as well as some good restaurants.  The breakfast was great - lots of options and nice outside area to eat.  The other restaurants were very nice but no one eating there so very quiet! The bar is lovely with a terrace looking over the pool but again there was never anyone there.    The negatives of this hotel fall down to the staff. I did not find them very helpful or accommodating. Trying to order a drink by the pool or in the bar was just hard work and they couldn't understand what we wanted even when pointing to our choice on the menu.  The cafe staff inside were the worst - very very slow and quite rude. The lady overcharged us and when I pointed this out rather than apologizing she tutted.  We also had a problem when we bought water and crisps from the local shop and walked in with a shopping bag. We had 4 members of staff surround us and confiscate the shopping. I understand they want people to spend money on their drinks but I did not appreciate the treatment we had and it was only water!    Overall I thought this was a really beautiful hotel which sadly is being let down by the quite incompetent staff.

The rooms were the same as any other modern 5* star hotels. It did not have any touch of Moroccan art and culture. Breakfast buffet had nice options of hot and cold foods. Pool area always so crowded. Towels were provided in abundance. However the staff members in the reception desk and the main entrance (guards) were not very hospitable. Their expression constantly looked serious and stressed. They did not look approachable at all. On the other hand the other staff especially the one who did our hotel and room tour was very nice and friendly. He made us feel welcomed.

However I am sure that Movenpick would serve well as a base on a leisure and holiday adventure. Food is good in all the restaurants - but still they all lack ambiance - just too sterile. People working there are very nice and friendly - but too much ""manjana"" - the efficiency and expediency of the service is absent for most of the part. People are running around in circles. The hotel is only about 15 minutes from the international airport and it is not far from the city centre where all the restaurants are.

Service to the room was very good though they seem to have a very limited number of irons and ironing boards if like me you need one to try and look smart. Good provision of restaurants and bars though service is pretty slow. This was noticeable in the Medi Terra but food is very good - it is partly in a courtyard which is a nice feature. The Moroccan restaurant was very good as was the poolside restaurant. Staff were very helpful and courteous. There are two large swimming pools and we found a smaller private pool near the Spa which better suited us. Friendly and obliging staff and we left with a very good impression.

The staff were extremely friendly even at the pool they would always ask if we were OK. The hotel itself is sophisticated with a modern take to Moroccan design. It had beautiful water features everywhere so beautiful that you wanted to take a pic of each room. It was a very calm atmosphere mostly couples or business people - but everyone minded their own business. There were no kids there at all when we went which made it more relaxing. The hotel itself is 5-10 minutes away from so many things including the airport. The only thing I will say however is that I probably wouldn't go back to the SPA because even though it was beautiful we chose a 30 minute treatment out of the 30 min or 1 hour but the treatment itself was only 15 minutes. We didn't want to make a big deal out of it but I would have expected a full 30 minutes (as you would). Otherwise I recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jasx8
Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,GCH365 wrote a review May 2017,50,Newly renovated extensive paradise near the city,We stayed at the hotel on our way South over the High Atlas in December and on our way back in January. This is a beautifully renovated hotel with multiple buildings spread out over amazing grounds with pools and greenery and a most extraordinary foyer. Great breakfast and very enthusiastic food & beverage director/deputy hotel manager. Well equipped and appointed rooms. The hotel's Director of Engineering and his team made a huge effort to arrange charging for our Tesla EV at the hotel for free!    The hotel plans to install more permanent electric vehicle (EV) charging arrangements in the underground car park which would be a lot better. Easy to get a bit lost at first in the extensive grounds with multiple buildings and internal layouts also take a bit of getting used to. The lift failed at one point but to be fair the whole site is still on test. A minor design issue with the shower causes water to flow out onto the bathroom floor. A magnificent hotel and certainly our hotel of choice in Marrakech as we travel by EV.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Galway, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GCH365

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,THS2010 wrote a review May 2017,30,Not 5 star,Half through a multi week stay and wishing I could move. It's too bad really it's a nice building to walk into but like many of those the rooms and service don't match the look. After trying several of the restaurants found the food bland at best. The breakfast certainly isn't up to Movenpick standard. The promised 24 hour cafe seems to run out of food in the evening. All in F&B not great.    Service in general misses the mark in that promises just aren't met - I've given up asking to have my room made up early every morning it happens when it happens. The infrastructure is worn the tile floor of the elevator in my building is cracked and dips when you step on it and why do I have it ask for a new key all the time because it stops working (which is really annoying because rooms are in separate buildings away from the lobby). Finally do you have to have the extra-loud outdoor roof top band at night when all I really want to do is sleep?

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Raphael wrote a review May 2017,50,Awesome,We stayed at the M√∂venpick for a week and it was a pleasant experience. The hotel is very well located in between the airport and the city center. The area (H√©ritage) is very clean and organised.    Positives  + we arrived very early and the reception desk showed us the bar took care of our luggage and made our waiting time as comfortable as possible  + the room is very clean well furnished has a huge restroom and a very comfortable bed  + the breakfast buffet offers a wide range of dishes  + we really enjoyed the restaurants the meals taste great. Especially the Medi Terra excellent cuisine!  + the bar/restaurant by the pool (Jamra) was very nice! Tasty snacks homemade ice teas (i highly recommend the rosemarin one) drinks and attentive personell  + the pool boys were very attentive and helpful as well great job!  + The concierge service was very helpful as well. We could easily book two dinners at normally fully booked places and the recommended quad tour was very entertaining (and didn't contain the usual sales pitches which I really appreciated!) I'd highly recommend to book a tour guide with them on your first day to explore the medina!!    Points to work on  - even if we were treated very well it's not comprehensible to me why we couldn't get a room early in the morning as the hotel wasn't fully booked  - some of the personell needs more training. The service has to be on a 5* scale which clearly means that you have to walk the extra mile! As i meantioned before most of the staff we met was very attentive very nice always open for a quick chat and very supportive which we really appreciated. But a few simply ignore you (or the work that involves) which is not acceptable.  - It was a pitty that the rooftop bar wasn't open - I'd really loved to watch the sunset from there. Btw: a humidor with some cigars would be nice. For all of those who love them: they sell cigars right across the street (Ave Muhammed) in the kiosk between the two restaurants)    Overall: great experience nice hotel very well located great restaurants.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,lily100 wrote a review May 2017,30,Service needs work,Huge hotel good decor great pool + excellent breakfasts + lunches.    BUT - after loooong queue to check in I was allocated a poolside room that hadn't been serviced then relocated with minimal apology to an inferior room at the rear of the hotel which suffered loud singing late into the (mid-week) night from a nearby bar. There was no iron + only 1 small bottle of water.    Check out process equally painful - system was down + car that wasn't booked added to the bill.    Staff were friendly + reasonably helpful but these issues mean I can't recommend for business travelers + I imagine there are better options in the price range for tourists too.

Despite the limited choice due to the hotel being full the very helpful young ladies at the main reception Nouhad and Nezha did their outmost to accommodate us in a better room with a view.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,kirstyb655 wrote a review Apr 2017,10,"Beautiful hotel, TERRIBLE service!",I have stayed at other Movenpicks in the past and so I knew the quality of service which you would expect from this chain of hotels. Well my expectations could not have been more wrong.    Don't get me wrong the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very comfortable and clean however the service is diabolical.    Our trouble started on arrival when we were told our room would be available at 3pm and it was not ready until 5pm. When we finally got to our room and started to unpack so that we could get showered and changed for dinner we received a call that we were in the wrong room and would have to move. We were informed that someone would be with us immediately to show us to the correct room but they did not arrive for 40 minutes! In that time we called reception and nobody answered.    The room we were moved to was equally nice but we were woken up three nights in a row by 45 minutes of taxis beeping their horns at people who had come out of the hotel's nightclub. Totally unacceptable especially considering we had paid extra to upgrade our room!    The staff around the pool were generally very nice but it took 45 minutes for an orange juice to arrive and over an hour and a half for our food. Sometimes our order was incorrect and on one occasion totally unpalatable despite having ordered the same dish the day before.    Breakfast is okay but the options are limited and the same every day. The omelettes are very greasy and so raw in the middle I couldn't bare eating it. My partner picked up a stomach bug and we are convinced it is from something he ate at the hotel.    The staff don't seem to understand what is going on. We asked 3 different members of staff what time a restaurant opened and received 3 different answers. On two separate occasions we were sent by the concierge to a restaurant that had closed its kitchen. On the second occasion we actually asked if they were serving food they assured us they were and allowed us to order drinks. When we asked for a food menu they told us the kitchen was closed!    Even when we tried to expain our grievances to reception it was clear the staff member did not truly understand what we were saying and didn't even have the decency to pretend to listen!    It is not in our nature to complain about bad service but this really was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. The only saving grace of this place is the lovely pool. However our holiday would have been far more relaxing if the service had not been a shambles.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstyb655

Unfortunately this is the only good thing in this hotel. Reception staff is unfriendly and we didn't feel welcomed at all ; the lady at the reception even rolled her eyes to heaven because she didn't understand the name of the booking. The service at the pool is very slow and poor ; it takes more than 20 min for your fruit juice to arrive and sometimes you don't even get what you've ordered.  However the worst is the Spa. I had a ''semi permanent gel manicure'' and it took them 3h30 and 4 unsuccessful attempts to paint my nails. The treatment was very painful since they used wooden sticks without any gentleness and even made one of my nail bleed while pushing the stick under it.  To sum up if you plan to only sleep at the hotel and enjoy the pools I would recommend this hotel. Otherwise if you want to eat there (the food at the buffet isn't fresh however the gastronomic is good) or if you want to enjoy spa treatments avoid it.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Geneva, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yubinr2017

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,rd1709 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,"Amazing entrance, beautiful grounds, modern rooms, mixed service",This recently renovated hotel has a beautiful entrance and lobby area with lush well maintained grounds.    The rooms are of a reasonable size and are well maintained with regularly replenished amenities. The hotel breakfast was satisfactory with freshly made eggs/omelettes available however it would have been nice to see a greater variety of fruit on offer.    The hotel is well located 7-10 minutes walk from Menara Mall (and its restaurants) and a 5 minute taxi to the main square in Marrakech.    The hotel has a significant security presence with 10+ security staff visible at any one time. This can be rather confusing especially when you enter the hotel for the first time carrying your luggage yourself after a long flight whilst those who appear like staff members (although are security members) look on disinterested. Additionally the security members aren't very helpful when it comes to hotel related queries either and hence some training of the security staff to give them dual roles would be advised especially when most guests including myself would regard them as ambassadors of the hotel.    Overall an enjoyable stay in a beautiful hotel and I would be more than happy to return in the near future.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rd1709

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Jodie W wrote a review Mar 2017,40,Good hotel!! :-),I had a great stay at this hotel we practically had the entire hotel to ourselves! It was peaceful quiet a nice location close to the city centre but far enough away to feel out of the madness and the spa with the complimentary jacuzzi and steam rooms open until 9pm every night was beautiful and right next to our part of the hotel! The grounds are beautiful the pool is really clean and the staff are happy to do anything for you you just need to ask as they won't approach you asking for drinks at the pool but if you ask them for a snack or a drink whilst you're sunbathing they will go out their way to accommodate you. I felt the prices of the food were a little steep but noticed that in general everywhere half decent in morocco shared the hefty price tag. I feel if the hotel slightly lowered their prices especially the drinks it would encourage more guests to stay in the resort to eat and drink :-)  13 pound for a cocktail and 6 pound for a diet coke is crazy expensive even by London terms!    All in all I loved the hotel it is truly stunning they have a chocolate hour every day from 5-6pm where you can get some free snacks! I also wished more of the restaurants were open but understood the hotel was very quiet so you can't have it every way! The staff seem to be trying lots of different ideas everyday to see what works and what doesn't. We loved the singer in the bar and just the general decor and ambience. The hotel felt very safe and secure!,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/982jodiew

There is a large swimmingpool and several smaller pools placed around the large complex all cosy and we'll kept. The large garden is beautiful and constant being nicely kept by a large garden crew.  We stayed in a superior room on 5th floor with a view of the rooftops of Marrakech on our extensive side and the Atlas mountains in the horizon of the other side - beautiful - the room was well equipped and tasteful decorated.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,SailorMum wrote a review Dec 2016,40,Movenpick Hotel Marrakech,Hotel had excellent gym and swimming pool facilities. Good restaurant for breakfast though I wished they vary the menu - practically same range for two weeks - scrambled eggs Moroccan soup Moroccan harira (ala Singapore Kacang Pool -the Singapore version had mashed kidney beans unlike the Moroccan's which had whole kidney beans) boiled eggs sausage pancakes prata selection of bread and cheese fruits dates. The range of flavored butter was amazing though. There was apricot butter dates butter fig butter - deliciously sweet and creamy - lovely on your bread. Moroccan tea was also served but you had to order from the waiter.    The only snag is that me and some other fellow hotel patrons had problems with our room key cards - my card had to be validated every time before I walked the 200 - 300 m distance from the hotel lobby to my room. Should I forget to validate the key card I would end up not being able to enter my room and had to walk back that distance to the lobby get my card validated and walk back the same distance to my room. But this should be less of an issue if your room is in the same block as the hotel lobby.

Toiletries and tea/coffee are never replaced in room. Had to call and beg for these things every night. Room service leaves door open after service. Some of our staff had people entering their rooms unannounced. My room was near a stairwell which had slamming wooden doors. But I think more than 20 rooms could hear the slamming.    Breakfast was in a mess- coffee never comes never a clean table in sight. Rude staff scolds you for moving tables or asking for new cultery. Also unhygienic practice of giving you used cups when they are lazy to get a new one. Conceirge confiscates unsanitary items before entry to hotel. Be prepared for your bags to be searched after shopping for food and other snacks and then have them impounded by hotel staff. They can't speak English. Be sure you speak Arabic or French. When it's raining there aren't any umbrellas too btw.    Are you here for business? Good luck as there is no printer available you print from the front counter by sending your confidential documents to the hotels inbox for printing.

Movenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi Marrakech,Talampakan wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Mixed feelings,The hotel is beautiful and I mean both the public areas and the rooms. The lobby is quite compelling and there are many spots where one can simply lounge and take in the view. My room was huge and had a balcony large bedroom and spacious bathroom. However there is an issue in the design of the shower cubicle as using the angled shower caused a little flood in the bathroom (other colleagues reported the same adventure).    Housekeeping services need to be improved. When I asked if I could borrow an iron to press my business clothes I was told that they do not lend irons out and that I could send my clothes for laundry service if I wanted.    One evening someone from housekeeping tried to enter my room at 10:00 p.m. to turn my bed down. I received a jolt as someone tried to forcibly open the door that I had double locked. Why they would schedule turning down the beds so late beats me.    Breakfast choices were fantastic and would have pleased anyone. However the staff in the breakfast area will need more training in customer service (we all have our off days but some of them were downright grumpy on certain days).    On my second day as I tried to enter the hotel with some grocery items (I was stocking up for two weeks of intense meetings) I was blocked by security and later told that I was not allowed to bring any food from outside. Other colleagues had their grocery items confiscated.    A few days before I was about to leave I tried to get someone at reception and discovered that no one was at reception. I later learned that they had moved the reception area without telling anyone.    I have been told that this hotel had to open earlier than scheduled due to the conference I was attending. That helped me to understand some of the defects I saw in the hotel. I do hope that they manage to improve the consistency of their service in the coming months.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Nairobi, Kenya",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Talampakan
