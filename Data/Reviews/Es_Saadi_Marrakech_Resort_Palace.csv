Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Mingy127 wrote a review Mar 22,50,Day Pass!,We visited the hotel on a day pass to get some much needed rest and peace away from the main medina. We were greeted by friendly staff and given a choice of sunbeds around two large pools. The hotel is quiet but the staff are attentive when needed. The food that came included in the day pass was delicious and the portion sizes were big. Overall we paid 600 Dirham each for pool access and a three course lunch! We also got some drinks that weren‚Äôt included. Overall a great visit!,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mingylunes
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,WoodpeckerET wrote a review Mar 7,50,Oasis of health and well-being,This was my first stay back in Es Saadi post-pandemic and it was wonderful to say the least. It was great to see familiar faces in good health including Mme. Elizabeth they were happy to see me too and made sure that I felt their hospitality and grace :-)  They worked on their offer during the Covid period. Among the features I greatly appreciated was the gluten-free lactose-free nut-free and allergen-free breakfast table. This was the best of any hotel I've stayed at.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Berlin, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoodpeckerET
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,meldorton wrote a review Mar 2,30,As explained above,We were given the worst room first. Why not give the client th√© room he has reserved  Instead of hoping he will accept an inferior one. Even the one we accepted was immediately below the restaurant so there was a lot of noise at night.

Whether we are there for business or leisure we have such a warm welcome and incredible service. The property is gorgeous with spacious rooms and impeccable touches.

Insisted we pay how embarrassing and cheap. We would never return because of this single act.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Stay729447 wrote a review Feb 2023,10,Palace of extras charges and huge keys from last century,Called prior to coming hotel that I have two children they said no problem you have booked a suite. Paid $400 a night and I have never been bothered by this anywhere in the world. As I checked in at 1 in morning since our flights were delayed by 12 hours. So we were just paying to sleep at this point and really tired. Check in guy said they will charge 1000 mad which is $100 per night for child. I said that‚Äôs ridiculous and eventually stuck in a foreign country and had to swallow my pride.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,BasibLondon wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Luxurious accommodation and hotel,We stayed 8 nights in the largest suite we have ever been in room 2301. The service everywhere was excellent  great breakfast and although we don‚Äôt normally eat in the hotel had a very good meal in Othello Restaurant. The only gripe I had and maybe this is the practice in Morroco is not that the hotel blocked the cost of the room for full stay on my card but they blocked a further ¬£500 from my card against possible extras.. If indeed this is a normal practise then ok but I really object to this as a matter of principle,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BasibLondon

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Jennifer H wrote a review Jan 2023,30,Not what I‚Äôd expect from a place that boasts 5 stars,I booked one night at this place with points knowing I was arriving back into Marrakech from Fes late at night and departing super early for an international flight the next morning (choosing airport convenience and ostensible comfort over charm.) First despite arranging airport transport over a week in advance no one was there to meet me when I arrived. I thankfully have international data and was able to call but it took more than an hour to get picked up. There was only one person at reception (with 3 different check-ins ahead of me) so I waited forever to get my room. Reception was pissy when I explained I was exhausted and tired and wanted things to move faster. Could they not have a second person help at the reservation desk? Room is okay but far from 5-star Lux. No temperature Contol and the room is scorching so only option was sleeping with all windows and patio door open. Queen bed is two twin beds pushed together. Far from the worse place I‚Äôve ever stayed but this is far from my conception of 5-star. Three stars tops.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7072WSjenniferh
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Alex R wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Festive Break in Paradise,We stayed at The Palace over the festive period and we cannot compliment and recommend it highly enough. The driveway into the property gives you an expectancy of grandeur we were not disappointed. The lobby is spectacular and welcoming. The check in was efficient and painless just what was needed after a long day travelling.  Our room was Moroccan spacious clean with spectacular views over the pools gardens and the snow capped Atlas Mountains. The bathroom was spacious and clean with double sinks‚Ä¶large bath‚Ä¶separate toilet cubicle‚Ä¶separate shower cubicle.  The breakfast restaurant was large with both inside and outside seating. There was a varied selection of food for breakfast both hot and cold. The quality of food was excellent with more than enough to quench the biggest of appetites.  The grounds surrounding the hotel were immense and immaculate. The pool area including the restaurants were without fault despite being well used the area never seemed overly busy.  The location is a short 15 minute walk to the bustling Medina with plenty of cheap taxis available should you not want to walk.  The hotels biggest asset is without doubt its staff. Any requests or questions were dealt with professionally confidently efficiently and always with a smile. The staff were always interested in what you had planned for the day and always followed up the next time they saw you to see how your day had been. We‚Äôre confident that the staff were genuinely interested in ensuring we were getting the best from our holiday and specifically the resort.  We are embarrassed to say we can‚Äôt remember everyone‚Äôs name however a special thanks go to the Guest Relations Director Karima Ferg. Her attention to detail ensuring we had the best experience was second to none.  A massive thank you to Karima and all the staff at the Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace your hard work and attention to detail is obvious for all to see.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,David S wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Beautiful hotel within immaculate grounds close to the thriving centre of Marrakesh,We stayed at the Es Saadi Palace. This is a really stunning hotel set in beautiful grounds and with high quality service and spa.    We booked a ksar; eight traditional self-contained two-storey houses in the grounds of the hotel. They have lovely Moroccan decor plenty of space with two double / twin bedrooms both with en-suits fridges and tv's private terraces can be accessed off both bedrooms large enough to dine and sunbath on and a good sized living room and a wonderful butler service. I can't recommend them enough.    We were travelling as a family of four with two children aged 9 and 6. The ksars are perfect for families and the hotel had lots going for it for children including fabulous pools and also a good kids club (in the neighbouring Es Saadi Hotel). Breakfast is great on the terrace overlookign the pools. However be aware that children are not allowed in either of the restaurants in the Es Saadi Palace. Children can eat in one of the restaurants in the neighbouring Es Saadi Hotel but it felt a bit too formal for our kids. We made it work through a combination of room service on our terrace eating at the pool bar at the Es Saadi Hotel (which serves until 6pm) and also eating at local restaurants of which there are a variety at a range of price points within a short walk. You can also walk into the medina within 20-25 mins (or take a short taxi ride) so it's a great location to be on this side of the Hivernage new town area.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sizzler1970

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Katherine G wrote a review Oct 2022,50,An oasis of luxury in Marrakech,I stayed at the Es Saadi Palace last week and it was fabulous!  The suite was beautiful; so comfortable and spacious with its own walk-in wardrobe massive bathroom and balcony overlooking the enormous outdoor pools that are surrounded by the most stunning gardens full of palm and citrus trees. The gardens are so lush and well tended and have all kinds of interesting sculptures and lanterns scattered amongst the vast landscaped areas.  There are two huge pools outside joined by a pool bar and island restaurant in the middle of them with one pool having a slightly warmer water temperature than the other. No children's pool outside but not sure if the indoor pool has that facility - we didn‚Äôt use it as the weather was so warm.  The staff were all so friendly attentive and nothing was too much trouble; amazing customer service at all times.  My friend and I booked this stay at the last minute and I‚Äôm so glad we chose this hotel‚Ä¶.it never felt overcrowded or too busy no waiting for anything ever!  Breakfast is a feast! Everything you could wish for is available and fresh along with a chef to cook eggs to order.  I would definitely love to visit again.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Deb20748 wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Outstanding resort,This hotel is amazing! My thoughts:  1. The staff is so nice and welcoming. They attend to your every need.  2. The hotel is immaculate abd the grounds are do well kept.  3. The pool is very large and the water is cool and refreshing.  4. We had free breakfast each day in our room or on the balcony. The food was outstanding and the service was first class.  5. The room was beyond belief. The room had a massive double sink bathroom with a separate space for the toilet and bidet. There was also a separate shower and a huge tub. They provided Moroccan black soap as well as two body scrubbers. They bed was heavenly and came with a pillow menu.  6. Each night they would come and turn down the bed lay out slippers and bath rugs.  7. Room service was amazing  8. The restaurants offer both local and international cuisine. You can get a burger and fries or lamb tagine they have it all.  9. The lobby is beautiful with a bar.  10. There is a soa and casino. Do yourself a favor a purchase some black soap yo take home.  11. The concierge can help arrange any excursions. If you vgey a guide to go to the Souk you will walk from the hotel about 15 minutes unless you want to pay for a cab. So yourself a favor and pay for the cab if it's hot outside. Also your guide will steer you to a rug shop shoe shop pharmacy and garment maker.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,cee wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Lovely solo visit,From the moment you enter the Palace your needs are seen to in a gracious setting. Beautiful and well maintained the property is a gem from a bygone era. Updates keep the space feeling modern with art adorning the halls while beautiful architecture remains intact.  Everyone was receptive to my needs as a solo traveler but I was also given my space. I would visit again with my partner perhaps not with young children but slightly older children would appreciate the area.  Spa was luxurious and the relaxation room after treatments was a nice respite from  The city.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,champatail wrote a review Jun 2022,50,A fabulous find ‚Ä¶..,My second trip to Marrakech‚Ä¶the first 15 years ago when I stayed in a beautiful riad and this time when I stayed in a pretty double storey villa within the grounds of the Es Saadi.  The hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport and within walking distance of the medina.  I requested a car from the hotel to meet me at the airport ‚Ä¶ ¬£20.00 and well worth it.  The villa was spotless and extremely well serviced and kitted out ‚Ä¶ a great hairdryer (with nozzle - very important!) and lovely oils etc for the shower. Bed linen was excellent.  The staff were extremely polite and helpful.  The buffet breakfast was super ‚Ä¶ so much choice ‚Ä¶ and it was great to be able to eat outside. I had two grandchildren with me ‚Ä¶ ages 5 and 6 ‚Ä¶ and they made good use of the extensive food available.  The pool was absolutely fabulous ‚Ä¶ a beautiful shape and huge. Although we went in half term there were no other young children until the last day and then still only a handful.  The only criticism I have would be the pigeon population around the pool and restaurant at breakfast. They were everywhere and their mess landed on me three times - disgusting. I really think the problem needs addressing urgently as it spoils what is otherwise a superb getaway.,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/champatail

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Natalie L wrote a review May 2022,40,Beautiful hotel,I had a fantastic stay at Ed Saadi Palace. Check in was fantastic with mint tea and pastries. The staff were all excellent throughout my one night stay. My junior suite was massive and very comfortable. I appreciated the amenities from a selection of bath oils to a free mini bar. A word of advice is to not leave your balcony door open as I did as bird will enter and peck through the covered film of the pastries - albeit very amusing. The only issue I had was sound issues - I think I was staying below a staff cleaning quarters so there was a lot of banging noise at times.    I didn‚Äôt get to explore some of the restaurants and casino as they were closed on my visit I assume to covid restrictions but was told they will be open again from May.    The spa was fantastic. I had some issues with trying to pre-book treatments as my emails and website messages were never acknowledged. However the spa staff were very accommodating and although fully booked fitted me in for a facial and massage. The treatments were heavenly so although on the pricy side were worth it. The pool was cute and there are also several sauna rooms you can access as a guest at the palace.    The pool was magnificent. However the chairs were very dated and it‚Äôs hard to find a space. I went to grab a towel and was treated like a criminal trying to use the pool. I get that they need to check that you are a palace guest and not from the hotel but the staff were very rude. There‚Äôs no  Pool side service so you need to walk to the pool restaurant to order drinks and food. The cocktails were very watered down and my ¬£20 club sandwich was dry - the fries were very nice though!    I would recommend this hotel but they definitely need to improve the pool area. Apart from that I had a fantastic stay.,Date of stay: March 2022,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieL848
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Joanne R wrote a review May 2022,40,"Overall, relaxing and peaceful - but there is room for improvement in some areas","My husband and I stayed at the Es Saadi Palace for 11-nights from 1st May 2022. We had a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the gardens.    The things we liked about the Palace are as follows:  * Free airport transfers were included in our package with a quality vehicle and a helpful driver.  * The hotel was calm and peaceful inside and outside.  * The location is good - about a 20-minute walk to the Koutoubia Mosque and Jemaa el Fnaa Square and about a 12-minute walk to Churchill's favoured Mamounia Hotel and the Menara Mall where the Carrefour sells wine and a whole host of other food products.  * Although we only had the standard room (a Junior Suite) it was large and comfortable with a 6ft bed fridge kettle (but bring you own tea and instant coffee unless you are happy using the expresso machine in the room) separate sitting area a balcony adequate air con a safe plenty of storage (in fact a separate dressing room) and a large bathroom with a corner bath 2 wash basins a separate shower and a separate toilet and bidet.  * The gardens are beautiful and the gardeners work hard to maintain them. It is worth trying to get into the gardens around 07:30 - 08:00 just to enjoy the peace and quiet before other guests arrive to sit around the pool.  * The public areas inside the hotel are faultlessly clean and well maintained.  * Breakfast is good albeit sometimes food runs out towards closing time (10:30 and 11:00 at weekends) and the service can be a bit ""hit and miss"" - we were lucky to be spotted and served coffee most mornings by waiter Hamid who never seemed to stop working and is an fine example of what consistent and good service looks like.  * There is a regular and efficient turn-down service around 18:30-19:00 when towels are replaced if necessary and bottled water is also replaced in the room.  * Although the next-door Casino is open until 05:00 in the morning and is busy throughout the night there is absolutely no disturbance for guests in rooms situated at the back of the building overlooking the gardens and pools.    The key things we did not like about the Palace are as follows:  * The balcony in our room was NOT swept daily by housekeeping and bird droppings sat there for days.  * The pool area / seating require daily or twice daily washing and wiping down to remove previous-day guest debris and bird droppings. This area was NOT well maintained or cleaned overnight / early morning when we stayed at the Palace and quite often I had to wipe down the sun lounger cushions and clear paper & plastic bottles from the previous days before I could comfortably sit down. There was little or no assistance from staff.  * The driveway to the Palace was littered in several places with bird droppings which stayed there throughout our stay - a bad impression on arrival / departure from the Palace.  * The cost of eating at the Palace is disproportionately high in all venues. Around the Pool Bar a burger is about ¬£25 a Club sandwich about ¬£24 cocktails about ¬£13 and a glass of local wine about ¬£10. In the 2 restaurants (Italian 'Othello' and Moroccan 'La Cour des Lions') prices are approx. double to what you would pay in a good restaurant in the city. In several occasions we would have liked to have eaten and / or have had a drink at the Palace but were put off by the prices.  * The Palace does not have a list of preferred taxi drivers - unless you pay for a private vehicle you have to go outside the gates and haggle yourself with local taxi drivers in yellow cabs who tend to make up the prices at whim and often have trouble finding your desired venue as they have no maps or navigators. It can be a nightmare getting an honest and reliable cab driver who doesn't overcharge and who takes you to where you want to go. You have to 'brace yourself' and be prepared to barter on the price (normally around 50MAD / ¬£5 for anywhere within a 2 / 3 mile radius of the Palace).",Date of stay: May 2022,,"Weybridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joanner128

No disappointment there to the contrary - a very large beautifully decorated suite. overlooking a lush park with large swimming pools (one is heated). A bunch of 30 lovely roses as a hello from the management.  Breakfast in the garden leaves no wishes open. The park with very exquisit plants and flowers invites you for a long stroll.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Lisa wrote a review Nov 2021,30,Not the best choice for Marrakech,Spent a week at the Es Saadi Palace for a first trip to Marrakech.    The room (a superior suite) was v nice - lots of space huge bed exotic bathroom. Terrace overlooking the pool.  The poolside is wonderful- large heated pool great option on sun loungers super poolside service.  Full marks for the spa‚Ä¶possibly the best massage ever!    On the downside - we were not told on booking (only.a week in advance!) that all the Palace hotel restaurants were closed.  And the overall service is simply not 5 star. Spent a week arguing the lack of fast track airport service which the hotel recommended (finally was reimbursed- definitely don‚Äôt book!)  The conciergerie lacked local knowledge on the best restaurants to try- recommendations were all tourist places we found the best by ourselves.  Service is very mixed‚Ä¶some amazing staff (the female manager in the Lagoon restaurant was always brilliant); elsewhere not so good (many times requests for coffee etc simply not understood or ignored)    Overall sense that you had to push for the services needed rather than this being a 5 star experience.    Overall disappointing.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Sylliana wrote a review Nov 2021,30,Very nice room and amenities but disappointing in some aspects,We stayed here for three nights to relax after some busy days of travel excursions.    Room: we had a junior suite in the palace. The room was impeccable! Very spacious and cosy. The bed was big and the sheets were very good. We enjoyed the big balcony. The bathroom was amazing. Overall incredible room.    Service: The level of service was not always on point for an expensive resort like this. We have stayed at resorts in other parts in the world for the same price were they almost never made errors or lacked in service.    We had a waiter forgetting an order at breakfast we had a disappointing experience in the restaurant in es saadi hotel. Breakfast buffet was sometimes empty because someone from the villas had ordered the last pieces of fruit in the bowl. Eggs were just laying there with no info or boiler nearby so you expect them to be boiled eggs which they were not.  All in all these are small things but i don't expect these things to happen in a resort like this with higher standards.    Pool bar: The pool bar drinks and snacks were average which is again disappointing for the price you pay. They also charged us double for two milkshakes which we dit not notice at the time but saw when we already paid for our bill...    In room dining: we had in room dining one evening and the food was very good! Service for in room dining was also a lot better.    Location: You can go on foot to neary restaurants and gardens or even the mall but its not nearby any other touristic spots. We expected this so this is not a big issue. Just keep this in mind if you want to visit the center of the medina during your stay here.    Amenities: the spa is wonderfull but not as big as we expected. There are some sauna rooms but one of them did not work. The tree in the main pool area is very beautifull and i recommend coming here in the evening when the lights turn on.  The outside pool is big and there is a lot of space around the pool. The usual rules apply for taking spots: they put their key of towel on the beds.    Overall: We won't come back here any time soon. We felt like this was not worth the money we paid.,Date of stay: October 2021,,Belgium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sylliana

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Patrick wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Very relaxing stay in Marrakech,Great hotel from the off welcomed with Moroccon tea and a personal welcome to the hotel and its amenities the hotel strikes you as you walked through the door with a beautifully ornate grand entrance our room was not ready when arrived ( we were early so no issue) they let us get changed in the spa  don a couple of robes and we were straight in the Spa for an hour  it was great peaceful warm relaxing and the various steam rooms and saunas especially the herbal ones felt great for the body. The place is clean and all day everyday people were cleaning  polishing  wiping down  this maybe as a result of the current global virus issue but the hotel is immaculate if I were to make one suggestion here I would have the glass to the Spa cleaned from the outside regularly as nature resides a lot in the trees!!! We went to our room which was very large and comfortable and wonderfully Moroccan in style  clean and well presented with a great view over the expansive pools.breakfast was wide and varied and very good shame a couple of birds manage to sneak in the morning to steal from the nuts and dried fruit stand. Be wary the birds know exactly what they are doing and if you leave your room window open they will come inside and nick your food. Pool area is calm and relaxing and they are many spots to either stay in the crowd or away from it which for us is great as we don‚Äôt have kids one pool is heated 27 degrees and the other natural 17 degrees during spring the later not being for the faint hearted it feels very cold I am sure it‚Äôs great in the summer restaurants are varied and great and the food is also of great quality which I guess is reflected in the London restaurant prices ( (average price per meal ¬£100 with a glass of wine or two). Spa treatments were nice and the ambience and area is professional and clean  a massage will cost you around ¬£150. With other treatments similarly priced. Staff were Courteous and friendly and smiley which was nice each morning and do their jobs well on the whole in summary a beautiful hotel set in wonderful grounds in a bustling city  we loved our time there and enjoyed our holiday greatly Advice be prepared to have a decent holiday spend budget to really enjoy what this hotel offers,Date of stay: March 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelstacked

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,imlauralau wrote a review Nov 2019,50,"Stop searching, book this hotel now.",Currently I'm staying in the hotel & all I can tell that Es Saadi is magic.    The main thing that Es Saadi stands out from other incredible hotels worldwide - it's the service. Hands down the best hospitality you could find. From the minute you walk-in everything is taking care of in the highest level.    I was planning to only come to SPA (which you probably know is one of the best SPA's there is in the world) but ended up booking a room and this was the best decision. Saad Head of Concierge went extra mile to make me feel like at home. He is a true gem in this hotel friendly professional & knows how to do his job very well. Also not forget to mention Khatima from the reception who quickly found me the room & escorted me upstairs.    The room is very spacious beautiful & luxurious. The bed is extremely comfortable the amenities are high quality the tub in the bathroom is perfect and the balcony had a lovely view over the pool. I am in love with the amenities & fresh roses that I found here.    It is my last night in Marrakesh & I'm already planning when I could go back - only to stay in this resort.

This is a very modern hotel with all the amenities. The staff that we interacted with were very professional and helpful. The common areas....e.g. lobby and pool area are very beautiful and clean. I especially liked the lobby bar where I enjoyed a martini or two....always accompanied with great munchies.    The breakfast buffet was outstanding....I think the best of any hotel that we stayed in during our tour of Morocco. Our room was fairly spacious with a sitting area and a nice balcony overlooking the pool area. The bed was very comfortable the bathroom was clean and had a nice shower although one oddity was the narrowness of the tub.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,ASB71 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Incredible stay,This really is a gem of a hotel. There are many luxurious hotels in Marrakech all of them are beautiful but what sets the Es Saadi apart from the others is the feeling of being welcomed into the family which own and run the hotel. It is decorated superbly with so many little touches which together has created the most beautiful space. It even has its own art gallery - family owned pieces on display it truly is beautiful. We met the very elegant Madame Bauchet who greeted us with such genuine warmth and her son Jean-Alexandre who now runs the hotel and has created one of the worlds best nightclubs we found him friendly engaging and welcoming. The concierge team helped us with restaurant reservations guides to the Medina and nothing was too much trouble. We were unlucky to have one of our bags go missing from the flight they couldn't help us enough in recovering luckily the next day. The room had the most beautiful four posted bed with muslin curtains so romantic. The room was huge as was the very well appointed bathroom. Some of the staff told us the hotel was at full occupancy but at no point did it feel that way there were enough staff on hand for ordering drinks or food either at the bar inside the hotel or at the pool side (there are 2 pools) that it felt they were there for servicing us alone. The hotel and its beautiful grounds have a calming peaceful atmosphere. We were lucky enough to be shown one of the several villas you can stay in which are again so beautifully decorated. All in all this was an incredible trip I honestly cannot think of anything negative about the hotel or any of its wonderful staff. I cannot wait to return.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,SJThomas1 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Best Hotel In Marrakech,Marrakech is without doubt my most favourite city in the world. And the Es Saadi Palace is my favourite hotel in Marrakech. There is a special magic that happens at a family owed hotel. Even one at the hight of the five star catagory. And that is care! Care for the guests care for the team that work there care for the little things that the large corporate hotels take for granted. You can tell that the family that own this hotel are very proud of the hotel and what they have achieved and this is mirrored by the staff.  The service in the Es Saadi Palace is second to none. Nothing is too much trouble and the team are happy to assist with your every need. The hotel its self is very well kept and exceptionally clean. The rooms are very spacious and very comfortable. The Spa is incredible with a team to match. Forgive me for forgeting your names but the guys that run the pool bar remembered me from 4 years ago!!! amazing!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Helen B wrote a review Oct 2019,10,Do not trust their staff!,We stayed at Es Saadi Palace this week. It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel with all the luxurious amenities. What we found disappointing though was dishonesty of their staff. We were provided misguiding information on a few occasions by their workers at the reception and sightseeing desk. The way they do it is they tell you everything you want to hear in order to sell you something or impose it on you. Then they try to charge you for their misguided information that was initially offered as a free service or less priced. The interesting thing is their reaction. They pretend that they either never provided that information or you misunderstood it ( however it‚Äôs not the case because you would clarify it a few times). So be careful with everything you are told and if possible record the conversations when it comes to payments of significant amounts. Otherwise you might find the bill for something you never used or planned to pay for or buy a tour that doesn‚Äôt include everything you were promised at the beginning. The worst thing is that with a smile on their faces and apologies they will make you feel and look like an idiot üòâ,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J4617ZVhelenb

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Daniel P wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Visiting Marrakech in style,"Prior to visiting I was somewhat skeptical about our stay at this ""Palace"" but my concerns were immediately assuaged upon entering the establishment.    The resort is an opulent mix of old world charm new age convenience.  My one ""must do"" recommendation is to try the indoor spa pool. Lay back in the water ensure your ears are submerged and prepare for a surprise.  After experiencing this don't ruin the surprise for anyone else!    We ventured out for most of our meals but we did have breakfast and on a couple of occasions dinner. The food is authentically Moroccan and there is lots of it.  This resort is a little pricey but you deserve it. The staff are really friendly and go out of their way to help they guys who served breakfast were excellent!  At the end there was a mix up with our car to the airport and the hotel arranged a free drop off.  If you visit Morocco and you can afford a little luxury this is the place to stay.",Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielFPope

Large clean pool with nice green park around. Sunbeds can be well separated from other guests due to the large area.  Rooms are very nice and comfortable (we had a Junior Suite) with large and very nice Maroccain style bathroom and toilettries.  Staff is perfect and looking for our comfort and really provides the 5 star feeling not only the facilities.  SPA is also very nice ...

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,187Kelly wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Amazing Stay!,July 5th-8th    We came for a weekend at the beginning of July . We were greeted and taken from the airport by the Hotel driver . Only 15 min away the Es Saadi Palace is stunning. A very grand and beautiful lobby with a bar and lots of seating areas.  As we were early we were shown to the pool restaurant where we had coffee whilst waiting for our room . It was certainly worth the wait. We had booked a Deluxe Suite and we were not disappointed. It was amazing . Devided in two our suite was beautifully furnished and had a king size bed and a beautiful big bathroom and on the other side a large living area with table and chairs and a seating area with sofas . Our son was with us too and there was plenty of room for another bed in the lounge.There was also 2 dressing /luggage rooms  a kitchen area and another toilet. Our suite was overlooking the pool and gardens and had a double balcony with loungers and a table and chairs.  All staff from Reception especially Mohsine to Housekeeping Bar staff  the staff at Breakfast and the restaurant plus the guys at the pool bar were all courteous friendly and very professional.  On our first night we went to the Moroccan restaurant. Which had beautiful views overlooking the pool and gardens.  Impeccable charming service and our meal was delicious. We opted for the beef tagine and the slow cooked lamb (for 2 ).  Breakfast each morning was a delight lovely fresh food and omelettes and eggs cooked to order .  We also chose to have lunch in the restaurant each day which was also very good .  Overall we loved our stay at the Es Saadi Palace and would love to return.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187Kelly

Our previous 6 nights had been spent in a Riad in the M√©dina a kasbah in the mountains night under canvas and a Riad in Ait Ben Haddou. The service provided at these surpassed the Palace by far.

The staff at the Palace were bordering on rude (reception) friendly (Moroccan restaurant) and at times slowwwwwww.  Our room was lovely don‚Äôt quite get the welcome of one cake when there‚Äôs 2 of you though!  Pool area and spa excellent.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Christopher M wrote a review May 2019,30,Should Not Be Your First Choice,The El Saadi is a large hotel adjacent to a casino and villas all part of the complex. It‚Äôs about a 20-minute walk from the main hotel to the market and souks. They have a lovely pool that is heated and spa facilities and the rooms are pretty typical of a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù hotel; however that‚Äôs where things end. Their hotel does offer some respite from the stench of the main market and the souks. They do offer a few news programs in English hair dryers and decent towels. The first room they put us in was right above the main entrance and adjacent to the road so it was very noisy. We asked to be moved to a quieter room a request they took with some umbrage; however they told us they would comply the next morning. Upon returning from an excursion to the Atlas Mountains they had indeed moved us ‚Äì two floors directly above where our original room was located where it was just as noisy. One did get the feeling that this may have been an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù thing though that‚Äôs the only time we felt that our entire two weeks touring in Morocco. I would not stay at the El Saadi again as there are other luxury hotels on the same street where the staff may be more friendly.

We certainly found it at Es Saadi Palace Resort. It was avsimply beautiful stay. Staff were lovely gardens perfection service great breakfast wonderful - all in all a great stay. The pools looked very inviting although we did not indulge. We did however spend sometime in the Spa with massages and hair treatments which were lovely. No complaints here. Free private transfer to the Airport a bonus and the driver even assisted us with our luggage from the carpark directly to the entrance of the Departure hall at the Airport with a smile even though our bags weighed a ton. Truly could not fault this esatablishment at all. Only tiny thing to comment on was the soundproofing between rooms.

Brilliant location - walkable to central square of Marrakesh through Koutoubia Park easily navigable due to it having a very tall minaret. Area of hotel is far away enough from hustle and bustle to be peaceful though. Upmarket area of Marrakesh - Hivernage. Staff spoke English and French fluently.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Vik2409 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,"(for palace) Great Location, gardens, carefully crafted property, attentive staff",Important: The review is for Palace which is very different from the hotel itself.  (+) Location is top draw Gardens solitude SPA  (+) Rooms - Exquisitely hand crafted individually. Be warned if you are looking for flawless factory cut perfection in every piece of wood tile metal work etc. it is not the place for you. The detail/minor imperfections are the signature of the craftsman.  (+) Staff - discreet but attentive to your needs very helpful especially when my son was a bit unwell; I was sent a doctor and one of the staff offered traditional warm drink. Almost everyone at breakfast (next day) and around the hotel asked my son about his health. He felt really good with a sense of wonder how everyone knew he was not well. Mohammed at concierge was really proactive in suggesting and finding the right trips.  (+) Variety of Restaurants in the Palace Hotel and within 10min walk  (+) Overall package on offer at Palace is good.    ...Well already gave 5stars but i loved the place and can't resist sharing some constructive suggestions (not criticisms) that i normally don't bother with anywhere else. It is such a beautiful place I just want it to keep up with the best in its class; so we can enjoy for ever.  (-) The Egg station (at breakfast) - Everyone needs an egg and the queues and wait spoils the holiday feel of a relaxed bfast (unbecoming of a 5* holiday). Copy the process from a business hotel (Hilton) if you want to do it this way but then you have so much staff around go the Shangri La way.  (-) For a property of this kind with heavy French influence my expectations were sky high with food; however the creativity on the menu/dishes/taste can go a notch up. AT this price point one can go to south of France and they will blow your mind with creativity. Similar in London  (-) Check-In: The longest checkin for a hotel of this class we have ever had and two other guests said that to us too. reference again - Shangri_LA cos your property is in same class. When we stay at top end Shangri LA; the driver radios the hotel when we start from airport checkin staff is at the door of the car with the room key in hand and walks us straight to the room. My family loves that. No waiting time at all (after long journey that is heavenly). At the palace it will greatly help the experience.  (-) The guides (not hotel employees) - i heard from other guests as well. though knowledgeable but have ulterior motives i.e. showing you the shops than the sites (perhaps get commissions). The downside is you get quoted unbelievable prices with those guides :) compared to when you go to shops on your own. Best to charge a little more money and shorten the list of guides you get. Tell them only take us shopping if we request that.    I think the leaders of the hotel may benefit from a three day trip to a Shangri La in similar location. The experience you are offering is similar but small touches in food customer experience will ensure you keep the customers for ever. You have the people location buildings and very creative leadership to match. We highly recommend spending some holiday time here.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vik2409

We booked two executive suits which were adjoining. Perfect rooms well equipped serviced twice a day. Very nice pool side area with plenty of places to watch the day go by. A really very good hotel....so what would make it perfect? Really only very small things: perhaps a more varied menu available in the evenings in the restaurants. There were plenty of excellent dining options but perhaps something a little more casual with more western choices? These are provided for lunch but close in the evenings.

I am delighted to report that it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.    The room was very spacious - a duplex suite with a nice sitting area and a terrace.    The swimming pool was spectacular - the main pool being around 100m long. OK it's a bit chilly at this time of year but great for swimming my daily kilometre (and there's a smaller heated pool to keep children happy).    Internet access was excellent being fast and reasonably reliable.    But the best thing was the friendliness of the staff. Everyone was cheerful and helpful without being in any way intrusive.    My only reservation would be the quality of the in-house restaurants is a bit disappointing - particularly the Italian Othello restaurant. But there are some very good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel so there's plenty of choice.    All in all a truly wonderful holiday.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Punzer26 wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Lovely time at the Palace,We are a family of 4 (kids aged 13 and 9) based in London and were in need of a sunny break.    We really enjoyed our time at Es Saadi. The guys on the front door were especially welcoming whisking our kids off in a golf buggy for a tour of the resort whilst we checked in. Thumbs up from the kids - good start.    We stayed in a Ksar which was lovely. Like a large 2 storey apartment with more than enough space for us all (and plenty of storage). There were lovely terraces on both floors.    We were lucky enough to have wonderful weather and so spent most of our downtime around the pool. Great attendants there - they jump to find you beds/ mini-cabanas/ shade/sun/umbrellas as soon as you arrive and despite being there in UK school holidays there was never a shortage of any of these facilities whatever time we arrived.    At the Palace one of the pools was heated to 25 degrees whilst the other was unheated. Our kids spent most of the time in the former as the latter was still a bit chilly but it was the start of April so I expect it would be glorious by next month.    The guys serving around the pool were delightful. A little haphazard at times for a ‚Äú5*hotel‚Äù but really friendly utterly charming and very good with kids. (Special mention to Ashraf!)We ate lunch at the pool bar 4 times and whilst the menu is fairly limited it was nice.    We ate in the cor de lion - very nice good food beautiful views but quite formal. Also ate in the Ed Saadi restaurant in the actual hotel which we found to be atmosphere-less. We also had room service which was efficient and actually delicious - the ksar is big enough to properly sit down as a family for a 2 course meal.    We ate out on our final night and enjoyed the wander around wishing we had done that more in the evenings - there are lots of nice bars around the area.    All in all we had a great time - it‚Äôs good for kids. The shaded playpark for little ones and table tennis for older ones is right by the pool so it‚Äôs possible to read a book with one eye on the kids for hours on end. We also used the well-maintained tennis court everyday.    We had one drink at the Hotel pool but it looked very busy at that small pool and we were very glad that we had booked the Palace.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Punzer26
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Saarika R wrote a review Apr 2019,10,Es Saadi resort (NOT Palace)... terrible 1 star service...WOULD NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO STAY,Please be warned ...some of the reviews on this stream are meant for the Es Saadi Palace and not the resort attached to the Palace. This is a review for the resort.    Es Saadi Resort has been listed as a 5 star resort which is why we booked it. We received nothing short of a 1 star service at this resort. The manager (Mustafa) and the majority of staff (Marium and many of the breakfast staff) were rude did not speak good English and only interacted with guests who were fluent in French.  1.) Day 1 - our booking was messed up. We booked a double room and received a twin bed room. It took 1h30mins for them to fix (they kept us waiting in the twin room with no update of what was going on after a long journey). When I went down after an hour and fifteen minutes to see if it was fixed Marium told me they were fully booked quite rudely! To be honest I was supposed to be one those bookings!  2.) Day 2 - first day at breakfast. Staff who spoke fluently in French and not English didn't give us the time of day (this was most of the breakfast staff). We are strict vegetarians and there were no labels on any of the foods. We couldn't tell what was meat and what was vegetarian. It would be a struggle for those who have allergies!  Breakfast staff seemed to be in their own world of rushing past you to do things just not the 5 star service I expected. Even when the collected finished plates from our table they would push passed your hands very quickly and forcefully dropping pastry crumbs from your plates all over your lap! Certainly not 5 star.  3.) Evening of Day 2 - Came back from a privately booked tour of the Atlas mountains had an amazing day just wanted a shower. The water came out cold then came out brown with a distinctive smell I jumped out and told my husband to grab my phone we took photos as proof and one video. Please see attached. When we showed Mustapha (the manager) he didn't apologise and just told us we were the only people in the hotel who experienced it. Not 5 star service. He asked us if the problem had been fixed (not sure how I was supposed to know if it had fully been fixed but clear water came out 5 mins later to which my new husband and I had quick showers in fear of more of the brown stuff coming out). He said he would send someone to look at it whilst we were out for dinner.  I also mentioned our breakfast problem at this point - he did nothing to help resolve the issue (even the next day before we saw him for breakfast).  4.) Came back from dinner we asked reception (Samira) if it had been done she told us no and that now she would send maintenance (!). We had been out for 3 hours by this point and there seemed to be no urgency in resolving what could have been a serious sewage type of issue.  5.) Maintenance finally came and said our shower head needed to be replaced and left. We assumed he would come back and change it - NO ONE EVER DID FOR THE REST OF OUR TRIP we even fell asleep waiting! Again not a 5 star service.  6.) We were offered no compensation no complimentary drink at the bar not even a measly 10% off a drink at the bar or even an apology! Terrible for a 5 star.    Kamal head of concierge who we met on our last day was nice and Salima who was at breakfast on the second to last day was nice spoke good english and helped me figure out what I could and could not eat.    Mustapha ignored us for the remainder of our stay every time we saw him. This is not 5 star service.    Terrible service certainly not 5 star as promised on your website. Thoroughly disappointed unfortunately. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON STAYING HERE...Spend a few bucks more and go to the Novotel or Sofitel which are closely and only a little but more money.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,goron59 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Good but a number of minor issues,We stayed in a corner suite 3101 on the first floor in the palace part of the resort.    The entrance to the palace is basically the entrance to the casino with the hotel entrance off to the left. It does make you wonder where you are going especially as the ‚Äúhotel *****‚Äù is around the other side of the block.    Our suite had a large living space an outside terrace a small kitchen area closet large bathroom and a bedroom.    Other rooms on this floor are much smaller with living/sleeping rooms and no kitchen.    The kitchen has a fridge filled with soft drinks a kettle Nespresso machine and a sink.    The living room has a dining table for four a writing desk and lounge sitting for up to six comfortably.    Now the minor issues.    There was no milk and we had to ask for it but it was left in a jug so it went off spectacularly within a day. The fridge and Nespresso pods were not replenished even though other things (like bathroom shower gels etc) were replenished.    The TV in the living room didn‚Äôt work but the one in the bedroom did. The TV opportunities here are pretty dire though so no big deal.    But why aren‚Äôt these things checked? I don‚Äôt book a nice suite in a decent hotel only to have to spend each day chasing housekeeping and maintenance.    Fortunately the WiFi here is pretty good so you can get all the TV and news you need on your own devices. The TV that did work lets you cast from your mobile device too that‚Äôs good.    Our terrace views were off a tennis court some maintenance area and the highway. The grounds of the resort are quite nice so it‚Äôs a pity we didn‚Äôt get to see any of it.    Nice things:    The staff are very friendly and generally quite helpful when you do engage them.  Breakfast is so-so but included in price so no real complaints there.  It was a bit chilly when we stayed but you could breakfast outside if you wanted.    Spa:    We didn‚Äôt use many of the spa facilities but the pool area was nice as were the various steam rooms/saunas etc. Very relaxing.    Other:    We used the Egyptan Bar (lobby bar) and the Cour du Lions Moroccan restaurant. I‚Äôll cover those in different reviews but the food and drink options are limited in the bar (and room service).    Alcohol is VERY expensive but there are two Carrefour supermarkets nearby where bought some basic provisions and made use of the fridge. Beer/wine is actually not that expensive in Marrakech even compared to the UK.    Overall a pleasant and relaxing stay.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goron59

Hotel was OK. Hotel room was on 3rd floor facing. the street. You had to choose either to be hot with the patio door closed or cool and not sleep due to the street noise (rain motorcycles people horses...). Room always smelled like cigarette or cigar smoke.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Koogs wrote a review Mar 2019,50,"A couple quirks, but still one of the best",We've traveled all over the world even stayed in six hotels on this Morocco trip!    The Es Salado hotel is one of the nicest hotels in many ways:    The staff greets you in a traditional Moroccan outfit white head to toe sporting a dagger in his belt. They offer Moroccan tea and some cookies while you wait.    Lobby and hotel interior is incredible majestic. High ceilings elaborate tile walls and stone & marble everywhere. Looks like the set of a movie. Everywhere you look there are comfortable couches and seating areas that invite you to relax.    Exterior grounds feature beautiful green gardens tall palm trees and an amazing pool.    The room is huge. Stone tile floor raised ceiling and a beautiful bathroom featuring a large tub very large shower with rain fixture and a separate toilet space. Also there you'll find a towel-warming rack! The room even offers a large walk-in closet. The whole thing is very spacious and has a balcony overlooking the gardens.    The quirks we encountered were:  A rushed and confusing check in process where the quickly processed our group but then we were ignored an left in our own to find our room. This wouldn't normally be a problem but to get to our room (on the third floor) we had to take a elevator to the first floor (reception was in Look Level 0) walk down a hall take a separate elevator to a different third floor. It was confusing and there was no way we would have found it on our own especially with no directional signage. After we tried and failed we retired to reception and requested assistance. Just be sure to ask for assistance at check in.    Enjoy your trip!

We were more than happy to be told on arrival that we had been upgraded from a Junior Suite to a private villa with Butler! From the moment we were picked up at the airport in a beautiful air conditioned e class mercedes with cold water and and a hot towel the resort and staff could do nothing more to make our stay more pleasant.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Clare M wrote a review Jan 2019,40,A nice hotel but we are unlikely to return,We stayed here over New Year. The hotel is lovely with a good breakfast (waiting for eggs could be a random event - sometimes they were raw and sometimes overcooked). Some of the staff were incredibly helpful and polite. The pool was good too and big. We also used the tennis court which is worth booking when you arrive if you want sociable hours. We were disappointed with a couple of things; room service could be a bit random although mainly very good. Unfortunately one of our children was given a hat as a new year's gift by the hotel which we tried to exchange for some leather slippers that the rest of us received as the hat was too small. Unfortunately the hotel kept the hat and told us they would get back to us....we're still waiting. The hotel is walking distance (just) to the centre which we did several times. We are a fit family so it wasn't a problem for us - but a 20 minute walk plus. We enjoyed our first visit to Marrakech and will leave with loads of memories.    However the worst thing was that I had food poisoning there which we reported to the hotel with no action at all. I barely ate for two days and lots 3-4kg so it was vicious. This was following the outrageously priced New Year's banquet dinner so a double disappointment. It was the following morning that I was ill and hadn't eaten outside of the hotel since so must have been within the hotel. We were amazed by the hotel's lack of action given the severity of my illness and I basically lost 2 days of the holiday out of a week. Not good. Thus my comment that we are unlikely to return.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gerrards Cross, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18ClareM

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,HBT wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Grumpy and unprofessional staff,The resort is located a few minutes from the city center. the resort hosts several buildings labeled as Hotel palace villa and so on. I stayed in the palace and I loved the suite that was assigned to me. it was a very comfortable spacious and classic suite with a big balcony.    I have been to many 5 star hotels but I have never seen one like this one. As I arrived at the palace I was able to check in quickly. I was given some forms to sign; yet I was never informed of my breakfast location nor given any further instructions about the hotel. it seemed a busy day. for this reason one concierge was given the task of accompanying me along with other clients. since my room was before the other client's room the concierge dropped my luggage and left without bothering to show me around ( this is the 5-star treatment that I always get in other hotels).    The majority of the staff are unbearable and rude. From the day I entered the palace until the last day most of them were very grumpy and they seemed as if they were doing a favor to their clients. They were very unprofessional and not trained to work in a five-star hotel.    Both the staff at the reception and the breakfast staff assumed that everybody could speak and understand French. All the time I asked something in English the staff always responded in French.    The funny part of my experience was that the more I spoke English the more the breakfast staff got upset.    I have had the chance to use one of their conference room as well. It was really dated and the air conditioning system did not work properly.    Although my experience with most of the staff was stressful there is one particular staff ( concierge Hicham ) that made my stay better. He smiled continuously and helped me calm down.    a beautiful Resort with grumpy and unprofessional staff has no value.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hodab999

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Joseph Traveller wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Incredible attention to detail. Perfect.,"Our two night stay at the Es Saadi Palace was quite frankly by far the best hotel stay we have had in Morocco (and we have travelled a lot in Morocco over many years). We found the staff to be utterly professional and clearly very well managed. The magical thing about staying here is that one benefits from all the advantages of a premium class 5* de-luxe palace hotel whilst enjoying an intimate atmosphere more often found in smaller boutique hotels. As a family of 2 adults and 4 children we could not have chosen better as the kids LOVED gardens and pool we all thoroughly enjoyed the absolute luxury of our Ksar Suite with 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and a delightful sitting room with private terrace and garden. The butler service worked beautifully. Abdou was always on call and quickly delivered breakfast sun downer drinks snacks and even first aid when we needed it. We ate one night in the Moroccan restaurant ""Coeur des Lions"" which was AMAZING. The second night we dined at the Gastronomic French restaurant at the sister Es Saadi hotel on the other side of the beautiful manicured gardens. What amazing food and great selection of Moroccan and French wines. The cocktail bar at the Palace makes a great Thai Daikirai but the way!  We were ad to leave today but most definitely will be back with more family and friends.

We stayed at the Palace and were quite literally blown away by its magnificence. Rooms were incredible staff very friendly and the extra attention to detail was what made it 5*. For example staff noting we had tea for breakfast and then hand delivering a box of tea to our room one afternoon! Helping us with excursions. And setting us up with a private dining area in the grounds so we could enjoy a romantic evening together. The restaurants at the Palace are fantastic - the Moroccan restaurant on the roof has the best tagines but the Italian (Othello) knocked us off our feet - 5* dining at its best with a menu that rivalled the finest we‚Äôve experienced around the world.

The hotel has a very good location where it‚Äôs not in he middle of Medina but is close enough to even walk or just a short taxi ride away. The junior suites are spacious and traditionally furnished - one feels immediately at ease there. The higher category rooms are even bigger so this is an excellent choice for one that requires a bit more space. The service is good and the garden is beautiful. It is really a nice oasis in Marrakech if one wants an option to stay out of Medina and very reasonably priced too. One thing is that the pool although beautiful is always quite cold. ))) there is a Spa are and very nice indoor wellness area - I can imagine it should also be very nice in winter months. We are spoiled travelers who only take the best but in Marrakech we love this place and won‚Äôt need to go to our usual four seasons - this hotel is excellent for the money one pays and is more authentic.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Ana C wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Complete rip off - Scam after Scam.,We have no words to describe this hotel-resort... but we will try: fraud and really bad experience. I will start with the booking process... they advertise it as a 5* resort with some nice pools and infrastructure all the photos and comments they provide correspond to the ‚ÄúEs Saadi Palace‚Äù -which is not what you are actually booking. So since they think it is ok to mix them both my review will also be of both hotels. Once you get to the hotel you have a worn down building that would not even get 3* in the 60s; dirty walls prison-grade bathroom sticky carpets cleaning-product smelling shampoo/lotion. The whole installations (both of the ‚Äúhotel‚Äù and the ‚Äúpalace‚Äù) are covered with flies... just nasty!  The pools again... horrible experience. To get a towel in the advertised pool you‚Äôve got to pay 500MAD per person per day the staff of both the pool and reception (‚ÄúPalace‚Äù) have the worst condescending attitude looking down to guest and making extremely rude comments. They aggressively laugh at your face... this is NOT a 5* treatment the whole treatment is just dreadful.  The SPA... after paying +1200MAD per person most of the steam rooms were not working again... no advise.  The bar another nightmare you‚Äôre either completely ignored by the staff (Palace) or they serve you a drink of a much lower quality (Hotel) than the ordered and they still pretend to charge you 240MAD per glass (when not even the full bottle is 150MAD) - note that they don‚Äôt inform you of the change on the product until after it‚Äôs poured and served! you only notice if you actually know your champagne! We clearly refused to accept/pay for it.  The taxis they arrange for you also a fraud! Extremely pushy drivers and very old cars for gold prices (I guess aligned with the whole philosophy of the resort). They took us to places we didn‚Äôt ask for (random shop in the middle of nowhere) and then pretended us to pay for that.  Every segment of the day (morning afternoon evening) you are jumped with a new unpleasant surprise. From having to pay ridiculous prices for basic services ill-mannered staff (with a few exceptions like the room cleaning lady/guy) to shattered rooms rusted bathrooms patched lobby...  The 1* of this rank is given to the bed (quite comfortable) and the grounds of the ‚ÄúPalace‚Äù (which would be very nice if you get rid of all the staff).  Conclusion: bad bad bad we would NEVER come back.,Date of stay: June 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N6716NUanac

It was nice to leave the busy city behind and relax at the resort. The gardens were beautiful and the staff was super friendly we even had a driver who showed us to our villa. The Berber Villa was everything we wanted and had a lot of privacy. We also booked a massage at the palace spa best massage we ever had!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Roderick H wrote a review May 2018,50,Emphasis on Moroccan art - and Gambling,We had a Junior Suite at the Palace very clean and spacious with views (in clear weather) of the Atlas Mountains in the distance. The hotel staff are welcoming and helpful.  Examples of Moroccan art can be seen on every wall and corridor.. Some is surprisingly challenging for a Muslim country but it all shows the energy and optimism (and sense of fun) of young artists in the country. The grounds are well maintained and the pool area is extensive. The sister hotel is more conventional and its grounds much more limited.  Between the two is the original casino in Marrakesh. On the day we were leaving both hotels were filling up with poker players. Even so there was no intrusion on the calm and quiet of the Palace and its grounds. The concierge staff were very efficient.  We did not use the Spa but I used the gym which was up to a good standard.  Others have commented about breakfast service. We found the food to be of high quality and the coffee good and hot served promptly.  Getting to the main sites in the old town is best done by taxi at an agreed price - easily arranged and not expensive by Western standards.  Overall we were very happy with the hotel.,Date of stay: May 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roderickh32

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Anaisboo75 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Very nice overall but could be improved,Pros:  Nice Moroccan style hotel; grounds & swimming pool are pretty well maintained; complimentary transfer from hotel is very welcoming; most of the staff are nice and do their best; very nice bathroom; good breakfast; not a 5 star palace for sure (but we obviously can‚Äôt expect it to be at the level of the Mamounia) but an overall nice place for sure.    Cons:  Was there for a birthday & had organized a couple of surprises: 2 emails and they still forgot... room was not as described on pictures when I booked the room (6months in advance) way simpler (definitely not as richly decorated as on the pictures) and far from the swimming pool view we were promised. Dinner at the Cours des Lions was disappointing: food definitely not as good as Gastro type they pretend to be and they remembered (in extremis) after we finished our tea and desert about the birthday cake... The cake was delicious though! We did appreciate it as it was also complimentary and that is a nice gesture.  Young woman at the reception was totally helpless couldn‚Äôt answer any of our very simple questions (taxis distance to Majorelle gardens etc) and this for every single day (we decided to go to the concierge instead very efficient).

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,shelrahrah wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Overall a great stay with some quirks,We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and although I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a 5 star resort by any means it‚Äôs a great place with attentive staff that really tries to give luxury accommodations.  Pros-  Safety: This place was a bit on the outskirts. It‚Äôs also gated with security.  Location: close to the airport and a 40 minute walk into the Medina which we did regularly (rarely took a taxi in a lot of traffic). It was also close to super nice restaurants and clubs  Getting a taxi is super easy. They greeters call the taxis over and set a fixed price with the driver and you so you don‚Äôt have to be weary of that awkward taxi interaction.  The grounds are beautiful. The pool and garden areas were superb.  Cons-  Rooms were a little run down. It seems like an older building but you can tell that they do try to make it the best experience.  Service at breakfast was questionable. We had to wave down the servers multiple times just to get coffee almost every day.  Restaurant and excursion prices are steep. They are good but you could get most of that outside for the resort and it‚Äôd be 1/3 of the cost. There were times we craved convenience over price and other times we didn‚Äôt.  There wasn‚Äôt a lot of Moroccan charm if you are looking for that stay at a riad.    Overall a great place to stay. Like I said it was a little run down and at times trying to hard to be more luxury than what it‚Äôs capable of. Wouldn‚Äôt call it a 5 Star but definitely nice.,Date of stay: April 2018,,"Salt Lake City, Utah",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelrahrah

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,bluejules2020 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Lovely hotel with beautiful pool & gardens.,We had a lovely stay in this beautiful hotel but it's not quite as good as other 5 star hotels we've stayed in. The main areas of the palace were beautiful and the gardens and pool area were superb there were just a few tiny niggles that make it not quite right as a 5 star hotel in our view...    We stayed 5 nights in a Ksar villa which worked well for us as a family of 4 (travellers with young families may need to check the suitability though as the twin room was upstairs with an open staircase and no door leading into it). Generally the Ksar was nice although it was a bit 'tired' with some damp patches and slightly odd 'conference centre' chairs. Complimentary mini bar with soft drinks and pastries each afternoon was nice. We felt it was reasonable value for money for a hotel of this quality.    Housekeeping had an uncanny knack of waiting until we returned to our villa in the evenings between 6-7pm to ask if they could come and service it - slightly odd timing given most guests would have left the pool area at 6pm or would have returned at that time to get ready to go out for the evening.    Breakfast was good a reasonable choice with eggs cooked to order. The waiting staff though seemed overrun with no obvious process or system in place things regularly seemed to be spilled or slopped everywhere. They could also do with sorting out the birds that live in the dining room regularly flying down to help themselves to cake from the buffet table - after the first day we learned only to go for items that were under cover...    We ate in both the palace restaurants which were nice and the food was good but atmosphere was lacking in both and whilst convenient they're not value for money. We found much nicer places to eat out locally and in the old town.    The spa area was lovely with great service and really nice treatments on a slightly cooler day an afternoon spent in the indoor pool and steam rooms was very welcome. The pool area was also lovely and the heated pool was very welcome the larger pool was too cold to use during our stay (being unheated) but I suspect it would be lovely in the summer when it's warmer.    Despite all of the niggles Es Saadi was very convenient rooms are good value and it's somewhere we would definitely return to.,Date of stay: April 2018,,Buckinghamshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluejules2020
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,sbaig wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Looks great on the outside,First time in Marrakech and we decided to play it safe and stay outside the medina hence chose the Essaadi Palace for its convenient location to Jema El Fana and souks. The three of us stayed for 5 nights in one of their Ksar. The lobby and common areas are spectacular very well maintained and clean. You are totally mesmerized by the grandeur colors and smells. This creates an expectation for the finest however that‚Äôs not quite the case or at least was not for us.    Pros:  - Ksar was huge it had 2 levels with 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms 2 living areas 1 terrace and 1 patio. Enough space for a family of 4 and more.  - Nice bathroom amenities  - Mini bar was restocked daily with water juice and soft drinks (complimentary)  - Complimentary sweets left in the ksar by housekeeping  - Friendly staff  - Location is very convenient to get to souks    Cons:  - Rooms not so well maintained. There is wear and tear. The day we checked in we realized two out of three bathroom sinks were not draining well. They tried to fix both one even started to leak so we left it at that and just used the working one the whole time.  - The AC on the second floor did not work three out of the five nights. We complained after the second night but no one came to check till we complained again in evening it was finally fixed after the third night.  - Sketchy service at breakfast. Some days the service during was impeccable and some days it was not so great. Also birds fly inside the breakfast area and settle down on open food. They do try to keep things covered but not everything is.  - Limited restaurant choice on property    We ate at their Moroccan restaurant Cours De Lions two nights. Limited menu but the food was good yet overpriced. One night we ate at the Es Saadi Hotel restaurant and that was decent food service there was great.

We also had a great view of the pool from our balcony which was the perfect place to watch the sun set. I also can't forget to mention the delicious food from the room service menu (the lamb tagine was to die for) and the delicious buffet breakfast served each morning. The resort is really just so so beautiful from the hotel lobby to the pool and garden area through to the rooms. I loved Es Saadi and hope to return one day. Highly recommend staying here when visiting Marrakech!,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traviella

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Seagull2005 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,ES SAADI OASIS OF OPULENCE,When a hotel uses words like refinement unique sumptuous exquisite distinguished contemporary ultimate and exotic in its marketing brochures your expectations are high. Many don‚Äôt deliver on promises but The Palace in the Es Saadi Gardens and Resort possibly could have used even more superlatives. I loved my time her in the heart of Hivernage. A few days was not enough! The grand lobby began my impression as did the heartfelt welcome of a staff so obviously trained in the specifics of treating guests as family. Looking around the lobby the first thing I saw was an abundance of green and blue. I was taught the colors of green and blue should never be seen together; yet in the lobby lounge bar area fireside where you can relax in a space of refinement and contentment with a gin and tonic or Moroccan tea the combination of these two colors in tiles fabrics and soft furnishings are as warm and inviting as a Berber welcome to the Sahara.    There are three floors of generous-size rooms all with balconies that look over the Palace's gardens of palms citrus and lush lawn surrounding an over-sized swimming pool with its novel architecture of bridges that take you to the central Island Bar where one drink usually becomes two because of the friendly persuasions of the bar waiter. Children will love this pool. With your balcony doors wide open you can lie in bed and look out toward the snow-peaked Atlas Mountains. I did this one morning and somehow my morning became my afternoon. My reward was a peace and calm I‚Äôd forgotten how to taste because of the white noise of my busy life.    Each floor of The Palace has a different color theme. Ruby Red. Majorelle Blue. Fresh Mint Green. I stayed on the red floor. The walls of the wide passageway leading to rooms are adorned with modern vibrant art from all over Africa. A gallery exists with even more art of the first floor and is well worth your time. Each suite has its own unique majestic entrance of beautiful hand-carved or hand-painted doors made from reclaimed cedar with intricate exquisite designs adorned with raised three dimensional brass carvings and embellishments of camel bone and lacquer-aged to produce an antique appearance. Large knockers give the doors a Moorish touch. Even before entering my room the word opulent hardly seems enough!    Once inside my room everything was as the marketing brochure had promised. Extras like full bar fridge of water and soft drinks espresso machine with coffee capsules vases full of stunning roses a plate of decadent sweets a bowl of fresh fruits and in the bathroom black soap and scrub mitts was a signal that this hotel was big on small details.    A substantial breakfast fir for royalty was included in my package. I ate it in the garden but just as easily it could have been delivered to my room. All manner of breads decadent cakes (I particularly loved the mini-cheesecakes) pancakes and pastries as well as freshly squeezed juices a cooked breakfast of my choosing and the best coffee began another great day in Marrakech. This accommodation is perfect for the solo traveler a couple celebrating a honeymoon or special anniversary or for a family holiday. I hope I can find many reasons to return to this accommodation.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seagull2005

A family owned resort that the likes of Leo Di Caprio has visited.. who are we to judge when they have put the family have put their heart and soul into this hotel and resort!    We stayed at the Palace and what an apt name this was everything a Palace should be the service impeccable and the rooms traditionally gorgeous. I have nothing bad to say about the beautiful place only that no matter how much time you have there you will be sad to leave.    The staff make you feel like family and the location and buildings make you feel like you are a Prince or Princess. The Spa is something I have never experienced and Ive seen a lot of Spas in my time but this is something else surrounding an old tree respecting nature and a nod to the merge of city life and wildlife wild birds soar through the skies as you sip chilled drinks on you sun lounger admiring the lagoon the biggest in Marrakech and also this hotel was the location where they filmed 'The Night Manager' so all you film buffs out there this ones for you..    I have no comments or concern just that as soon as I get the chance ill be back!!!

Well worth the extra to have more space everywhere.The service and friendliness are unsurpassed. Unsurprisingly the big pool is called 'the Lagoon' 20C smaller heated pool 26C. Proper mattressed Sunbeds. Breakfast very good mixture of buffet and table service.  Quibbles? Of course. Two Restaurants very upmarket Morrocan in The Palace and an upmarket French in the Hotel.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Michael-Traveller-JP wrote a review Apr 2017,50,First impressions are not always right,Driving to the Es Saadi we passed the Sofitel where many luxury cars were parked and which looks impressive from the outside and arrived at our hotel which looked rather run down in comparison. Bad choice we thought. But we were proven wrong.    The inside looks like a luxury hotel with the ambiance of an Arab palace. The decor of the rooms is more classical Italian but nice. They are very large not only our suite but also the regular rooms. Everything was in working order. W-LAN is free and very fast. Excellent housekeeping. A few nice suprises here and there that are signs of good hospitality.    Service varies depending on the wait staff. The wait for the food around the pool can be quite long at times. Service during breakfast is spotty too and some of the staff. ould be a bit more friendly. On the other hand dinner service at the excellent Cour de Lions is very good. Same applies to El Saadi at the Saadi Hotel.    The Spa is large and nice with a lot of different Sauna options. And the pool is very large as well and nicely laid out.    All in all we had a very enjoyable stay. If you are looking for an Arab style grand hotel in walking distance to the main square but with a spacious resort feeling the El Saadi Palace ranks among the top choices in Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael-Traveller-JP
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Howard B wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Could be better,Went for a long weekend and these would be our key observations    Positives    - lovely large clean pool with no chemicals  - nice large rooms but missing coffee and tea  - gardens are well kept relaxing with lots of shade if need it  - nice Moroccan restaurant had excellent meal  - Hotel location good as can walk in to the old part if want to but not too noisy at night    Negatives    - no drinks on arrival a miss for first impressions ....left hanging about to process passports and credit cards    - breakfast fairly basic in choice and random process to be seated or not. Seems staff have to rush in and out of building to get everything making service ineffective    - gym was very warm and air conditioning not working    - main gripe was the food and drinks service around the pool. Had to wait 30 mins for drinks to arrive having to order twice. Next day went to order directly from the bar and still 15 mins to get drinks. Lots of staff with headphones but shocking service. Again having staff run over bridges to get back to the bar a poor design if want better service. No one asked us for a drink while we sat round the pool for 3 days.    - managers in suits stroll around looking like FBI agents but don't seem to notice the obvious frustrations of the customers    In summary it is a nice hotel let down by poor service outside not helped by poor design layout with staff having to walk too far to get a spoon glass or anything you might need.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Macclesfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowardB918

The reason is that even though smoking is not allowed they still allowed it which is not only disgusting but a disservice to the other diners. 2 different tables had smokers.

Situated in the heart of Marrakech The Palace is in a perfect location as you‚Äôre close to anything you may need during your stay. And as part of the Es Saadi Resort the Clefs d‚ÄôOr Concierge service is happy to assist guests with anything they may need whether small or detailed.    I had the privilege of spending a night at The Palace which was one of the most luxurious experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Upon arrival I felt like royalty as I gazed upon the beautiful grounds of the property. Filled with luscious greenery and gardens The Palace brings Moroccan influence to the forefront.    The staff was incredibly helpful and super friendly. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a warmer welcome when I checked-in and I really felt comfortable.    I stayed in a junior suite which was intimate and cozy. The suite even had a rivate terrace which provided a spectacular view of the Atlas Mountains. The terrace was furnished which made sitting and enjoying the sights comfortable.    My booking allowed me unlimited access to the Oriental Thermae a detoxifying array of different baths and a truly unique experience. From differed steam baths to an ice fountain to a sauna and other spa chambers the music colors and scents of the Orient take relaxation to a new level.    The bathroom featured real marble which really added an air of sophistication and luxury. I enjoyed a refreshing soak in the tub and then made myself comfortable in the king-size bed. Probably the best night sleep I‚Äôve gotten in a long time!    I loved the included breakfast in the morning as the buffet was filled with delicious pastries and other hot/cold offerings.

Breakfasts in the morning are delicious every day. The hotel really takes care of its guests from larger requests to the small things like making sure you have a glass of water and a cookie next to your bed every night. All this within a very convenient distance to the bustling nightlife clubs and casinos as well as the busy markets and old Medina of Marrakech so that you can still have the true Morrocan experience and see both sides of this wonderful city.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,LondonUpandaway wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Very Nice Hotel with a few quirks,We have stayed in Riads in the heart of the Medina in previous trips to Marrakesh so this was a different experience. Obviously the grounds were more spacious the rooms airier  the pool much bigger than anything you would find in side the walled city. All of that was very nice and Es Saadi Resort is well placed among a number of the top end hotels and perhaps slightly better value for the money. On the down side we were about a 15 minute walk to Jamaa el Fnaa. We loved the Es Saadi location when we were going out of town to play golf but found it less appealing when we wanted to spend the day in the Medina. For anyone who has been to the Marrakesh Medina it is a daunting and exhausting experience. On those days we wished we were in a charming Riad within 5 minutes of our wanderings...usually carrying bags or even a rug.  But that is not a negative about Es Saadi which was an oasis when we finally made it back. The Staff were friendly and helpful which was useful since we had an electrical problem and lost lights for several hours.,Date of stay: March 2016,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonUpandaway

My email confirmation stated the reservation was confirmed at the Es Saadi Palace but when we arrived they said our reservation was for the other hotel. After waiting several hours while Cancelon and the hotel discussed the situation they took us to our room. I specifically asked if I had to pay any more money. They assured me all was fine and I did not owe anything. At this moment I am trying to check out and they will not allow us to leave because they want us to pay alot more money.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"East Berlin, Connecticut",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaureenBen

The main building itself is a memorial of architecture with a very nice garden and a swimming pool that it takes your breath away.  But the biggest value is it's people.

Not one detail was spared in decoration accommodation cleanliness etc. The minute we walked into the room I was taken aback by the size and luxury of the space.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Jonny G wrote a review Apr 2016,50,"Luxurious Palace with beautiful gardens, walkable to Medina",We stayed in the Palace in a corner suite which was more like an apartment. Unique rooms and decor which you'll be familiar with if you saw BBC's 'The Night Manager'.  Food and drinks expensive but you're paying for the surroundings and excellent service. If you want a quick and dirty meal then Extrablatt is 3 minutes walk around the corner.  You can walk to The Medina in 20 minutes with plenty of other hotels and bars on the way if you need a pit stop but the cabs were only 50dirhams in any case.  There's a cash point in the lobby offering decent exchange rates.  This is an excellent hotel providing a quiet and calm oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.

Absolutely everything has been thought of. On Arrival we were seated in the lobby and offered mint tea and Moroccan cookies. It is a lovely property and well maintained.    The staff was nice courteous and helpful. It is a lovely property and well maintained.  We were very happy with the quality of the room was excellent possibly one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in. Spacious and the quality of the furnishings were excellent; lovely soft sheets towels and bathrobes (felt new). We loved the bathroom with large bath and rain shower with marble bench. Also included a great range of shower gels shampoo body scrub etc.    In terms of food breakfast was very good. They served a few traditional Moroccan dishes fresh fruit pastries etc. We ordered room service because we were trying to wind down after such a long flight my fianc√© and I loved the lamb tagine but everything else was disappointing - limited choices and food not up to the mark (what you would expect from a high end hotel like this) and it was very expensive.    On our second day we woke up to a flooded bathroom. The bidet was spewing water everywhere when we woke up. They managed to get it fixed fairly quickly and the staff was helpful.    One of the highlights of this trip for my better half was the gym. Very modern and was equipped with everything he needed.    We spent both nights in the Egyptian Bar where we met an extremely kind and welcoming bartender name Youssef. He and his boss made us specialty drinks and conversed with us for hours about Morocco and gave us great tips!    We wanted to have a night out to visit a well-known restaurant within the Medina. Concierge called us a taxi and told us that the restaurant was a 15 min. walk from where the driver could drop us and that the driver would walk us. Once we got in the taxi the driver started showing us other restaurants on the way. He said it wasn‚Äôt safe to walk at night (we found out later in the week that we were very safe to walk around at 9 pm and did it for our last few days). Long story short after going back to Es Saadi he told the concierge that he was taking us to a different restaurant that was closer. This restaurant is a place where Taxi drivers get commission for bringing in patrons and the food was not great. The concierge was actually surprised that he took us there as this was not the place he was told we were going to.    All in all the staff should be aware of shady taxi drivers especially those that they call upon for the hotels patrons.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/200shanip

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,WDime19 wrote a review Feb 2016,20,Be warned stay away.....,We visited Marrakesh in Feb 16 after reading most of the reviews here we decided on the Es Saddi Palace and Gardens.  We expected this hotel to be one of the better ones in Marrakesh as it was to cost over ‚Ç¨4000 for a one week stay.    On Arrival we were seated in the lobby and offered mint tea the lobby seemed quite dated and some of the seating is grubby and not up to 5 star stadard. We were upgraded to the Ksar suites which was a nice surprise as they were very spacious (as you would expect if you paid the advertised price of ‚Ç¨10000!!)    We ate dinner in the hotels gourmet restaurant on the Tuesday night and found it very disappointing and overpriced. The service was extremely poor and most of the dishes arrived at the table cold. The guest beside us an elderly gentleman from England was extremely upset by the way he was being treated and how he was being ignored after waiting over an hour for his dinner. It came out cold and he had to send it back. The waitress also insisted that you must order your desert at the beginning of the meal otherwise you can‚Äôt get desert. this was also clearly written on the menu‚Ä¶.Bizarre requirement in a 5 star hotel restaurant.    We ate lunch most days in the Palace restaurant and found the staff were lovely and couldn‚Äôt do enough to help you. Just don‚Äôt order a bowl of plain pasta for a child as you will be charge ‚Ç¨19.    My biggest complaint about this hotel is the reception staff and the Concierge.  We were checking out on our last day and our transportation was outside ready to take us to the Airport. We could not locate one of our room keys  so we asked the staff to check the room as we were sure we had left it behind. They insisted that we empty all of our suitcases to look for the key before we could leave. We searched our cases as best you can in a hotel luggage area we also took great care checking all of the children‚Äôs hand luggage. I promised the concierge that I would post the key back to him if it turned up in one of our cases when we arrived home. When we said we couldn‚Äôt find it the Concierge said we must pay 1200 Dhirams (approx. ‚Ç¨120) . I at this point asked to speak to the manager.  I found this extremely unusual that a hotel would look for such an extortionate amount of money for a lost key. I understand it had a fancy key ring (which I am sure you could get in any Souk for under ‚Ç¨5) .  We were not allowed leave the hotel and they refused to let us load our suitcases into our waiting taxi until we paid 1200 Dhirams (aprox ‚Ç¨120).  When I insisted on taking my suitcases I was physically prevented by doing so as one of the porters tried to drag the cases back. Eventually the manager came out to speak with me just as I had finally managed to get my cases to the front door.  She basically accused us of stealing the room key as the concierge kept repeating ‚Äúyou have the key you have the key‚Äù .  I had just spent over 57000 Dhirams (‚Ç¨5700)in their hotel‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.why would I steal a key that would be no use to me!!!!    They eventually allowed us to leave on the promise we would post the key back if we found it. On our return the key turned up in a childs coat pocket buried at the bottom of a suitcase. We have since posted it back.    For reception staff of a 5 star Hotel to detain a family with small children in this way against their will while running the risk of them missing their flight and causing them great distress would lead to instant dismissal in any western country.

We went with our young son and wanted to go to the casino so the hotel arranged a babysitter on two occasions for us and both times they sent lovely ladies. We stayed in a garden duplex and the room was again probably the best hotel room I've ever stayed in.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Andrew V wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Luxurious & Peaceful,I took my wife and 4month old baby to the Es Saadi Palace for some winter sun in early December for 8 nights. It was very quiet with what seemed only a handful of other guests. Overall we were very happy with our stay and will definitely consider returning.    The room:  We were given a substantial upgrade to a deluxe duplex suite and we were very happy with the quality of the room was excellent possibly one of the best rooms we have ever stayed in. Spacious and the quality of the furnishings was excellent; lovely soft sheets towels and bathrobes (felt new). We loved the bathroom with large bath and rain shower with marble bench. Also included a great range of shower gels shampoo body scrub etc.    The hotel:  Nicely decorated with a traditional feel and a nice atmosphere. The grounds are large luscious and very green and a nice place to have a walk with the baby. Some nice market style boutiques are located within these grounds if you want to purchase gifts/ souvenirs. A very high level of security can make you feel at ease when inside but will also mean you can get an overly intimate frisk search if you return from a walk outside the hotel.    The staff:  Very friendly and helpful always greeted with a friendly and welcoming approach by all within the resort except the front entrance security.    The food and drinks:    Breakfast was always a buffet with freshly cooked egg options available. Whilst it was not a large selection mainly due to how quiet the hotel was but there was still many options and it was always nicely presented. I think the content of the breakfast depended on the occupancy at the time    For dinner the hotel has two main restaurants fro dinner the expensive cours de lions restaurant in the palace and the more reasonable french restaurant I forget the name in the hotel part. We ate dinner twice at both restaurants and had excellent food and service in both except the french restaurant feels dated. I should add the quality of the meat is excellent.    Lunches were always eaten in the Palace restaurant by the pool which was very expensive by comparison to the dinner but the quality of the food and service was always excellent.    Pool Area:  They have a smaller outside heated pool 28c and a massive unheated one. the main pool area is stunning with a central bar island. perfect place to relax catch some sun and have a swim. They made some awesome drinks especially their kiwichitos.    The Spa:  the palace has its own internal spa and then an oriental spa within the hotel. the spa within the palace is without a doubt the most expensive spa I have ever been to and when i say been toi mean looked at the prices and thought no chance of going there at all. Decided to use the other option oriental spa in the hotel part as was more reasonably priced about half the price of the other but that felt dated and the walk between the two locations meant we didn't go more than once.    Overall Cost:  This is the most expensive hotel/ resort we have ever stayed. We did a full room and board and only ate out once and food drinks tax bill came to just over ¬£300 per day for us. However everything was of a 5* quality and when you pay c.¬£20 for a club sandwich and more for a burger you expect it to be very very good and it was. So be warned it is massively expensive horrifically so when you consider the price of restaurants in the town BUT if you want to be pampered and you are not watching what you are spending then you cant help but love it.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642andrewv

As tired as we were the foyer was breathtaking.  The following day We spent a couple of hours just exploring the hotel and grounds and enjoying the beautiful pool area. The gardens are beautifully maintained with masses of roses and orange trees.  Where else would you find a gym with chandeliers.  Delicious cakes and fresh fruit were in our room together with complimentary bottled water.  Our suite was extensive including a walk in closet lounges balcony and a large modern bathroom strewn with rose petals.  An amazing place to regenerate before exploring morocco so take time to enjoy the facilities.  Free wifi and pillow menu is available.  The hotel spa is a luxury In beautiful surroundings that should not be missed.  The indoor pool built around an ancient eucalypt tree is a wonderful sight.  Service while always polite is in the restaurant is slightly less than you'd expect in a hotel of its class.

The hotel was absolutely superb and helpful with everything from directions to lending us things we had forgotten (adapter etc).

Pillow menu two cleans a day with turndown service water in the room each evening etc. Breakfast was great.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Robert B wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Very peaceful with excellent rooms but ice cold pool,The rooms were definitely 5 star and compare better than other 5 star hotels we have stayed at in Marrakech. The reception on arrival is perfunctory and could be more informative but you sense immediately an overwhelmingly peaceful atmosphere. The bar can seat 150 but there was only 4 of us there in the evenings. The Hotel (A walk across the gardens from the Palace) is run down and not worth the visit which leaves evening meals a problem since there is only one restaurant in the Palace serving Moroccan food - most 5 stars include a choice of restaurants within the hotel. The main issue is the temperature of the pool water which is not warm enough to describe as heated. Overall a good experience with the room the highlight - with warmer pool water this would be the perfect place for 'recharging the batteries',Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertbD2225EC

It is not conveniently located as there is a really high end mall about 15 minutes walk away and the other older parts are about 20 to 30 minutes walk away.

The location is perfect only 10 mins from the airport and a few minutes drive from the Medina and shopping areas. Service is excellent! Food and amenities are superb especially the spa which is well appointed. However on my trip the rain showers were not working. The Casino is well worth a visit especially the al fresco dining section where the food is excellent. The nightclub has to be experienced even midweek it was a great atmosphere.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Oilpatchmike wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Great stay. Totally relaxing from start to finish.,‚Ä¢ We live in Morocco and visit Marrakech 3-4 times a year so we know what to expect for our money. I had looked at Es Saadi before but never stayed due to some bad reviews on Booking.com and TripAdvisor. I felt it necessary to write a thorough review after seeing the several negative reviews of this resort.  ‚Ä¢ For those that won‚Äôt read this entire review I can only say that the Es Saadi exceeded our expectations and then some. We will definitely return.  ‚Ä¢ I know that people like to complain about high drink and food prices at hotels including this one. All I can say is that prices for drinks and eating at the hotel were reasonable considering the environment you are staying in and the service you are getting.  ‚Ä¢ It was a fantastic stay from the time we arrived until we left. We paid ~$290/nt for our junior suite and I have to say that for our experience it was worth every cent. I have also stayed in La Mamounia in Marrakech for twice the cost and in my opinion the Es Saadi was a better experience. The pool and garden are magnificent. The resort is not ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù or ‚Äúnot kept up‚Äù as some reviews seem to imply.  ‚Ä¢ We walked in every part of the Palace interior and the d√©cor and fixtures are in excellent condition. Everything was very clean and freshly painted.  ‚Ä¢ Every member of the staff was 100% professional and as courteous as I have ever encountered anywhere in my travels. We were treated like royalty from our arrival at the front door until we were shown to our car at check-out.  ‚Ä¢ Our room was a junior suite of 75m2 (750 ft2) with a garden view. Large marble bath with 2 sinks shower garden tub and a separate changing room. A bedroom/salon area with a very comfortable full king bed with a sofa and table/chair for eating. Nice terrace with room for a chaise and 2 chairs with a great view of the pool area and the mountains beyond.  ‚Ä¢ The pool is huge and the area around the pool is beautiful and well kept. There is an island bar in the middle of the pool for drinks and sandwiches.  ‚Ä¢ The garden has a great walkway among some big trees and flowers that passes by the villas. A nice 20 minute stroll over to the Es Saadi Hotel pool area.  ‚Ä¢ Breakfast offerings were good with great service and a view of the pool.  ‚Ä¢ We had dinner on the terrace at the Couer de Lion Moroccan restaurant. Great service and view and the food met our expectations. Cost for 2 with wine was <$70.  ‚Ä¢ Also had dinner at the Es Saadi Hotel restaurant Restaurant Gatronomique. A nice varied menu and the food and service were again excellent. ~$70.  ‚Ä¢ The Egyptian bar in the Palace had a piano player at night but the bar at the Hotel was more open and lighted and close to the pool. It also had a piano player and singer at night.  ‚Ä¢ The casino is very small but enjoyable. We didn‚Äôt try the Theatro disco.  ‚Ä¢ Full massage treatment for 2 hrs. at the Palace spa and the personnel could not have been nicer. There are also at least 7-8 separate small rooms (3-5 people) with different types of steam and sauna.  Cons  The spa had a large selection of steam and sauna rooms but I was puzzled why they do not have a Jacuzzi.  No coffee maker in room.  Need more chaise lounges around the pool. They fill up fairly quickly.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Mohammedia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oilpatchmike

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Lorna R wrote a review Sep 2015,40,"Lovely hotel, can highly recommend but let down by reception staff",We booked this hotel through booking.com and had decided to stay here rather than the Four Seasons. We were really pleased win our choice-our transfer was waiting for us at the airport we were checked in quickly and our room was huge with a great view over the gardens and pool. Breakfast was wonderful sat outside enjoying the morning sun staff very pleasant. We played tennis every morning on the clay court that they had swept for us beforehand. Most days were spent by the pool which is huge-one recommendation is they could make the smaller pool near the children's play area a children's pool and allow adults without children to relax at the far end of the pool. They could definitely up sell drinks etc from the pool bar by coming around and asking if we wanted anything. In the evenings we used the gym or the spa-both really well equipped and worth a visit. The walk into town was easy and took about 15 minutes. We also ate locally at a roof top bar above extrablatt which is a cafe nearby that you can go to for lunch. The casino wasn't that great and everyone was smoking so we decided not to hang around.  The only thing stopping this being a 5 star review was the attitude of the reception staff on check out. We had booked a non refundable reservation through booking.com and I saw during the week my credit card had been pre authorised which I expected. During our stay we checked with reception that my card would not be fully charged and we could pay on another on check out which they assured us could be done. When we came to check out they had already fully charged my card and would not refund it to allow us to pay on another card. Since we stayed there (early Sept) I have had to make countless calls to them to sort out the refund and paying on another card which has been very costly and time consuming. I am very happy for a card to be pre authorised but I have travelled many times and have never not been allowed to pay on a different card at the end of the stay. This problem was very unique to us and all other staff were most polite and helpful therefore I do really recommend this stay for a relaxing trip to Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LornaR523

The gardens are beautiful and in my opinion the nicest in Marrakech. The piano bar is stylish but when we stayed there very quiet. It is expensive but we actually preferred it to Mamounia which was twice as expensive mainly because the staff are more ""human"" here.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Secret_T390 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Hidden Oasis in the Centre of Everywhere,We have stayed at the Es Saadi Palace twice now as a couple and with our 1 year old baby and always a guaranteed service.  The Location is fantastic we were able to walk to koutoubia and the old town (Medina) in an enjoyable 10-15 min at the same time a whole bunch of very cool roof top bars clubs and restaurants are all in the area. The Resorts own night club is one of two top clubs in Marrakech and has an amazing cirque show. The live Jazz bar at the back of the casino is something very cool with an interesting cosmo croud. With all these places mention you are staying at the palace and immediately you get a VIP access. Security at the Resort is on the same league as Las Vegas.    Having mentioned the above the Palace itself is a peaceful relaxed oasis. The gardens and the pool is just breathtaking. The rooms are luxury in itself. The views from the balcony overlooking Marrakech is something to be seen. The pool is amazing with a fully stocked pool bar while the staff are really taking care of you. The Concierge service is top every booking they made for us we got the best table in the house and their recommendations never stopped to impress me and as an ex-New Yorker I am difficult :)    I have a feeling that the next visit to Marrakech will be at the Palace again.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Secret_T390

The garden pool and pool side is pristine and maintained every day sun loungers are very spaced out which makes it a pleasure to sunbathe and relax around the pool.    We would like to especially mention the pool/island bar staff they were amazing. Extremely friendly and approachable. Please mention this to them! there was one in particular we did not get his name but he had braces and short wavy hair- we loved him!    The only downside was when we went to a local shop for bottles of water (which we do on every holiday we go on) we were told no drink could be bought in to the palace from the outside. It was 40 degrees outside and the man was quite rude to us when he informed us that drink purchased from outside of the facility was banned. We felt he looked down on us from that point with very snide looks.

We had high expectations which I'm sorry to say we're not met and overall we were rather disappointed.    Don't get me wrong the hotel has good points - great location nice grounds lovely pool and the rooms are pleasant enough (not sure I would describe them as suites though). Unfortunately we had some issues with the service which in all honesty was shocking. On arrival we had a complimentary bottle of water in our room but our friends did not - mentioned this at reception and they promised to send one immediately. It actually took 48 hours despite a number of reminders and to add insult to injury we were told that we couldn't bring a bottle of water into the hotel from outside.    On one occasion our room key broke off in the lock. This was fixed but they wouldn't give us a replacement and we had to go to reception and have them call someone to let us in every time we wanted to get into the room.    Food was generally poor quality and overpriced - recommend eating at the 'sister' hotel next door which we found much nicer (special mention to Khalid who was a star).

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Cathy P wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Enjoyed the Es Saadi Palace and our upgrade!,Arrived for a 4 day break and had booked the normal hotel but upon check-in was immediately upgraded to the Palace hotel. This wS due to the construction ongoing at the first hotel.  Was quiet perhaps due to Ramadan but we could not fault the Hotel the rooms or the staff.  Breakfast was brilliant and lots of choice and served by the poolside. We had Half-Board basis and had to go the the sister hotel for dinner.  Dinner and restaurants did not open until 7.30pm which is a bit late for us but that could have been due to Ramadan. One thing we were informed by a member of the Hotel staff that we could eat in the beautiful Morrocan restaurant for a 100 dirham per person surcharge so we booked a table and we went and was just about to order when we were told that this was not true! Was embarrassing and we left even though we were the only persons in the whole restaurant.  Drink prices are a bit steep and poolside drinks served in plastic beakers....understand plastic but did they have to be so ugly and 'old' looking?  Loved our rooms very quiet with just birdsong as many birds in the beautiful garden.  Would definitely stay again...perhaps not during Ramadan and we really appreciated the automatic upgrade.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,bournesupreme wrote a review May 2015,50,Splendid stay in fabulous surroundings,I invested a considerable amount of time doing my research into which hotel to stay for my first trip to Marrakech. After careful thought I decided to stay at the Es Saadi Palace.    It was the best decision I made. We were picked up by the hotel transfer we had arranged beforehand which was smooth. Upon arrival at the hotel I was impressed by the architecture design and grandness of the lobby. The check in process was smooth and we were quickly escorted to our rooms. We had booked a junior suite. The room itself was awesome spacious and had a comfortable bed separate lounge area with a small balcony. The bathroom was great with a separate bath tub which looked ideal for having a hot soak. It also had a large walk in shower.    The rooms are somewhat lacking in modern design but do compensate for this in their moraccan themed design infused with luxury.    The swimming pool at the Palace is one of it's highlights. It is huge and stretches from one end to the other. We never had any problems finding sun loungers and always managed to get a good spot by the pool. There is a pool bar in the middle but we hardly used this facility.    The hotel gardens and landscape are pretty good with lots of greenery in sight. The breakfast was good but I found it lacking in variety compared to the 5* hotels I have stayed in at Antalya or Dubai. In addition the service at breakfast time was poor for a fine hotel like this. I always found it took the staff a long time to get our tea etc & this was a consistent theme over a weeks stay.    The hotel is located in the trendy hivernage area and has some excellent restaurants nearby. I would recommend Le Comptoir Namaszake at the Pearl Marrakech & Arkech lounge. There is a carrefour approximately within 15 minutes walking distance.    The only negative experience to report was due to the room keys. To my surprise this hotel did not use cards to open the door. They gave us big keys which can be awkward to leave in the pocket. On the first night my friend snapped the key trying to open the door. They never supplied him with a key until there was 1 night left in our stay. Also our room key went missing in our room due to the cleaner misplacing it. We were not given a replacement key. Also I found the hotels attitude towards this incident quite poor. We should have been provided with a key sooner rather than having to go to reception & ask to be let into our rooms every time.    Overall we enjoyed our stay and the Palace proved to be a spectacular place for us to explore Marrakech & escape the hustle and bustle and retreat into luxury.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bournesupreme
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,DaisyP17 wrote a review May 2015,10,Read before you stay here...,"There were some good attributes about this hotel but unfortunately the horrible management completely overshadowed them for us and I would never stay at this place again.    Apart from the general disorganization of the front desk the slow service and the passive concierge (recommends only the hotel restauraunts?) we had a very bad experience with the hotel manager. On the first day we unpacked and noticed our safe was not working. We were on our way out and decided we would address it later-BIG MISTAKE. The next day 800 euros were missing from an envelope I had hidden in my suitcase. We informed the hotel manager and his response was a shrug of the shoulders (literally) and a comment that we should have declared the safe wasn't working-and that the only thing he would do is call the police IF we wanted him too. He said he had no proof that we had that money (accusing us of lying) and didn't offer and in fact refused any type of restitution to at least make us feel a little better about getting robbed on our first day staying there (perhaps a meal at the hotel a spa service...a drink...a ""sorry""?).  Nothing.    The strange thing is that we had overheard another man on the first day complaining that his safe didn't work. Smells fishy to me especially with the way we were treated after being robbed.    Not a 5 star hotel. The place is not a palace.The grounds are indeed beautiful but if you don't get out to the pool early enough they have to scramble to find you a spot....doesn't seem like there is enough space for all the clients...    Because you can smoke inside lobby areas have a strong smell of smoke. I know you have to expect that but I still found it unpleasant to say the least.    All in all VERY disappointing. With all the nice places to stay in the area (think Sofitel)-I don't recommend this one.",Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaisyP17
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Didge1 wrote a review May 2015,40,Perfect location,Spent a very pleasant five days at this hotel.The location is perfect....within walking distance of the Medina but in a quiet residential area.After a hectic time sight seeing it was like a oasis of calm to return to the hotel and enjoy the pool and gardens.  We had a room overlooking the pool and yes there is some noise in the early hours from the casino but this is by far outweighed by the delight of looking out and seeing the snow capped Atlas Mountains.  We stayed in the lead up to the Easter holidays and the hotel became progressively busier so it became evident that they did need more staff during the breakfast period.  Overall the staff were extremely pleasant and were always attentive to your needs....I would definitely recommend.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Didge1

Overall they are available and effective (which is the most important after all).  Very good points of this hotel:  - Swimming Pool side: beautiful area within a luxurious gardens and oasis of freshness. One of the most beautifull I have seen up to now. If you are the type to like getting lazy near water this is the place!  - SPA: modern well equiped with a nice staff (only annoying thing you have to fill up a form about your health and stress when you arrive of 2 long pages kind of intruding!)  - Evening Restauration: We tried 2 restaurants; La cour des lions (Morrocan): very beautiful restaurant with excellent food and nice service: EXCELLENT. Also the EPICURIEN (modern bistro/lounge serving French/Morrocan food by the Casino): simple efficient price fair very good for an evening which you want easy...    Things to improve:  - Despite the excellent location where the breakfast is served (Under the trees outside) the breakfast is nothing amazing food is fresh but not especially tasty.. dont get me wrong it is not bad ... just like any other places.. service smiling but a bit disorganised.  - lunch food by the pool is pricy long to arrive and the result is NOT Worth the price (about 20Euros for a club sandwich which is up to now the smallest I have ever seen!).  Overall this hotel has a lot of good points and a good location (10/15 min walk to the Medina).

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,wendy d wrote a review Apr 2015,40,"ABSOLUTELY STUNNING ,BEAUTIFUL HOTEL- BUT SERVICE COULD BE BETTER","We stayed at Es Saadi Palace in HivernageMarrakech between 4th and 14th April this year .The Palace itself and the landscaped gardens/pool area are absolutely beautiful .The ""lobby "" in the Palace is jaw droppingly gorgeous ;immaculately presented .Very stylish modern and with a real Moroccan feel . The interior is simply delightful.When we first arrived it provided a real ""wow"" factor .We had booked one of the Ksars which is essentially a Moroccan ""duplex"".The accommodation suited our needs perfectly as we were travelling with our 2 sons aged 6 and 8 .They had the run of a very spacious area upstairs comprising bedroom living area and separate bathroom with French doors onto an enclosed and thus safe elevated sun deck .Downstairs was a separate bedroom for my husband and I  a bathroom and a living area with French doors onto a sun lounger area with views to the pool .The Ksar was Moroccan themed with a rustic feel : painted shutters tiled floors and the like .It was very clean with comfortable beds and regularly maintained to a high standard during our stay. I cannot fault the accommodation or the Palace in any way however I was disappointed to learn on our first evening that the Lagon et Jardin restaurant which served a buffet breakfast and lunch and which was ideal (if rather expensive ) for children was not open in the evenings . My only real complaint about our stay (apart from the disappointing weather- only 4 days sun out of 10 -which I accept is outwith the control of the hotel !) concerned the level of service and a rather ""laissez faire"" approach by some staff .At the breakfast buffet it was often left to us to request cutlery/cups and saucers/etc (on sometimes more than one occasion ) and often there were no cereal bowls/plates available .During our stay this happened certainly more than half the time .The lunchtime buffet was not hugely inspiring for ¬£30 a head /¬£15 for a child and was considerably less exciting than we have encountered at similar 5 star resorts in Turkey or Dubai for example .We attempted lunch at the Island bar/restaurant on a couple of occasions however on the last visit we had waited 40 minutes from ordering and had yet to even receive our drinks and we therefore went to the snack bar at the older Es Saadi hotel where we found the service( and speed in particular) to be far superior .At the snack bar drinks were delivered along with tapenade olives and fresh bread rolls as standard however the same niceties did not happen at the Island /pool bar in the Palace which was disappointing .The manager of the Island bar seemed to spend a lot of his time shouting at his staff and rushing around which did not make for a restful experience .Finally when we asked on our last day for chicken nuggets for our boys(having seen another child being served them) we were told that they were too busy and that there was ""no childrens menu that day"" !.To be honest up until that point no one had informed us that there was a kids menu and we had been ordering lunch from the standard menu paying around ¬£15 for a pretty average bowl of pasta which was too large a portion for children .  I do not think that the hotel was really geared up for families needs and would better suit a couple who could enjoy the delicious food that was offered in the French and Moroccan restaurants .These opened for dinner at 730pm and so generally you would expect to be eating around 815pm which is a little late for younger children . In summary a gorgeous hotel faultlessly presented and well located that could be really impressive if it improved its customer service-particularly in the Lagon restaurant and Island bar areas.

Breakfast terrace with the pool view is very enjoyable also. Very clean and spacious rooms Moroccan design with massive furniture beautiful bathroom. Extremely attentive attitude of all personnel!!    I highly recommend location in this area of Marakesh - Hivernage - it is a peaceful very modern area which is at the same time in 15 minutes walk to the medina hassle.    I have noticed many small unfortunate drawbacks which prevent the hotel from being just perfect so please mind the following:  - slow & unstable wifi  - no coffee/tea in the room  - several times after cleaning only part of clean towels were provided  - in some evenings only 2 of 5 steam rooms work  - tea in the spa area is not being looked after and refilled  - breakfast did not offer any local specialities (apart of cheese and desert)  - breakfast does not change from day to day the variety is too small  - birds are flying in the breakfast room and.. eating from the pastries table and nobody cared about it  - when moving or lifting sun beds one can feel they are sticky and a little dirty,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Riga, Latvia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beatriise

Breakfast excellent all you need to start the day.  The only critic is the ambiance a little subdued in the bar although probably to do with the period we were there. Also small point if you offer a pool table in the bar then really it should be equipped correctly or just take out. Also shame the Palace does not have any little shops or boutiques and other than the gastro restaurant no other restaurant however the hotel restaurant is of excellent standard as it had always been.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Sara A wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Relaxing Oasis in Marrakech,My husband 15 year old son and I stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of our trip and then an extra night at then end of our week. We were picked up at the airport in a lovely clean people carrier and taken to the hotel. We were served mint tea and pastries while we waited to check in to the sound of a man in traditional dress playing an equally as traditional an instrument. As we went off peak we were up graded to a duplex apartment. It was on the ground floor and huge!! There was an entrance area with a large toilet coming off it then another small room with a sofa and all the wardrobes and safe. WE used this as a dressing room for my son as it had curtains separating it from the main lounge. This had a writing desk mini bar TV large sofa dining table and chairs and the stairs leading to the bedroom. Patio doors led onto a patio area with table and chairs. The ceiling here was about 25 feet high so a lot of glass. AT night we used automatic shutter which came down and blocked out all the light. Upstairs there was a bedroom with a bed which I think was bigger than a UK super king size. More wardrobes a flat screen TV and the biggest bathroom I have ever seen. The rain shower room with marble bench was lovely and large. Rose petals were scattered in here twice a day. In the evenings a small cake was left on either side of the bed a lovely touch. The beds were too hard for my liking.  Breakfasts were amazing the best freshly squeezed orange juice and an omelette station. The staff here struggled with English but there was one lady who could speak English and I would always ask her for what I wanted and she was very attentive and helpful.  Room service was delicious but over priced.  My son played tennis with the amiable tennis coach for 150MAD he really enjoyed it.  The concierge is the only real negative I think they were on commission. He insisted I could not do a half day quad bike only a full day after arguing for some time I went back to the room and booked it myself on the phone and got a discount!  We asked to look around one of the villas and the butler kindly took us on a tour which was lovely.  We left our luggage here when we left for a few days reception staff was very helpful. We left our cash with them and they had a wall full of safes. Our belongings were put in and locked using 2 different keys they kept one and so did we.  When we had our final check out they tried to give us an extended check out time as our fight was not until 8pm but they couldn't as they were full. I explained that I only needed this as I would need to pray before leaving. They assured me not to worry and that they would provide a room to pray in. I was so pleased with this consideration but I was quite shocked when they gave me the luggage room to pray in! After all the luxury and care I had expected something better!  I can't fault the hotel however be warned I loved it because we went off peak and practically got the room half price if we had paid more I would not be so pleased.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Camberley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraA460

The pool area is very luxurious and again the staff are very pleasant. The large round double sun loungers were a particular favourite.    We loved the free airport transfer in a Bentley!    Drawbacks would be the costs of drinks/food within the hotel (we kept going to nearby cafe ExtraBlatt just around the corner which was a fraction of the price and great vibe).    Finally the lack of atmosphere within the hotel was a little disappointing...but perhaps this was because we weren't in peak season in March?

The room was very clean and the staff came a couple times to check it a day. A chocolate or pastry was left each night by the bedside table. I saw waters in the room and consumed a couple and I was ready for someone to pull the 'gotcha that actually cost money' but that never happened and I was pleasantly surprised. Breakfast was included every morning with my room and it was a very nice continental breakfast. Not limited at all.    Sitting pool side was awesome. The pool was extremely cold but I liked it. I would take turns sun bathing and then icing myself in the pool.    Very close to everything. Easy walk into the Medina did it many times. Woke up every morning and had coffee on our very expansive outdoor porch which had a view of the pool and the mountains. I liked to sleep in and the black out curtains did an excellent job of keeping out the light in the mornings so we could sleep in.    One of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. Bathroom had a massive room for a shower and an awesome bathtub that we used. They also had ample hotel amenities including some really nice black exfoliating scrub.

The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the pillow menu extensive! I was delighted to find a tray of fruit on the small dining table and enjoyed relaxing on the comfortable sofa in my few free moments. While I wasn't able to go swimming I did feel the water in the pool which was heated to a very warm temperature - nice for a February day!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,addicted2hotels wrote a review Jan 2015,30,"Great rooms, but aloof staff",We didn't get off to a good start. We were greeted nicely and given tea but then there was a long delay when we were left just sitting there with no explanation. We had booked 3 rooms and were finally given a tour of the public areas and shown two of the rooms and had to wait another half an hour for the 3rd room (it was late afternoon).    The public areas are cavernous and in the winter months at least rather dark and dreary. The restaurant is also enormous making it rather characterless. There is a lot of contemporary art which was all very interesting and did improve the overall look. The rooms are lovely - very spacious with large comfortable beds and nice linens. All rooms had a vase of fresh roses which was a nice touch. The bathrooms are also lovely with bathtubs big enough for two and separate walk-in showers although our son's bath was ringed with cigarette burns which looked horrible. The housekeeping was excellent. We had one complimentary bottle of water on arrival and then each got a small bottle (330ml) at turndown but any water after that was chargeable. This seemed rather mean at the high price we were paying and especially as we had come from another hotel where we had a complimentary stock of several large bottles of water. As other people have said the wifi is very patchy.    The outdoor pool is huge with guys on duty to help organise your sunbeds and bring towels etc. The sunbeds were mostly all used so I think in warmer months it must get very busy. We were told the hotel was in 20 acres of gardens and it was a little disappointing that you couldn't wander round and find a quiet spot to sit - the gardens were dotted with private villas (which you can book rather than a hotel room) and they had private gardens but other than the path that wound round them to take you to the villas you couldn't access them. So it was sit by the pool or on your balcony.    We found the food to be very expensive and mediocre. We went over to the hotel on our first evening where we were offered a very limited menu and although there were quite a few interesting desserts on it we were told that the only desserts on offer were those on the sweet trolley. I can't say that the service was bad but I would say that we were served with very bad grace and we did not feel that our custom was appreciated in any way. We could also see that there was a degree of bullying going on amongst the staff which wasn't very pleasant to see.    We did a city walking tour the next morning and so were tired and hungry when we arrived back at the hotel and decided on the buffet lunch in the Palace. No one explained what the form was so we didn't really have an idea of exactly what was on offer. After a while they started cooking food on a bbq but none of us got the actual things we'd chosen - there seemed to be no system in place. This meal was even more expensive than the dinner the night before.    We gave the food one last try and ordered items like burgers and club sandwiches out by the pool one day. The food arrived very cold and the club sandwiches were made with very thin very dry (and cold) toasted bread. We had a similar meal in a local cafe one day which cost a fraction of the cost here and was far superior.    The breakfast staff had thawed out a little by the end of our 5 night stay but although all very efficient I would not describe any of the staff as cheerful other than one delightful doorman and one of the receptionists Hanane who was very helpful.    We had booked through a travel agent on a Bed & Breakfast basis but there was apparently a New Years Eve dinner included but this was never explained to us and we had made arrangements to go out. When we were asked about the dinner (well given a letter about it that they demanded we sign) and we asked for more details the lady we were talking to actually stopped mid-sentence and turned to speak to other guests who were at the desk.    Our daughter had to come back to England early and because we had booked through an agent and paid in advance we weren't expecting the hotel to offer any sort of a refund. However they did re-let her room so we felt that as a gesture of goodwill most businesses would have offered something in those circumstances but nothing was forthcoming either to us or our travel agent.

Otherwise the bed application was previously made on the online reservation . We felt a total lack of control in this regard.  Reception staff was very unfriendly and unable to outline a minimum smile; even seemed that they had to do an enormous effort to greet customers.  Moreover in the breakfast restaurant (buffet) there were birds and that would not have anything special but the birds were constantly eating over the dishes that we were serving our breakfast under the impassive gaze of the numerous waiters. We couldn‚Äôt believe our eyes.  In our opinion Es Saadi Gardens is far from being a 5 star hotel.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/474marianf
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,vingar123 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,"Very, very nice place to stay",We visited Marrakesh for about 1 week and stayed in the Palace a Ksar with two floors/bedrooms. Service is top from the airport pick up to return. Food is also great I especially liked the high quality of the meat which I tend to eat almost raw(ish). Our kids were well thought after and even brought back/forth between the Ksar and the Kids club on request.  Only (minor) comment is that the restaurants are less for small(er) children a bit too stiff...a pity because the food is great.

We were left astonished by its premises nice staff and location. We can certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who decides to visit the wonderful city of Marrakech. It's a charming and relaxed atmosphere with a great garden to explore as well as excellent swimming pools. The staff was very service minded and took good care of us in every way. This hotel is suitable for couples as well as for families. You also have the casino next door although you won't be bothered with any kind of noise or sound.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Gabriele S wrote a review Nov 2014,50,A wonderful hotel set in wonderful gardens in the centre of Marrakech,I stayed at the Es Saadi Palace for a few days in November and loved it. My accommodation was one of the Ksars away from hotel's main building. It was quiet and sheltered and very spacious. My own little house with an upstairs bed and bathroom and a balcony and an entrance hall bedroom  large bathroom and lounge downstairs leading onto a patio backed onto the pool area.  Yes its very 'morrocan' in its decor and had everything ( including a Nespresso Machine) one needed as well as a butler and buggy service should you wish to not want to walk through the beautiful gardens. The breakfast was good and I loved to sit outside in the morning sun overlooking the pools and gardens. One of the pools was heated great for an early morning dip.  Another benefit is the extensive Spa featuring an Oriental Thermae  a large pool and offering all things relaxing and beautiful. I tried the Haman Experience and was transported into a different world followed by some lovely tea afterwards.  Once you step outside you are right in the centre of the city next to the Casino and the Sofitel and in walking distance to the Square and Medina. Highly recommendable.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GES57

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,TBTr wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Great place to stay,We just returned from Marrakech and had an absolutly wonderful time at Es Saadi - The Palace!    My first impression was not so good though - I tried e-mailing the hotel about a pick-up at the airport but never got an answer. My husband called and booked it and although our booking said that airport transport was included the hotel said it would be 150 dirhams. But we never got a chance to argue about this beacuse there was never anybody at the airport to pick us up. And when we tried calling the hotel we didn't get an answer. So we had to pay for a taxi to get there. So that's why this hotel don't get a full score form me. The funny thing is that the transportation back to the airport was included. So I'm assuming somebody messed up when we got there.    Bu when that being said after we arrived at the hotel we had a very pleasant time. We got tea and a pastry while checking in. The suites are very spacious and we got a nice view down at the pool. The included Wifi worked very well most of our stay - it was a bit slow during the weekend and I'm guessing it's beacuse there were more guests there then. We got water every night and wonderful pastry. We also enjoyed the breakfast and though it had quite a good selection.    The gardens around the hotel are beautiful and the same goes for the pools. We only tried the heated one the other felt way too cold. The sunbeds where nice and we enjoyed our time here. But I'm pretty sure the guys working by the pool could do a better job. They were pretty slow to get you a towl and they didn't really remove towls after people left. Most of the time they sat on a bed and talked to eachother. But maybe that's just how it is during low season.    The hotel is a quick walk form the Medina and in a very quiet and nice neigborhood. We felt very safe all the time and it was amazing to get away from all the hussel in the old town.    We would love to stay here again and have already recommended it to friends and family.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Oslo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TBTr
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Alice294265 wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Luxury in the sun,We have just returned from a week in Marrakech staying at Es Saadi Palace hotel as a family of four with teenage children. The hotel scored highly on all fronts - gorgeous rooms which were spacious and very clean. Excellent bedlinens and towels and very good room service. The included breakfast was pretty good made better by being served on a wonderful terrace in the garden. The best member of staff was Aziz the restaurant manager who was friendly and helpful. The least good staff members had to be the concierge and his stand in when he was off duty. Both of them were sour faced and made you feel like they were doing you a favour helping you. The tennis court which we used everyday was pretty grotty but better than nothing - but the coach was rude and unhelpful.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,ronan s wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Es Saadi Palace,This hotel probably isn't a 5 star when compared to what is on offer in other countries but that shouldn't take away from the fact that is a lovely place to spend few days.    We were picked up at the airport in an air conditioned Bentley which made a good start to our visit.    The hotel - the approach and main entrance comes across as a bit shabby (compared to the Sofitel next door) and could do with some TLC and investment. However the interior is beautiful and tasteful - very tranquil.It was a pleasure coming into the main lobby - check out the art gallery and the doomed ceiling area very unexpected.    We opted for a first floor junior suite and weren't disappointed - the interior finishes and furnishings were exceptional and the view over the gardens and pool was super - go for a room with a garden view. The bed was large and comfortable. Large L shaped sofa was laden with perfectly placed pillows. 2 flat screen TVs with English speaking channels limited to CNN and BBC News. The suite was cleaned twice daily with complimentary water each evening. Wi-Fi access in room was very good.    The gardens are superb and tended by a small army of gardeners - the pool area likewise; and our only minor complaint would be that the pool service was a bit slow at times.    Breakfast was served on the terrace leading to the pool and garden - very pleasant. The buffet was good not exceptional and didn't vary during our stay.    We did not have dinner in the hotel - although busy during the day the hotel was extremely quiet at night. We only noticed a couple of people in the very large bar. Each evening we took a short taxi trip to the new town - 5 minutes or a 15 minute walk. The old city is about the same distance.    The hotel staff were all very pleasant but don't come across as really going the extra mile to satisfy...we enquired about getting coffee facilities in our suite - but no-one actually bothered to come back and confirm what was happening. Having asked a third time we dropped it...but it would have been nice to have been told whether our request was being dealt with.    These are very minor issues and in the scheme of things aren't important. This hotel has a lovely atmosphere and we really enjoyed our stay.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronans455

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Jill H wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Indulgent relaxation at the Palace,The Es Saadi Palace is an oasis of friendliness and graciousness serenity and refinement with a quality of service that is second to none.    The architecture of the building and the design of the interior are eyecatching and there is an array of excellent local handiwork and handicraft throughout the building: handwoven carpets and sumptuous fabrics tiles and mosaics woodcarving and metalwork and original paintings. In the lobby one can listen to soft exotic music played by a musician while sipping freshly brewed mint tea.    The hotel is set in a tranquil tropical garden of palms and palmettos orange and pomegranate trees roses and bougainvilleas which surround a large freeform lagoon pool with an island bar. Parasols and very comfortable sunloungers surround the lagoon and large soft towels are provided for swimmers. There are two other swimming pools: one outside and another in the spa both heated. The spa provides a sensual sanctuary with a comprehensive range of pampering beauty treatments massages thermae and a traditional hammam; and there is a superbly equipped fitness room. The hotel garden and pools are immaculately upkept by a large team of staff.    The generous buffet breakfast is laid out in a restaurant that opens onto a garden terrace and guests can eat inside or at the tables outside. Delicious light meals are available in the Bio du Bled and the Lagon & Jardin restaurants and there are two bars.    Dining in the Cours des Lions restaurant is a memorable experience. The talented chef and his excellent team of kitchen staff provide a delicious feast of tagines couscous and artistically presented desserts. Dining at a table on the terrace affords a view of Marrakech as the night sky darkens and the city lights come on; and dining inside allows one to feel the breeze wafting through the doors that open onto the terrace. The impeccably trained waiters the stunning decor soft music candles beautiful tableware and very comfortable chairs enhance the dining experience. This is very fine dining indeed.    Staying in a spacious suite with a balcony overlooking the gardens allows for a truly restful stay. My superbly appointed executive suite had a luxurious bathroom; a dressing room; a sumptuous four-poster bed; a dining table set with complementary wine bottled water fruit and honey cakes; a desk; two large televisions; a wonderfully comfortable divan; handwoven carpets; and fully adjustable airconditioning; and the balcony was furnished with a sunlounger a table and two chairs.    Overall the Es Saadi Palace is a base for exploring the exotic city of Marrakech and is a place for indulgent relaxation.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Tenterden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillh981

I will start by posting the ""Con's"" of the Palace (since most of the reviews pretty much repeat themselves by saying how great the Palace is):    1) there is no iron. you have to pay to get your clothes ironed and you need to at least give them 24 hours notice.  2) there is no clock in the room. (that's if you need one... i like to know what time it is every now and again lol so it was a little bother to me)    With that being said i LOVE the Palace Es Saadi. It's located 10 minutes walking distance from the Medina (which is in the center of Marrakech). that's where all the spice markets are located.    The service is Incredible.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,gisella81london wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Excellent location and facilities,I stayed at the Es Saadi for a week-long business trip to Marrakech. One thing to keep in mind is that both the Hotel Es Saadi (cheaper less luxurious) and the Palace (5-star treatment) are advertised on the same page which can be very confusing. I stayed at the Palace (upon arrival we were surprised with an upgrade which was wonderful) which came with all the facilities and comforts you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. The spa is actually really good - I had a hammam (divine) and used the indoor pool regularly (there's also a huge outdoor pool). Highlights for me: the staff (always friendly always helpful); the breakfast (generous and delicious); spa facilities; spacious room; free/great wifi connection (key if/when on a business trip); location - this was a major bonus as the hotel was close enough to the medina (old town) but far enough so you feel you're getting away from the hustle and bustle of the square and souks.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled on business,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gisella81london

I was taken with my friend to the Palace part of the resort only to be told I was being surprised with an extremely generous upgrade from 5 star hotel to an Executive suite. The suite was payed out over 2 floors with a beautiful terrace facing the infamous palace pool. Since the moment I arrived at this resort I do not think I could fault any service of this palace. From the amazing reception staff Zakariya to the fabulous pool staff Redwan and Hakim there was not one person who was not willing to help all you have to do is ask. The proximity of the hotel to the Casino de Marrakesh and Theatro is lovely and even though there was a famous comedy festival (Marrakesh du Rire) going on in the hotel you could not tell it was fully booked. I spent a lovely weekend and left with beautiful memories. I would definitely recommend this palace again and urge others to see it for themselves.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Emma D wrote a review May 2014,50,Luxury and FUN,I came with 3 girlfriends for a semi bachlorette/hen party. We had 2 adjoining rooms in the Palace (note the Hotel is a different building) and the rooms were truly impressive. great size great bedding and beautiful styling. If you want the romantic or intense cultural experience of Marrakech this place probably isn't right but if you want the feel and expectations of a large resort (with the styling of morocco) this place is for you.    We had dinner in the Cour De Lions restaurant which I would recommend fully as the interiors are stunning. I would also recommend a traditional Hamman treatment at the Palace SPA. very hot but great to prep the skin for some sun.    The other thing nice about this hotel is that due to its size and international flair you are a bit more free to behave liberally and as you would at other European reports. We spent a good amount of time at the pool having cocktails (as we were predominately there for a girls weekend and to get some sun). Although the drinks service was a bit slow the attitudes of the staff were helpful and positive.    Do learn a bit of french before travelling- we were able to communicate effectively with everyone but with no french speaker in the group...this sometimes took a few efforts.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/410EmmaD410
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Angela D wrote a review May 2014,50,"Great hotel, great location",My friend and I stayed here for a week. We had a very comfortable large room with balcony overlooking the city. The beds were very comfortable. The staff were excellent throughout the hotel very friendly and attentive. This includes the housekeeping staff with their lovely smiles the pool staff who kept an eye on everything and were quick to respond to requests and the restaurant staff who were attentive humorous and very hard working. The buffet breakfast which we enjoyed on the terrace each day had a very good selection and the staff were quick to come round for tea/coffee orders etc. the grounds are beautiful and the boutiques were an added bonus. The pool area was very pleasant and we always managed to find sun loungers. The location of the hotel is excellent being only 20 minute walk to the Medina and approximately 20 minute drive to the airport. The road outside was a little noisy at night. The whole week was very good value for money.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Elaine F wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Amazing relaxing holiday experience,My partner and I stayed at the palace for 1 week. We wanted a peaceful but interesting break. We had both. What a fabulous time we had. Excellent service from the moment we arrived all staff were friendly and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. The grounds and poolside were immaculate. It was the most tranquil experience I've enjoyed for a long time! We used the spa facilities it was again perfect. We were in a suite big traditional rooms. One evening we asked for 2 wine glasses as we had bought a bottle of wine from supermarket. They arrived at our room with an ice bucket and crisps and nuts for us ! What a lovely touch!! The hotel is in the more up market area with great choices for places to eat and drink. A little more expensive but well worth it. It's a 15 minute walk to medina and souks. So your close enough but not too close with all the hustle and bustle it has. Our only little complaint was that there is no tea or coffee in room. But I'm sure if we had asked it would have been organised. As a rule we don't go back to the same hotels but we would definitely return to the Es Saadi palace.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ascot, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419elainef
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Lucy A wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Serene Palace stay,I have been lucky enough to have just returned from a week long stay in the Es Saadi Palace. WOW! What a place. An oasis of calm but just 20 mins walk from the centre of the mind boggling Marrakesh. The hotel itself is beautiful expensive but if you want luxury and location you cannot ask for better. Catering mainly for adult French guests as you'd expect lounge poolside in a vast manicured garden (look out for the tortoises) and gaze up at the burgeoning orange trees with the snow capped Atlas mountains in the background. I agree that the evenings were very quiet here for the nights that you don't fancy the bustle of the centre - we found a great little Cafe round the corner - Extrablatt which was fun and relaxed. The junior suite we were in was amazing - huge and every detail seemed to be thought of including a menu of 12 pillow types to choose from to ensure your comfort. A meal on the 3rd floor restaurant is a treat - stunning settings and a very pleasing view - not to be missed.    Overall this holiday was just what we were looking for. Luxury and location.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Dumeca wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Memorable stay in a truly amazing hotel,I was lucky enough to stay in one of the villas with my boyfriend for my birthday and I could not really fault anything. The villa itself was beautiful and private we woke up to the sounds of birds in the beautiful gardens service was attentive and friendly the rose petals on the bath mat and the addition of Moroccan soap and products in the bathroom were a nice touch. For those who are peculiar about pillows there was even a pillow menu if we wanted to change for something more specific (we didn't but I was definitely curious).  The Palace nearby is quite a stunning place with ornate walls and ceilings and beautiful Moroccan furniture and details everywhere it is beautiful both inside and out.  The entire hotel felt like a little oasis of peace and greenery only a few minutes cab drive from the craziness of the Medina. All the staff was friendly and helpful from the staff at the breakfast bar to just about anyone else we saw even the gardeners said hello with a smile! The garden has a heated pool which was perfect for the sunny (but not yet too hot) warm weather. We had a hamman (with traditional black soap) at the spa which was really relaxing and leaves you with incredibly soft skin definitely worth trying!! The pool and choice of steam baths were also pretty good especially after a day walking around the souk and the Medina. Needless to say I (well we both) could have stayed there longer rather than fly back to reality and work.

Offering only suites and all with a garden and mountain view this is the perfect retreat from the chaos of the city. Wonderful pool facilities indoors and out. Free access to its own 'hammam' with many different water treatments - and few customers is a welcome bonus. Above all the service was faultless happy and polite. The bar and restaurant are a little quiet but you can always relax on your balcony watching the sunset over The Atlas Mountains.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,StellaMats wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Magical luxury,I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with my company a quite large crowd of sun hungry Norwegians! We entered the hotel before sunset and was met with luxury beyond. The atmosphere the ornate detailing in every corridor stairway doors tiles rooms and outside garden and pool area just stunned us all. My collegue and I roomed together and ended up staying in a 2 story house each allowing us to spread out in our own individual queen size bed like starfish. The bathrooms were decorated with maroccan details floor rugs laid out with rose petals spread out onto them. Just the little extra. Each night 3 chocolates were set on the night table and bottled water bedsheets pulled aside and curtains drawn. My other collegues in gorgeous rooms with spacious balconys overlooking the garden area. Friendly staff everywhere giving me opportunity to freshen up my french vocabulary. My company enjoyed the heated pool and poolbar. Hard to know what a glass of wine actually cost prices differed a bit..also the nespresso capsules in the room were not for free as we thought...these were possibly the only thing I could put my finger on. Delicious meals good selection of fruits and absence of fatty bacon for breakfast...I like! Clean premises romantic light at night from beautiful lanterns! Short ride to the market place about 100mad for taxi or horse carriage ride. No problem. Also  easy walking distance to other hotels with lucious restaurants in the european neighborhood.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,sw1lad wrote a review Dec 2013,50,"Hotel heaven, totally amazing and the best experience ever",We have just came back after a week in Marrakesh having spent 4 nights of our week at the Es Saadi Palace Spa and Resort over Christmas. Having read negative reviews of the hotel on Tripadvisor I don't get it I just think some people are never happy we could not fault our stay from the second we arrived to the second we left it was perfect. Having travelled all over the world and stayed in some of the best hotels this has to be the most amazing hotel experience ever.    We booked a superior suite and when we arrived the front of house manager Karima (she is a true professional and great fun all the guests just love her) upgraded us to a corner suite on the 3rd floor of the Palace which was magnificent with a huge terrace balcony huge lounge dining and sitting room and bedroom not one but two walk in wardrobes and a bathroom the size of a small London apartment. The room design was a perfect blend of traditional Moroccan with a twist of modern Paris chic (the owners are a French family) really stunning with great attention to detail.    We came across the villas whilst walking around the immaculate landscaped gardens there are over eight hectares to wander around and kept beautiful by a team of gardeners I did see them on the website and thought they would be way out of our price range. We asked if we could have a look at one or two them Karima arranged a visit for us and we were shown around by one of the butlers and instantly fell in love with them so much so we booked in for our last two nights. We moved into the Sultane Villa and it was just heaven with its own 50 Sqm private pool 500 sqm of landscaped gardens the interior was designed for a Sultan. From the handcrafted fireplace hand carved stone ceiling marble and stone bathroom with sunken Jacuzzi huge drapes separating the rooms dressing room with the most amazing hand crafted wooden wardrobes it was like we had stepped onto amazing film set it was truly luxurious.    Our butler put a Christmas tree in our room and even left our Xmas presents and a few extra gifts from the hotel under the tree. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff or butlers they were always on hand to help. We went out for a walk in the Medina and when we got back our butler had built a roaring fire and brought us some amazing canapes and a bottle of champagne as we got ready to go to dinner.    The hotel was built by and to this day is run by the same family since 1956. They have built a business on delighting and exceeding guests expectations and it really does show. They hosted a champagne jazz and canap√© reception for all the guests in the lobby next to the biggest Xmas tree I have ever seen (it was designed by a famous French designer) where they greeted all the guests we met the all three generations of the family and every guest was treated like a member of their family. This is so rare in today's world of branded hotel chains you don't come across such personal service to me it's on par with Sandy Lane in Barbados. On Christmas day the butler delivered an amazing breakfast by our pool (like in the suites where we had breakfast on the terrace the food was outstanding). Again he lit the fire while we ate it was picture perfect opening our presents on Xmas day in front of a roaring fire glass of champagne in hand the sun shining it was truly magical.    We paid several visits to the spa again the service was awesome if you stay in the palace you can use all the facilities in the spa from herbal steam to the ice bath they have a great gym also. The staff are a credit to the hotel and its owners it was even a joy to lose money in the casino which is also within the grounds so you don't even have to pay for the cab fare if you lose all your money!. There are several restaurants with in the hotel but we just lounged around the villa and ordered room service.    If you want to be spoilt and treated like a Sultan then look no further than the Es Saadi we loved it so much we are planning my birthday in some of the two bed villas in June with a group of friends. Compared to places like the Burj in Dubai or the Versace Villa in Miami it's a faction of the cost and worth every single penny but the big difference is you get your own oasis of luxury and don't have to share with others!,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sw1lad

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Leanne T wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Incredible stay at Es Saadi,Fabulous stay here in July. Hotel is breathtaking as I'm sure are the villa's in the grounds. Two hotel sites one with a casino. The hotel grounds have long winding walks along palm tree lined paths so it was surprising to take a long stroll without actually leaving the hotel one night! Every now and then you come across one of the hotel's gated villa's.    The hotel is only a short walk from both the old town and the new town.    Two hotel pools (one is much better than the other although both absolutely amazing for a dip from the hot weather). Pools are manned by people asking if you would like any refreshments or food from the cafe which is brought to your lounger.    The little boutique shops tucked away on site were very pleasant and I got two great paintings from there.    Breakfast each morning was extensive and stunning. Fruit yogurts cooked breakfasts and continental options and pastries. So good and very well catered for.    We also visited the spa for hammam and massage. Hammam was unceremonious (it was my first time and I wasn't expecting it to be as rough!) but massage was lovely and in a lovely building just next to the pool.    Tip - people do expect tips in Marrakech so take a couple of extra notes and be prepared to have to ask for change back if you order pool service.    We're hoping to visit again this time going with a big group of friends to use one of the villa's with a private pool :),Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeanneT53
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Victor C wrote a review Nov 2013,30,Not Five Star,We went to this hotel for two weeks with Saga. It is a pleasant hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Our package was half-board and we paid for an upgrade to a pool facing room rather than the standard city facing room. This had the benefits of a quieter location (day time) and a south facing view which meant that we could sit on our balcony in the sunshine. The downside was that our room also faced the Casino which played loud music until four or five in the morning. Much of the noise could be drowned out by using the very efficient air con. however if you are a light sleeper you may have difficulties.    The half-board dinner menu was rather limited in choice although the quality of food was always good. Service however was quite slow. Unfortunately we arrived at the start of a three day religious festival which was not indicated in the guide books or by our operator. This resulted in less staff available and a considerably longer wait for menu items. Fortunately after the festival things speeded up to just slow.    Breakfast was not good particularly if a hot meal was required. A reasonable choice of cold food was available but watching the flies running over the cold meats is rather off-putting.    Prices for extras e.g. drinks at meals or in the bar were extremely high. We overcame this by shopping locally at shops or supermarkets. Apparently the hotel is quite happy for you to buy wine water etc. outside and consume it within the hotel.    We usually holiday all-inclusive and I found that this was a much more expensive option.    Finally this is not a five star hotel except in pricing. Bedroom furnishings are not just 'tired' but positively 'weary'. Their sister hotel next door is five star and although guests are told that facilities can be shared it is not really encouraged.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Andover, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictorC932

We asked if there was some place we could get dinner in the hotel and they accommodated us at one of their restaurants even tho it was closed. The staff prepared an authentic Moroccan meal which was delicious we were entertained by the musician playing a Moroccan instrument.

The service was impeccable and they looked after me and my dear friend for the whole 5 days. Nothing was ever too much trouble and everything was delivered with a smile even giving us a room to shower in after we checked out so that we were fresh for our night flight home. The breakfast buffet was also so very suitable with a great choice from continental and warm food.

Subsequently that is reflected in the level of service that you get here. It's impeccable. Nothing is too much trouble and everything is delivered with a smile. But the real star of the show is the food. We booked on a half board basis rather than full board. A choice that certainly stood us in good stead. Breakfast is a veritable feast of fruit pastries and cooked food that will sustain you until much later in the day. The dinner menu changed on a daily basis and was a three course serving with plenty of choice between local Moroccan dishes and Western classics. The weather is pretty much guaranteed sunshine from May to September.

We complained to reception and emailed and still have not been answered to the compensation we seek. Without the pool we were left with a much smaller pool barely a quarter of the size. The hotel would have been much nicer to stay in perhaps 10-20yrs ago where the would have been more than 25 guests in the palace. The bars and lounges were empty leaving no atmosphere to socialise with other guests. The belly dancing and snake charming dinner was not running either due to the low level of guests.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Ann_Marie252 wrote a review May 2013,40,A Real Treat,We stayed in the Palace for four nights. The hotel and suites are traditional and very spacious with a balcony and table and chairs. The bathroom is gorgeous slippers dressing gown toiletries and hairdryer (in the drawer) provided. Housekeeping did a great job cleaned in the mornings and changed towels and turned down sheets in the evening. The bed is extremely comfortable with extra soft pillows but we discovered a pillow menu on our last day! All the staff are friendly and helpful and will provide whatever you need; they mostly don't look for tips but are very happy to accept them if offered. The hotel is ideally situated as it's a 10-15 min walk to the square and is close to the main road but the noise didn't bother us or disturb our sleep. The grounds are vast beautiful and well tended. Pools are lovely surrounded by sunbeds with mattresses and the pool attendant will bring towels - 'baskets' with a canopy mattress and cushions provide extra comfort and privacy . Lunch time food is good big portions but pricey. We only had one issue during our stay in that we had no hot water on our second evening. I felt this was not dealt with correctly as once I had reported it there was an element of surprise and was told reception would get back to me. After 30 mins no call so I inquired again and was told it was the whole palace yet other people were going out all dressed up for dinner. I would expect a 5* hotel to supply hot water and certainly offer an apology for the inconvenience particularly as I had explained we had dinner reservations but the apology never came neither did an offer to use another room. We were offered the spa but I didn't feel having a shower and getting ready in a room with strangers was appropriate. As the hotel was not full I found this disappointing but it didn't spoil our stay. We settled for a cold shower in our room cancelled our reservation and ate locally at La Table du Marche (5 min walk from hotel) again which is very good and well worth a visit. On the whole we had a very pleasant stay at the Es Saadi Palace and apart from the water everything else was wonderful.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ann_Marie252
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Kelly J wrote a review May 2013,50,Relaxing and Peaceful,The Palace offers large rooms complete with sectional couches small dining table desk large comfortable bed and a quaint balcony with lounges. The bathroom was wonderful as the large soaker tub was lovely. I have to say I just loved the long over-sized robe too! The service was outstanding. All staff were accommodating and eager to ensure your stay was without issue. The food was excellent and the choice of items on the menu sufficient. My favourite was the spa. The treatments and treatment rooms were better than most I've ever had or been in. The facilities atmosphere and products were first rate along with the technicians. I loved the room of beds as a waiting area in between treatments. Gorgeous gardens. Location was excellent even with the busy road running behind - it is in the middle of the city after all.

We could not fault it for value - the food service and facilities were excellent. The fact that it was in such fantastic surroundings - acres of gardens filled with roses leading to the Palace Hotel in which we were made so welcome - both for dinner and drinks if we chose to made the deal even better. The convenience of being able to get to the centre so quickly was an added bonus.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Alice D wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Tired but lovely,"Es Saadi is rather tired perhaps because we visited when it was a bit empty. However I think this just adds to its charm. The staff are phenomenally helpful and friendly I can't praise them enough. They're always ready with a ""bonjour"" or an ""as-alymalykum"" whenever they see you and are generally brilliant. The restaurants aren't great although the one by the pool is nice for lunch. I'd recommend going to Extrablatt (just a 5 minute walk away) for dinner instead or perhaps into the Medina. Definitely stay for the breakfast though; just make sure the birds don't drink your orange juice when you're not looking! All in all very nice especially if you get a room with a balcony overlooking the pool and Atlas mountains.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Seeingtheworld wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Paradise Found,When we were taken to our room I actually gasped when we entered the enormous painted door. The suite is just gorgeous with fresh roses around the room. We absolutely loved the huge comfy bed and waking up hearing the bird song from the garden each morning. The gardens are kept immaculate and are teeming with flowers and lush palms. We really enjoyed the breakfast each morning. It is beautifully presented and changes daily.    As far as staff they are professional and polite. I was assisted enormously by Samir the Head Concierge in respect of work I was trying to finalise. He could not have been more patient or helpful.    Other nice things about the hotel: I really enjoyed the playing of live music each day and the mint tea! In addition the Spa is one of the most lovely I have ever visited.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Richard477 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,A wonderful stay - great value - beautiful gardens & pool setting,We have visited many countries over the world. Our party of 4 had a wonderful stay at this hotel (poolside view). Superb friendly and efficient staff. They could not have been more helpful - just be friendly and tip appropriately. Arab people are usually very friendly if you are the same. local wages are low and you should reward appropriately for good service. Very comfortable rooms. Wonderful buffet breakfast. Irresistible pastries. Good evening restaurant (delicious fish tajine). Gardens are large and impressive. Extra facilities available through the sister Palace hotel & casino. Very pleasant walk into town if you go left out of the hotel straight on past the cafe on the corner (good food) and through the hotel private road by the city walls. Taxis always available by the gate. Complaints about birds at breakfast? - must be nature haters. The birds are a joy. Sit in the sunshine and enjoy the breakfast. On some nights there can be noise for a short time when people leave the casino. It provides interest and all you have to do is close the balcony doors which give you a lovely view of the mountains from the upper floors. Sunsets and sunrises can be magical. Do take a trip up the Ourika Valley. Walk the falls.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richard477

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,debbie o wrote a review Feb 2013,30,Very Noisy Hotel BEWARE !!!,The Hotel has a lovely pool area and the gardens are well kept.Most of the staff are very helpful  some of the ladies on the desk are a bit sullen. The breakfasts are very good and lots of fresh fruit and fresh orange juice and nice breads  cereals and hot breakfasts are available  i didnt try them so i cant comment .    The worst part of the hotel is the noise that happens every night so you wake up as the people are leaving the casino  they love their hooters on the cars so they sit in the cars and wait for the people to come out. Our last night which was a Saturday night we were woken by lots and lots of cars hooting and people shouting at each other at 2 am there is a disco run by a nearby hotel so the locals go either to the night club or casino we looked out the window and saw lots of cars  it looked like New years eve in London  we were awake at least for an hour and a half  i phoned the reception but all they said would i like to change rooms?  you would have heard this noise in the whole hotel . So we were very tired by the time we got up for breakfast  i told the receptionist when we left and they just turned there noses up  they dont seem to care  so i hope this makes people think before they book this hotel.We booked a day trip to the Atlas mountains through the hotel which was nice  just a bit drawn out  they stopped too long for lunch but it was nice to see outside Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbieo636

We went looking for a bit of sunshine to escape the cold of London and instead found a place to stay that was just Great!! Es Saadi Palace. The staff were so incredibly attentive and helpful from the moment we arrived until we left. No request was too small or too big and the front desk and concierge were incredibly helpful in arranging transport making recommendations for dinner lining up a guide that gave us our tour instead of his and even directions to one of the numerous great restaurants that were literally a 10 min walk away. The room was large spacious clean and had a fantastic shower and gigantic bed. The spa was fantastic and the food in the restaurants was great as well. We also fell in love with mint tea while on the trip and they have a little collection of sweets in the front lobby all the time that are great--simple pleasures--but those really are the best.

From the very moment we arrived the staff there couldn't do enough for us. We were initially greeted by lovely and welcoming staff offering us tea and cakes. The rooms were also beautiful. The resort was beautiful and luxurious. Great location. It has a club and casino attached both of which were great. The concierge team were very helpful and we ended up going to amazing restaurants and on fantastic trips because of their recommendations. I would also highly recommend the quad biking and the traditional Moroccan cookery class in a Riad. The buffet at breakfast in the hotel was honestly one of the best I have ever seen in terms of quality and variety.  The only downside was that it could be quite noisy late at night when people came back from clubs in the early hours. Also the food in the restaurant or for room service was incredibly over priced. We had the same meals in local restaurants down the road for a fraction of the prices we paid in the hotel. The same goes for alcohol in the hotel.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyA275

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,lankaisi wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Beautiful hotel but mind you don't get charged for things you didn't consume.,We really enjoyed this hotel until we were asked to pay for wine we had not drunk at dinner.  We asked for a receipt when we paid in the restaurant but the waiter gave us one for red wine not the bottle of white we had paid for and kept in the restaurant fridge overnight. Then the concierge said we hadn't paid until we remembered we never ordered red. Honest mistake?  We didn't think so and it left a nasty taste. Apart from that the hotel is very beautiful set in huge splendid gardens with great pools. Rooms are lovely too. Dinner service was sometimes somewhat surly and tips are assumed by not returning with change which annoys. Perhaps that was the reason for the wine deception.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,mshbnyehud wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Exceptional in all respects!,"One can only say ""Wow!"" (and ""sorry I can't stay longer"") after experiencing this exceptional property and service. ""Wow"" when entering the hotel room for the first time (and I was only staying in a ""standard"" room). ""Wow"" when venturing into the gardens and pool area. ""Wow"" about the exceptional service and offers to assist. Any shortfalls are only nitpicking but let's list them just to be totally transparent.    1) Only one elevator to the rooms .  2) No buffet breakfast (at least during my 2 night stay) -- everything was ordered a la carte. However service was generally speedy and accurate. Try the Moroccan pancakes!  3) Fitness room is huge with lots of brand new equipment. They have a small ant problem and so I decided not to do my stretches on the floor.    I heard the Spa was ""very expensive"" so I didn't venture in except to use the complimentary Fitness Room (only open from 9 a.m. - 9 pm).    None of the above detracts from my overall five star rating and great desire to return here. And for those who might be wondering although La Mamounia has the reputation (well deserved) for its full top-notch experience Es Saadi Gardens - Palace can be half the price and thus a much much better deal for basically the same experience.",Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Dallas, Texas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshbnyehud

We were served a decadent and delicious breakfast every morning in our room. The restaurants were all fantastic especially the top floor fancy one.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,nasra07 wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Wish i lived there,I stayed here for 4 nights and i wish i had more time.    The staff were really helpful and always willing to do more. The room was clean with everything working properly. The pool was clean too and always enough seats - when the pool staff get to knnow you after 1 or 2 days they tend to reserve your bed for you.    We had half board but only found out that we could eat at the casino on the 3rd night - the food in the casino was to die for! I had to keep asking if they were sure that it was covered because it was that good. We spent 2 and half hours eating and drinking! We ate in the hotel the first two nights and i was really pleased with that also.    We went to a Moroccan themed night that the hotel had planned which consisted of us eating traditional moroccan food with a Moroccan show. This was fantastic! The food was really good and i am Moroccan so i can judge Moroccan food really well the portions were massive too. They had live bands belly dancers and gymnasts etc.    The hotel was about 10 minutes in a cab from old marrakesh and possibly 2-3 minutes from new marrakesh so it was a good balance. The hotel is stuck on to a casino if you go to the back of the hotel. From there you can also access shisha cafes and other bars.    I only managed to wake up for breakfast once ( its a holiday!) but the one day that i did go down i had a good full breakfast. Eating breakfast in the garden is like nothing ive experienced before listening to the birds and the trees it was actually very quiet on my table i think every one was just enjoying the food an the surroundings. I had soup and some croissants with almond something in them - it was really good! The fruit was fresh too.    The main thing i remember about this hotel is about how attentive the staff were. I was feeling very poorly one day and the staff asked if i was alright i told them about how i felt and the next morning i had the receptionist knocking on my door checking to see how i am and if they could go to the pharmacy for me!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Saif A wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"Magical Marrakech "" Happy"" Palace",We stayed at the Es Saadi gardens and resort - palace marrakech for three nights in August 2012. First plse note that there are three properties in the huge gardens: hotel palace and villas. In addition there is a spa and casino    Hotel- some 150 rooms and 15 suites which can be crowded during peak period  Palace - there are all suites from 70 to 250 m2 and also there are 8 small ksars villas built in berber architectural. These Ksars are ideal for families or group of friends. We stayed at the suite in the palace all decorated in typical morroccon deco including terra cotta tiled floors and moroccan rugs which we loved it.  Villas- there are 10 large villas up 200 m2 with own gardens and private swimming pool. Each villa built in unique design and colors. The villas are nested in the colorful garden but they are very expensive    Location of resort  The resort is located in hivernage where most of the top hotels are located and some 15 to 20 min walk to the old medina and jamaa el fna. It is a safe and nice walk including good pavement all the way past the fountains. I recommend staying out of chaos and noises of the old medina and instead in hivernage oasis where there is peace and tranquility    Suite Room in the palace  Our palace suite was HUGE with biggest and comfortable bed we ever have stayed ( i think the bed is 7ft x 6.7ft) . This bed is so confoy and better than all brand hotels.The linen and the amenities were all natural and of highest quality. There is a huge bathroom: separate toilet and biddet huge bathtub for two separate shower even for two to indulge in whatever you can imagine a walk in cupboard and large a safety box. There is a sitting room with large tv dining table mini bar with free soft drinks free coffee expresso and a working desk. At the private terrace there is a good view of the swimming pool and city with a day bed two sunbathing chairs and table. Amazing during the day was too hot but evening was cooler and nice    Service  The staff are the excellent and are very ken and helpful to ensure memorable stay. Once you enter the palace you are greated with morrocon mint tea and morrocon live local solo music. The check in is fast and swift and then you are then given a 10 mini tour of the resort (which you need)    The concierge is one of the best I have seen. He is soft spoken and did arrange for us two tours (day tour for old medina souk and the other one to ourika valley) plus arranged for first class railway ticket to casablanca. Highly recommended to travel by train - it is comfortable and relative cheap. We paid usd $15 one way per person for first class ticket from Marrakech to casa and takes 3 hrs and trains are on time    Breakfast is la carte and you can order whatever you want try the local dishes including moroccan crepes. More choices in the la carte menu could be added.    Restaurants  There are 8 restaurants in the complex but we decided most of the time to eat outside in local restaurants - try chicken lemon    Spa el Saadi palace  Has large indoor heated pool and is really a place for relaxation and serenity and opens 9 to 9  My wife and myself had 80 min the Marrakech Hammam with body scrub with wrap massage and essential oil moisturizing. The ancestral ritual of the morrocon Hammad is a blissful experience where the skin after having been exfoliated with black soap and then covered with ghasssoul earth is cleared of all impurities and leaves smooth and cool skin    My wife endulged herself with rose and Argan facial treatment. Whe you visit Marakesh do put forget to buy Argan natural products which you vpcan either get at the market or at the ourika valley cooperative factory some 45 min drive from Marrakech    Overall the highest standard facilities and the service in this resort is the best i have seen plus great location and good value for money (paid via hotels.com some usd 450 per day for a suite at the palace) . I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely inform my friends and relatives and will come back    I think one reviewers wasn't happy because some staff could not speak proper English - but there are many who speak    Go for it and you won't regret I promise!,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Muscat,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/302saifa

That is why it feels like you are home amongst your most trusted friends. And of course it has comfort and they make you comfortable. The location was perfect for me near the Medina but in the chic part of town. This is a must stay. The gardens pools and spa are superb so much detail and attention is paid to these places.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,AnthonyBidulka wrote a review May 2012,50,Exemplary Service and Style at Es Saadi Palace,I‚Äôve just spent a week at the Es Saadi Palace in Marrakech. My experience with Es Saadi however began long before I ever got to Morocco. Never having stayed at the Es Saadi or been to Marrakech before I began planning far in advance. I wished to arrange things as much as possible before I got there to ensure the experience was what I wished it to be. Which it has been. None of this early planning would have been possible without the able help and assurances of the Es Saadi reservation agents especially Lamia Alfa and Nadine Jadari who answered all of my questions and made reservations at several restaurants along with Concierges Mr. Errouk and Samir Alalaoui once I arrived.  My first introduction to Es Saadi Palace was the friendly driver awating my arrival at the Marrakech airport. A friendly face where he is promised to be upon first arriving in a foreign country for the first time is a worthwhile thing. This was my first hint that Es Saadi would deliver on all they promised and more.  Es Saadi is conveniently located just outside the medina. In a way a perfect location. A 10 minute walk will put you in the centre of all the action in Djema El Fna Square and bustling souks in the medina. Right next door is Casino Marrakech. Fine dining is in the hotel or casino and many more options within walking distance or short cab or caleche ride away. But when you want to escape the heat noise action of the exotic city the oasis of Es Saadi is nearby.  With luggage collected I was quickly taken to the Palace and greeted by music friendly door men and reception staff some hot mint tea and sweets. Check in was taken care of while I indulged then after a short tour including the Spa I was taken to my Villa.  This was a gift really. The Villa stay was an upgrade by the hotel. Of course such a thing is not to be an expectation at any hotel but their willingness to do this was itself a precursor of the fine service which would follow for the next week.  I am a bit of an oddity; a single traveler who does not speak much French and no Arabic or Berber. But none of this was an issue at the Palace (although somewhat at the Spa). My villa was the Art Deco. A spectacular place to spend the week. So much so that I changed plans to spend more time in my room! To lounge in my very own L-shaped private pool. Have a wonderful meal and wine on my outdoor patio with the Villa‚Äôs wonderful butler service.  The staff including the excellent butler service at the Villa was always friendly prompt and of high calibre. Whatever you asked for they asked if you wanted more. The door men in their smart white uniforms were also very friendly and willing to help with finding a cab or caleche or do whatever you needed doing. Each night I would return from my adventures in the city or medina to find my room well taken care of lanterns lit at poolside trays of sweets and plenty of water (which you will need in the Moroccan heat). The main Palace pool area is extensive and well taken care of as are the grounds of thriving foliage. On my last night the owner kindly sent over a parting gift of olive oil and marmalade. This was indeed like staying at a Palace. Many thanks to the fine people at Es Saadi for making my stay memorable and special. I highly recommend Es Saadi Palace.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Saskatoon, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyBidulka

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,JeffreyS wrote a review Dec 2011,30,"Es Saaid Palace... Arabic for ""Palace of Inate Sadness""?","I often ""switch off"" when I see what appears to be a long and bad review and quickly go to the next 5 star review because I only want to read ""good"". You will note by my other reviews over the years I am not an habitual moaner. If a hotel or restaurant is great it gets said..... conversely if it's bad it also gets said in an effort to advise others to avoid our mistakes. This hotel was one of our pretty rare mistakes. This is the 7th time we have been to Marrakech and seven appears to have been our unlucky number on this trip. We have stayed at La Mamounia Palmeraie Palace and a GREAT Riad Dar Donab all Deluxe properties. Unfortunately they were fully booked for half term and we chose ‚ÄúPalace‚Äù Es Saaid on the strength of TripAdvsor reviews. This time and unusually we were silly enough not to have actually READ the reviews but relied on how many 5 stars reviews we saw. Upon our having ACTUALLY read themafter the event we sincerely are at a complete loss as to quite why this relatively average property (compared to the Deluxe properties we stay at worldwide) has received more than its fair share than it ought of decent reviews. The Palace Es Saadi is a ""quiet and relaxing place""....... so long as you keep the double-glazed balcony doors closed so you can't hear the CONSTANT hum of traffic from the nearby main road which you can resoundingly hear by the pool area. This is a family run hotel with NO management structure[ that you would expect from a Deluxe hotel group and we certainly saw no sign of day-today involvement. We felt there to be an innate sadness to this hotel that we have not experienced in a purported Deluxe property before. We found there to be either false or no smiles from staff) and sincerely the worst karma we have experienced. We felt that the staff acted as though they were ""scared"" of the owner. From the very first 'next morning"" we were literally counting the days of our to return to London. The concierge[Unknown] desk we found particularly unhelpful. There is NO structure whatsoever for complaints. (again we are sincerely not a typical complaining couple) other than to the owner directly. We paid full price through Amex Platinum (who subbed it to Classic Collection Holidays) for an Executive suite (a massive 70 sq. metres (750 sq ft) of poorly designed room of which a third of the space was corridor with very poor WIFI facility) We requested a bed (before our trip) for our 5 year old but were told that she had to sleep on the small sofa in the room..... NOT even a proper sofa bed. We told them we wanted a proper single bed as supplied by other hotels of a similar and lesser standard. They eventually did supply a bed but ""....only as ""a favour just for you"" (verbatim). The Front Office Manager and Deputy both tried to get us to ""upgrade our room"" (already one of the highest category) at a ""special price of a further 2000 MD "" (UK¬£165 per night) ....we normally charge an extra 5000 per night"") so we could gain extra space for our daughter. (We had booked for 8 nights costing circa UK¬£4950 (excluding BMI Club Class) The Front Office Manager ""accused"" us of having booked through Expedia (it would appear that this is the ultimate sin) and then latter apologising for her mistake. It got to the stage where for the very first time in 30 odd years of being an Amex member we telephoned Amex UK to try to sort out this ridiculous situation. Incidentally the hotel on our arrival had only 36 persons staying there so one might have thought that every effort for a full paying guest might have been ""de riguer"". The restaurant staff (other than the Signature Restaurant) speak the very poorest of English resulting in a totally frustrating experience full of misunderstanding and wrong orders for the 10% (certainly during our internment) of English speaking clientele. The main dining room/breakfast room a poorly designed depressing and sincerely soulless public ""airport lounge"". The F&B ‚ÄúManager‚Äù had an unenviable job and had been in his post for nearly six months. He didn‚Äôt sound particularly confident that he was going to be there in another 6 months. The kitchen staff were continually shouting at each other. The service around the pool area was poor. One waiter (literally) delivering food around the pool. One day our lunch was delivered ""stone cold"" with the waiter blaming the 25 metre walk to where we were sitting! Food OK (ish) The two pools (neither young child or ""poor swimmer"" friendly (1.4 metres min depth) so if you're short even an adult can't touch the floor and have their head above the water. Holes and cracks ( See image...an accident waiting to happen) around the pool. Incidentally on 3 of our 8 days here the hotel ""ran out"" of the good quality pool towels by 09:30 only to replace them with cheap and threadbare towels that they use in the ""5 Star"" (see more below) sister hotel. There's a large taxi rank outside the hotel (about 90 second walk down hotel driveway. When you order a taxi one might reasonably expect there to be a ""flashing light"" system to alert the ""next in line"" taxi. Not here! The doorman walks to the taxi rank and ""handpicks"" (I‚Äôll let the reader guess the euphemism"".....) your taxi. We understand that the churn rate (turnaround) of ""senior"" staff is very high. The ""3 star guests"" staying next door in the sister hotel (Es Saadi Hote.....advertised as 5 star but sincerely 3.5 star max when we inspected it to see if it were any better than the ""Palace"") used the pool facilities of the ""Palace"". (Call us snobs but if Iwe are paying top dollar then I don't expect the pool area to be overrun by the 2/3 star guests next door paying half the price or less). The Casino next door is owned by the same family I understand and we popped in to check it out and in the main there were fruit machines in a thick cigarette smoke environment and yoy come out stinking. The Main Square is a 10/12 minute taxi ride....not a 15 minute walk as suggested in literature. Finally lest I be accused of being totally unfair in my review the owner has a sublime collection of Moroccan 20th Century Art which can be viewed on each floor and at the time of our visit was on exhibition.",Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salmonofthenile

Putting just another 5 star next to this hotel is not giving it enough credit. They did not cut one corner on this place. I just love it here they have a butler at your call and they make up your room twice a day. I honestly could go on and on. Bottom line everything is incredible.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,ParaisoGirl wrote a review Oct 2011,30,Three Stars for Three Star Service,"Perhaps one of the most depressing and disorganised hotels we have stayed at. The service at best was three-star and at worst two-star. The staff did not speak English of an acceptable standard of even a four-star property making it very difficult to communicate. Often no towels by pool. Food at breakfast was very acceptable but more often than not shambolic and understaffed service. The training at this hotel needs desparate attention. Certainly some of the reviews I have read seem ""suspect"" and certainly do not reflect my experience. (For the avoidance of doubt we stayed at the Es Saadi Palace and not the Hotel of a similar name next door) Certainlythe few English speaking families we met were unanimous in their agreement that they would not return.",Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParaisoGirl

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,ned_frubley wrote a review Oct 2011,30,Es Saadi good hotel with some shortfalls,I recently stayed at the Es Saadi as a single traveller on a half board basis and although the hotel was of a good standard there were some disappointing features.. On the plus side the staff were very friendly and the room I occupied was clean and maintained to a good standard. The hotel is set in very attractive gardens with lovely flora and because there are very few cats or dogs in Marrakech there are plenty of birds within the grounds. However on the negative side the food was mediocre. For exampleIi chose the fillet of fish one evening and the bone was blooming massive and when I pointed it out to the senior waiter he simply shrugged his shoulders. There may have been a language issue but a massive bone in a fillet of fish does not take a lot of translation!! There was a choice of restaurantsbut the one night me and two other guests decided to try the alternative to the main restaurant we were the only eaters and were outnumbered by about twenty to one. when we asked why there was so few customers rthe waiter explained that in that part of the hotel guests were so exclusive they preferred to eat in their rooms out of site of the public!! needless to say we did not eat there. I would therefore heavily recommend that should you decide to stay at the Es Saadi then choose the bed and breakfast option. Ther are plenty of excellent eating places within wallking distance or a short taxi drive away.,Date of stay: May 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Luton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ned_frubley

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Eric wrote a review Aug 2011,20,BE VERY CAREFUL - Make sure which property booked - classless owner,There are two completely different hotels on one property. Also be aware that the normal star rating system in Marrakech is not consistent with the rest of the world. This property looked like it would be a nice place to stay. I stayed in the hotel located at the back of the property. Which was disgusting. Make sure you are staying at the palace. The hotel is completely different. I will review the hotel property on the hotel site on tripadvisor. I have read other reviews whom have made the same mistake. I tried meeting with the owner after conferring with tripadvisor after checking in which stated the owner was easy to meet. I was told the owner was hosting guests the night I checked in. For the next 2 days I tried meeting with her to discuss my displeasure and ask to correct the hotel name problem so other guests are not burdened with booking a 5* hotel and getting a run down 3 star hotel. Which by the way guests of each hotel has access to the grounds of the other - odd mix to see the 5 star guests with the families and shenanigans of the 3 star guests. The owner set up an appointment but when I showed up the manager met with me and tried to put me in a suite in the same hotel a bigger lousy room. I wanted to meet with the owner to show her the shower nozzle that fell off in my hands. Before the meeting the owner did not make I asked housekeeping if I could look in my previous room. Sure enough to prove my point the hotel put the shower lever back on without fixing it. I brought it to the meeting with the Owner which she did not attend and the manager grabbed it out of my hands and hid it behind the desk. BE VERY CAREFUL!!!!! Very deceitful people who refuse to correct the confusion the hotel creates by naming two different quality hotels the same name on one property.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,compraschic wrote a review Apr 2011,40,Luxury,The Es Saadi Palace was used as a venue for a conference and whilst my other half worked and enjoyed the conference facilities provided by the hotel I enjoyed total luxury for a week. The hotel provides first class accommodation. The staff is multilingual and provides impeccable friendly service. The executive suite was palacial very beautifully decorated in Morrocan style the bathroom most splendid the walk-in cupboard a dream. The hotel and the room were spotless clean.  The welcome plates of fruits and Morrocan sweets were delicious. The superb flower bouquets were changed so often it felt a waste. Petals of roses are decorating the bathroom freshly every day even inside the toilet! Another nice touch is that the hotel slippers are in the shape of local babouches.    The Saadi do not apply yet the policy that all hotels should apply nowadays: to offer the choice of changing towels or not to protect the environment from the chemical of washing powders. It is not clear why the suite (one very large room but one room) had two enormous televisions and it was not possible to swith them completely off they remained on stand by again not environmental friendly.  I had dinner by the pool the restaurant provides very nice dishes in generous portions a mix of international and morrocan cuisine with impeccable service. The room service was very good and timely having breakfast on the terrasse with the birds and the view on the magnificent garden with the lovely fragrance of the orange flowers was an absolute delight.  The swimming pool is immense and spotless clean it divides in two parts with the bar in the middle you can have a drink sitting whilst in the water. The large one is cool at 16 degrees C and the less large one in an oval shaper is warmer. There a many comfortable loungers in the shade or in the sunshine and towels are provided. It is very relaxing and again the staff is helpful professional friendly and discreet.  It is a short walk to the centre of town and the main Square with all the tourist activities but it is quite a walk if you carry shopping (and in Marrakech you will). So you have to be prepared to haggle with the taxi drivers to get you to and from the hotel. Some drivers will ask the standard price others understandably will try to obtain more from the tourists. The economical situation is difficult for everyone and they have to try to get as much as possible from the tourist. Do not hesitate to ask help from the concierges if you have a haggling disagreement with a taxi driver they are very helpful and will listen to both parties very calmly.  I also lunched at the restaurant by the much smaller pool in the older part the non palace hotel Saadi there the food was good with large portion too but the service was mixed. A lot of staff present but don't seem to know what to do or seem to wait instructions from a moody maitre d' hotel instead of doing what they should do: welcome someone quickly with a smile and a menu for example.  The boutiques are difficult to find sort of hidden in the garden they provide the same as the souks at a higher price and surprisingly they sell local fakes of French haute couture bags!  I liked the fact that each suite had a different beautifully crafted door in antique style with a real key not the horrid credit card type of keys that you see so often these days.  If you stay all the time in the Es Saadi Palace you can relax nicely but you will have seen nothing of the real Morroco but for work or as part of a holiday it is very luxury place to stay in.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled on business,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/compraschic

Also very good breakfast and excellent Moroccan restaurant upstairs. Pool is very clean as well so overall - great experience. However there was still one thing that was very disappointing - the air conditioning. Everything was working fine during the first night. After that the air conditioning in the hotel was switched off centrally and no matter what you did to the switch in the room - didn't help. It even made you wonder why you have it in the room if it's no use. It was quite warm for November - about 28-30 degrees but the hotel wouldn't swich air conditioning on due to ""winter time and people being cold"". One night I woke up and discovered that the heating was on (with +18..20 degrees outside)! After four conversations with housekeeping they eventually switched the heating off but refused to turn air conditioning on and offerred me a fan (or two!) instead - and this is in a 400+ Euro a night hotel probably one of the most expensive in Marrakech. So I had to sleep with my windows open which added quite a bit of noise. My colleagues who I was travelling with were complaining about the same thing - so can't say it was just me.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Alex_Charlotte wrote a review Jul 2009,50,Loved it. Best swimming pool,We stayed at the Es Saadi Palace (next to the Es Saadi Hotel but a lot better so careful when booking) for a long week-end in July with our three children. We selected this hotel as we wanted to have a nice swimming pool to relax in the afternoons (absolutely necessary if you have children as visiting the city in the morning with the heat is enough) close to the Medina. So we did not want to go to any of the hotels in La Palmeraie and waste time in taxis and the only other choice was Les Jardins de La Koutoubia which has a much smaller pool (try this hotel if you are without children otherwise stay away).  The simming pool is HUGE and we were not disappointed by the hotel ammenities. We were updgraded to an executive suite which was very nice (ask for it when you check in as they are not full at all). The staff is very helpull. We had a very nice dinner at the Cour des Lions restaurant. It's worth it.  Also  - if you are planning to visit the souks for the first time having a guide is a must to avoid wasting time and making sure you are not missing anything. we had a great time with the hotel's guide Mohammed  - we were able to add extra beds for our three children (369) in our suite at no cost  - check their website for photos of the hotel and special offers  We had a very relaxing stay and recommend the Palace especially for families,Date of stay: July 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alex_Charlotte
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,BelgiumReiziger wrote a review May 2009,50,"Pure luxury and class in the heart of chaotic, but so romantic Marrakech !","Marrakech is one of my favorit destinations and i have to say it's also thanks to this hotel.  It's an oase of repose in the middle of a lively chaotic city.  Everything but really everything is perfect. Couldn't mention one bad or minor mark.  It's not cheap but you get value for every cent you spend.  This is definitaly the most prestigious hotel of the city. Have stayed at La Mamounia La Sultana (small luxury hotels of the world) but not one can match to the quality style charme and romance of ""Es Saadi Palace""  Already dying to go back in june !",Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bruges, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelgiumReiziger
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,WandaSlack wrote a review Apr 2009,50,Stunning in every way luxurious and comfortable.,We stayed 5 nights and loved this hotel. It is ideally placed for visiting everything in Marrakech. Very easy to get into the Medina (a cheap taxi ride) or 10 minutes walk. There are really good restaurants nearby if you do not want to go into the Medina. It is a beautiful hotel with a stunning swimming pool (one part heated for cooler weather). The Junior Suit was extremely comfortable with the largest marble bathroom I have ever seen. The bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in. Breakfast is good and can be taken in your room. Wonderful views of the Atlas mountains from your bed. Service was impeccable and the staff could not have done more to help us. Do take a city tour with one of the guides they will arrange it for you at short notice if necessary and it is not expensive. We loved The Palace Es Saadi and could not recommend it more hightly. The only problem is that only a few people were staying when we were there and it would have felt more inviting with a greater number of guests. I can reccomend you stay at this hotel and you can find some really good rates on the internet.,Date of stay: April 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Topsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WandaSlack
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Austinprogress wrote a review Mar 2009,50,A real palace,We stayed a week at the Es Saadi Palace in March. What a hotel. Unmatched service perfectly organized refined and very friendly. If you want to indulge yourself that's the place. Don't expect disturbances just relax and enjoy the extremely high quality. do not come if you want animation and burgers on the pool. Very good value for the money.

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,ladyjane_99 wrote a review Dec 2008,50,Loved the Palace Es Saadi - Absolute Luxury - Al la Maroc!!,"We are staying for 4 days at Palace Es Saadi until New Years Day. The hotel is magnificent and we are experiencing incredible luxury and service. It is so lovely that it is hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go to the hustle and bustle of the Medina. In fact we are not even bothering with a day trip to the Atlas mountains having the most amazing view of the mountains right from our terrace living area AND bedroom of our gorgeous Deluxe Corner Suite. Every time we head for the Medina we can't wait to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel.    As I mentioned before we are in a DELUXE CORNER SUITE -- so this review is for lovers of luxury and prestige properties of the world. I am counting PALACE ES SAADI amongst these divine experiences.    Yes it is expensive but I am having trouble finding anything between cheap and expensive in Morocco. Perhaps as time goes by (given the economic climate) specials may arise which may make Morocco and in particular luxury places like this a more affordable destination.    Our room is divine and the lobby and gardens are just as beautiful as the photos --- if not better. Breakfast is included in our room price and you can have it delivered to the room at no extra price. The pool is lovely but being winter we did not have the chance to use it.    Expensive but fabulous. Restaurants are great. I travelled with my husband and mother and there was plenty of room for the 3 of us. If you do not want to eat at the hotel there are plenty of options in Marrakech which are not far away.    Overall I would say this is probably one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in on holiday and we are extremely fussy. The location is great -- just outside the walls of the Medina (old city) in a 5 star hotel area -- about 20 minutes walk into the souks gardens squares and busy shopping streets that Marrakech is famous for.    If you want to experience real luxury and do not mind the price ..........then this is an absolute must.    One more thing I noticed previous reviewers complained about the service plumbing damaged terraces etc --- We experienced non of this .... but I will include a couple of tips    1. We do not speak french --- but noticed that the ""hot water  tap was marked ""C"" and ""cold water tap"" was marked ""F""/    2. French is spoken more widely in Morocco than english .... since Moroccans do not really learn english you can make them feel more relaxed and ""understand"" you better if you can just say ""shokrun"" (thank you) ..... and assure them that their english is fine. We found that we were able to get what we wanted more often. Unfortunately if people do not understand you or feel shy to say so --- in these places (and in some instances) they tend to walk away and hope the problem does the same!!    3. Make sure you stay in the new section ... the ""palace"" and not in the old hotel. Also if you can get it at a good price .... book the deluxe corner suite and make sure you get the terrace with view of Atlas Mountains .....    We did not experience any road noise in the lobby in our room AND no noise from neighbours ... but we did at times hear some noise which we could not determine the origin (maybe maintenance or repairs? Who knows .. but we did not care    Palace Es Saadi is listed in the luxury and prestige hotels of the world -- and for many good reason!!!    We loved it loved it loved it!!

Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,Vincent38 wrote a review Jun 2008,20,"Good location, but not yet at the required standard",The newly opened Es Saadi Palace is a promising hotel but it is not yet living up to the expectations.    What we liked: the location close to the Medina the amazing large and flowery garden the large swimming pool the quality of the material used.    What we did not like: It is noisy (nearby road despite double glazing and tiled lobby which resonates from the air conditioning engine and luggage trolleys). We had quite a few problems with the room (bathroom TV fridge eneving service) which we ended up living with as we got tired of mentioning issues again and again. Not so welcoming of children.    All in we felt a bit lost and lonely (few customers) in this large but soulless hotel which has not yet developed the expected service level. Luxury is not only defined by the quality of the setting (by the amount of marble used or by the height of the ceilings) it should be a good level of comfort and an exquisite service: that has not been reached yet. They may get it right but I would let plenty of time pass for them to sort it out before giving it a second chance.,Date of stay: May 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vincent38
Es Saadi Marrakech Resort Palace,French wrote a review Jun 2008,40,Almost perfect...,We‚Äôve been many times to Marrakesh and always regretted the lack of top quality hotels there except the Mamounia.    This time we thought we had found a new gem which proved to be ‚Äúalmost‚Äù perfect‚Ä¶    The newly open Palace Es Saadi (December 2007) is located in the Hivernage area next to the Casino and its sister hotel Hotel Es Saadi dating from from the 50‚Äô.  I had seen some press reports on this new high-end hotel only composed of 90 suites and was eager to discover it.    First of all their pricing policy is very very expensive‚Ä¶ Official rates started from 500 Euros a night for the smallest suite‚Ä¶ Although we managed to book it for a better price the place still remains expensive even overpriced to some extents.    The hotel has a wonderful Moroccan decoration: marble carved wood panels different doors for each suite flowers everywhere. The park is large and very well kept with villas hiding in the trees.    We were told by the receptionist we had been ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to a larger suite instead of the regular Junior Suite (60 sqm) but I am not so sure about this...    Never mind our room was great decoration was very nice bed was comfy but walls were very thin‚Ä¶ so we had to enjoy our neighbour‚Äôs late arrival or early departure‚Ä¶ as well furniture being pushed around in the suite above us etc.    We also discovered some appliances or fittings were not in good shape (tap unfit window or door damaged balcony) while the hotel has just been open for six months!    Buffet breakfast was excellent with a good choice and opening times were good (from 7 until 11 AM). We tried the regular restaurant and quality was excellent prices were high too (for Marrakesh).    The Palace has two pools (a very large one and a smaller one heated). As it was rather quiet when we stayed there we did not have to fight for chairs or umbrellas.    Another good point: airport transfer is included in prices and a driver waits for you at the airport (please book a bit ahead of time). We just had a small problem on departure as the lady at the reception forgot to order the car but the issue was quickly solved.    We enjoyed our stay overall despite the noise‚Ä¶ but we think the hotel has a positioning problem especially with the high Euro rate.    Many high-end hotels are being constructed or renovated in Marrakesh but I still wonder how they will fill up their rooms once tall of them are all fully operational.,Date of stay: May 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/French
