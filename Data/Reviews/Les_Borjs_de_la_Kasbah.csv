Les Borjs de la Kasbah,richard_watters wrote a review Mar 26,50,Faultless!,Beautifully presented very helpful hosts and staff impeccable service. Just can't fault this lovely Riad.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Jan N wrote a review Mar 18,50,A Most Wonderful Stay,I can't give enough accolades to this riad and its staff. I loved the whole experience and I look forward to a return visit in the near future. Every single one of the staff was accommodating friendly and ever helpful. The public spaces including the courtyard library and pool area were perfect and I loved my room with a little private courtyard. The bar was fab and the restaurant was lovely with wonderful breakfasts and excellent evening fare. In my opinion this is THE place to book for your stay in Marrakech.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Wanderer619999 wrote a review Mar 11,50,Thank you,Being met by the friendly helpful Nora the manager with mint tea in the oasis that is Les Borgs de la Kasbah set the tone for a fantastic visit to Marrakech! It is a haven set away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The staff are all extremely helpful and very friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. Breakfast is amazing and sets you up for the day! The rooms are perfect comfortable and have all that you need. Great to relax around the heated pool late afternoon. The spa facilities are great and the hammam and massage were a real treat. But it will be the friendliness of the management and staff that stand out. Will definitely be back to Morocco and be staying in Les Borgs de la Kasbah again.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Jan L wrote a review Mar 8,50,A Fantastic Riad with a Great Restaurant,Fabulous! We last visited Borjs de la Kasbah in 2008 and were delighted to find the Riad as good as we remember it 15 years ago!    The director/owners Tom and Nora were delightful and a mine of information. The staff were fantastic always cheerful and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.    We decided to go half board this time (we ate street food during the day on our walks around Marrakesh) and were very glad that we did as all the food we had in the restaurant was delicious. We would definitely recommend it. Breakfast was also great with a lovely selection of bread cereals and made to order pancakes omelettes etc.    The Riad arranged a walking guide for us and we also did a cookery course in the kitchens which was great fun. I will be trying out the menu on my friends next week!  I must also mention the spa where I had one of the best facials I've ever had.    The room was very comfortable. Our only (minor) complaint would be that the lights were a bit gloomy but apart from that it was great.    Overall a 5 out of 5 week and we would not hesitate to recommend this Riad.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oraclegirl22

The hotel and all its staff were so welcoming the room spectacular. All the outdoor areas were beautiful and beautifully kept but we also enjoyed the TV space and the library. The highlight for me was the cooking experience- chef was brilliant we learnt a lot about Moroccan cooking and then got to eat it too!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Time4chocolate wrote a review Feb 2023,50,The perfect hotel. Marrakech at its best.,I’ve stayed here five times and will again. It’s beautiful. Everywhere you look is attractive immaculate clean a joy.    The staff are welcoming and appear to genuinely want to help. My son leaving at 5.30 am? How about coffee brought to your room and a bag of food for the journey? We want lunch at 11.30 am? Of course - what would you like? My husband’s birthday? A special table setting cake candles and staff singing happy birthday.    The food is freshly prepared and delicious. The spa a haven. We love sitting by the pool or in the flower filled courtyard lit by candles and lanterns at night.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Pam M wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Calm in madness of the medina.,We booked this Riad based on TA reviews. It is everything I expected and more. From arrival to departure I don’t think the staff under the watchful eye of Nora could do anything more to make our stay comfortable.    The Riad itself is beautifully decorated rooms very comfortable and exceptionally clean. The spa which I used on many occasions was fabulous. Hadisha is the most amazing therapist.    I cannot thank Nora enough for making us feel welcome and for going above and beyond. Nothing was too much trouble. A shout out to the wonderful Rabi on reception also he always greeted us with a smile.    I cannot recommend Les Borjs de La Kasbah enough.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L469WZpamm
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Swarmite wrote a review Feb 2023,50,A 'Second Home' I call it. Coming Home to High End Hospitality.,My first visit to this Boutique Hotel was 2009 and my last was last week.    In-between I must have stayed over 20 times hence the title of this current review. Before pandemic I would bring 15 people each year to a Wellness Breathwork Retreat I led in the Conference space at Les Borjs as well as visiting for leisure so I am familiar with what is on offer. Every time I visit it looks pristine with regular refurbishments. Tom & Nora do not rest on their laurels ( and laurels in terms of professional accolades are aplenty ) they constantly aim for top notch upgrading of rooms and public areas.    I haven't been back since 2019 held back by health and pandemic but last week felt like they are in constant refresh and observation exactly how a high end boutique hotel continues to succeed. I particularly loved the new courtyards seating painted pots and cushions with the Nora touch of welcome. Nothing lacked attention. Fresh as a daisy.    This includes superb long standing staff always on top of things welcoming helpful at Reception always available for the smallest request. We ate in the hotel some nights highly recommended fine dining at ease with impeccable service. Plus being greeted by the familiar face of Sharif at Marrakech Airport and swiftly taken to our hotel in 15 mins was truly 'coming home' to high end hospitality.    Having been back so many times and recommended so many friends to try Les Borjs ( I took 2 this visit and they were bowled over first day! ) we are already planning our return so 5 Stars all round to Les Borjs de la Kasbah.,Date of stay: January 2023,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swarmite

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Ben C wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Our favorite stay in Marrakech by far!,This hotel is a major reason we keep coming back to Marrakech! The attention to detail is not only reflected in the beautiful rooms courtyards and lounges of the hotel but also the superb staff who go above and beyond to ensure the most memorable experience. We thoroughly enjoyed the Moroccan-style New Years Eve bash (which we have attended before) and found the entertainment and food to be excellent. The highlight was all of the guests dancing in the main courtyard as the clock struck midnight. We also recommend taking advantage of the spa offerings especially the famous hammam! The various day trips organized by the hotel are also fantastic if you want to escape the chaos of Marrakech. We loved our trip to the Ourika Valley! All in all it is always a treat coming to Les Borjs De La Kasbah and we could not recommend it enough to anyone seeking a luxury stay within walking distance to all major attractions.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9163RSbenc

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,gracehallamSheffield wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Faultless hotel and service in a perfect location.,If you're wanting a warm welcome from wonderful staff and helpful and considerate owners... this is the place. If you're wanting to stay in a gentle peaceful oasis within the real vibrant colourful Marrakech... this is the place. Beautiful hotel perfect service comfortable rooms calm and pleasant atmosphere. They have a gorgeous bijou spa a pool a restaurant with lovely food a courtyard to relax in at any time under the orange trees (where you will probably be accompanied by their lovely house buntings!). You can walk 5 minutes from the quiet location into the busy bustle you came to see - good coffee houses and some great little rooftop restaurants are tucked away nearby the main square is 15-20 minutes meander but here you can come back and feel you're away from it all - the sound of the city seems to slip away completely the minute you step through the doors. We felt completely at home here and are planning to return. Seriously don't miss this boutique hotel - it is charming well situated and faultlessly managed.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sheffield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gracehallamSheffield

The hotel is a small/medium sized Traditional Riad in the Medina .  It is perfect for a couple  family or small group trip . The Riad is within walking distance of the Main Square and Souks .  Once inside there is peace and tranquility and the Pool and Courtyard are perfect for relaxing and chilling after a hectic day sightseeing .The relaxing spa treatments were reasonably priced and also we ate at the hotel not only for breakfast and some lunches but also on two evenings and enjoyed super local dishes ( international also available ) with great service  The Moroccan Evening with dancers and music was especially fun .  The rooms are traditionally furnished and each one is different .

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Bushey-Rob wrote a review Oct 2022,50,A very special place,We were lucky enough to stay here for a week and what a truly special place it is.    First things first the owners Tom and Nora are two of the nicest most accommodating people you could meet - and their team are equally welcoming. Friendly professional warm - lovely people who make this place significantly more than just a fabulous Riad.    And if you want trips organised or taxis to and from the airport - no problem at all.    My teenage son had a premium room. My wife and I took a suite. The rooms are spotlessly clean large tastefully in character. Beds are supremely comfortable.    Breakfast is wonderful and full of local produce (as well as Yorkshire tea!). The restaurant which sprawls across the  courtyard of this oasis of calm serves excellent bar food local higher end offerings and homely comforts.    The pool is heated and a perfect antidote to the madness of the Kasbah and Marrakech itself. After the wonderful sensory overload from the old town sitting with a beer by the pool is perfect.    The spa and hammam are also wonderful.    The Riad is very much at the boutique end of accommodations. Homely and classy in equal measures.    We couldn’t recommend it enough. A very special find.    As an aside Nora organised a day trip to Imlil in the Atlas Mountains for a mini-trek followed by lunch at Richard Brandon’s luxury retreat Kasbah Tamadot. Kasbah Tamadot was fabulous although we had been so spoiled at Les Borjs de la Kasbah it was somewhat of an anti climax!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bushey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bushey-Rob

We were welcomed with the same friendly professionalism (and mint tea). The air conditioned elegant rooms and cool of the pool were an oasis of calm away from the blistering heat and busy streets of the Kasbah. Breakfast is plentiful and the dinner options are good value and beautifully cooked. I had 2 massage treatments (booked at short notice) which were wonderful My sons will be cross with me for leaving a review as they want to keep this place just for us!

We stayed in room 303 which was absolutely perfect such a treat. Every member of staff we spoke with was professional and very pleasant (sorry can’t remember their names) and as previously mentioned nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them everything done with a genuine smile. We had an early flight and coffee and pastries were arranged for us a lovely touch. The breakfast was fresh and plenty to eat especially if you have a sweet tooth. The swimming pool an absolute bonus location was good and while it was less than 2k to the square it wasn’t the most pleasant of walks While I wasn’t totally enamoured with Marrakesh I loved Les Borjs de La Kasbah.

On arrival everything was on point a being at home feel yet with exquisite service - which is just my kind of perfect. Hosts Tom and Nora and all the team are always on hand kind friendly attentive engaging and really helpful. For someone that has never navigated Marrakech this was a lifesaver. The riad hotel is super stylish supremely and tastefully decorated rooms perfectly balanced and the delicate sound of the house birds all adding to the ambience. Food - breakfast lunch and dinner - are a feast. Local ingredients made to order and just so relaxed. I was also lucky enough to visit the on site hammam - where treatments are very in keeping - my scrub was very cleansing inside and out.

Originally we were booked at a different riad but the week before we were due in Marrakesh our original booking was unexpectedly cancelled (not through the fault of the owner I must add).  This was when Tom and Nora stepped in and agreed to allow 12 women on a weekend away embark on their lovely riad.    And just wow! From the most amazing decor attention to detail friendly staff arrangement of excursions little gifts to a sweet 16th birthday and not forgetting ensuring that every guest was looked after and their every need catered for!    I would recommend this lovely little gem to everyone! It’s so close to everywhere you need to be (10 minute walk to the souks and Jamaa Elfnaa square). It has the most beautiful spa facilities including an on site hammam masseuse and outdoor heated pool.  (The massage was the best I’ve ever had!)    I want to finish this review by saying a big thanks to every member of staff at Les Borjs de la Kasbah…every single one of you were amazing.    And lastly to Tom Nora and little Yasmine…you’re hospitality and kindness was first class. Don’t change a think! Keep doing what you do.    Until we meet again back in Marrakesh!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Aaron wrote a review Mar 2022,50,Beautiful Riad with an amazing staff!,We visited Marrakesh as a family of 7 and stayed in this beautiful Riad. Visually it was stunning with colorful decorations and architecture behind the typical sober facade. Everything from the courtyard to the restaurant to the rooms etc. was meticulously cleaned and cared for. Once inside all noise from the busy streets around disappears.    We flew in quite late the first day but were greeted with a full meal while our luggage was taken to the rooms. Which brings me to the staff for which I have nothing but praise! Everyone was extremely kind caring and prepared to help out at any time. Two of us got quite sick on the last two days of our one week trip and the staff went out of their way countless times to make us a special tea bring breakfast to the rooms even pick up medicine at the pharmacie to make sure we were as comfortable as possible. All of which I'm very thankful for!    The hotel offers in-house henna tattoos hammam sauna and multiple massage options. These as well as the swimming pool were very nice additions to our stay in Marrakesh on days where we wanted to rest or stay at the hotel.    In summary despite the sick days at the end we had a lovely stay in Marrakesh thanks to Les Borjs de la Kasbah and its staff. It is the perfect place to stay if you want to explore the city itself and the surrounding mountain villages and coastal cities.

It was easily our favorite lodging out of all the places we stayed during our 2 week tour of Morocco. Tom and Nora are a wonderful team and helped with every question and need. The meals were delicious--all cooked by a private chef on staff. The ambiance was the shining quality of our stay because Tom and Nora managed to create an atmosphere that was intimate yet warm and welcoming yet exclusive. Also the accommodations were top notch and beautiful. The purple bougainvillea were in full bloom and the Riad was sparkling clean and even had fresh flower petals in the fountain each morning. Tom & Nora's attention to detail is what made our stay even more enjoyable--the table-side fire heaters for brisk dinner and early morning breakfasts on the patio mint tea and homemade pastries waiting for us inside of the tent on the terrace upon our arrival and we won't soon forget the evenings spent relaxing in the salon with wine and good music.,Date of stay: March 2021,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadelineEllis

After a rather stressful year this was the perfect place to relax and decompress. As the photos convey the hotel is beautiful with various areas to sit and chill - both inside and out. Its location away from the traffic and crowds of the busier streets means that it is also very quiet and peaceful. I had a single room which was spacious and comfortable with great facilities. The restaurant is excellent with fantastic breakfast and evening menus and we ended up eating there most evenings. The hotel also organised an amazing day trip to the Atlas mountains for us. The main thing we took away with us though was the friendliness and helpfulness of all the lovely staff. The owner Tom talked to us every day to ensure that we were comfortable and gave us good advice on what to do (and not do) locally which was much appreciated. It was a lovely break and I certainly felt much more cheerful and relaxed on returning to the winter gloom of the UK!

The service was impeccable and the director and his wife were always very attentive and mindful to all their guests.  The highlight of the trip was the ""New Year's Eve"" ambient entertainment creating an unforgettable atmosphere of dazzle. The entertainment had plenty of variety and included all the guests from the hotel which allowed for some good mingling.  It started with cocktails by the pool and music from a local folk group. Later the fire breather brought us the thrill of live fire dancing.  During our six course meal we were graced by a belly dancer and an award winning magician delivering truly mesmerizing tricks leaving all the guests asking "" How did you do that?"". There were also other folk groups playing music during dinner and plenty of dancing with a DJ till the early hours of the morning.  The food was excellent as was the service.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,MichaelS wrote a review Nov 2019,50,A perfect dream hotel,I went there with our whole company (18 people for 4 days) to celebrate our 20-year anniversary after I've been there already about 10 years ago (with my wife). What can I say ... this was a fantastic stay it has been more than perfect and better than I could have imagined before - 10 years ago as well as just now.    As soon as you enter the hotel the vibrant city of Marrakech and the Kasbah Quarter fades away and you enter a quiet and relaxing oasis. Everywhere in the hotel you can see that everything has been made with lots of passion and love and they payed attention to every little detail. Rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom - every day nice soft towels in the room as well as at the pool the whole decoration in the room plants all over the hotel...    The hotel itself is really like a dream with everything you are looking for. Wonderful spacious rooms from big suites to smaller rooms (but even the small rooms are big enough and as nicely made and decorated like the larger rooms) a rich and delicious breakfast a nice pool to relax a SPA with hammam and massage a restaurant with outside terrace a bar with everything you need (important for us Germans ... :-) ) and much much more ...    The whole hotel has an amazing and very special atmosphere.    But the best of all in this hotel is the staff. I have been in lots of places in the world but in this hotel you feel at home and feel so welcome. Every staff member is very friendly and helpful no matter whether it's in the restaurant the SPA at the reception at the pool or even the maintenance workers... this is where the special atmosphere in that hotel really comes from.    Especially Jihane and Nora helped me a lot to organize our whole trip including restaurants our trip to Ait-Ben-Haddou guides Moroccan evening etc. They were there to help me whenever I had a question or needed help.    With our group we had dinner after a trip to Ait-Ben-Haddou and also a Moroccan evening with oriental dancers music etc. both in the patio of the hotel next to the restaurant. The food was delicious as well as the wine and all the other drinks we had. The Moroccan evening was awesome. We had so much fun and I highly recommend that especially if you are a bigger group like we were.    For us everything was perfect and I can't find anything to complain.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,kristi l wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Amazing Oasis in Marrakech,My family (husband and 8 year old son) had the pleasure of staying at Les Borjs de la Kasbah for three nights in October 2019. We had an amazing stay and would highly recommend this riad. We had debated booking at a larger hotel outside the medina mostly because we were travelling with a child but I am so thankful we decided to stay here instead!  The riad is tucked away from the main hussle and bussle of the souks but we still could walk everywhere (or take inexpensive taxis as needed). The riad is gorgeous with a beuatiful inner courtyard lit up with lovely laterns at night that makes for a wonderful atmosphere. My son loved cooling off in the private pool after long days of exploring the city (the pool is larger than it looks in many photos).  Our room was beautiful and huge! Probably the nicest we stayed in during our trip and we could not have asked for anything more.  We had dinner at the riad one night and it was fantastic (not to mention we could enjoy a bottle of local Moroccan wine with our dinner!). As well I tried my first Hamman experience here and it was great! The owners of the riad are extremely dedicated and passionate about the experience they provide to the guests and I cannot recommend this riad enough if you are looking for a place to stay in the fascinating city of Marrakech.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Constane wrote a review Oct 2019,50,An oasis in the chaos of the Medina!,This is a wonderful hotel! We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay here.  It has just what you need in Marrakech - a beautiful retreat from the hustle and bustle of the streets and markets. Our rooms were spacious beautiful unique and had great air conditioning. The courtyard is lovely (we played cards had a drink - yes it has a bar) and there is a separate courtyard with a pool. And breakfast (included in our price) was great and the dinner we had at the restaurant was very good.  We also had spa treatments at the on-property spa. The Hammam was fantastic - a great experience! And the massage afterwards was a welcome pampering during a busy vacation.  All of the staff were friendly helpful and very accommodating (especially the front desk team) - we always felt welcomed and comfortable.  Practical advice: it is about a 15 minute walk from the main square and souks. When it was hot it was just more time in the heat. That said as a first time visitor to Marrakech I was very glad I was not staying in the section right by the main square/souks. There are no cars there so you get dropped off and told to walk the rest of the way. Plus it is very very busy and I was very glad I wasn't staying in the heart of the chaos. Walking away from all that was worth it!  I highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay there again!,Date of stay: October 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErinC3032

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,andkam8082 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Friendly staff, intimate hotel grounds, relaxing spa",Hotel Les Borjs de Kasbah is amazing. It’s basically a mega-Riad with several properties combined into one renovated to modern building code keeping the original courtyards and updated the architecture in the Moroccan style.    Upon arrival we were immediately escorted to the courtyard for complimentary tea and pastries while they took our bags to our suite and started the air conditioning. During this time we also were greeted by Tom and Nora two of the hotel directors. They are very sweet and friendly.    Our room was a suite with a sleeping area and a living area with day bed and two chairs. There was a mini fridge (mini bar) and cable TV. The bathroom consisted of shower stall and bath tub and a double vanity for sinks so plenty of space. There was also a clothes “warming rack” that you can dry bathing suits.    Dinner was fine. The food was good and the service was slow but we are from America where wait staff is in your face all the time. So don’t be afraid to flag one of the servers down if you need something. I had menu de jour for 20 MAD which consisted of gazpacho arroz saffron and panna cotta with a jello thing.    Breakfast was included in our stay and was one of the highlights of our time here. Great selection of fruits yogurt and smoothies an omelet station Moroccan pastries and crepes coffee with either hot or cold milk juices and teas. They do a great job of presentation and food safety.    Pool area is thoughtful size of actual pool is quaint and fine.    We also did some spa packages - a traditional hammam and full body massage. The price was very very good for the service. It was a very nice way to try a hammam for the first time at a hotel.    Service here is very good. It appears to be slightly understaffed so we were patient with expectations. The size of the hotel and the number of rooms is on the low side so it’s intimate here. The grounds are gorgeous and there are many places to relax such as the courtyard restaurant/lounge pool or library.    On our last day the staff allowed us to move to another room that wasn’t scheduled to be used so it was a blessing to have another area with air conditioning to hang out in until our evening flight.    Wifi is strong and they have several networks scattered throughout the hotel grounds.    We highly recommend this hotel spa because of its friendly staff intimate grounds and relaxing aura.

The rooms are individually decorated with not a detail left out. It was my first time in Morocco but I learned that this hotel is a “Riad” with a typical layout of rooms around a beautiful courtyard. Beautiful architecture with carved wooden doors mosaic courtyards.    The personnel were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Perfect service. The owner is present. An English-French gentleman and his wife. He takes an interest in managing and it shows    The location is good. Within walking distance of the Kings Palace and with a little longer walk to the souks and the plaza where the snake charmers etc do their tourist stunts.    I’ve traveled a lot on business in five star hotels but I would prefer this one anytime.    Just yesterday the hotel presented an Arabian night with Berber singers and the obligatory belly dancer.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,mich4230 wrote a review May 2019,50,Great 3 night stay,First time in Marrakech and could not be happier with the hotel. We stayed three nights. The rooms were very nice clean bathrooms were very large. Service was excellent. The staff was very helpful and kind. Tom the director was very personable and very honest. The grounds were just beautiful. So quiet and tranquil it was impossible not to relax there. We had dinner there twice and the food was very good some of the best we had during our short stay. Breakfast was my favorite meal- lots of choices and delicious. The location of the hotel is great we could walk anywhere in the medina but were in a more quiet section of the city.    We had one small hiccup when given a recommendation for a restaurant in town. The hotel called to make us a reservation and then called us a cab. We were instructed that the fee should not be more than 35 dirham to get us there. But what no one told us is that there were two restaurants with the same name in Marrakech so we ended up and the restaurant that did not have our reservation which I guess was a bit further because the taxi ride was 70 dirham. So we got in an argument with the taxi driver to find out we were at the wrong restaurant. In the moment we were upset that the hotel did not inform us that there were two restaurants with the same name but in hindsight we should have confirmed the address or location before venturing out. Oh well these things happen. I would not hesitate to stay again and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Marrakech.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,New Jersey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mich4230

It was the best of both worlds on one hand a fantastic Riad experience complemented with the VIP service of a 5 star hotel. Despite our many experiences in 5 star hotels we have never seen such a complete infrastructure at the swimming pool (lockers bathroom facilities etc ..). The attention to detail is just everywhere I even could not distinguish the difference between a painted salamander on a wall with a real one! The personal approach of the people at the reception provided an ""Unbeatable service"" (advice of places to visit what to do etc ..).

It's rather difficult to find as it is within the walls of the old City. One has to park outside and walk in. A local showed us the way (fo  r a small fee😉). From the outside it looks like nothing on the inside quiet and tranquil. We were served mint tea while they checked us in. Good sized room with a large bathroom decorated in Moroccan motifs. The staff was very cordial and attentive. Within easy walking distance of the square and various markets. Breakfast was good - Moraccan fare as well as more regular choices served buffet style. Dinner was included with our room plan. It was just okay looked good but not particularly flavorful.

Situated at the south of the Kasbah a short walk from the centre of Marrakesh you'll find this peaceful and welcoming riad. On arrival we were given Moroccan tea and patisserie to enjoy whilst sitting in the delightful courtyard. It feels miles away from the busy and noisy streets of Marrakesh which is a welcoming thought after a day of exploring the city.    The staff here are extremely friendly and helpful and always greet you with a smile. We were also greeted on a number of occasions by the manager who asked us how our stay was going which was a nice touch. The rooms are clean and spacious and have lovely touches such as rose petals fresh on a daily basis. We also used the pool (which is heated) and the other communial areas of which there are many to relax in.    There is a modest continental breakfast which is topped off with an omelette and pancake station where you can request your order each morning. The lunch and evening meal options are tasty and we ate here twice enjoying both of our meals.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Sarah H wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Wonderful hotel,We stayed here in January for 3 nights (myself husband and 2 grown up sons) and we all loved the hotel.  The rooms were really comfortable with everythingi you needed - heating (which took the chill off in the morning) mini bar safe dressing gowns(handy for using the heated swimming pool) lovely fluffy towels. The staff were very friendly and helpful - showing us where to go arranging taxis etc  The breakfast selection was excellent (particular favorites were the crepes and the omelettes). We also ate an evening meal in the hotel on 2 occasions - superb food (although there wasn't a lot of choice for my vegetarian son). When we didn't eat at the hotel we still enjoyed sitting in the comfortable bar and having a drink. There are lots of nice areas to sit and read a book have a drink or just relax.  The hotel is in a great location as well - easy to walk into the main squares and within easy reach of the sights in the old town.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahhC3905CX

And i wasn't disapointed. An origional Riad sympathetically restored into a hotel with class which offers excellent rooms and service. One of the directors was available every day but i had no reason to contact him with complaints just to praise the ambience he has created. Marrakesh can be a full on assault on the senses which is fun but the hotel provides a perfect redress to the mayhem which the medina creates.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Francisca G wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Authentic Boutique Luxury Riad,Surely the prettiest hidden Riad in the heart of Marrakech - a soulful sanctuary within the busy city. Its beautiful mosaic floors and four stunning patios (with a pool and great spa area) with endless rose patels and bespoke furniture make this place a true Moroccan luxury experience itself. My family and I enjoyed our stay with a great breakfast buffet (the Moroccan crepe lady was so nice and memorized all our favourite ingredients) the cool receptionists Rabi and Omar (they truly know how to select the sweetest tangerines ;) and also book the best tours) and of course the lovely owners who immediately made us feel like we're part of their family and constantly exceeded all expectations by surprising us with little goodies and pastries presents etc. - they all made our stay so unique and hard for us to leave. It's a top notch boutique Riad (18 rooms only) which is way more authentic and uniquely luxurious than any hotel ressort. So after our 7-nights stay we can say that it is truly of best value.  Besides if you are thinking about spending NYE here - this is the only place offering a gala dinner party with high-end F&B and top entertainment throughout the entire night.    BTW: And no nobody asked me to write this posting ;) it just truly happens to be this perfect.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,WaltherRyff wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Excellent value for money,This is an elegant impeccably clean and friendly Riad. My fourth stay in Marrakech and this is the best place I’ve stayed at. The staff are wonderful: courteous and hard working every one of them from Tom the manager to the receptionists waiting staff and spa staff. I was in a single cosy room with a sunny terrace outside. I appreciated the fact that bathrobes were provided. The Riad’s facilities are excellent—especially the spa with full Hammam and heated swimming pool. I swam every day I was here (late December) and the pool was always very comfortably warm. One thing to note—the pool area doesn’t get much sun in December and there’s no roof terrace. I had a variety of spa treatments massages and Hammam and all were superb (as someone with arthritis who has a lot of massages I am pleased to say the masseuse is really skilled). For me the only letdown was the restaurant. The selection of dishes in the restaurant is quite limited and the food in my opinion pretty mediocre compared to elsewhere in Marrakech. As others have noted (see reviews for the Jasmin restaurant) the food is over-seasoned: twice my tagine was virtually inedible. But! That should NOT put you off staying here. It’s a wonderful peaceful place and excellent value for money. Many thanks to Tom and all the staff for a wonderful visit. I highly recommend Les Borjs. By the way it feels safe here—Marrakech is a bustling city with its fair share of scammers but travellers of all kinds should feel comfortable in this area.

From the moment I crossed the threshold to the moment I departed I was made to feel like I was the only guest. My room was comfortable with satellite tv a mini bar & a well appointed bathroom. These are things you would expect to find but the level of service is well beyond what is expected. The young lady on reception who checked me in on arrival presented me with the best mint tea I have had in all time in Morocco accompanied by a selection of home made biscuits. Once settled in she gave me a guided tour of the spa pool bar & restaurant. Breakfast has to be seen to be believed the choice & variety are first class. The location is ideal for the main square & souks. I wish I had been able to stay for longer. The staff both front of house & behind are a credit to this fantastic riad.

The Decor inside and out is tasteful and charming. It’s clean.

We had a back massage in the spa which was great value for money though one downside was that the beds didn’t have the hole for your head so I got a bit of a crick in the neck. No big deal though. The food and drinks are reasonable and tasty. There is a lovely library to sit and read in or just to chill. Mint tea aplenty. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room but we called reception to ask for coffee in our room and they brought it to us for no cost and promptly. Get the staff to arrange your taxis from the hotel because then you won’t get ripped off (they use a specific taxi company). You can walk to the Médina and the souks from the hotel.

It's located in a 'quieter' area of the medina with the peace being interrupted only by cockerels and the call for prayer. However as soon as you step outside you're hit by the commotion of what defines Marrakech.  Rooms are spacious and whilst being equipped with everything necessary are distinctly Moroccan. The staff are excellent - warm friendly and helpful. Breakfast is a treat. The food is wonderfully fresh homemade and mainly local.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Bel Warren wrote a review Oct 2018,20,A very disappointing way to end our honeymoon,We were in Morocco for a week and we stayed in this hotel for our final night. Unfortunately the hotel was so poor that it really cast a shadow over the end of our honeymoon. Outlined below are a list of the issues we faced. Some are relatively minor but nonetheless all add up to a really sub-par experience.    1/ The location was questionable with a group of between 4-10 young men constantly loitering outside. The hotel staff were not seen to approach them or try and deal with the problem but we were followed or hassled every single time we arrived at or left the hotel.    2/ At check in we were not asked for any travel vouchers but these were then demanded at check out before they would complete the process. There was no suggestion they even knew it was our honeymoon!    3/ Safe was unlocked with master key rather than any electronic combination meaning the hotel and potentially any number of other individuals would have access.    4/ Bathroom grout was mouldy + bath didn’t drain properly    5/ Toilet didn’t flush properly    6/‘Hot’ water in bathroom was lukewarm at best    7/ Loud music in patio playing until 11pm with no guests in the courtyard but rooms opening onto the space. Not very peaceful! Why have music at all?    8/ Breakfast was scarce and looked very tired (fruit brown meat looked tired bread stale. ‘Fresh orange juice’ was just orange squash. Omelette was burnt due to being left unattended when cooking. Coffee served at breakfast was cold. Ironically there was no chocolate at all in two pains au chocolat.    The staff were certainly friendly so of course none of the above is anyone’s fault in particular- to sum up: we were disappointed.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/208belc

Rooms are spacious and decorated with taste the whole complex has been renovated using traditional techniques - there is a very interesting book in the little library documenting the process of creating the hotel from one original Riad and the adjacent smaller houses.  We never managed to make up our mind which area of the house is nicest to relax in - pool bar private balcony spa - so we went to each in turns.  Not to forget the beautiful shady courts where breakfast and dinner are served. Breakfast is a feast in itself here lots of things are homemade and incredibly fresh! The restaurant gives you the opportunity to dine either traditional Moroccan or French we only tried the Moroccan part (not enough evenings) and were very happy with it.

We had already paid for our accommodation elsewhere but liked this place so much that we kept coming back everyday for a relaxing time in the jaccuzi and the lovely roof terrace.we also brought our mother and auntie both in their eighties for a massage they both loved it and kept asking to come back. Amazing staff and excellent food. Highly recommended. But the real gem here is Belinda a beautiful and sweet extremely professional showing all what hospitality is all about.

Everyone was so friendly and helpful the food was fantastic and I have not discovered even one place in the hotel that did not look absolutely stunning.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Ning66 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Oasis of calm in a hectic city,My husband and I and our teenage son stayed here last week for 5 nights. Fell in love with the place as soon as we were greeted at the door. Check in involves sitting on super squishy sofas whilst drinking mint tea and eating pastries. What a pleasant change when you arrive late and tired.  Our room was lovely and small touches such as fresh flowers was appreciated. The whole place was spotless and the food good. What sets this place apart though is the staff. They were all friendly and obliging going the extra mile if we needed help. Special mention to Norma who lights up the place with her friendliness and to the front of desk staff especially the young man (Rabii?) who swiftly sorted things out for us when our aircon broke late one evening. It is the mark of a good hotel when any issues which arise are handled efficiently and promptly.  We had a fantastic stay and hope to return one day.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ning66

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,s d wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Great hotel,We chose this hotel deliberately from the photos as it had a typical Moroccan feeling rather than a concrete international hotel. I must say that we were so impressed the staff were lovely the room was so impressive spotlessly clean a bottle of water waiting nice little touches rose petals on the bed and in the bathroom and bath robes. The continental breakfast was good a very good choice of fresh fruit cereals different teas and coffees breads and pastries cold meats and cheeses on offer to suit all tastes. I do not understand some of the negative comments Tom the manager was to us extremely polite and interested in how we were. The pool was clean and sufficiently large loungers by the pool with fresh towels always ready. We did book spa treatments individually but they did ask us on the day if we would like to go in at the same time so that we would finish at the same time which we did. I had a hammam followed by a relaxing massage which was excellent my partner had a manicure and pedicure which she said was better than she had had back home same for my massage. There were lovely common areas around the courtyard a tv room a meeting area etc very well laid and fitted out in typical morrocan style. The only niggle was my partner getting stuck in the bathroom when the door handle malfunctioned but very quickly resolved which is all you can ask. We would definitely return as we discovered a couple of guests were doing while we were there.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/251sd

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Lily O wrote a review May 2018,50,Solo Female Traveller in Morocco,An oasis in the epicentre of bustling Marrakesh  I stayed at Les Borjs de la Kasbah for 4 days and had an amazing time. It was my first time in Morocco and as a solo female traveller I was initially a little nervous so I informed the hotel that I would be arriving. They were very prompt in responding to all of my emails and assured me that they would do what they can to ensure that I had a great stay.  And they did!  My room was amazing- very large (much bigger than I expected). Very comfortable mattress. Large bathroom with Argan oil-based products.... The hotel itself was beautiful and offered me exactly what I'd hoped to get out of my stay in Marrakesh- an authentic Moroccan experience. It's in a great location- 20 minutes walk from the main souks. 10-15 minutes walk to nice bars and restaurants. It's also very close to many of the main attractions Marrakesh has to offer. It was off the main road and located on a side road but the road is well known well populated and easy for transport to access.  The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly informing me of the nice bars and restaurants to visit during my stay. They gave me a map to use but after I told them I'm useless at using paper maps they input the location of the restaurants they suggested onto Google Maps on my phone.  Breakfast was included and was lovely with a good selection of traditional Moroccan dishes as well as continental breakfast options. I also had dinner there a couple of times which I enjoyed.  I made use of the hotels other facilities such as a small library which looked out into the courtyard and the spa facilities which was blissful :)  I was very impressed when the hotels Director looked out for me and greeted me by name- remembering the email I had sent the hotel about travelling solo. He made me feel very welcome and greeted me daily and when I was leaving for the airport he helped me by contacting the private taxi company who were running late (I had arranged my own transport).  If I had to list any cons they would be:  1) Service in the restaurants is a little slow  2) The hotel does seem to have much change on the premises for cash purchases and it would take a while (15 minutes at one point!) to give me change whenever I paid in cash.  All in all I had a fantastic stay thanks to the friendliness and helpfulness of the director and the wonderful team at Les Borjs de la Kasbah.,Date of stay: May 2018,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilyo29
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Mikeyportsmouth wrote a review May 2018,40,Surprising little oasis,I had no idea what to expect and as our taxi trundled along a narrow side street and when it stopped suddenly outside the hotel my heart sank. But as soon as I walked in I knew we had struck gold. The hotel is simply beautiful charming and such a delight. It is centred around a pretty courtyard where the walls are covered in places with climbing plants in full bloom. One of the best features is a heated swimming pool which we retired to every afternoon for a refreshing swim and a cold beer. The staff are also wonderful friendly and so accommodating nothing was too much trouble. We also loved our room which was spacious clean and traditionally decorated. Breakfast was taken in a lovely little enclosed courtyard and there was so much on offer including cereals fresh fruit cheeses fresh yoghurts fruit juices pancakes and omelettes. The only disappointment was our evening meal and out of the four of us only one main dish came up to scratch. I ordered a fillet of beef served with dauphinois potatoes but the fillet was pretty tasteless and the potatoes undercooked (this is the only reason I have give it a mark of 4 out of 5) On a more positive note the hotel is ideally situated and we were able to walk to the main square the Saadian tombs (a must see!) and the souks. I'm not sure what to make of Marrakesh. It is manic exciting vibrant scary spiritual wild and often overwhelming but it was always so nice to know that we could return to our little oasis where we could relax and unwind.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cowplain, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikeyportsmouth

All of the staff were so friendly and helpful - we were genuinely made to feel most welcome. The rooms were spacious clean comfortable and very well presented. The public areas - in particular the main courtyard and the pool area - were a delight to sit in ... everything was so calm and peaceful - you couldn't tell that the hustle and bustle of the Kasbah was just the other side of the wall. The Riad is a little way from the main 'tourist' area of the city (about a 20 to 25 minute walk) but I regard this as a positive asset rather than negative and reception will always arrange a taxi for you if so required. The food was always very pleasant - breakfast (included in our stay) served up a variety of fresh food with pancakes and omelettes made to order. Dinner on both occasions that we dined 'in' was delicious - I can particularly recommend the fillet steak which was done to perfection. All in all we had a wonderful stay at the Riad and would most definitely recommend it.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leyland, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulandChristineXXX

The rooms were clean well furnished and traditional decorated the pool was fantastic to chill around after walking the routes to the centre of the Médina about 20 mins away.    Food was great and the tangine was excellent and breakfast was fine. There was always a member of staff around to provide ad hoc drinks.    We booked a trip to the Berber village via the reception which was a wonderful experience although dress for a climb and trek! We also had a spa and massage which was lovely.    Special thanks to Nora and the staff at the hotel who were very attentive regularly checked everything was ok for us and helped with any enquiries.    Marrakech is a vibrant and at first sight an apparently chaotic place but very quickly you realise there is a rhythm that makes the city tick. The Médina routes are narrow and you need to pay attention as bikes are up and down but everyone is respectful. Have your route worked out and you’re fine!

Tom the owner welcomed us on our arrival and was charming and helpful even lending us some cash when we hadn't had chance to get to an ATM. The pool area was a delight and we were lucky enough to have it to ourselves on our first day. The 20 minute walk to the medina was in our view ideal because it meant you could escape the hustle and bustle without being too far from the action.

It gave me the choice of going out and exploring in the city or relaxing by the pool or reading in one of the many relaxing common areas.    To wrap it all up Tom ( the co-owner) made a point of meeting me and ensuring my stay was going well which was really the cherry on top.

The staff at the hotel were always on hand with wonderful service and friendly advice about the wonders of Marrakech. The food was superb and plentiful.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,GaryInFairfax wrote a review Oct 2017,50,An oasis in the Kasbah,We had a lovely stay at Les Borjs de le Kasbah. The property is hidden away in a back corner of the Kasbah and has been completely renovated in the classic Moroccan style. It has plenty of amenities including a pool a bar and a restaurant. Our room was very small but not uncomfortable with AC and a nice bathroom. Breakfast was awesome with lots of cold choices and cooked to order omlettes and pancakes. The only drawback is that it is located fairly far from the main square and the souks so we needed to do a lot of walking to do our sightseeing.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fairfax, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryInFairfax
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,cscgesp wrote a review Sep 2017,50,We are SO GLAD we found this riad!,We recently spent 6 nights at Les Borjs and what a wonderful time we had! We were traveling with our daughter son-in-law and son for the first family trip in a few years and this riad guaranteed that any family tensions that tried to rear their ugly heads were immediately assuaged by the lovely rooms courtyard pool and hammam not to mention the fabulous staff. The beds were so comfy the bathrooms absolutely clean beautiful tilework everywhere and air con when necessary (we used it only at night). We had breakfast in the courtyard each morning and dinner a couple of nights. The location was a 15-minute walk to the main mosque a bit farther from the souk but in the (relatively speaking) quieter neighborhood of Kasbah. Tom you have done such a formidable job of creating a real oasis amidst the chaos of the medina and all 5 of us so enjoyed our chats with you.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,KBoy38 wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Perfection!,Spent 5 nights at this gorgeous Riad and wish we had more time to extend our stay!  Such tranquil beautiful grounds to relax in and take advantage of their great service delicious food and wonderful wine list.  We found the staff here to be absolutely wonderful. Always friendly attentive and greeted us with smiles. Nothing was too much trouble. We had booked for our family ( including our 2 kids aged 11 and 9) to join in their Moroccan night ( a fun night with Berber music Belly dancing and set menu). On the night after asking about the set menu items we realised that our fussy eaters were unlikely to eat the set menu items ( we loved them though!)We apologised and asked for just a main course of their choice but that we were still happy to pay the full charge for them to attend the Moroccan night. The hotel staff happily presented the kids with our own main course choices and rather than charging the kids the set price for the Moroccan night ( which included entertainment) waived the fee and only charged for their meal! . This was just one of the many times the hotel and staff truly made us feel like guests rather than a number.  From a location point of view we also found it ideal. It was close enough to walk to the Medina ( approx 10 mins) but far enough to allow some breathing space.  (TBH we ate out just one evening spent a few hours each day shopping but then found ourselves wanting to get back to this hotel to enjoy the pool relax and enjoy a perfectly made Negroni! )    A special thanks to Miriam the delightful breakfast cook who made our omelettes and pancakes each day ( always with a smile!) and Nadia and Nora for their warmth a bubbly greetings! All the staff were brilliant- I just didn't get all their names! And of course to Tom the hotel manager who took the time to chat with us and make sure we were happy.    A most memorable stay!

There is a casual breakfast each morning with everything you would expect on offer.The evening meal we had twice and both occasions the food was very tasty and good quality.  It has a good size pool and relaxing area unfortunately I did not have time to sample a spa treatment which I would have like but a member of our group did and said it was wonderful .  The hotel is managed by Tom whose family own it and he meets his guests and takes time to ask how everything is and makes sure you are enjoying yourselves.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Danielle N wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Probably the best boutique hotel in Marrakech,If you want tranquillity and outstanding service while staying in a traditional property in the Marrakech Medina I'm not sure you can do better. Moroccan style with superb levels of style and comfort and everything that you need for a great stay. Located in a quieter part of the Medina but within easy reach of tourist sites eating places and markets. The courtyards effectively shut out the city and are filled with trees running water and lots of birds (particularly noisy morning and evening).  Each suite is slightly different but all offer peaceful views  unique furnishings and plenty of space. The pool is a huge bonus - on site and big enough to spend an afternoon next to or in. A hammam/spa and restaurant on site mean that when you are tired out from the heat there's no need to look elsewhere and the offerings of both are extremely high quality. The dining menu includes both Moroccan and international cuisine and lighter meals around the pool are also good with staff happy to vary dishes according to individual requirements. Breakfast is also very good - with pancakes omelettes and local delicacies cooked to order.  But what really makes this Riad stand out is the personal service offered. The manager takes time to meet each guest and help them to make the most of their stay in Morocco. All the staff at the hotel don't just respond to requests but anticipate them too - truly exceptional. And the flowers scattered across bedrooms and bathrooms to greet you are the final touch.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Netanya, Israel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/744daniellen

The rooms are very comfortable and give a real sense of the Moroccan style. The heated pool is a wonderful place to relax especially after a morning of shopping- an oasis of tranquillity in a very busy city. However what really makes this riad so superior to the rest is the staff. They are all so helpful caring and attentive whether you are a lone traveller family or couple you are instantly made to feel welcome and looked after throughout your stay.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,charliewestenra wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Pure bliss! An oasis of calm and tranquility,I've never been on trip advisor before but signed up so I could leave a review.    Believe everything you've read. Staying at Les Borjs de la Kaspar is heaven.    It's a beautiful building remodelled a few years ago using local traditional craftsmen (no power tools) with big cool spacious rooms a lovely courtyard that is filled by nesting sparrows in the evening and a pool to relax by. You are surrounded by the gorgeous colours of the well tended plans. Traditional yummy Moroccan food and most importantly good cocktails. I love it so much I've been back three times now! Once I went adventuring and the staff helped organize lots of local trips and we so helpful providing good deals maps advise. The second time I came to write and the atmosphere was perfect as it's so calm. And this last time was to relax. Sunning and spa! I really recommend the spa. Have a Hamman to waken your skin and then a long back massage or facial.    What makes Les Borjs such a stand out is the staff- Tom the French/ English manager goes out of his way to welcome everyone. All the receptionists are so accommodating. The man who runs it during the morning ran out to get extra sun cream when I ran out! Fatima and Nadine friendly servers and Nora checks in with you throughout to see how you're getting along.    I love it here and cannot recommend it highly enough. Go!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Pearce wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Quality hotel which offers a welcome respite from the streets of Marrakech,I booked a single room half-board very much last minute and settled on Les Borjs de la Kasbah based on the existing reviews and very reasonable price.    The initial benefit to the hotel's location is that it's roughly 10-15 minutes from the airport which is brilliant if you have had to travel a number of hours prior to arriving in Morocco. Not to spoil the introduction to the hotel once the check-in has been completed but it was a nice touch to be greeted by the director and enjoy tea/snacks while the room is prepared.    My choice to go half-board at the sacrifice of a smaller room was absolutely non-regrettable. Based on the description of the room in square meters I was expecting a fairly small area however I was relatively surprised and happy that it exceeded my expectations in terms of overall space - which because of the cozy aesthetic comfortably mitigates any pre-existing concerns about the size.    I arrived late afternoon on my first day so I was able to enjoy the evening dinner menu which comprises of three courses for those wishing to incorporate the half-board aspect giving a choice of two options for each starter main and dessert. I was fortunate enough to have chosen the chicken tagine for the main course which cannot be understated as one of the best courses I have ever eaten anywhere. I'm happy to say that it has certainly set the standard of what I believe tagine should taste like in Marrakech if it is anywhere near as amazing from the restaurant at the hotel.    The staff although often caring and attentive (one time I was sitting in the indoor lounge and one of the staff closed the curtains to the main door and turned on the AC which I appreciated) are easily approachable and quick to attend to service requests.    As stated in other reviews cleanliness goes without saying - absolutely no issues is spotless.    Overall it's a great relief to come back to the hotel from the often blistering heat of the Medina. The social areas for relaxing are very comfortable and emanate tranquility. If I come back to Morocco I will certainly be recommending LBK to family + friends.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811pearce
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,emiliemariew wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Oasis life in Marrakech,Unfortunately I caught a stomach bug in Fes so we were rather exhausted (and not very optimistic) upon arriving in Marrakech after an 8 hour train ride. But then we discovered Les Borjs de la Kasbah. Described to us aptly as something between a Ryad and a luxury hotel this proved to be a tranquil oasis in the heat an bustle of the city. The room was spacious clean and not laking any of the comforts of home. The staff was polite and friendly and took excellent care of us. The restaurant bar and pool were of the highest standard so despite my upset stomach we had a wonderful stay.

I did the research but sometimes it's a complete waste and you don't get what you expect. I didn't get what I expected I got better. I was greeted  by staff not only upon my arrival but everyday everywhere I went within the environment. The staff and guests were all so friendly. Fatima Hisham and Elham were a few of the people I spent more time speaking with although everyone made me feel at home.    My room was always impeccably spotless. I loved how they left rose belts on my bed everyday. The extra touch really made a difference.    The meals are were delicious. I loved how breakfast was included. The egg omelette was delicious. My favorite main entrees for dinner: of course the chicken tangine and chicken cordon bleu. I tried the chicken tfgya and it was also delicious but not my favorite.    The pool area is great. It's relaxing and great place to start your day.    Last but not least make sure you have a Hammam. This was the best thing to do at the start of my trip. It rids all the dead skin so I glowed the entire trip.    Thank you so much to everyone at LBK. I will be back to see you soon.

They offered me tea and delicious cookies and showed me the entire facilites to make sure I find my way at the Riad right from day 1. My room was stylish cozy with dark wooden furniture fresh and shady (plus airco) large comfortable and very clean. The housekeeping did an excellent job. I e.g. just mentioned (not complained) that at home my mattrass is a bit softer. They immediately came to change the mattrass!    I loved the breakfast and truly appreciated that I could decided on taking a lunch or dinneer spontaneously without previous booking. The quality and choice of dishes was very good so was the atmosphere in the inner courtyard.    I really want to mention the service attitude attentiveness and friendliness of the whole (mainly female) staff absolutely extra-ordinary very diligent and professional.    In general I enjoyed the ambiance the decor the spa pool and sunbathing facilities in the Riad which was most welcome due to the hot temperature in Marrakech. I feel it was good value for the money. The location in the old Kasbah is very recommendable. In my opinion a much better choice that going for a hotel outside the city. In the end I could keep my room till departure at 16:00 h (without extra charges). True customer service!    The only negative comment from my point of view: I booked at the reception a guided tour 3 hrs for dirham 400 plus entrance & taxi fees.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Zkk wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Lovely oasis in the middle of the medina,Borjs is a beautifully renovated riad in the southern part of the medina near the Saadi mausoleum and royal palace. Rooms overlook either the pool or the courtyard where dinner is served; they are very quiet due to the ancient type of construction (adobe). They have all the modern amenities and include lovely rose-scented soaps and shampoo. Dinner is excellent. The riad is located about a 15' walk from place Jemma el Fna which means it is far from the tourist traps close to the square and is much quieter.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,711matthew wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Great trip,My wife and I stayed here having found an advert for the place at the back of the Telegraph. Booking straight through the hotel site we saved money got an upgrade (apparently the best suite in the hotel) and got free transfers.    Having never been to Morrocco or Marakesh neither of us really knew what to expect. This Riad is basically through a door off the side of a quiet street. The receptionist's customer service was second to none from the moment we arrived. We were greeted with mint tea biscuits etc and given a tour of the place. We mentioned it was our 10 year anniversary the following day and when we arrived back at our room found a bottle in ice waiting for us! Our room was perfect the whole place is spotlessly clean and the swimming pool is just right for having a dip or lying next to sunbathing.    Location wise it's pretty good. It's not far to the main square and really easy to navigate there. It's also at the quieter end of the old town and right next to a great cafe called cafe Clock. There is also the cafe Kasbah not too far away.  Our favourite find was the Nomad cafe which we went to a couple of times. Prices for food are cheap so no need to worry there. There is also another good cafe opposite Nomad on the other side of the square - the name escapes me but this is also very good.    All in all a great stay lovely weather lovely hosts great food. Don't come here if you want a boozy trip. Although they serve beer/wine at the hotel it's really not that sort of place.

I was not disappointed at all with this lovely friendly boutique hotel/Ryiad. From the moment we got there the staff and owner Tom and Norah were great hosts and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were very comfortable with great extras like the bath robe as a nice touch. The pool was a nice size not too big and quiet and tranquil with service at the pool for great salads sandwiches pizza and drinks. We paid for half board and there was always a choice from the menu and the food was very fresh and cooked to a very good standard that I couldn't fault it in any way.  The location is ideal in the royal quarter of the Kasbah within easy slow 10 min walk to the main square and souks. We went out early in the morning after breakfast at 8am so we could be back around the pool by 1pm as it was 42°F most days so good to have a nice place to relax and cool down at out of the heat. I would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone as it is big enough to have a lot of great service and well maintained decor of a high graded hotel but small enough with low amount of rooms to feel you are feeling like a valued house guest.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,JKBGood wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Sanctuary in the Chaos,We don't normally write reviews but felt we really needed to say something about this place! Where do we start? This place is an absolute gem! From the moment we stepped inside we were amazed at how peaceful and calm this place is considering the all the chaos right on its doorstep!    We stayed in one of the suites which was lovely. The room was quite spacious and clean. The only problem we had was the odd smell from the bath - which I would blame other factors not so much the cleaning staff.    The staff at the front desk keenly helped us arrange tours and guides for us and eagerly helped us make bookings with the spa. If you end up staying here and trying the spa (because your body might ask for it with the heat and all the walking) the best part is the hammam although I wish there was a better massage at the end of the treatment. We did go in for massages in the days following and felt relaxed enough but we knew going in that we weren't exactly on a spa vacation.    We loved the staff! A shout out to all of the lovely ladies who were pleasant from the start of their shifts right to the end! And Tom what a lovely person! It was very kind of you to take the time out and come chat to us.    All in all given its location facilities attention to detail and staff we would have no hesitation to come back with our children! Another winning factor for this place is that we were looking for a place which was clean close to attractions with a pool and reasonable spa; and this place met all of our criteria.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKBGood

I would recommend this hotel highly and thank the staff for a lovely home away from home during our Moroccan vacation.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D5565VHbens

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,kshin01 wrote a review Jun 2017,50,5 star experience in every way,staying in Les Borjs was the best decision i made in marrakesh.    upon arrival Nora at the front desk greets you like you just arrived in your own home. she welcomes you with a traditional morracan tea which was excellent while she handles the paperwork. she then shows you the room and i knew right then i made the right pick. this place is immaculate and you can tell the people who work here pride themselves on keeping a top notch operation.    i had a chance to interface with many staff during my 3 nights stay and they were all extremely nice and incredibly helpful. i came to marrakech without doing much research and Nora and others helped me figure out the best places to go and looked up other information.    i can't say enough positive things about this place. yes the location is bit away from the main square but i found that as a positive also. you will get to see the other side of the old town where you won't see too many tourists at night. i enjoyed walking back to the hotel because it gave you a different perspective than had you stayed right in the center. besides palace and tomb is stones throw away.    on my last day i got to meet the owner tom and i could see how this place has the dna that it has. tom is well travelled also so he knows what is like to be in a foreign place. he's had an interesting life which i think translates very well into what he is doing now. we had a pleasant conversation.    overall there's no doubt you will have a good time staying in les borjs. if you can't believe what i am saying tune into hundreds of other reviewers who are raving about this place also. i don't normally write reviews but i do so when i see an exceptional place such as les borjs.    to tom nora and all the staff i want to thank you for your hospitality and i will sure to stay here again when i come back to visit. cheers!    kevin,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Los Angeles, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kshin01

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Liam J wrote a review May 2017,50,Divine,A beautifully designed and thought-out hotel.    Perfectly blends exquisite Marrakech aesthetic with exceptional service.  Delightful design touches include the latticing the archways & bougainvillea. Resident buntings sing and play all day. There are several intimate and more social lounges set around a stunning centrepiece riad style courtyard and fountain.    The staff & management are beyond wonderful; calm kind co-operative but never intrusive; They will help you with anything and offer services from day trips to an in house hammam and swimming pool.    The kitchen dinner and day menus are excellent the specialties requiring 24 hour notice are well worth it the rooms are gorgeous (I stayed in four because we kept extending our stay)    I liked it so much I joined trip advisor :),Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55liamj
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,helen m wrote a review May 2017,50,Couldn't be better,I booked this holiday on the strength of other travellers' reviews.. also it was within my price range for a mini break. It more than exceeded my expectations. Upon arrival I was immediately upgraded to a double room from my originally booked single. Nothing is too much trouble for these lovely members of staff. I met the owner Tom who is British and makes a point of introducing himself to all guests. My room was lovely; had all the facilities and amenities one would expect at a high end hotel and the food is freshly prepared with a good variety of local and european dishes.  I think the very best feature of this riad is the intimacy and peace that it provides even though it is placed just within the busy Medina. The swimming pool is fabulous too with a small bar and snack area. Main meals are in the dining room and wonderful central courtyard. The very best value for money and friendliest establishment I have ever stayed in.... and at my age I've done a few! Perhaps I should also add that I am a middle aged female single traveller so friendliness service comfort and safety are of paramount importance to me.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Exeter, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenm851
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,fesaner wrote a review May 2017,50,"Excellent ""oasis"" in Marraketch",Les Borjs de la Kasbah is located on a small side-street on the south end of the Kasbah close to the Royal Palace. The entrance is simple and nondescript but then opens into a large beautiful courtyard. We were warmly greeted by the owner and his staff upon our arrival. The hotel accommodations and amenities are excellent. The breakfast buffet is excellent - the best breakfast we had during our entire time in Morocco. The pool provides a refreshing respite from the heat of the day.

The owners (English/French) somehow managed an exceptionally elegant hotel but with Moroccan character by combining 7 buildings into one well-designed hotel with a great (licensed) restaurant and swimming pool. Access is relatively easy if the owner knows when you are arriving.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Gary23 wrote a review May 2017,50,Outstanding experience,Les Borjs de la Kasbah is a wonderful retreat from the Kasbah and is a riad that my wife and I would return to without hesitation. The noise bustle heat and yes sometimes the odors of the Medina seemed miles away as soon as we crossed the threshhold. The main courtyard is comfortably large — and many in Marrakech are uncomfortably small or have tiny “swimming” pools stuck in the center — and the spaces at the perimeter of the courtyard with cushioned couches and chairs are wonderful places to relax and rejuvenate (especially during happy hour).    There’s a large pool (by riad standards) in a separate sunny courtyard with comfortable lounges and plenty of fluffy towels.    It would be hard to exaggerate the helpfulness of every member of the staff. They worked tirelessly and bent over backwards to help my wife when her luggage was delayed three days (Transavia Airlines). They repeatedly called the airport’s baggage office for us and essentially acted as our intermediaries with the airport bureaucracy. They also were very helpful in suggesting places we could shop for necessities. They had good advice and suggestions for restaurants in the vicinity and were cheerful and gracious to boot. Language was not a problem (which is not the case in some riads) and some of the staff were fluent in English.    Our room was very pleasant with ample AC (which we could easily adjust) and had a lovely sitting area and large bathroom (with both shower and large tub). The bed was extremely comfortable. The furnishings were lovely and authentic.    Tom the manager made a point of speaking to us each day either at breakfast or when he saw us lounging near the main courtyard and always wanted to know if everything was OK or if we needed help with anything. His care and concern (about everything not just our delayed baggage) were apparent and genuine.    It is at the very southern extreme of the Medina so it is a bit of a hike if you go on foot to get to the souks or to some of the better-reviewed restaurants. However to us that was a real advantage of staying here. The location though it looks as though it might be inconvenient is actually pretty close to ideal. It’s in the Medina in a real neighborhood but it’s also easy to get in and out and it’s very close to the Sa’adian Tombs and a few other sites (and to a goverment-run fixed-price store if you’re not eager to engage in hard bargaining in the souks). The desk will call a taxi for you on demand at any time so getting to the new part of the city (Ville Nouvelle) or to the Jemaa El Fnaa or to the souks or to the major sites is quick easy trouble-free and ridiculously cheap (10 - 30 MAD depending on the distance). Also the riad is located on a wide main street so taxis can pull up right in front. Many other riads are located on narrow derbs that taxis can’t reach so if you with them it’s a constant struggle through crowded narrow crooked alleys to get anywhere.    Les Borjs de la Kasbah also operates a restaurant. It has an extensive a la carte menu featuring both Moroccan and Continental dishes and also has a set menu that changes each night. We actually ate here all five nights that we stayed (we then moved to a different riad at the opposite end of the Medina for five more days). The atmosphere was inviting the ambience pleasant (even romantic) the Moroccan wine was inexpensive and delicious and the food was good. The Moroccan dishes were not gourmet but well prepared tagines tangias and couscous among many other things and were easily as good as any of the other moderately-priced restaurants we tried.    Breakfast was the only flaw albeit a minor one. Moroccan pancakes crepes etc. were prepared in advance and set out under plastic wrap (so flies couldn’t reach them). Since there was a cook on site who prepared eggs to order we’d think that it shouldn’t have been necessary to prepare other dishes in advance. Also breakfast was supposed to begin at 7 AM and one morning when we needed to leave early wasn’t set up until 7:30. Also to save themselves trouble on that day the staff had already set up the tables in the dining courtyard for dinner so we had to eat breakfast that morning in a room off the courtyard out of the open air which we didn’t care for. The coffee was excellent as was the homemade yogurt. The fresh sliced oranges and grapefreuit were juicy and sweet.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fort Myers, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gary23

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,CMPVacation wrote a review Apr 2017,50,BEST HOTEL EVER!,This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Hands down! Why?  1.) The Staff. I cannot speak highly enough about the staff. They were exceptional and examples of what everyone in the hospitality industry should aspire to. I got sick during my trip and they treated me like a member of their own family. They brought me bananas and rice to settle my stomach made me special rosemary thyme tea and cumin water (Moroccan traditional remedies) and thoughtfully checked up on me. Their care was such a comfort and you could tell that they are sincere in their desire to accommodate you so that you have the best stay. .  2.) The Restaurant. My group ate 90% of our meals at the hotel. The food was so delicious there was no need to look elsewhere. Over our weeklong stay we tried a selection of items from the menu and everything we tried was delicious. Get the chicken tagine. It is out of this world delicious! One day we took a 3-hour private cooking class where we made a 3-course meal which we then ate. It was educational and fun trying our hand at preparing traditional dishes under the guidance of Mariem. the sweet loveable house chef.  3.) The Pool. My favorite spot in the hotel was by the pool. Pictures cannot capture how beautiful it is. The pool was the perfect temperature and the courtyard was sunny and beautiful with its flowering vines. The pool-side food and drink service by the incredible Fatima and Mounia made spending the day there a delight.  4.) The Spa. My husband and I had a hammam gomage message package at a very affordable price. The hammam was beautiful marble and the massage room was warm and comfortable. We got scrubbed down and then rubbed down and after an hour and a half I felt and slept like a baby.  5.) The Room. It was spacious well appointed and nicely decorated with traditional style that was also comfortable. Well lit with separate tub and shower ample storage and a comfortable bed. My room overlooked the courtyard with windows that opened so you could hear the birds chirping from their nests in the flowering vines. If you wanted to get out of your room there were plenty of seating areas in the public areas that you could tuck into.  6.) The Attention to Detail. It may seem inconsequential but the small details really stood out at Les Borjs de la Kasbah. The mint tea and Moroccan cookies we were greeted with the flower petals placed daily on our bed the complimentary bar snacks during happy hour the music selections during dinner and even the towels at the pool! Seriously the softest nicest pool towels I have ever experienced. You can tell the owner and staff make the extra effort.  Don’t hesitate to book a stay at this hotel. You will not regret it.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Corinth, Vermont",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMPVacation
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,SacramentoLanie wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Lovely Haven from the Busy Streets,We stayed four nights in this wonderful hotel. It was remodeled combining seven houses (or riads) in the Medina - or old town -- of Marrakesh. The architecture and decorations are traditional Moroccan and so tastefully done. Our room was a junior suite - very large and so nice. The staff are all wonderful and helpful - they even sent someone to buy us train tickets for when we would leave for Fez. The owner came by to say hello and ask if all was going well. There is a nice big courtyard and several other sitting areas to relax and have a drink or snack. Also a nice restaurant. Breakfast was great with lots of choices from eggs to crepes etc. I had a massage in the spa which was lovely and very inexpensive compared to the US. A second courtyard contains a nice pool and lounging area. I have only good things to say about his hotel. It was away from the main square about four or five blocks and a welcome haven from the craziness of the streets square and souks of the city.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,sacramento,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SacramentoLanie

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Onceawaitress wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Fantastic stay in the heart of Marrakech,A short break in the half term holiday staying in this amazing boutique hotel. Situated in the old walled part of the city in the Kasbah you are immersed in the hurly burly of street life until you step through the door into an oasis of calm. From before we arrived we had exceptional service. When you arrive you are welcomed with mint tea and pastries in the beautiful cool calm courtyard. Our room was one of the larger ones as it had space for the extra bed. The beds are made with crisp white sheets decorated with rose petals and palm leaves. In the the seating area there was a bowl of fresh fruits and a bottle of mineral water. The bathroom had a bath separate shower two basins and a European toilet. The towel's were fluffy and plentiful and a few toiletries were also provided. The room had a safe for passports a good size wardrobe and a dressing table desk. There is also TV and satellite system if you have time to watch it! The rooms are heated or cooled by an air conditioning system which was very efficient.  The breakfast was very good a wide range of cereals fruits meats and cheese as well as pastries toast and breads. A Cook makes wonderful Moroccan pancakes and omelettes to order. And there is English breakfast tea alongside the full range of drinks  Evenings are started in the bar area with one of the delicious cocktails. The chef has a menu of international dishes alongside Moroccan ones so there is something for everyone. The portions are large and everything was great quality. Its worth leaving room for pudding!  We didn't go to the spa but judging by everything else I'm sure it would offer a superb service. The heated pool was a big hit with my 9 year old and was warm enough to use in February  The reception can arrange trips and tours for you and offer a wide range at great prices. We booked our trips in advance but almost wished we hadn't.  What makes this hotel so good is the incredible cleanliness the warm helpful friendly staff and the attention to every detail.

We were absolutely surprised to learn that the truth was... even better than we could have imagined. We could continue to compliment the beautiful junior suite we stayed in. We could align with so many great comments about the food. We could be another guest telling you to really check out the spa (as it really is better than a couple of others we've tried). And we could also just be amongst those visitors that left Les Borsj de la Kasbah having made friends with guests and staff.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,tour-guide-barbie1 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Peaceful and welcoming Riad,Peaceful and welcoming Riad close enough to walk to the main sights of the centre. From start to finish the staff at Les Borjs de la Kasbah couldn't have been more friendly or helpful (particularly the reception staff). The Riad has been beautifully designed and decorated with all areas well maintained. The continental breakfast had a great selection including freshly cooked omelettes and pancakes. We enjoyed a Hamman Spa massage treatment at the Riad which we would highly recommend. The only downside for us (being sun worshippers) was the lack of sun by the pool. As it was January when we visited the sun is not high enough in the sky to quite reach the beautiful courtyard swimming pool. However I would imagine it is quite a sun trap in the summer months. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a traditional style Riad in the heart of Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tour-guide-barbie1

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,steve r wrote a review Jan 2017,50,A wonderful experience,We spent a week a Les Borjs as a gift for my partners 60th Birthday and had researched in depth where to stay. Delighted in our final choice as we were pleasantly surprised at what was behind the front door. Atmospheric and cultural treats awaited us as the decor and design of the hotel was charming to say the least.  We were lucky enough to stay in two of the suites both were different and both had there own appeal. The lay out of the hotel is beautiful and peaceful but be aware of the dawn chorus depending on which room you are in. Inside Restaurant is cosy and the outside restaurant area lovely and very decorative. Cosy areas are abundant to sit and relax at any time of the day.  Breakfast was extremely good with very tasty fresh produce.... particularly loved the bread.! Plenty on offer and enough choice for everyone. We stayed half board and found the evening menu varied and very appetizing with an excellent a la carte menu if preferred. Staff are friendly and helpful and will do all they can for youbut don't expect the same from the night staff as one member in particular was certainly lacking in people skills.  Completely fell for the charms of the lovely receptionists Inham and Nora who made up for any shortfall in others. Spotlessly clean hotel hidden from the hussle and bustle of the city and would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Owner Tom was also available and helpful when needed and will try and resolve any issues you may have.

The hotel is fantastic however it is the staff who really make this hotel stand out. The kind friendly and knowledgable team will impress even the most travelled guests.  I particularly love the 15 minute walk into the main square passing the spice shops fruit juice stands and smoky bar b ques. Keep an eye open for the donut guy selling huge sugar coated 10 cent donuts. He is on the right as you enter Rue Kasbah. Buy a bunch for less than one Euro and share them with any kids hanging around. Their smiles and politeness a true reward.

Everybody was very friendly and nothing was ever a problem. We enjoyed all that was to offer in the hotel and look forward to going back in the next year or so. We enjoyed several excursions organised by the hotel so we knew what we were paying and didn't have to worry about getting there or back as we had door to door pick up/return everytime.

It boasts of a great location right in the heart of the Kasbah and is right in-between a Riad and a resort. You have all the amenities without losing the cozy feeling of a boutique hotel. I loved the decor which is very traditional Berber/Arabian colors and themes. The owner Tom is very visible and friendly and is passionate about running a family friendly hotel. Le Borjs was definitely the highlight of our stay in Marrakech. The staff is very friendly and you get the feeling that everything is possible as they can arrange any tour experience or guide to make your experience better. We got to personally know Nora Hesham Nadia and Fathima. Take advantages of their spa treatment you will get a bang for your buck and your body will thank you. Also take advantage of their dinner package and save yourself the hassle of going out. This place has earned every single one of its five stars! Only regret is not planning a longer stay here.

Every effort was made to make our visit easy and problem-free.

The staff are brilliant the service is as you'd expect in a top 5* hotel and we really couldn't fault anything about the place. We were lucky that it was almost empty whilst we were there so we had the whole place to ourselves most of the time and we were upgraded to one of the suites for almost nothing which was really generous and accommodating of them.    The Riad itself is around a 20 minute walk from the main square but it's a simple route we actually had building works going on right outside the Riad whilst we stayed there but as soon as you walked through the doors there was silence it's a really peaceful and tranquil little escape. Also make sure that you eat at the Le Jasmin restaurant in the evening at least once it's a genuinely top restaurant in it's own right and as good as any food that we had whilst in Marrakech!    Overall I couldn't recommend this Riad enough my parents went to Marrakech a month after we did and decided to stay in a posh hotel costing three times as much they came back really underwhelmed and wished they'd took my recommendation to stay here.

The whole hotel is very clean and rooms have different designs on the bed everyday which was nice touch. Rooms spacious and well equipped.  Meal meals were good for half board basis with enough variety. For breakfast you must try the crepes and omelettes which are freshly made to your requirements.

We booked a suite and on arrival we were given their best suite...the 303.  During our entire visit we and all other guest were treated as royals.  The level of service from the complete staff was fantastic ! Everybody was so nice.  The manager Tom came every morning in the breakfast patio to greet all the guest personally.  The day of our anniversary they surprised us with a romantic diner in a cosy place adjacent from one of the patio's.  A nicely decorated table with lamps flowers and...sparkling wine. A special menu was presented to us printed on a paper with our name on it was a marvelous celebration.  Room was large good double bed with quality sheets and pillows great bathroom with bath and separate shower with high (!) water pressure and free amenities. The soap in the dispenser in the shower had a nice fragrance like roses.  Although it was very hot during our stay (40-44° C) the aircon in the room did his job without a problem.  Room was kept very clean and there were rose petals on the bed every day !  The layout of the Riad was marvelous lots of hidden corners were you can relax two nice patio's of which one with orange trees and a fountain in the middle just idyllic.  Nice swimmingpool available with enough sunbeds and free towel service. If you desire a service on the poolside you just have to push a button and the staff comes to you for your order...even a simple bottle of water was then presented in a nice ice bukked to keep it cool.  Breakfast was OK dinner was good a three course diner for the half board guests you can choose between two items in every course. A la cart is also available with some (small) extra costs.  Wines...available good and...affordable !  Enjoyed the happy our...6-7 pm with great cocktails !  It's a 20 min. walk to the square and there is a small shop approx. 100 meter to the left to buy large water bottles.  Said all this we are still in a daze because of the great service we received.

I booked directly with hotel requesting the room 303 (as it was stated best room with a view to pool and was suitable for us as a family of three plus they had special offer on for stay of 4 or more nights free cooking class spa day day out with guide or bit of all three options). I received email confirming all done apart from that offer was only for two people and we wld have to pay for our daughter.  Couple of days before holiday I received a call from Tom (manager) apologising for double booking room 303 and offering room 107 instead.At that point I wasn't too happy but Tom convinced me that our stay is going to be a VIP one.  Now the moment we walked in this Riad we were treated like VIP's with a bucket full of complimentary treatments. Tom even offered our daughter a Complimentary separate room next to 107. Room 107 is beautifully decorated with a nice clean and modern bathroom. Would definitely recommend staying in that room.  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Nora's hospitality was exceptional she definitely made us feel like royality. we thoroughly enjoyed our spa treatments cooking class and a guided tour of marrakech.  Beautiful clean quiet Riad with a touch of both modern and traditional touches.

It was my first time in Marrakesh and booking this riad was the reason why I wanted to come back to Morocco as soon as I left.    My sister and I arrived in the evening and were picked up from the airport nice and easy. Got to the riad and was welcomed with a mint tea and a few nibbles. I believe it was one of the riad managers who then came to speak to us who was very welcoming.    The room we were given was lovely. I stayed with my sister and we found it funny that our bed and bathroom had rose petals scattered all over...but it was a nice touch.    DINING:  Arriving quite late we were pleased to find out we were able to dine in-house without making reservations. The food and service was exquisite. Lovely atmosphere for me to try my first Moroccan Tagine ha! Breakfast is complimentary and there was a vast array of food for us to choose from. You can also request for pancakes omelettes and so forth.    During our stay I had two massages and a Hammam. The experience was incredible and the lady was so nice! The riad also had a decent sized pool which we used.    All in all the riad is close to everything and easy to walk back to (without getting lost). I stayed at a different riad with my partner this year and it definitely made me realise how good this riad is. I'll definitely come back!

From the time of arrival staff were welcoming courteous and helpful and constantly going the extra mile to make our stay a pleasant one. They are a credit to management. Wide choice was available for breakfast. The new town was easily accessible about half an hour walk away with lots of things to see and do. I would recommend to anybody.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salehsaumtally
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Normski123 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,What's cooking?,I didn't stay at this Riad although having seen the quality of it I certainly wish I had!  No.. My visit was to participate in one of their Moroccan Cuisine courses.  Absolutely splendid!  I was the only participant on the day and I was a bit worried that it would all be a bit rushed to get me out of the way so that the kitchen could return to normal.  But not a bit of it! I was treated as an honoured guest and felt very welcome.  Chef Miriam is very good! She led me through the process with great attention to detail and made sure I understood what each ingredient was for. I learned a great deal about the range of spices.  I would also like to thank Nadia who stood by throughout the course giving me any supplementary information.  I would recommend this course to anyone wishing to learn more of Moroccan Cuisine.  As for the rest of the building. If the bedrooms are as sumptuous as the public areas you are in for a very good time if you should choose to stay here. The décor is magnificent clean airy and very colourful.,Date of stay: March 2016,,"Gretna, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Normski123

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,CarlaJ1986 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Amazing Stay at Les Borjs de la Kaspah,I booked a last minute 5 day trip for myself and my partner to Marrakesh. The Borjs had really good reviews and was reasonable priced.    When we first arrived at the hotel I was a bit worried as there is literally a pile of rubble on the opposite side to the entrance to the hotel (looks like a building has been knocked down). From outside you wouldn't know that there was such a beautiful oasis inside.    Inside is so peaceful and serene and such a nice getaway from the bustling streets of the medina.    When we first arrived we were shown to the courtyard and given Mint Tea and Pastries. From start to finish the service we received whilst at the Riad was impeccable. All of the staff treat you like family and go out of their way to help you. There was not one member of staff I could fault.    On one occasion we didn't have time to get breakfast as we were going on an excursion early in the morning. I was rushing to get ready so my partner quickly went to pick up some pastries for us to take with us. The waitress saw him and told us she would take anything we wanted to our room for us to eat there whilst getting ready.    On another occasion I was feeling a bit of a sore throat and wrapped up in warm clothes with a scarf wrapped around me. The waitress saw me and offered to turn the heaters on and made me a Honey and Lemon drink.    The staff in the Spa are incredible! Definitely treat yourself to a Hammam and Massage - the treatments are so reasonable and lovely! The staff there made us feel so comfortable and like family giving us hugs when we left. We could have stayed in the spa all day!    The rooms are clean and traditionally decorated - so cute when you arrive to rose petals on the bed and arranged in the bathroom.    The lady at Reception (with braces - sorry I am bad with names!) was incredible helping us arrange excursions and offering recommendations.    I am so happy we booked the Borjs and we are now planning another short trip back in a couple of months. I don't normally like to go to the same place twice but the Borjs is an exception!,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlaJ1986
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,IamMissHarry wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Charming Hotel - great location in heart of traditional Marrakesh,Beautiful smaller hotel.  A peaceful haven with the busy side streets of Marrakesh just on the doorstep.  Friendly and attentive service.  Great restaurant - to be honest the tagines and traditional food here was as good as the better restaurants we visited. Highly recommended.  Good breakfast - lots of freshly cooked pancakes and eggs fruit etc.  Good size rooms over looking the traditional courtyard. Theres a small pool and a spa. I booked a back massage - this was perfect.  Easy to get to anywhere from here. This is in the heart of Marrakesh away from the shops like Zara and H& M which are opening up more and more in the busier more commercial shopping areas - where the more expensive swanky hotels are - here you have the markets and traditional smaller stalls in among the locals and the true atmosphere of Marrakesh.  But if you want the more commercial side - its only a 5 min taxi ride away.  Loved it and will definitely return in the future.

Definitely go for half board if possible because the restaurant is great serving the traditional tagine and international food (and seven types of pancakes in the morning).

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,ronald_thomas2 wrote a review Nov 2015,50,"Les Borjs de la Kasbah was reccomended by several friends, and it far exceeded even their high marks.",This was our first visit to Marrakech and although we have friends who have visited Les Borjs de la Kasbah really didn't know what to expect. This without doubt turned out to be one of the finest holidays we have experienced. The entrance to the hotel is so misleading. Once inside the reception door it opens out into another world. The patio area is so beautifully and tastefully set out with a central fountain surrounded by flowers. Leading from this central features are doors leading to the lounge dining room pool area  and bedrooms on ground and 1st floor.  Our bedroom was on the first floor and looked out onto a small courtyard. There was plenty of room for a couple with comfortable beds and plenty of wardrobe space. The lighting was very good . We didn't spend any great time in the rooms during the day but TV reception was good when needed with a selection of English News and film channels. The on-suite bathroom couldn't be faulted with twin vanity facilities and two showers.  The hotel is located only about 15 minutes from the airport and the transfer was all arranged by the hotel with a member of their staff meeting new arrivals. For less than £2 you can get a 10 minute taxi to the New Town and there are several exciting excursions to Berber villages/Atlas Mountains etc.  Breakfast offered a wide choice  satisfying most peoples needs. Cereals toast fresh fruityoghurts Croissant's cheese meats fruit juice etc. and much much more .  Lunches were available and snacks were always available. A different set menu was available each evening  in addition to selections from The Al a Carte menu.  The peacefulness and ambience of the whole hotel was unbelievable it was difficult to believe you were so near busy areas hardly a sound could be heard once you have entered the reception..  We could go on and on praising this hotel we really have tried to find anything we disliked or could find fault with but there were truthfully no negative comments to report.  What really put the icing on the cake were the wonderful staff working there. Everyone without fail were helpful pleasant and went out of their way to make our stay most enjoyable relaxing and peaceful.

All the staff were exceptional especially the two lovely ladies on reception. Tom the owner made a point of welcoming us and was very keen to make sure we had a good time. They just couldn't do enough for you. Nothing was to much trouble. The Riad is in a really safe area within walking distance to the square and souks. it has a lovely pool area and a great spa. you must have a Hamman. great experience. The hotel arranged a guide to show us around which i would really recommend. They also sorted out a fantastic taxi driver for us who spent the day with us taking us up to the atlas mountains and showing us many things on route.(£50) He then found us a guide who showed us up to the waterfall. £20. It very steep but well worth the climb wear sensible footwear. We had a cookery lesson at the Riad making a 3 course meal which we then ate for dinner one night. We felt extremely safe on our visit to marrekesh it is a really clean place. Prices were really cheap for most things remember to haggle. Henna tattoo at the Henna Art Cafe was about £4 they also do great lunches. You must have a go in tuttut. we paid about £2.75 from the square back to the hotel. if you not sure where to stay this is in a great location and would give it 5****. thank you Tom and staff.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888ChrisR888

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,hugobasset wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Look no further!,"We are probably a bit biased with regard to reviewing the ""Borjs"" as we have visited it 7 times over the years and trip number 8 is 2 weeks away!  The first time we came here was in 2008/9 and as it was our first time in Marrakech we wanted somewhere relaxing and a haven from the wonderful madness of the city. Since that first visit we have been back to Marrakech well over a dozen times and also to the Atlas and Essaouira. Throughout this time we thought that there must be other riads or hotels which would outdo the ""Borjs"" and that all the accommodation would be better and that we were missing out! How wrong we were this place is the ultimate in comfort chill out fantastic rooms and food and staff who we now consider friends.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Paul B wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Incredible hospitality in a bit of paradise,From the moment I walked in I was in love. The public areas are truly serene with soft music the smell of orange blossom fountains and cascading bougainvillea falling over the walls of the several courtyards around which the rooms orient. The restaurant is under a retractable roof through which you can view the stars the tile work throughout is exquisite the pool is warm and impeccably maintained and the reading and relaxation rooms around the main courtyard are divine. Really everything about the property is amazing. My room was incredible: huge tub mammoth vanity walk-in shower very comfortable bed huge closet perfect air conditioning mini fridge seating area. The floors are warmed so while the a/c keeps you cool you can still walk around the room in comfort. Giant breakfast was more than expected. The hammam is luxe and quite beautiful. I favor a more vigorous massage like sports massage or deep tissue and wish there was more of that on offer in the spa but that's my only minor complaint. The staff was humorous but respectful and everything you could ever want is made available if you ask. The staff works under the direction of Tom who is old world in his manners incredibly hospitable and attentive. I really couldn't be happier with my stay. Marrakech is deeply stimulating and at times hectic so it felt even better to enjoy the luxury this riad offers. I really couldn't recommend this property more. Great for solo travel friends couples (super romantic) and adventure travel if you want to really unwind.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Tony K wrote a review Jul 2015,50,An oasis in Marrakech,We have just returned from 10 days holiday staying in this wonderful Riad in the Medina of Marrakech.  On arrival we were slightly put off by the street outside but on walking through the main entrance of the Riad we the (my wife son and I) were at awe! It is one of the most beautiful tranquil hideaways that you can imagine with quiet well planted courtyards from top to bottom resembling one of the tropical glasshouses at Kew Gardens and curtained rest spots with traditional Moroccan comfy seating around the fountained courtyard. We were given a tour of the facilities by a very helpful person on reception including the pool and facilities and shown our lovely rooms with air conditioning. The pool is a good size very clean with good changing facilities large towels and comfortable wooden loungers and umbrellas for shade. At the press of a button one of the extremely helpful staff will come and take your order for drinks or food and bring it to you poolside.  The restaurant is very good with a good choice on the menu after you have had one of the freshly made cocktails at happy hour. Breakfast is continental with lots of fruit and freshly cooked pancakes or omelettes and more than you can ever eat and I was made delicious smoothies each morning by the chef.  What made our holiday so special and relaxing were the most friendly and very helpful well-presented staff in a Moroccan uniform always smiling and wanting to help you Fatima Norma Nadia Noele and Semele who cooked the breakfast every morning and taught us how to make a Tagine to mention but a few.  Our rooms were beautifully cleaned each day and our bed covered in rose petals on our return. We were upgraded for free to a suite after the first night which was very pleasant and spacious and a real treat for us. We did several excursions organised for us through reception and our special driver who was extremely pleasant and knowledgable was called Sharif who I would recommend you ask for. My wife had a foot and leg massage in the Arganier Spa above the pool one day after a long day in the souk and loved it.  I cannot find any fault with this establishment at all and will be making a return trip in the not too distant future.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Twickenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/539tonyk
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Harry C wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Tranquil,Shower was worth the booking on its own the cleanest I have ever felt in my life like washing in the tears of angels. Complimentary exfoliating soaps and perfumed shampoo. Large bath. Spar offering massages and treatments. Nice people working there. Reception helped organise cabs and dinner reservations really went the extra mile. Staff sometimes take a little while to get things for you but I think that is simply a cultural difference. Courteous and friendly British Director made us feel welcome and listened to all our comments.    Make sure to take advantage of the lovely pool great for a little plunge when sunbathing but not one for lengths at only 10m. A real tranquil retreat amongst the chaos of the medina. Speak to the riad about air conditioning as our room was very hot making it difficult to get a good nights' sleep.    On the whole wonderful and all for a superb cost.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/harryecole
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,daf74mck wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Very peaceful and family friendly,There was not one thing bad about this riad it was perfect. It is quiet yet in the Medina it is an easy walk to the Jemaa El Fna Ben Youssef Madrasa and many other sights. They were so accommodating we arrived rather late and were prepared to drag our 3 tired children into the Medina to find some food but the staff told us no they would keep the kitchen open so we did not have to go out. We had a great couscous ravioli and chicken tagine. The food was lovely with very unique smoothies for breakfast such as date and nut or beet and banana. The omelettes were cooked in the dining area and made to order. The breakfast buffet was perfect for us! We were in rooms 301 and 302 because we felt we would be more comfortable in 2 rooms they seemed rather large even in comparison to US and European hotel rooms. The courtyard separated the rooms my husband stayed in one room with our 2 younger kids and our older daughter and I stayed in the other room. I could not hear my youngest daughter when she cried at night so the rooms were pretty quiet. The rooms were also very clean and had unique touches like the bed spreads were creatively placed on the bed with rose petals. My daughter loved the rose petals everywhere and thought it was beautiful and very special. The parking was rather simple the front desk staff helped unload our things then parked the car in a lot diagonal from the Riad. All in all everything was perfect!,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Blue Ash, Ohio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daf74mck
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Hannah T wrote a review Jul 2015,50,A sanctuary of tranquillity,What an absolutely amazing week! Myself and my friends had been planning this holiday for a good few months and I have to say that our stay at Les Borjs de la Kasbah was the absolute highlight of our time in Morocco.    Our experience started when we were picked up at the airport by the very pleasant driver that the hotel had arranged for us. We were then invited for Moroccan tea and a selection of pastries these were most appreciated after a day of travelling. After we had had spent some time relaxing in the main courtyard we where then shown to our rooms all of which were absolutely lovely we were then given a brief tour of the hotel and it's facilities. The weather at the time was beautifully sunny so you could imagine how grateful we were upon seeing the pool. After spending the first day relaxing by the pool we then went for a lovely traditional Moroccan meal at the hotel restaurant. The following day we gorged on the amazing breakfast buffet the selection was vast and freshly prepared- just what we had hoped for. After a day spent wondering around the enchanting souks of Marrakech we then decided that we would go back to the hotel and treat ourselves to an afternoon at the hotel spa; this was pure bliss and something that I would thoroughly recommend taking advantage of! We felt that the manager and his team were fantastic and a real credit to the hotel; we were looked after from the second that we arrived and made to feel very special. I am already planning to return with the family for my mums 60th next year.,Date of stay: June 2015,,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844hannaht
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Heidi005 wrote a review Jul 2015,50,A beautiful Riad with wonderful staff and the added bonus of an onsite hammam/spa and pool!,This is an amazing peaceful Riad in the quieter Kasbah area of Marrakech - about a 15/20 minute walk from the bustle of the main square and souks etc.  The staff are wonderful; always smiling friendly with a great sense of humour yet at the same time courteous and discreet. They are happy to answer any questions and give great advice - from where to go things to do the culture and traditions and customs... Special thanks to Jihane - reservations/reception who we emailed back and forth a few times before the visit with various queries. Tom who greeted us on arrival (as we were being served the delicious complimentary mint tea and pastries) and who popped in to say hello most days. Also Nadia Fatima and the spa ladies who all made our time there so special.  We visited during Ramadan so during the day Marrakech was quiet with some of the shops and restaurants closed however after sundown everything came to life - it was amazing and incredibly busy. Marrakech has a wonderful vibe and yes everybody is touting for business but we never once felt in any way threatened or intimidated. We booked the three hour walking tour on our first morning which was great very informative and good for getting your bearings if you haven't been to Marrakech before.  It was very hot when we were there - in the 40s so we were more than happy to laze around the pool at times being brought drinks and snacks.  I thoroughly recommend the hammam which we had on the first day followed by a massage - what a great start to our four days!! We had another massage before we left too - they were so good definitely amongst the best I have had.  We also tried the cookery school - thanks to Miriam our Moroccan chef and the lovely Nora who assisted and translated for us and then sourced ingredients for us to take home! We prepped and cooked a three course meal and ate it for lunch - delicious!! The breakfasts are very good freshly squeezed orange juice tea/coffee breads and pastries Moroccan pancakes eggs to order as you like them... We ate dinner in the hotel on our first night and opted for the traditional Moroccan menu ( they also have a French / international menu too). We couldn't fault the food - the wine list is fine too - all Moroccan wines at very reasonable prices. They have a happy hour from 6 - 7 every evening with some great cocktails which you can have outside in one of the pretty courtyards or if too hot in the airconditioned bar.  The bedrooms are amazing we stayed in 202 (one of the three suites) spotlessly cleaned every day with the thickest most luxurious towels and bathrobes provided. Lovely toiletries in the bathroom too. We asked to see some of the other rooms as we are intending to come back with friends and family -Nora showed us various types - they are all beautifully decorated and very spacious.  We had a really wonderful time here and I just hope that people aren't put off by the one negative reviewer whereby despite giving the actual hotel and staff a rave paragraph then proceeds to publicly air a grievance with Tom the manager (surely this should have been sorted out privately by email with the hotel?) I feel strongly that it is unfair to then give this wonderful place where all the staff work so hard to make your stay so pleasurable a one star rating which clearly greatly drops the hotel's ranking on tripadvisor.  If you're planning a trip to Marrakech stay here you will not be disappointed. We will certainly be returning and hope to bring friends and family too.,Date of stay: July 2015,,"Burwell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heidi005
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,David W wrote a review Jul 2015,50,A jewel in the Medina,I recently was in Marakech to visit a friend and stayed at Les Borjs for a few days. I was welcomed by a friendly and helpful group of staff who immediately made me feel relaxed and showed me to my lovely single room. This was on the downstairs level in its own courtyard. As the temp was about 38 degrees I went straight for a dip in the very inviting pool followed by some comfortable poolside lounging reading and refreshments! For me the pool is a real highlight of this place as they are hard to come by in the Medina and I have stayed at quite a few Riads now. The ambience of the place is welcoming relaxing staff always on hand including the manager who is English and always willing to advise regards things to do / places to go. There is a lovely bar area an excellent restaurant which is open throughout the day and evening and lovely plants fountains orange trees birds etc give the place such a special feel.  It also had the advantage of being located in a more authentic less manic part of the Medina though not too far a walk from the usual manic mayhem of the souks and central square.

The Riad is beautiful the staff are great and do everything to make sure your stay is enjoyable.    This Riad is unusual in that it has a reasonable sized pool but is located within the Medina.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,holidaymom wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Rock la Kasbah,I also stayed at Les Borjs de la Kasbah for four nights with “Donna Z” and 22 other ladies and read her review and the reply of owner; Mr Bruce-Mitford who I believe is the father of manager Tom (aka David Brent – as suggested by another reviewer) and was not actually present when the unfortunate events occurred. Donna’s comments were not “exaggerated” or “false” and many of the guests were left feeling embarrassed humiliated and anxious about the remainder of their stay after Tom’s extraordinary behaviour on the Thursday night and subsequent ridiculous Friday night apology. The atmosphere greatly improved once Tom left completely and the amazing staff are a credit to the owners for the way they handled the incident and carried on working very diligently to restore peace and harmony.  The Riad is a truly delightful 3*/4* purpose built retreat in an extremely convenient location. It was absolutely perfect for a celebratory single party occupation. The bedrooms were very comfortable and the communal areas most welcoming for relaxing contemplation or sitting with friends. The pool area was perfect for a few hours sitting in the sun away from the chaos of Marrakech. The food at breakfast was good and the smiling chef Miriam made super smoothies great pancakes Berber bread Moroccan sweet eggy bread and other local delicacies every morning.  Lunch and dinner were not “haute cuisine” but were more than adequate for what was wanted on a half-board package. The waiting staff were charming funny and extremely patient with so many drinks bills flying around. The Moroccan Evening was a great success and enjoyed by all.  The spa services were fabulous and nearly everyone enjoyed a massage and/or Hamman.  I cannot thank ALL the staff enough who salvaged a ghastly situation – EVERYONE (cleaners kitchen reception spa gardeners security bar and waiting staff) should be treasured for making the Riad de la Kasbah such a special place.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Verwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h0lidaym0m

After 3 days in the High Atlas Mountains we returned to Marrakech for our stay in this Riad. On entering the Medina and travelling down a dusty road it was difficult to imagine what the hotel would be like. On entering the minimal entrance from the street passing through reception into the first courtyard we were met by an oasis of tranquility from the hustle and bustle outside. It was immediately apparent that this was a hotel of high quality with a lot of thought put into it's traditional style of design. The standard of our room and furnishings was first class. The communal areas were tastefully furnished and the dining area good. A special mention to all staff we encountered. All very friendly courteous and helpful and with a very good sense of humour too.

Good stuff first - the hotel is beautiful and is in a very peaceful and gorgeous setting about a 15 minute walk from the main square. The hotel is well maintained very clean the colour schemes and furnishings are wonderful and the rooms are lovely with extra special touches like fluffy towels and bath robes - alot of thought has gone into making the guest feel special and comfortable. The biggest shout out must be for the staff who go over and above in the levels of service and professionalism and I say a big thank you to them ALL for making our 5 days so special. Also the spa facilities - fabulous and thank you.    Ok - now the not so good stuff - the manager Tom. Sorry Tom but you nearly ruined the whole weekend for me and were close to turn a weekend that had been in the planning process for over a year into a complete disaster. It is NOT cool to get absolutely drunk offer your guests drugs (and say how good they are when we say no thanks) join your guests for drinks into the evening without being invited go around the table and insult guests with personal comments about their appearance and then try and enter the bedroom of one of my friends when she went to bed!! Thankfully another friend was there to pull you out of the room. I appreciate that the next day you apologized to everyone and sent us two bottles of wine (for 24 people) but ...really!!! Was this really an apology when you started to repeat the things you said the night before ?

The hotel was set in the Kasbah which is quite busy but once you step the doors it's so peaceful and tranquil. It's just what you need after the hustle and bustle of the souks. The staff are extended helpful snd arranged for a medina tour at very short not be. The rooms are lovely and the restaurant serves good food. The fish Tagine was especially good. It's also fantastic that they have a lovely outside pool to cool off from the sun which was needed.    Taxis are really cheap however make sure you agree on the price before you set off they will try and up the price where possible.  Being on my own it's advisable to have your wits about you as people will hassle you and want to talk to you. They were all friendly but just to be aware it happens quite a lot.    I tried Al fassia restaurant which the staff in the hotel recommended which was fantastic. Sat outside in the garden. Food was delicious and staff were very attentive. This is the 2nd restaurant in the same name I'm told it's smaller than the other but still worth visit.    Overall my stay has been lovely.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Leanita75 wrote a review Apr 2015,50,An Absolute Marvel in Marrakech,This hotel is a beautiful Moroccan home away from home. Attention to detail is found at every turn in the concept and design of the hotel in the genuine care attention and attentiveness of every single wonderful member of staff in every role. It is found in the exquisite Moroccan cuisine...I stayed full board and fully (puns intended!) enjoyed each dish which included a wonderful breakfast. Stay for the Moroccan evening for a taste of the food music and dance.  The hospitality of Marrakech is mirrored in the hotel; I was always greeted with a warm smile some tips and advice a friendly word or compliment and I was greeted with delicious tea and pastries. All the staff were so lovely; special shout-outs to Nora Hicham and Ilham who looked after the reception/management while I was there. They do their jobs amazingly. Nothing was ever too big or small to help me out with. I had a glasses 'malfunction' and 'tout de suite' Nora arranged for them to be fixed as good as new. She also assured me in arrival that it's a safe place for solo travellers - I agree - and she talked me through a city map which was a lot better than the one that I had! This is a place that goes over and above in all senses. The room was a spacious single offering with é suite bathroom. My room was always made up so tastefully every day. I had my first hammam at the onsite spa which was an unforgettable experience in pleasing surroundings. I couldn't possibly stay anywhere else when I return.    You will be right next to the Royal Palace and near to the ruins of the Baadi Palace which is worth a visit. Currently there's also a wonderful photography exhibition at the Baadi Palace; if art interests you a trip to the Musée de Photographie is worth winding though the souks for. The view over the city from the rooftop café is amazing and the photos of faces of Morocco over time were very emotive. You will be just close enough to the Djemaa el Fna which is an experience for all the senses! Have a coffee on the top terrace of Café de France whilst you plan your return journey. Use your instincts and talk to some local people who I found to be helpful and warm.    See Jardin Majorelle and the Berber museum if you can.

You can walk to the Djemaa el Fna in about 15 minutes. Our rooms were quite small and cave-like but I suppose that's unavoidable in a Riad. (Also we were told the rooms were small in advance which was honest.) We were on the ground floor and there was some noise from staff and other guests but it was OK.  The hotel was well-appointed and the staff were lovely. The bar pool courtyards etc. are all fantastic.  I thought it was a bit petty to charge us for two local calls from reception to our travel agent with a huge mark up.  The food was OK but you're better off eating in the open-air stalls in the Djemaa el Fna.Breakfast was excellent.  There was a slightly surreal David Brent sort of moment when the (English) ""Director"" introduced himself and then kept insisting I was Greek.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Kay M wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Our Best Holiday Ever!,We stayed for a week at Les Borjs de la Kasbah and were genuinely saddened to leave: the place the people the experience the price were everything you dream of for the perfect holiday.  THE PLACE: Les Borjs is beautifully designed spotlessly clean and unbelievably quiet yet located within walking distance of all the main sites. The intimate restaurant serves fantastic local food and their half board package is great value offering 3 courses on the Morrocan ‘menu de jour’ which changes daily. Our breakfast favourites were the date and nut smoothie and home made yoghurt. Loved the hot power shower in a wonderful room (they’re all good) plus having loads of space and free wi-fi.  THE PEOPLE: Cheesy as it sounds staying at Les Borjs truly felt like being part of a family. The staff are a happy team from Mariam cooking with quiet matriachal expertise to the rascal humour of our favourite waitress. The director Tom works hard at improving Les Borjs – installing improved wifi and effecting a switch of produce supplier to ensure consistently best quality food ingredients whilst we were there. Monsieur Ali who led our city walking tour was superb. All in all it is a welcoming place for everybody including those who travel alone: I would have no hesitation in returning in future without my young adult daughters next time.  THE EXPERIENCE: You need to be reasonably agile (definitely wear training shoes) for the trip to see the waterfalls at Setti Fatma which involves a scramble up the mountains but it is absolutely worth going. En route back to Marrakech we skipped the suggested visits to the toiletry/saffron manufacturers and instead asked our driver Shareef to take us to buy tagines and pottery. What an Aladdin’s cave he introduced us to!! Huge amounts of choice and the chance to bargain but without the sales pressure of buying from the souk.  We also loved the fun and interesting cookery lesson experience at Les Borjs – Menu 3 is absolutely yummy! – plus our evening vists to the vibrant ‘Cross Cultural Café’ located just around the corner from our Riad.    It's hard to believe that it's all over - we had a fabulous time and would recommend without hesitation!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YKM61

However on the advice of our local travel agents he booked a week at Les Bourjs as a Christmas gift for me. What a fabulous gift! I can only reiterate the comments that everyone else has given regarding the beautiful intimate and friendly hotel and the welcoming staff who immediately made you feel at home. They genuinely seemed to want to make our holiday the best.  We had suite 202 which was lovely light airy and spacious - and spotlessly clean!    The whole riad has a light airy feel to it arranged around the various courtyards. The scent of jasmine and orange blossom gives an exotic scent and the bougainvillea is just so pretty. With all that and the birdsong we could have been in the middle of the country rather than on the edge of an exciting city with all we wanted within easy walking distance.    So what did we do there? A half day city trip on the second morning to get an idea of what was there. La Place of course is a must - such an amazing experience and different by night and day. Shopping in the souks and artisan centres (for ""fixed prices"" - no haggling) a trip to the achingly beautiful Majorelle Gardens. A camel ride in the Palmeraie and a 4x4 trip in the High Atlas Mountains - berber villages breathtaking scenery and snowmen that the berber children had built by the side of the road. So so much to do in Marrakech - and then back to the tranquility of the riad afterwards.    We ate in the restaurant most nights and the food was delicious. Breakfasts were fantastic - the only problem was been tempted to eat far too much - especially the fresh cooked Morrocan pancakes.    Being a comfort bunny like another reviewer on here my only gripe is that I found the pillows hard. My partner didn't seem to have a problem though!

In our first hour in Marrakesh we wandered from our (absolutely lovely) Riad down the street and around the corner. After our first experience of the wonderful mayhem we wanted a cold drink and some cosy bites. When we looked around we were outside this wonderful hotel.  The welcome was warm and we made ourselves comfortable in the gorgeous courtyard while the staff attended to our drinks order (it's worth noting the Borjs is one of the few hotels with a proper drinks license). It was the first of many visits - and oh how I wish I had been staying there so I could have enjoyed the heated pool. You won't find many hotels or riads which can provide a heated pool in winter. A soak while looking up at the sky and the vines climbing the walls would have most certainly have been bliss.  Yes while street food (meat on a stick) is quite wonderful it's also nice to treat one self while on holiday and the food at the Borjs is absolutely exquisite. The Moroccan chef prepares many a tagine and traditional fayre but also a selection of international dishes (after a few days away you may hanker for something not cooked in stoneware!). All were perfect and good value in a lovely restaurant setting.  The hotel is owned by a British couple and their son Tom. He is the director of this establishment and his passion for outstanding customer service is evidenced throughout. The story behind how the hotel was purchased and renovated (with no heavy machinery even the pool was excavated by hand) using the finest materials and expertise of local artisans architects and engineers is worth exploring. What Tom brings to those finest traditions is an understanding of what UK travellers look for during a well-earned break and there's no doubt about his fantastic hosting skills - he is a true gentleman.  I've recommended this hotel to three people who are considering a break to Marrakesh Glasgow only recently having established direct flights. When I return to this amazing city I won't hesitate in booking with Les Borjs an oasis of calm and service in the heart of the Kasbah.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdoh28

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Tantranorth wrote a review Jan 2015,50,"Fun, friendly and fabulous breakfast",I stayed here recently with a group of about 12. We were royally welcomed and made to feel at home. Staff friendly and fun without any compromise in service. Very helpful. My air-con/heater didn't work and in five minutes I had a oil radiator for my room. The system was sorted the next day.    The best breakfast ever pretty much everything you can think of including morrocan specialities. Fresh juice and smoothie each day. Tea and coffee the weak point biut excellent Mint and herb teas.    And do try the hammam and massage really good not a wimpy beautician massage. The surround is stylish and comfortable. Very convenient for the old town and souk.    The rooms are as nice as the communal spaces. Lovely towels and linen and quality toiletries for a real feel of luxury.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Lisa T wrote a review Dec 2014,40,Well located and comfortable.,We had a very pleasant 3 night stay and the highlight was definitely the cookery course the Chef went out of his way to make us feel welcome in his kitchen and we cooked some wonderful food and he made a real fuss of us for the rest of our stay a really nice touch.  The room had everything needed good lighting mirrors etc and was very clean and serviced very well each day.  All in all a very good experience and a Riad I would recommend. The one fault I would find is that although the staff were always very willing to assist in the bar and restaurant areas a bit of direction and management was needed. Staff could often stand around talking to each other while we were waiting for plates to be cleared from the table or drinks to arrive. Staff were not proactive as I would have expected and as another reviewer noted breakfast items were not replenished and often cutlery or bowls were not available.  We did not use the spa or pool during our stay but both looked very inviting. Reception staff were helpful and the entire hotel was beautifully clean.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Villajoyosa, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaT813

Like the majority or reviewers here I can only praise the professionalism and friendliness of the all the staff - nothing is too much trouble and you are really made to feel at home. The fact that the majority of staff is female gives the hotel a special feel which is very friendly and relaxed and it does really feel like the staff all enjoy their working environment and their colleagues and they take the utmost care of its maintenance every area is spotless and carefully maintained. Location is perfect - located at the south end of the Medina it's central without the worst of the bustle. Spa/hammam and pool very good restaurant. We booked a premier twin room on first floor with plenty of wardrobe space and twin bathroom basins. The free wifi worked well throughout the hotel although not that fast. Beds were very comfy with memory foam mattresses. Local little songbirds/sparrows go to sleep in the courtyard trees at 5pm during high spirited chatter which is then repeated when they all wake up at 7! :) Highly recommended.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Birkaboo

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,AlisonP P wrote a review Oct 2014,50,great place to stay,This is a truly beautiful riad very tastefully renovated a little oasis of calm in the midst of the bustling medina and with probably the most consistently professional and courteous staff I've come across anywhere. This was my third visit to this riad; I can't think of anywhere else I've been back to more than once but along with it being a delightful place to stay just in its own right it's perfectly situated in the medina about ten minutes' (interesting) walk from the main square of Marrakech and various other interesting sites. I have recommended this place to several friends and family members - all who have visited have enjoyed it so far and fingers crossed my parents do in November!  Have to give a mention to the drivers for the excursions and to and from the airport. Extremely polite and helpful without being obtrusive and willing to stop and show you interesting things but not at all pushy about doing so.  If you're looking for some recommendations of things to do alongside the obvious and stunning Jardin Majorelle the Palais down the road is worth a visit and if you can find the nearby tinsmiths' square which we came upon by accident (try Kosybar for a coffee during the day) it's worth a visit for a little peace and quiet off the beaten track.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Dancer wrote a review Sep 2014,50,About the best so far..,This hotel takes some beating and is an oasis of calm in a city that is lively to say the least. From the moment we arrived late one evening to a warm greeting and a wonderful suite we felt completely at home and at ease.  The hotel is ideally situated near the Royal Palace and yet still only a walk of 10-15 minutes to the main square. Everything a tourist would want to see is within easy walking distance.  First the rooms are beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean - rose petals laid out onto the bedding and towels that are the thickest ever. We had suite 303 with excellent views over the pool on one side and small courtyards on the others.  Dining is a pleasure and the service superb. The only downside to otherwise excellent food is the lack of choice particularly if staying more than a few days. The local cuisine is tasty and very filling. Lunch by the pool and a very good breakfast make the dining complete.  I could waffle on for a long time but would like to thank the staff for making our break so memorable in particular Nadia Btissam Ilham Nora Fatima and Mounia. Also a special mention to Meriem who prepared breakfast for us.

Silly me- once inside the riad I couldn't find the opening to the main reception..the owner saw that I was lost and came out of his office and gave me a tour of the riad. I stayed here my last night in Morocco after a 8 day tour --and am very thankful I did--I left with fond memories of calm clean and beautiful!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,girlabroad13 wrote a review Aug 2014,40,Very pleasant experience,I stayed at this charming riad for one night prior to commencing an 8 day tour of Morocco and I have to say it was the most enjoyable of all of the hotels/riads I stayed in throughout my time in Marrakech and Morocco for that matter.    The hotel staff were very friendly and hospitable during my stay and it was may clear just how much attention the hotel management take to detail - On arrival at the riad I was welcomed with a pot of Moroccan tea and Moroccan sweets and my bed and en suite were donned with rose petals - both very nice touches and added a sense of ambience to my stay.    The breakfast which was included in the cost of my accommodation was very satisfying with delicious omelettes and crepes made fresh upon request.    Although I was meeting my tour at a different hotel in Marrakech at 7pm the day of my checkout the hotel staff were more than happy for me to checkout but leave my baggage in storage at the riad. Although I checked out at 11am I spent a very relaxing day poolside lounging on a deck chair beneath an umbrella. The pool is very clean and well maintained and the perfect place to spend a couple of hours (or day like I did) to escape the hustle and bustle of Marrakech's manic Medina. Whilst I was on my own at the riad I found it very easy to meet other solo travellers by the poolside. On my day of check-out I also had a very enjoyable pedicure at the riad's own spa which they managed to fit me in immediately upon request (I'd still recommend booking just to be on the safe-side).    The pool and courtyard in the riad are two lovely features of this riad. I enjoyed my time here so much so that I paid to come back on my final full-day in Marrakech to dine at the pool's restaurant for lunch and use the pool and shower facilities which cost around 150 dirham (or 15 europe). The pool's change rooms which are (donned with warm showers) was a real treat after spending 5 days in a hostel with questionable showering facilities.    Overall I had a very enjoyable experience at Les Borjs de la Kasbah. The staff are very friendly the riad is exceptionally clean and tidying and it's in an ideal location.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Michael P wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Amazing,I chose this riad as it had a pool and was within walking distance of the main square. On arrival I was welcomed with some mint tea and cookies. As I had arrived late I dined in the restaurant that night The food was lovely at reasonable by European standards. The riad is located in a small but safe street about 20 minutes walk from the main square. It is on the same street as the Royal Palace so their is a police presence which is reassuring. Their are loads of open spaces around the hotel to laze around which is nice. The pool is nice and their were always plenty of deck chairs. Breakfast was good typical Moroccan with plenty to choose from to suit everyones tastes. The staff were all very friendly and more than helpful. My room was located close to reception so I could pick up the wifi. Room was a good size and cleaned daily with the staff leaving rose petals on my bed everyday. My room had a fridge which was a big plus. In my opinion and based on European standards this hotel would be five stars in many areas such as customer service dining quality and facilities provided.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,moussafir wrote a review Jul 2014,50,I definitively found my place in Marrakech,I went to Marrakech at least 6 times between 2000 and 2014 always experiencing different locations hotels styles (ryad de luxe hotels cheap hotels etc.) I finally found my place in the city at Le Borjis del Kasbah. There are a couple of reasons why I said that. First: the hotel. Les Borjis is a charming quiet clean small hotel combining the charme of a ryad with the services of an hotel (spa swimming pool concierge large and comfortable rooms etc.) The staff is friendly and efficient the breakfast is excellent. The restaurants is worthwhile it offers good Moroccan or international cuisine. Second: the area. The casbah is walking distance from Jema el Fna and the souks and offers the experience to live in the Old Medina while it’s slightly removed from the most chaotic and crowded area. Third: the house. This is and ancient building amazingly restored by local craftsmen who recreated the atmosphere of an old Moroccan estate. The wooden moucharabia that closed the room was a real masterpiece such as the decorations of the façade and the floor. Please note that if you are looking for a modern full service luxury hotel with an Olympic swimming pool this is not the place for you. But if you look for a quintessentially Marrakech experience Moroccan hospitality at its best do not hesitate to book a room here.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Milan, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moussafir

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Tee11 wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Almost a 5,This is a really nice Riad only a few niggling issues stopped me from rating it a 5.    We arranged a transfer with the hotel and the driver was waiting for us when we landed. It is a very short drive to the Riad and we were greeted with welcome drinks on arrival. The room was absolutely huge and well maintained. The whole property is a wonderful retreat from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.    The Riad seems to be in a more local area of the Medina and we did not see as many tourists as we expected walking from there to the main square. However this was probably an advantage as the area felt safe and was full of families both day and night. There was also far less hassle than nearer the square and souks. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the main square and much of this is spent dodging traffic. This wasn't a problem for us but is definitly something to be aware of. On the plus side taxis are able to pull up right outside here which is impossible in some other areas.    The staff were consistently friendly and helpful with excellent English. It was great to have the pool especially in such heat. Drinks at the Riad are more expensive than outside but very reasonable by UK and international hotel standards. We booked a hammam and massage which was very good and also very reasonable.    There were 2 things that sold Les Borjs de la Kasbah to me when booking. 1. The air conditioning and 2. The wifi. However these are two things that did not function well during our stay. The air conditioning was not cool enough and the wifi was incredibly patchy. I know this wouldn't bother many people but it was a nuisance when I was relying on it for an important work email.    I also found myself slightly dissapointed with breakfast. The cereal never had any bowls and when something was gone it was very rarely replenished. Some of the fruit also did not seem very fresh but these are really just me being picky.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,blucanary wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Great retreat from the madness,We arrived very late in the night and had arranged a pick up with the hotel in advance. The flight was early but the driver was only five minutes away. Arriving late and having never been to Marrakech did mean that when no-one answered the door for a little while we got a little on edge but then we were welcomed in greeted by the hotel director and shown to our room which was a great size and beautifully presented - right down to the rose petals on the bed everyday!    The pool is a good size and it's very refreshing you can have food by the pool when the Moroccan heat gets too much and take a dip too. It's incredibly relaxing which is exactly what you need when you've walked the streets of Marrakech.    Food-wise breakfast was included and a wide selection provided including the Moroccan pancakes. When we overslept on our first day they kept breakfast running a little longer for us and that sort of detail is typical of the hotel. We also ate one evening meal there which was very nice and not unreasonably priced by european standards.    We also took a spa treatment which was brilliant and hugely recommended too the price is reasonable and the treatments are very relaxing (enough to make you fall asleep). If your aim is as ours was to have a relaxing getaway for four days Les Borjs de la Kasbah is ideal - you'll feel welcomed and the staff are really helpful the reception staff speak English perfectly although a little French is helpful at times.    I'd say this is a hotel for couples friends or solo travel rather than families - who may want a more resort style hotel with more activities for the kids but there was a family staying there who seemed to be enjoying it as well.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blucanary

We were able to choose which dishes we wanted but you must book ahead. I originally thought it was a little bit pricey at ?40 each but you do get to eat the meal afterwards for lunch and we enjoyed cooking together and had fun doing something new and we were there for 4 hours all in.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,mstraveller78 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Beautiful Oasis of Calm,We went to Marrakech early June. There are so many choices of where to stay making a decision was very difficult but we chose Les Borjs de la kasbah based good reviews a recommendation of a friend and that they had a decent sized pool which is not that common for the riads.    We stayed in a suite because I was aware some of the rooms didn't have a shower but knew the suite had both and we wanted to make sure we had a shower. The suite was beautiful big decorated with such attention to detail. The room came with a plate of fruits toiletries in the bathroom and complimentary water.    The Riad itself is beautiful very clean a lovely courtyard lots of places to chill out and take things in. I am glad we chose somewhere with a pool as we spent a lot of time by it when it was abit too hot to go out walking. We were there at low season and it was still pretty busy so I would imagine at busier times you would struggle to find space round it.    The breakfasts were lovely a selections of eggs bread pancake and fruits. No meat sausages etc    We tried the Hamam and a massage which was great. The massage was amazing! Highly recommended!    The staff were on the whole very friendly and welcoming. Service could be pretty slow in the restaurant and bar staff seem to disappear all together for long periods of times. I noticed guests at the restaurant having to knock on the door of the kitchen to get attention. But this seems to abit of a theme when reading reviews of hotels and eateries in Morrocco that generally service is relatively slow so I don't think this particularly unusual. But just something to be aware of things are much slower paced!.    The location was ok it's a 15-20 min walk to the main square but it's not relaxing one the locals tend to get around on motorbike driving them very fast down the little alleyways so you do have to have your wits about you. They also try to trick by telling you roads are closed when they aren't! So make sure you know where you are going.    I think this place is beautiful but perhaps a little isolated ..I would definitely come back here again if I wanted to get away from it all. But if I wanted to be in and around the action the nice restaurants shops etc I would probably chose something more central Overall a lovely place and lovely holiday.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Doha, Qatar",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstraveller78

Everywhere was spotless the staff immaculate in their outfits and with a ready smile and greeting at all times. With temperatures outside nearing 40 degrees the air-conditioning in the room was really effective and when combined with a very comfortable bed we slept well during our 3 night stay. We really enjoyed our breakfasts - especially the fresh fruit and omelettes but due to the draw of Jemaa el-Fna Square and other evening entertainment we only managed one evening meal at the riad but that was excellent. We really hope to return to Morocco and this is definitely where we would always want to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hereford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuncanS790
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Vols84 wrote a review Jun 2014,40,A Good Overall Riad Experience in Marrakech,This was our first night stay in a 13 day Morocco tour. Looking back I would say it provides a good view of the overall Riad experience. It has a nice garden area with a good sized pool for a Riad. The seating around the garden is in a very comfortable alcove type arrangement with some privacy but a community feel. The food was always well done with the ever present Tangine and Grill options. As we noted with all Moroccan hosts the service is an interesting blend of traditional waiting and do it yourself. You will need to reach out for assistance more than you are used to but the response is always warmly received and well executed. The rooms are comfortable with very firm beds that are a standard everywhere we went and a clean layout. Given it is a Medina location and in densely populated surroundings the views and light in the room are limited but the space is open and airy. Internet is spotty everywhere so you have to find the zone that works - here is was out in an alcove off the garden.    All in all we a glad this location was selected for the first phase of our trip and we would certainly consider it if we return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vols84

We had room 303 which had a 4 poster bed and views over the courtyard and pool. Excellent facilities- pool spa restaurant bar safes in rooms good towels bathrobes etc. Approx 20 mins walk to the main square- felt very comfortable and totally safe walking back even late at night. All staff friendly and helpful- nothing too much trouble from ordering taxis to storing our bags on our last day. Massage and facial in the spa both excellent.

We liked the touch of the general manager waiting for us on our arrival day to welcome us even if we arrived very late.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,junemorton wrote a review May 2014,50,Lovely riad wonderful staff,We had four nights here and loved it. Staff where all friendly and extremely helpful. Very nice room and a good size pool given the location in the Medina this is a rarity. The food was good and we enjoyed the meal in the restaurant the lamb tagine was fantastic and the banana pancake one of the best I have had. It is a 20 minute walk to the square but that's fine given the quality of the hotel pool and staff. Only comment I would add is I don't know why the glass roof over the restaurant is sometimes closed it's better open . A couple more sun beds around the pool would be nice there is a bit more space to do that. Over all I would highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: May 2014,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/junemorton
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Iamiamiam wrote a review May 2014,50,Beautiful place to stay,I chose this riad based on all the other amazing reviews. Very good value for money staff were very friendly and helpful. I was staying on my own and the lovely receptionist asked all the other guests if any of them wanted to go to one of the day trips with me so that I wasn't on my own. They also arranged a lovely guide to take me around the city at very short notice.    I only ate at the riad once but it was lovely. I had the beef cous cous. I nearly had a heart attack when the meat came attached to the bone (I'm a really fussy eater) but it tasted absolutely delicious. The breakfast was lovely too- there was always someone there to cook you up a fresh omelette. They also have buy one get one free on cocktails between 6:30 and 7:30pm.    As a single person staying at the riad it would have been so easy for me to hide away in my room whenever I was there. I was impressed by the many cute places to sit and enjoy a cocktail or glass of mint tea- the bar the terrace the pool etc. There was even a little living room area. I was also impressed by how good the WIFI was!    All in all a great riad!,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iamiamiam
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Lorraine714 wrote a review May 2014,50,Lovely road,Have just got back from a 5 night trip to celebrate a wedding anniversary. We chose the hotel based on other reviews and were not in the least bit disappointed. The hotel is located in a quiet part of the medina but only about a 15 minute stroll away from the main square (Jemaa el-Fnaa) and it really is a little oasis of peace. The facilities are fantastic and our suite was beautifully decorated and very comfortable with rose petals on the bed each night! The restaurant courtyards and pool are idyllic. The staff are friendly and helpful - the two ladies who run reception each organised restaurant reservations for us (including a fantastic anniversary meal) as well as taxis (telling us how much to pay for the fare in advance to save too much haggling). The spa is also well worth a visit -- a real experience and totally relaxing.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,7Dave7 wrote a review May 2014,50,Peaceful and friendly oasis,We chose this riad based on previous reviews and were not disappointed. We contacted them directly to take advantage of their 'pot pourri' special offer of a guided tour of Marrakech a cookery lesson and a hammam. We were very pleased with all aspects of the riad but especially the friendliness of the staff. Nothing was too much bother. We'd booked a suite which was beautifully decorated and had fresh rose petals on the bed every day; a lovely touch. Although it is located in the centre of the Kasbah area of the Medina it was very quiet inside the riad complex and peaceful. You do need to be careful on the road outside with carts bikes scooters etc but that is largely the case everywhere in Marrakech. It took us 15 minutes to walk to the main square and there are ATMs and a bureau de change on the way.  The only thing we'd change would be the option of feather pillows as we found the pillows too hard for our liking. We usually take our own but this was not possible with only travelling with hand luggage. However that is a minor point.  Definitely one to return to for a relaxing break.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7Dave7

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,DyerMaker wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Maybe there's a nicer place in Marrakech...maybe...,"Okay so I've stayed in one place in Marrakech -- two separate times -- and I'm not inclined to explore elsewhere after having great luck at Borjs de la Kasbah.    When you enter the fortified city you take a dusty road past vendors and merchants and you head away from the tourist areas. We took a cab at night -- not so much out of fear as much as it would be an uninteresting long walk to reach the medina and restaurants in the heart of the fortified city. And that is the only drawback. That's it. You're not in the middle of everything but you're still close and you're still in the fortified city -- actually with very convenient egress to get to the airport quickly to catch that early flight back home.    Being off the beaten path has its benefits in the form of the restaurant. Knowing how fantastic their authentic Moroccan cuisine is if I was staying in the center of the old city I would travel out of my way to get to the restaurant that is just a few steps away within the heart of the borjs! For our final night during our second stay we were fortunate enough to have live entertainment in the form of musicians from the southeastern part of the country and even a traditional belly dancer. The family loved the show and the entertainers were very friendly.    The staff is also very friendly. Everyone seemed to take ownership. It was never clear to me who was in charge -- in a good sense because everyone seemed to feel empowered and accountable for ensuring a first rate experience. This began on our arrival as we were served hot tea (in near 100 degree F temperature -- surprisingly refreshing) as our bags were taken to our two rooms. Another employee offered to show us the grounds and amenities. We were very relaxed even before we where shown to our rooms. As you can see from the photos that I posted there is no roughing it here. The rooms had us in the lap of luxury.    We didn't linger in our rooms there was much to see and do...and when we did linger there were plenty of areas withing the courtyard and grounds to hang out and meditate or read or converse. Even if we weren't in Morocco the best word to sum up the place -- and the experience -- is ""oasis.""",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lyon, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DyerMaker
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Marina47 wrote a review Mar 2014,40,"Very good, couple of issues",We had an excellent three nights break away from children and exploring a new part of the world. The staff we're welcoming and charming throughout our suite above the restaurant courtyard was spacious and charming. We chose one away from the pool thinking it would be quieter but actually got this wrong although the restaurant did not continue too late.    Excursions and recommendations were excellent particularly the private tour into the Atlas Mountains taking in many sights and a 30 minute camel ride (paid on top).    Pool and massages were fantastic so relaxing after a day in the city following my wife round the Souks and we're not massively into spas normally.    My only quibble is that the food was nothing special in fact quite ordinary considering the hotel states is pride in its kitchen. The a la carte dishes often looked preferable to our set guests menu so perhaps we just went for the wrong option. We didn't really have one meal that stayed in the memory; perhaps this is just Morocco and it's not somewhere to go if you want high quality food.    All in all though an excellent small hotel.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wiltshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marina47

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,mrssneak wrote a review Mar 2014,50,"Perfect, an oasis of calm",My husband and toddler (20 months) stayed at Le Borj at the end of February. It was a perfect stay. The Riad itself and the rooms within are absolutely pristine definitely renovated for the western traveller (all the modern amenities menus etc.) yet it maintained an air of authentic Morrocan-ness. Rooms were HUGE and very well appointed. The pool was gorgeous a little too cool for February but I'm sure it's lovely in a month or so. My only tiny little niggling complaint was that the beds were very firm but I'm used to a super soft bed at home. I certainly didn't lose any sleep though.  The British owner and family were usually onsite to make sure things were running smoothly. They always took the time to welcome each guest personally and to check in with them every day. Absolutely lovely people. The staff are also brilliant willing to help you out day and night. They made a fuss over our baby and were very accommodating. Families with well-behaved kids shouldn't hesitate to stay here if you're looking for the non-resort kind of experience (which we were).  The location of the riad was great located in the Kashbah a quiet area still inside the medina but only about 20 min walk from the (manic) Jemma Al Fna. It's also very easy to get to the outside/ Palmerie area with the supermarkets and bigger shops/ hotels.  Food was good traditional Moroccan breads and eggs cooked to order for breakfast with a diverse Moroccan and western menu for lunch and dinner.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,sunshineandlollips wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Fabulous!,Just spent a long weekend at Les Borjs and enjoyed the experience immensely! Selected and booked for me as a birthday treat by my daughter who also enjoyed the trip. We loved our suite on the 1st floor which was a dual aspect room with a view of the pool on one side and a small courtyard on the other - lots of sunshine pouring in at both ends of the day! The bed was very comfortable and the shutters lamps and curtains created a very snug atmosphere indeed in the cooler February evenings. We ate in the hotel each evening and the food was delicious and varied with lovely waiting staff always keen to please with a ready smile. (Unfortunately we weren't able to enjoy the half-board rate as we strayed from the tabled'hote in error). The breakfasts were also excellent with lots of tempting Moroccan treats (which we had to try!) and the added bonus of finishing at 10 am which allowed a lie-in! Great. The hotel is in walking distance of the main square and souks and I would recommend an early trip in a horse and carriage booked via the hotel which allowed us to orientate ourselves within the city ready to return to our favourite areas. (It also confirmed that staying within the walls of the Medina is the very best!) Our driver actually managed to take us through part of the souk area which was amazingly tight and caused us to breathe in very tightly! We had some excellent treatments in the spa with great massages. I would highly recommend Les Borjs which is beautifully restored and created with a fabulous tranquil atmosphere in a very lively city.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,SonodiLondra wrote a review Jan 2014,40,"Pleasant, but lacking the personal touch",We had a lovely large room which was clean and comfortable. I was expecting a fireplace but in fact the reversible air conditioning unit was very effective in keeping the room warm enough on the chilly January nights. Breakfasts were very good and we enjoyed the one dinner we had in the hotel although the restaurant room is long and narrow and a bit cramped.  Location is a good compromise being in the Medina and so within walking distance of most of the sights but in a reasonably quiet road.  A few little niggles: we had quite a wait - at least 20 minutes - for our welcome drink. Maid service was a bit erratic: on the third day our plate of fruit disappeared from our room along with our spare bar of soap. And we didn't get much guidance about where to go and what to expect in Marrakesh which we understand other riads offer.

From the location to the staff all was a positive experience. It is very clean and beautiful. The rooms are spacious and cater any need imaginable. I wouldn't comment on any changes that would need to be made. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming and strives to make your stay as pleasant as can be. The staff really go above and beyond! They are incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. From providing stamps for letters and sending them to providing the best advice regarding excursions you know you can count on them for any information! I had an excellent holiday and was at much peace whilst staying at this oasis in the midst of a chaotic city. It truly is a beautiful place so ornate. Such great taste in decorations and so nicely finished! The spa is a superb outlet to escape daily stress. Service all around was highly impressive and commendable.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Sarah B wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Peace and quiet in a frenetic city,We had a wonderful few days at Les Borjs … This was our first time in Morocco and we were also experiencing a riad for the first time although I think this is technically a hotel. It was amazing how the noise of the city totally disappeared as we walked into Les Borjs de la Kasbah.    The courtyard was beautiful and a very relaxing place to spend time. Our room was spacious and well-furnished (although it was not as light as we might have hoped but this could of course be entirely due to the fact that it was on the ground floor). The swimming pool was a good size and a constant and lovely 25 degrees!    The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them.    The result of the project of merging more than one property to construct Les Borjs is of a very high standard and the effect is ‘seamless’.    Breakfast was a lovely experience with freshly cooked eggs cooked individually for us as well as Moroccan pancakes etc. The weather was amazing during our stay and when the roof above the restaurant was opened up it was lovely to see the clear blue sky above us while we ate our breakfast. The evening meals were also excellent.    Les Borjs is very well situated in the medina close to the royal palace and is a relatively short distance to walk to the main square Jemmaa El Fna to the Koutoubia Mosque the souks and everything else on offer in Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Malvern, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahB140

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Alex A wrote a review Nov 2013,40,"Charming, friendly riad",My daughter and I stayed here for five nights in need of some winter sun and relaxation. We picked Les Borjs for the good reviews the facilities and the price. We had both visited Marrakech once before separately so had something with which.to compare this experience.    Our room was comfortable and well appointed my only criticism was that the beds were very hard (I do like a firm bed but this one did keep me awake a bit!). The hotel is built around a pretty courtyard so lovely views from everywhere.    We each had two spa treatments which were excellent I particularly enjoyed my hammam. We also did the cookery class which the hotel offers; this was good fun and very good value as it fed us for both lunch and dinner as well as teaching us the rudiments of Moroccan cuisine.    All the staff were efficient and very friendly and the atmosphere was at all times both relaxing and convivial.

My room was on the second floor with a view of the pool on one side and and a small courtyard on the other. The double bed was very comfortable as were the chairs in the sitting area. A good size bathroom too.  The tv had several English channels including BBC 1 and 2 ITV 12 and 3 and channel 5. Free wifi was also available but I could only get it on the ground floor but that was ok as there are several very pleasant seating area's.  There wasn't a huge variety of food for breakfast but the pancakes I had were delicious!  As I had an evening flight I asked to keep my room on. Unfortunately there was someone else already booked into it and so the reception staff gave me a small room on the ground floor. And at no extra charge. This level of service I've rarely encountered on my travels. This hotel deserves every bit of praise already heaped on it.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,balanced36 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,"Great welcome, authentic and very comfortable","There are already lots of great reviews of this hotel and we can endorse them all. But before we even arrived we were very taken with the website which reads like a guide book of Marrakech constantly updated by the owners who have devoted their careers to specialist tour operation. They realise the importance of a great welcome and some of the staff who deliver it have been part of the ‘family’ since the outset. The hotel itself is created from 7 riads re-constructed by local craftsmen with the added luxury of a pool (unique in this part of the medina). From the central courtyard bordered by the public areas of bar restaurant lounge etc there are passages to the bedrooms around a further 4 courtyards. It feels very exclusive and calm. The decor has been sourced locally personally by the owner and is extremely tasteful; every room is different and it’s all spotless. It's really lovely to return to a room that's been freshened up with rose petals always in a different design at the end of a hot day exploring. The whole place oozes 'care'. The food has been praised by others already so I can only echo what’s been said. You must try the hammam and massage too but don’t expect to do anything much with your day afterwards!    Outside the riad one is transported back in time - the medina is noisy colourful vibrant. The kasbah area is the posh end and the historical palaces are nearby. The central square Jemaa el Fna is about 10 minutes’ scary walk away but only scary the first time as you soon realise that the other road users are actually very skilful. We were there around the time of Eid - an important family festival which requires the slaughter of a ram in each home so for the first few days every second truck and moped (!) was carrying some poor unsuspecting creature. Very biblical.     It is worth taking a guide round the souks - it is so easy to get sucked into shops and feel pressurisedI to buying spices wooden objects carpets etc etc when you may have no idea of the quality. We just realised this at home using the  ""35 spice mix"" for a chicken dish to find it quite thin. The Ras el Hanout from Waitrose/Tesco same thing but with fresher spices  would have been much better. Of course we sniffed a very fragrant sample in the souk but were sold a ready packed version! This is the only negative comment however and has nothing to do with the hotel.    Our thanks go to Tom Fatima Nora Ilham Mounia Nawal Miriam and the others. We have a very happy memory of our stay with you.",Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"solihull, gb",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/balanced36
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,TAMember021620123 wrote a review Nov 2013,40,"Beautiful hotel, great location - but lacked atmosphere",My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights in October. The hotel itself is very beautiful the pool area good-sized and the staff friendly and helpful (special mention to the receptionists here). The location is also perfect - close enough to the centre of the Medina to walk in the day and for evening dinner but far enough away to be quiet. There were however for my taste a few negatives. It may have been the time of year but the hotel's public areas such as the bar dining area and pool area seemed to lack atmosphere. I can't say what would improve this - maybe it was down to us guests to provide some buzz!? Because it was quiet there weren't always staff ready to serve when you needed them. Our room on the ground floor was a little small and the two twin beds had been pushed together to make a double. This would have been okay but they had to be pushed to a side wall and there was no room at the bottom of the bed - so whoever was on the wall-side had to clamber over the other person if they needed the loo in the night. All-in-all however I would have no qualms about staying here again. My one tip though is to try the street restaurants in the main square for food in the evenings - great food good price and a great buzz.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Worcester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMember021620123

The riads centre was set with the traditional water fountain and rose beds just setting there was so peaceful you dont here anything of the hussel and bussel that's going on just outside. The rooms are just fantastic. They are set out in the traditional Moroccan style with a bit more luxury thrown in for good measure. The pool area was very clean and was set with sun beds and tables. There was also a great pool side snack bar. The restaurant was set out in a court yard style. The food was lovely with a good range of French & Moroccan dishes.

We meet the owners during our stay they were just lovely warm friendly people who were dedicated to ensure your stay with them was memorable. In fact all the staff were great and very helpful.

There is nothing about going to a fantastical place and have even better accommodations. The women at the front desk are the sweetest and so delightful not to forget very resourceful.  With our arrival they seated us in the courtyard and served us Moroccan tea and cookies while we waiting for them to check us in and gather room keys! That was the best nothing like after a long travel resting out on a beautiful courtyard sitting in comfy and cushioned sofas to enjoying tea and cookies :-)    My room was so adorable. The sizing was perfect with closet space nice sized bathroom a/c unit and some really nice accessories in the room. I enjoyed the doors and of course the windows! I wish I could've bought some to bring home!    The ladies at the desk helped us arrange a guide and a tag-along guide as well also where ATMs were and the best places to get some awesome buys. The Riad was walking distance from many main things and elements of Morocco especially Jmaa el fma square the Jewish Quarter etc. You can easily find your way after getting lost a few times! lol    I had the pleasure of eating lunch and dinner and the dinner was the best Lamb tangine I experienced my whole trip! The tangia was splendid full of flavor and tender as it could be! I fell in love at first bite. I then decided to take their cooking class they offer and I am so glad I did. The chef was a pleasure learning with and we made him laugh dearly by trying to repeat his French for ingredients! We had a blast and learned so much. He taught us how to prepare lemon chicken tanginess milk pastille the moroccan salads french native tongues of Morocco how to prepare the Moroccan style tea and so much more!    The Hammam spa was an experience...I never been scrubbed like that in my life and I loved it! The steamy room calms you and you forget you are completely nude for the most part but believe it or not the roughness of scrubbing is enjoyable. The ladies was fun! We shared some laughs but I love to share laughs with people because I am a little silly :-)    I enjoyed my stay and would go back and stay a complete isolated day at the riad sharing time laying by the tranquil pool partake on a massage and scrub a few drinks at the bar surf the web out in the courtyard day-dream eat sleep eat walk around gather my thoughts and just embrace all that Les Borjs de la Kasbah has to offer and it's a little bit of heaven!

This was my fifth visit to Marrakech and I would definitely book this hotel again. The rooms were very spacious as were the bathrooms. We were given rooms for my daughters right next door to each other which was very convenient. One negative was that the bed was very hard for us but I think this is just a matter of personal preference. It was also great to have a decent sized pool in such a central location.

From the moment we set foot in there we were treated with such warmth and hospitality. The staff are wonderful especially Fatimah. It is in a brilliant location because it is away from the direct hustle and bustle of the Jamaa square yet only a 10 minute walk away from it all! Staying in the old city is also a really unique experience that I would recommend. We stayed in room 202 which is a suite. It was gorgeous. Not good for people who don't like steps as there are 3 steps leading up to the bed. Everyday there were fresh rose petals sprinkled on our bed and around the room. Totally gorgeous.    A slight smell of drains came from the bathroom in the late afternoon but this was completely understandable - it was 46 degrees when we went!    This is also one of the only hotels/riads that has an outdoor pool (as opposed to a plunge pool that is shaded). The pool has a handy sitting area around the shallow end so you can sit happily in the water to your hearts content.    Only thing I would say is that it took quite a long time to get our food when sitting around the pool. For example between 30 - 60 minutes. Actually if you take this into consideration and order in good time it is no problem at all. Just bare this in mind.    We attended the Moroccan evening which was fun - great food music and a belly dancer.    There is a spa on site that does not charge through the roof. I went twice because of this fact.    We happened to pop to Essaouira for a few nights and when we returned we had a day to spend back in Marrakech. The manager went over and above to help us out. Even though we had not paid to go back they offered us a room for the day at no extra cost and let us use the facilities as if we were guests again. Honestly it was fabulous and I would highly recommend it.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyM641

Everybody works together to deliver really exceptional customer service everyone always has a smile on their face and after the bustle and noise of Marrakech it truly is an oasis of calm.    i have stayed in many of the Worlds very best hotels but none of them have better service than this one.    if you going to Marrakech do not book anywhere else stay here!,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/londonchris169
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Maglip wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Excellent relax,My husband and I spent a wonderful 9 nights in Les Borjs. It makes you feel as if you were visiting friend's house in Marrakech. Location is great and safe. The place is designed and maintained with a lot of care. Comfortable beds in clean rooms add on the interesting traditional style architecture. Staff are there for you and you experience Moroccan hospitality first hand. Ask for anything you need help with i.e. transfers excursions prices.....  It allows you to step in and out of the 21st century at will.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Farnborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maglip
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,TAabG wrote a review Apr 2013,40,A peaceful retreat,Les Borjs de la Kasbah is a great place to return to after a busy day sightseeing in the craziness that is Marrakech! Our room was clean and an adequate size. There was a table and chairs just outside the door to relax in. The riad and rooms have some lovely architectural details that remind you that you are in Morocco (unlike some nondescript hotel rooms). Like most riads in Morocco it has lovely courtyards. The pool was a great way to escape the hot Moroccan sun and seemed clean. The breakfasts were satisfying and we also had dinner one night at the hotel and it was quite good. Moreover the staff were all friendly and professional.    The riad is about a twenty minute walk from Jemaa el fna square and all the attractions and restaurants that we wanted to go to. We never had to use a taxi while there so its location is convenient if you are okay with short walks.    We did have some slight issues with parking our rental car. At first someone on the street tried to convince us that we could not drive down the street the riad was on (not true) but we continued. The area the riad recommended was full but we found another place close to the hotel. It is a bit of a challenge driving and parking on the narrow streets but worth it to stay within the walled city.    I would definitely recommend staying here while in Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"George Town, Grand Cayman",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAabG

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Chris O wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Peace and quiet,Stayed at Les Borjs de la Kasbah in April 2013. It is an oasis of peace and quiet away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. Beautiful courtyard with fountain library IT facilities and lovely comfortable sofa area which is great for relaxing with a good book after a hectic day sight seeing. Room was delightful - large with a seating area  TV and a huge well appointed bathroom. Also had a heater which made the room comfortable on chilly evenings. Buffet breakfast in the atrium was delightful - lots of choice and freshly cooked eggs and pancakes. We ate in the restaurant each evening - traditional Moroccan cuisine or Moroccan with a French twist -all delicious and good value. Had a excellent hamman and a massage in the spa. Staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough for us. Les Borjs is an easy 15-20 minute walk from the main square. Definitely a great place to stay.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854ChrisO
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,HStreet wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Tranquil oasis in a hectic city,This was our first visit to Marrakesh and hopefully will not be our last. The experience enhanced by the welcome to the lovely Riad set within the walls of the city.  We were collected from the airport by Abdul and whisked back to the Medina in 15 minutes where we were welcomed by Mohammed with a welcome glass of fresh fruit juice. After being shown round the Riad we were taken to our room (303). The room has a dual aspect looking out in to a courtyard on one side and the pool on the other. The bathroom had both a shower and bath and the basin and towels were decorated with rose petals – these were replaced daily. The bed was also covered in petals and each day a different design was left. Despite the fact that the bed was 2 large single mattresses pushed together with a double sheet over it was still very comfortable and no one disappeared down the gap!  On the first full day we took a walk around the city with a personal guide (Camil) – this was a wonderful way to see some of the sights and understand what we were looking at as our guide was very knowledgeable about the various historical sites he took us to. One note of caution – he did take us to a shop where it was almost expected we had to buy and to pay in cash – while the spices we bought I have enjoyed using it was not clear if we could have had a better deal elsewhere. This did leave us without any cash as we walked through the medina but I think my partner was secretly pleased I could not buy everything I saw. We did eventually have to go to a cash point and at this point it was useful to have the guide as he pointed out that some cash points are not as safe as others!  Another day we took a drive out to the Atlas mountains – the only problem was that I had not taken any walking shoes and my sandals were woefully inadequate for the trek up the mountain so we had to stay at the bottom – not a bad thing as we sampled the local tea and watched the local life in the village. There were plenty of hawkers trying to sell you anything even though we had no cash. On the way up we had stopped at a Berbers house and were shown around and even offered to have some to the bread that had been freshly made We had also stopped at a local cooperative where the ladies of the village sat and cracked the nuts of the argen tree to make the oil that is used in many different ways. On the way back we stopped at a pottery where there were thousands of pots of all shapes and sizes and colours.  On the last day we took a horse drawn carriage ride around the city – what an experience in the Marrakesh traffic! We went to see the gardens that Yves St Laurent restored – defiantly worth a visit. The driver dropped us at the door and waited for us to return. He then took us on a tour of the city very nice to see it from a different angle.  Breakfast & Dinner in the hotel is in an open air courtyard with a room to one side (just in case of rain) however we discovered that this courtyard did have a roof that was slid over – just as well as one night the heavens opened and a spectacular thunderstorm hit Marrakesh. The food was lovely and a good selection of local and European dishes were on offer. It was my birthday on one night and after dinner a cake had been arranged and all the kitchen staff came out and sang to me! Another night there was some local entertainment music and dancing – the belly dancer was mesmerising to all! There was also a girl who was henna tattooing during dinner.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HStreet
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Callebaut wrote a review Apr 2013,50,A Five-Star Experience,After looking online at several smaller riads I chose Les Borjs de la Kasbah because I wanted a riad in the medina. As a woman traveling with two other women I also wanted to have hotel services such as a bar and restaurant.    Les Borjs is absolutely beautiful -- even better than the website -- with wonderful service. The staff made arrangements for day trips to the Ourika Valley and Essaouria a half-day guide in the medina and last-minute manicures and pedicures in the hotel's peaceful spa. The hotel bar serves an excellent Moroccan rose.    My only quibble was with the hotel's restaurant recommendations. On two separate occassions we asked for suggestions for dinner. Both times we were directed to Al Baraka in the Djemma el Fna. When I heard the location the first time and that there was belly dancing I asked for another recommendation but was told that other guests liked it because of the belly dancing. Then on our last night we asked the woman at the front desk who wasn't the same one as earlier in the week for a nearby restaurant. We said we had an early flight and wanted a casual dinner. Once again we were directed to Al Baraka. Fortunately another guest recommended the Kasbah Cafe which was less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Chicago,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Callebaut
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,kikashi wrote a review Apr 2013,50,A gem,The entrance is in a cement wall in an unprepossessing street. Once inside though the place is a Tardis-like revelation. There are large rooms a peaceful central courtyard with a fountain tables and nooks with sofas.    The restaurant also in an atrium has a retractable roof three storeys above. Breakfast is half buffet (fruit pastries the usual stuff) and half cooked to order (omelettes pancakes eggs as you want them). Dinner was also good typical Moroccan food.    Our room was large very clean and very quiet. There were rose petals artistically scattered on the huge four-poster bed. The bathroom had a bath and separate shower. There was a comfortable sofa and a TV which had all the main UK channels not just BBC News.    There's a decent-sized swimming pool which gets sun for most of the day despite being in a walled garden.    The staff were friendly charming and attentive. Some spoke a little English (as well as French and Arabic); one Tom is English and very helpful.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kikashi
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,salandmick wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Thank you,"Stayed at ""Les Borjs"" in February 2013 three couples and one couple took their 12 year old son. My husband and I have stayed before for the others it was a first trip to Marrakech. Yet again the Borjs de las Kasbah was everything a riad should be an oasis of calm in a hectic city. The staff are unfailingly courteous and helpful special mention to Tom and our lovely waitresses at breakfast and dinner who went out of their way to make my 12 year old nephew feel at home...he quickly got used to their good natured teasing and he said it made him start every day with a smile. The food as always was first class the bedrooms spacious and well appointed and the airport transfers and trips organised by the Riad went like clockwork...The half day city walking tour is a good way to start a trip to this city you get a sense of the history and geography and how life is and was lived and because you have a guide there is no hassle from stallholders etc. The trip to the Atlas mountains was a joy walking in the snow with the sun hot enough to warrant factor 25. Several of our party hadnt holidayed outside Europe before they are all hooked and looking forward to their next trip and every one of them has said they wouldnt stay anywhere else other than Les Borjs de la Kasbah.",Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Stafford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salandmick
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Woozle111 wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Fabulous Hotel in a Beautiful City,We are a group of 40-something women who have just returned from a 4 day trip to Marrakech (March 2013)' One had a birthday the day we arrived and another during the stay.    We picked Les Borjs de la Kasbah after reading extensive reviews on Tripadvisor of various Riads available and couldn't fault it. Before arriving there was some email correspondence which was always answered within 24 hours efficiently and courteously. The hotel arranged for a taxi to collect us from the airport. Not a long trip but the taxi can drop you directly outside the hotel which makes life a lot easier!! It worked out at 15 euros per room so 7.50e each which seemed comparable to the prices at the airport and a lot more efficient.    The hotel is beautiful as you can see from the photos already posted. We were in room 206 - a double with really nice bathroom sitting area tv (never switched on but I believe they have all the cable channels!!) fridge etc. There is an enclosed terrace outside 205 and 206 with sliding windows overlooking the breakfast area and a small table and chairs outside the room. perfect for sitting and having a drink (or a cigarette!!!)The whole roof of the breakfast area slides back 'a la Wimbledon' which is lovely!!    The courtyards are beautifully kept with a library area (book exchange) tv room comfy area with couches and cushions. This is also the best place to get a strong wi-fi signal. The pool area is perfect. Heated pool that is a decent enough size to swim in lots of sunbeds and umbrellas. No stress no grabbing of sunbeds - just peace and quiet :-)    The staff could not do enough to help. Always smiling and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them. The birthday girls received 'Happy Birthday' cards and their names spelled out in flowers on their beds!!! The rooms were kept immaculately as were all areas of the hotel.    Breakfast was a real treat. Lots of choice; eggs cooked to order wonderful pastries moroccan breads fresh fruit cereals cheeses etc. I don't think anyone could fault the choice. We also ate there one evening and again the food was fabulous and exceptionally good value.    All in all the hotel was a joy to stay at and I would certainly go back there again.    Boring bits but may be useful!!! Rooms have a safe deposit box with a key. Hairdryers are in the bathrooms quite powerful but no styling nozzles if you need one!! No kettles in room (we took a travel kettle which was perfect for early cups of tea on the terrace - how terribly British!!). Brilliant showers and constant hot water and pressure. Towels and bathrobes provided. Didn't have any problems with mozzies or flies. Easy straightforward walk to the main square (about 15-20 minutes saunter). 2 minutes to the Tombs. Bombarded by every stall-keeper and shop owner you pass. A smile and some patience goes a long way :-). We did get fed up with people trying to show us the way to places (and expecting payment) so had to be quite firm in our 'No's' !! Money changing is easy. We tended to use the exchange at the Government Department store with the big stone lions outside on the way to the square. The rates didnt vary enough for us to need to hunt around. This shop is expensive but hassle-free so a good place to look at the sort of things you might want to haggle for in the souks!!    A beautiful city that requires a lot of walking but is worth every step. I think 4 days is enough for Marrakech - if I had been staying longer I would have wanted to visit the mountains or the coast. Places we enjoyed: tombs Jardin Majorelle Tanneries Dyers Souk Spice Souk (jewish quarter) Maison de la Photographie sunset over the square on a rooftop terrace. Dinner on the roof at Cafe Kasbah.

The staff are very friendly and were only too happy to help out with ordering taxi's and recommending places to visit. Breakfast was plentiful and the dinning room in a lovely setting. I didn't try the spa but my sister and friends all had a massage and said it was very good. Marrakech is an amazing city - vibrant and lively and full of contrasts.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Swarmite wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Faultless. Back for the 10th time.,"Just returned from yet another relaxing stay at Les Borjs. It's like being home from home for me after coming here many times since January 2011 so I can vouch for the other reviews in excellence. I am over 65 and travel to different countries every 2 months mostly combining business with leisure. On one occasion I hadn't booked ahead so swiftly and Les Borjs was full so I stayed at the newly revamped famous landmark 4* Design Hotel in Gueliz 4* La Renaissance ( #236 of 437 Hotels in Marrakech). Much more expensive soulless and certainly not the kind of personal service I had got used too staying in the 4* Les Borj de la Kasbah (#76 of 437 Hotels in Marrakech). I soon learnt to book ahead.    The difference between this family owned boutique hotel in the Kasbah and a swanky corporate like La Renaissance is the love and detail that dwells within at Les Borjs. Tom Jihane ( the lady in the office ) Sofia the attentive maid and Hassna in the Spa rooms are just examples of care toward me pampering and devotion to the craft of service. Nothing is too much. Sometimes I would work in Casablanca for 10 days topping and tailing work with a 4 day Les Borjs relaxation stay either side which proved invaluable as did being able to leave small bits of shopping and luggage behind saving me lugging it all the way to Casa and back. This is high personal service. Incidentally I don't speak french and on more than one occasion Reception organised train tickets for me or written details down on paper for me to hand into the ticket office. I tried this at La Renaissance Reception and got blank looks. Nothing is too much trouble at Les Borjs.    A recent addition to Les Borjs is updated cable TV prior to this visit BBC World on a loop was the only English option while now you can get all UK terrestrial Channels( plus European networks ) great if you plan a long visit and want a night in. I'm not really a 'pool person' but the laid back serenity of the open air pool is exactly what is required somedays reading a book and for me a plus - an almost child free zone. Only seen one child on all my 10 visits to Les Borjs larger 'family' hotels inevitably have a more vibrant pool area which I am inclined to avoid.    I aways book half board upfront not just for it's outstanding value but simply because I have never had a bad meal in 10 visits. Not one. Stylish beautifully presented clean wholesome Moroccan/French/ with an Asian fusion dinner menu. Restaurants in London charge more than double for less. Service is exemplary and the breakfast buffet is a feast of invention difficult to know where to start the choice is huge but I always go for the homemade yogurt first with the good coffee and the sweetest freshest orange juice to follow then I start eating as the stomach takes me. You won't fail to be impressed by Naoual & Fatima in the Restaurant & Bar long term employees and always welcoming made my stay as a single person not feel out of place with the couples at table and never made to feel ""alone' in a restaurant. As I said FAULTLESS and my moroccan home from home.

The staff were lovely particularly on reception the rooms and all other areas were really well decorated and very well kept. Breakfast was good and when we chose not to go out in the evening the standard of evening meals was also very good. There was about a 15 minute walk to the main square in the old town but apart from having to stay aware of the numerous mopeds it was fine.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,LockeyNewForest_UK wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Pefect in every way,"I can but only agree with all the other reviews given here. This place is wonderful and without fault the staff do their utmost to make you feel welcome and happy - from the welcome mint tea (delicious) and moroccan biscuits on arrival to the amazing breakfasts each morning (yes the avocado smoothie really is as good as Rosemary described) and the lovely - well priced - Moroccan dinner which we had one evening.  Not forgetting the lovely salad lunch in the main courtyard we had on our last day.  The rooms are individually designed with each and all opening out onto beautiful courtyards.  The pool and Spa/Hamman area is tranquil - pool is heated too!  Special mention to Darek who actually went out of his way to buy us a Supratours coach ticket as we mentioned one day that we had to go across to the station in the new town to buy it to go to Essaouira after our time in Marrakech - he just said leave it to me and we only found out afterwards that he actually went to get it personally - and he asked for no commission either - just the face value.  He also organised a great daytrip for the two of us and another solo traveller in the hotel's minibus up to the Ourika Valley to see the waterfalls at Setti Fatma. The driver was a great tour guide giving lots of tips and stopping at the places we wanted to go to.  You sensed that this level of service is the norm here.  There is nothing not to love here (unless your idea of a good holiday is to stay in your room on t'internet and you find that the hotel wifi doesn't extend to the rooms - which would not be my idea of a holiday but I guess it is for some people?) As it happens there is a free to use PC in one of the rooms off the main courtyard for essential net and email use - more than good enough for us.  One tip don't take any notice of scroungers outside and on the walk up to the tourist areas (and everywhere else in Marrakech too) - they will try to tell you that the road ahead is ""closed"". its a ploy to ask you for money when they have you all alone or to direct you subltly to their mate's spice/slipper/etc shop- even the ones who engage you with that old classic: ""I am a university lecturer and i was lucky to meet your lovely Queen when i was at a reception held by our crown prince"". the whole idea is to get you somewhere a little quiet before requesting in sinister tones for some money to buy milk for ""my newly born twins who's mother cannot lactate"". As anyone who's been to Marrakech before will attest It's virtually impossible not to fall for someone's story at some time. the best insurance is just not to have a 100dirham note as your smallest change - just make sure you have a few 5 dirham coins in your pocket to quickly hand over and scarper quickly - and put it down to experience and enjoy laughing about it when you tell the tale later (as i am doing now!)

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,gluepot wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Friendly hotel,My wife and I stayed here 3 nights in late Feb. Hotel and room were immaculate. Staff very helpful kind and friendly. Breakfast was good a bit disorganised but in a laid back kind of way. Pool and patio areas gave space and peace.... I imagine the pool must come as a welcome cooling off place in the hotter weather.    Marrakech was a bit of culture shock for us. The hotel is in a cobbled street full of workshops and shops for the locals it is slightly off the beaten track yet still inside the city walls. It took a bit of getting used to but once you know your way round the kasbah area and up towards Jemma n Fnaa square is great for exploring by foot. But a taxi can stop outside the hotel as well if you feel too tired to walk to one of the sights. So all in all the location is fine.    It is a 5 min walk to the Saadian tombs and the nearby mosque. There is a nice rooftop cafe there..the Kasbah cafe..which we can recommend.. For one evening meal we went to Pepe Nero which was excellent..... and we enjoyed the meal and belly dancing show at Le Salama restaurant (near Jemma n Fnaa..be there by 9pm for a nice 15 min show).

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Buzios_PW wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Superb Hotel de Charme in the heart of the Kasbah,My wife and I visited Borjs de la Kasbah for 3 nights to celebrate her birthday after making a last minute booking with Expedia. The reviews here on Tripadvisor helped me to choose and I have to say I was in no way disappointed by this excellent and charming small hotel.    We arranged for the hotel to pick us up from the Airport (for a price of 15 euros) and we were taken right to the door of the hotel which is in the Kasbah area of the Medina (the old town). The outside is very unimpressive but once you step through the doors off the noisy street you enter an oasis of charm and calm. We were greeted by friendly staff who invited us to have some mint tea in the courtyard whilst we waited for our room to be prepared. The courtyard is beautiful and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.    We were then shown around the hotel and then taken to our room. We had booked a suite and arrived at room 202 which has a private balcony which overlooks the outdoor restaurant area. The room itself was excellent. Sofa chairs satellite TV minibar then up a level to the bed and a great en-suite with bath and shower. There were flower petals on the bed and spread around the bathroom. There was a bowl of fruit and complimentary water. The room was very clean and very comfortable. Very quiet at night and complete with heating which is useful as it can get a little chilly at night in January (even though daytime temperatures were 28C).    The hotel has a lovely heated outdoor pool and a spa (which sadly we did not get around to using so cannot comment).    The hotel also has beautiful outdoor areas in Moroccan style. There is an internet area and you can pick up wifi in most of downstairs area including the restaurant - but not in the rooms.    There is also a bar which you often will not get in a Riad - so an added bonus.    Breakfast was great with a choice of fruits cereals bread homemade yoghurt. You could also have eggs omelettes etc and a selection of Morrocan pancakes cooked to order.    We did eat in the restaurant twice. Even though the food was very good I would say that this was the weakest aspect of the hotel as it was not up to the standard that the website had led us to believe. However the service was good and the environment was lovely.    From the hotel you can walk to the Jemaa el Fna square within about 10 minutes. This is a very safe walk (as long as you don't get run over by a moped). If you are feeling adventurous you can also get there via the maze of small passageways of the Kasbah by just entering the passage directly opposite the hotel. So the position of the hotel is ideal - you are in a quiet corner of the Medina but within an easy reach of all the action.    The staff were always very helpful throughout. Always available to answer any questions. All spoke good English.    If I ever go back to Marrakech I would definitely go straight back to the Borjs del le Kasbah as I do not believe you could do much better.

We stayed in a suite which was lovely spacious and very luxurious. There was a bowl of fruits in the room on arrival. I slept very well even though the hotel is in the Kasbah area as there was no noise at all coming from outside. The hotel is very tastefully designed which made me feel very relaxed after spending a day walking around the Medina. The staff very very nice and very attentive to our needs. I would definitely return to this hotel if I ever go back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hayling, null, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosaneW
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Tatiana v wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Les Borjs de la Kasbah - oasis of charm in Marrakesh,We spent 3 nights in this charming small hotel and were very happy there. Set back from the street with the pretty garden inside the whole place feels like an oasis. Beautiful orange trees flowers and small fontain in the middle put you in a different place from the Marrakesh streets outside. After a hard and hot day in Medina you can dip yourself in the swimming pool or relax in hammam with massage and spa. Everything is made here with love -- from style rooms and comfortable bathrooms till soft sofas in the garden where we sat looking through our photos of the day. The food in the retaurant is exellent ; breackfast and a la carte .You can try not only delicious Moroccan food - lamb tadjin is very good - but european as well. Every timereturning to hotel from our excursions we felt as if we were coming home so pleasant was our staying here.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Brian C wrote a review Feb 2013,50,“A Jewel in Marrakech”,Les Borjs de la Kasbah is a real find. It combines Moroccan authenticity with every modern comfort. We’ve stayed here three times now and would gladly come back. The unassuming entrance belies the elegant courtyards the feeling of quiet and space where you can relax under orange trees and escape the hustle and noise of the city. It’s located within the walled city and the transfer from the airport takes only 15 minutes. The staff made us welcome at once and were attentive throughout our stay. We found the dining experience very good not too expensive and the menu changes each day. You won’t get your full English here but with home-made breads and yoghurt and pancakes and eggs cooked to order you won’t go hungry at breakfast. The rooms are spacious and attractively furnished and the beds extremely comfortable. We loved the fact that the owners only employed a Marrakech architect and local craftsmen to build this hotel handcrafting all the lovely decoration using traditional methods.

The cuisine too provides an excellent choice of both local and European dishes.  This riad was formerly several different dwellings so each bedroom is unique . Ours was beautiful overlooking an inner courtyard typical of Moroccan buildings. It had all the usual extras that people seem to expect these days!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Sally S wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Good place to stay,Eight of us just spent 3 nights at the Borjs to celebrate a 50th Birthday. The staff could not have been more helpful from booking through to the time of our stay. They put on a party for us for the 50th along with singers a belly dancer and a fantastic cake. All the staff were courteous funny and helpful.    We had a premium room which had everything we needed even british TV channels if required. The bathroom was fine with an adequate shower and toiletries along with lovely towels.    We all ate in the large part of the dining room which had 3 patio heaters in. We were never cold in that part of the dining nor the breakfast room. Cant see how previous reviewer sat around breakfast buffet as this was laid in the corner of the smaller dining room. We were not cold in the bar area which had heaters on the wall.    We enjoyed the food although there is not a lot of choice. 2 choices for each course. The tagines were excellent. The food for the party was not as good as the other nights. We felt there was adequate choice for breakfast with fresh juice fruit cereals yoghurts bread croissants etc and you could have pancakes as well as cooked eggs. Make sure you ask for the egg choices as they dont ask you. We were asked on the first morning but not again.    The transfer was very quick at 15 minutes from the airport although we were unaware that you are charged 400 (£28 ish) dirhams to back to the airport. Only the pick up is included in the room rate. It is cheaper to get a taxi which is around 80/100 I believe. It was a 15 minute easy walk to the Souks and main square. We would not hesitate to recommend the Borjs. It was nice to be in a small hotel where all the staff knew you rather than in one of the large impersonal hotels located on the outskirts of the city.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/172sallys

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,geoffruth wrote a review Dec 2012,30,Not bad but not as good as reviews?? Be warned!,I have to question how some hotels receive their reviews. This Riad is well placed for most of the souks main square and main sights. However the walking is done amongst cars vans motor bikes cycles and even horse drawn carriages using the same narrow confined space. It is an area totally unsuitable for anyone with any mobility difficulties at all in view of the uneven street without pavements with many obstructions. Just to make it worse there is the intense traffic pollution and none stop harassment to contend with.  The Riad itself is quite beautiful if a little basic. The staff are very friendly and helpful but some are a little inexperienced. The breakfast is not particularly good and the dinner is only average and not particularly cheap. Eating out is a much better option for those able to venture out.  Be warned... we stayed in early December and our first three days were very cold no more than 13C by day dropping to 2C at night. This meant that there was nowhere in the Riad where it was warm enough to sit except our room which did have a large fan heater.  We were very surprised that we were not told that the pool and the area around it was to be closed for repair. I found out by accident and did request a discount or upgrade which was given. However this was not adequate compensation for having nowhere at all on the premises to sit in the sun which was the only way to get warm.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffruth
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Yvonne C wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Amazing Riad located within the walled city and easy access to the Souks etc,I recently stayed at this wonderful Riad with my grown up daughter and this Riad was the best part of our stay in Marrakech.    Its a lovely traditional classic Moroccan Riad beautifully designed situated centrally in the Kasbah close to the Royal Palace and within easy access of all the Souks etc.    I had an offer of four nights for the price of three which was half board so we had all our evening meals at the Riad. The food was reasonable in price and excellent I have to say. There is nothing not to like about this Riad with the exception of it would have been nice to have had tea/coffee facilities in the rooms. I asked for room 303 when making the booking and they were really kind in giving me this room. There was a lovely courtyard with a water fountain in the middle plus a swimming pool at the rear f the property.    The only slight thing that happened which was more annoying than anything was on the last night when washing my hair in the shower the water stopped. I went down to the reception to be told it would be back on again shortly. It only happened the once but by the time that the water came on again I had managed to get chilled (the weather was quite chilly in the evenings) and needless to say I came back home to the UK with a stinking cold.    The staff were extremely helpful and polite at all times. They used to put flower petals on your bed and sink every day.    Unfortunately the weather was really mixed during our stay. I had a couple of days where I sat by the pool for a short while when the sun did actually decide to come out. Generally the weather was quite chilly at times it was grey and cloudy then pouring with rain on our last day.    During our stay we used to walk up to the Souks most days and also went round the Royal Palace. You would see the snake charmers and the monkeys in the square. We used the taxi service through the Riad to be collected from the airport and then again going back to the airport.    If I ever decide to go back to Marrakech I would most certainly stay at this lovely Riad again.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Melton Mowbray, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaegerchick

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Kris G wrote a review Dec 2012,40,great riad,Very comfortable place to stay feels like a new hotel but has all the style of a traditional riad. Hotel itself is very beautifully designed. Everything in the guest room is new and well maintained. Staff puts flower petals on your bed and sink every day :) most staff spoke English well and were very helpful! They called a shuttle for me back to the airport among many other things. You can eat meals here if you dont feel comfortable out in the medina.    downpoints: no wifi in room had to go to lounge/patio/internet room to get it which was inconvenient late at night when planning what to do the next day. maybe the wifi signal doesnt travel well through the thick riad walls?    Also the riad is located in the far south of the medina so it was a bit of a trek up the Rue de la Kasbah to get to the main square Jemaa Al-Fna and the narrow Rue de la Kasbah tends to be clogged with mopeds/scooters spewing foul exhaust that you constantly have to watch out for. I suppose it is typical of the crowded medina area though.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrisG93

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Sue B wrote a review Nov 2012,20,Lovely place located in the Medina in the Kasbah area,Great place lovely room we had a suite on the first floor which was beautiful lovely huge 4 poster bed seperate bathroom with a shower and bath. Pool area was lovely we didnt go in the pool as it was in the shade so not warm enough due to the time of year but the sun beds were in the sun for a couple of hours. Food was lovely we are there 1 night and breakfast was good. The only complaint which is why I gice an overall 3 was the hotel allowed a film crew to stay and they should have closed the hotel to other guests because they took over everywhere even the restaurant not allowing the other guests of the hotel to eat in the main area we were all sat in the side areas so could not see the traditional musicians and they even told them to turn down their singing and instruments so they could talk!! There was a seperate conference room they could have made them use if thats what they wanted to do! They were constantly talking loudly mobiles ringing all the time and generally noisy which is not what we went to the Riad for in fact the riad actually stated in its brochure that this sort of behaviour was not acceptable. It is a place to get away from work and mobiles so we were very disapointed. We would not have expected the hotel to turn away this big business but they should have insisted they hire the whole riad. One morning they were shouting and mobiles ringing at 5.30am !!! Just ignorant and a complete lack of care for other people. A great shame as the day before they arrived it was a perfect oasis of tranquility.,Date of stay: November 2012,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueB205

A lot of the weighing & preparing of ingredients had been done in advance for us AND we didn't have to wash up - just eat the delicious meal we'd cooked!  We booked on the internet before we left the UK & at the same time chose which of the 3 menus on offer we'd like to cook.The cost was 400Drh each (half payable in advance) the rest after we'd eaten the meal which was beautifully served to us at a table beside the swimming pool.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Fabregasuk wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Successfully mixes a riad with a hotel,It's in good area which has many features you'd get in a hotel but with the charm of a riad.    Sadly my room was very small - however it was adequate for my needs. The bathroom was made more than just functional thanks to a sink unit made from a beautiful piece of marble. Water pressure and temperature were perfect - unusual for riads in my experience. The courtyard was pretty and the swimming pool and bar made it have a boutique hotel feel - most riads will not have these facilities. My room also had a mini bar and breakfast cold be brought to the room.    The place had really friendly staff all of whom spoke good levels of English. They were a good example of how decent staff can make a good place great.    Breakfast was fine not amazing but good for the price. I ate once at the restaurant - decent if limited menu options. However the food was delicious - have the chocolate dessert - it is staggeringly good and you are on holiday..    I can see why many people especially those new to Marrakech would love the place. An orange tree grows by the pool - those in the room on the first floor could probably reach out and pick them off the tree. The courtyard is airy and surrounded by lounges ideal for chilling out.    My room was able to pick up the wifi in the communal area - to me wifi is as important in hotels as water and electricity so hopefully this will be hotel-wide soon.    The location is fine - about 15 mins to the centre but there is a kiosk just outside selling water and snacks if you need some essentials. One slight disappointment was to be told that there was a car park when i was emailing the hotel before my trip only to find that this meant the street. It's a tiny narrow street and leaving it there is a risk due to the commotion you get in every Marrakech street. I was told by one of the locals that he would deliberately damage my car because I was parking it outside the hotel rather than at the end of the street where there was one of the hundreds of parking attendants you see in the town. I don't know if the car was damaged because it had so many dints and scratches anyway (the guy from Avis said to me 'everywhere' when we looked round the car for scratches and dints when I picked it up).    There is a noticeboard in the hotel which shows it under construction five years ago. To see the pile of rubble and a donkey where there is now a swimming pool and sun loungers shows what an achievement this place is. People who have had the vision to make places like this have transformed Marrakech and restored many riads to their former glory.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fabregasuk

This unimposing Hotel is like a pomegranate sold on one of the local fruit stalls nothing special to look at from the outside but open it up and take a peep inside and it’s full of little jewels. The staff were helpful welcoming and considerate but without being intrusive and our generously sized bedroom had plenty of storage space free safe was very clean and tidy and a couple of richly coloured local carpets added to the welcoming warmth of the room which was topped off with bath robes and the largest fluffy bath towels.  Fresh pancakes and eggs cooked to order any which way made a for a classic start to the day setting us up for a stroll along Rue de La Kasbah to the sights and sounds of Jemaa el fna. After more than a spot of shopping in the souks snake charmers and the maelstrom of the streets it’s worth getting back to Les Borjs de Kasbah early to spend a couple of hours around the pools relaxing in the sanctuary of the riad.  Marrakech is brimming with places to eat so we only had one evening meal at the hotel and although this didn’t quite match the timbre of the rest of our stay I’ve no hesitation in recommending Les Borjs de Kasbah as a great place to stay.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hayle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Velovox

Just take the 20 minutes walk and enjoy being submerged in more and more crowded streets to end up on the square.  I would advise to take a taxi home after midnight. It won't burn your money.

The room [305] was superbly appointed and decorated tastefully in what I am sure reflects local style and tradition with a modern twist. Bath robes and fluffy towels in plentiful supply fresh flowers quality toiletries good flat screen TV with Freeview a huge comfy bed with lovely fresh linen and everything you would expect of a top class European hotel made this a wonderful comfortable sanctuary to which to return from the frenzy and mayhem of the Kasbah.    The staff and thereby their management have achieved that rare golden mean of being friendly and available whenever you needed them without ever being pushy or ""in your face"". The pool and surroundings are likewise first rate: solid wooden loungers with clean fabric cushions and fluffy towels provided. Cool discrete changing rooms with individual lockers prevent you having to ""to and fro"" between pool and room and the whole area is scrupulously maintained.    We ate in most nights and found the quality of food and value for money significantly better than when we ate out. The food was contemporary European with some local twists. Breakfasts with a well stocked buffet for the cold stuff and cook to order for eggs crepes etc all accompanied by quiet classical music were a particular treat and the perfect start to the day.    What made Les Borgs really special to us was the architecture that preserved a riad style with modern convenience in one harmonious whole - the line of sight from the central courtyard to the mosaic and fountain on the dining room wall showed real flair and the opening glass roof [as at Wimbledon] preserved a traditional outdoor feel by use of modern techniques to ensure comfort in any conditions.    The situation at the South end of the Medina was great for access to all main sights [twenty mins walk to the Souks and Jemma El Fna a few minutes from Royal Palace etc].

This riad is a wonderful peaceful haven away from the chaos & intensity of Marrakech. It is spotlessly clean with good sized rooms ( we stayed in 3 of them) good standard of furnishings & comfortable beds. Robes  toiletries hair dryer (a powerful one) fluffy towels all provided with good quality sanitary ware in the bathrooms. Internet terminal & computer available & free to use plus library room all opening out onto the central courtyard.

The food in the Riad is first class- excellent choice of food at breakfast  plentiful & served in the restaurant which has a retractable roof so you eat under the sun or stars. Omelettes & other egg options are freshly made & the yogurt home made. Only comment is I prefer the Moroccan pancakes freshly made rather than made & then reheated & this I fed back .  We ate dinner here on one night - delightful ambience excellent food reasonably priced with efficient  attentive yet discreet first class service by the friendly staff .We celebrated our wedding anniversary & they made it so special. The staff went out of their way to ensure our stay here was a good experience  made enquiries if they didn't know the ansas ( eg dress code at the Mamounia ) & responded to problems immediately ( our air conditioning broke and we were moved to another room within 20 minutes) .Throughout our stay the staff were attentive efficient & professional at all times  The location of the Riad in the southern medina suited us -a short walk of no more than 10 minutes to the Royal Palace  the Centre Artisanal (to check out the fixed prices here before heading into the souks to ensure you don' t pay over the odds for your souvenirs when haggling ) & Saadian Tombs . Check out Cafe de la Kasbah which has a lovely roof terrace overlooking the Kasbah mosque & entrance to the Saadian Tombs & serves good reasonably priced food too- its a great place to watch all the local life on the streets.

You might want to comparison price directly with tour operators before arranging excursions through the hotel though.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220MaryC
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Adam C wrote a review Sep 2012,40,an oasis of calm in the madness of the Kasbah,"The front facade and the street outside bely the comfort and tranquility that lie behind the walls. The property has been skilfully converted in to a lovely medium sized hotel/riadh the rooms are large well appointed as well as being light and airy and for an added bonus the air conditioning actually managed to keep the room at a pleasant temperature not an oven or fridge which is so often the case.    The restaurant/breakfast area is in an open air courtyard area and is a very pleasant place to start the day the breakfast menu is fairly wide including the staples of ""eggs as you like them"" and ""croissants and jam"". We only ate in the hotel once in the evening and were a little disappointed the menu was good however not all the dishes were cooked well we were perhaps unlucky given the other reviews of the food.    Overall we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and have already decided that if we return to Morocco for a weekend break over the winter then this is where we will stay.",Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adam1630
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Helen H wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"""You could be miles from anywhere""",When the transport from the airport turned into the street I thought I had clicked on the wrong hotel! My fears soon disappeared when we saw what an amazing hotel this was. After a morning out in the hustle and bustle of the markets and attractions my husband sons and I were all eager to return to its peace and tranquility of Les Borjs. The staff were courteous and professional to the point of one of us needing to visit a pharmacy and a member of staff coming with us the help with the language - this I hasten to add was nothing to do with Marrakech. The decor of all the public rooms and our bedrooms was absolutely beautiful. Watching the birds roosting in the courtyard was an amazing sound and sight. The spa treatments were very good especially the hammam which was quite an experience. The breakfasts were of a wide choice and lovely as were the light lunches by the pool. We were a little disappointed with the one evening meal we had in the hotel - this did not reflect on how we felt about the hotel as there are plenty of restaurants locally.  For peace of mind we pre-booked transport from and to the airport.  We also booked a guided WALKING tour through the hotel which was very interesting. At 4 hours it was a touch too long but a must we felt. This 4 night holiday was a surprised 'big O' treat for my husband from my sons of 25 and 22 years old and myself. We were recommend Les Borjs de la Kasbah by friends who went earlier this year. It is an absolute delight and we couldnt have been happier with the choice.

Our second trip to Marrakesh the first being seven years ago and the hustle and bustle that makes this venue so exciting is contrasted by the peace and serenity that pervades Les Borjs.    The food and staff are worth a special mention with chefs creativity always a vegetarian option and always friendly staff giving attentive service.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Tellicherry wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Tranquility base,I'm not that keen on big hot busy hot bustling hot hot cities when it is hot...but...my companion was eager to explore another souk and so we did. To arrive at Les Borjs was a delight after the drive in from Essaouira. It is dark and cool and water trickles in many quiet places where lush plants abound. We were welcomed by the hotel manager with mint tea and biscuits and given a quick sketch of the services and general layout of this jewel of a Riad. The room air con was perfect and controlled via a remote; our room a haven with a minibar and safe and plenty of hanging storage. Did I say the bathroom was a dream? Hand tiled and with both bath and two showers it was complete with double sinks lots of lovely toiletries and big white bathrobes. We had two 'neighbours' on our landing and never heard a squeek.    We soon got into an early morning visit to the dining room for a slightly chaotic breakfast service complete with Moroccan delicacies and could order pretty much whatever one wished. Do try their 'smoothies' - a combination of fruit and vegetables. btw The staff were full of fun and returned smile for smile and were typically fluent in a couple of languages.    Couldn't wait to try the menu in their dining room the first night but I suspect a new chef as the service was tentative and food a bit heavy-handed. Meknes rose wine was delicious & that the room is open to the stars made it a magic evening. The Riad has a convivial bar area next to and overlooking the table area; put it to good use as most restaurants do not serve alcohol.    What else? Walking to the usual suspects - tombs & palace & marketplace - was fairly easy even with a recent hip replacement. A guide and an air conditioned car will get you to all the nooks and souks; do shop at the co-operatives for haggle-free buying.    A week old restaurant The Kasbah Cafe about a 5 minute walk from the riad served wonderful Moroccan dishes on a rooftop over-looking both the Palace walls opposite as well as the storks perched high above the churning crowds below. The rooftop dining area was cooled with the same technology as airlines - automatic mist lines were strung above the rattan umbrellas making the decor as sophisticated as the menu.    All in all Les Borjs is a peaceful oasis of beautifully thought-out rooms and common areas. We felt pampered catered-to but service was never intrusive. Salads and light lunches at the pool bar were absolutely perfect. Books-around-the-pool time in the afternoon was simply heaven after a hot trek thru the big wide world outside.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tellicherry

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,SUH777 wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Amazing place!,First trip to Marrakech. Excellent hotel - for families and couples stayed with 7 yr old child we all loved it. Location close to Jema' el fna - 15 mins walking important historical sites eg saadien tombs and palace badi round the corner. Hotel - very clean and comfortable staff superb - couldn't praise less took care of all our needs. Hotel is in Kasbah ie old part of town so you get to experience the true vibrant culture. Would definitely go back and recommend. Used hotel spa and hammam - very relaxing. Another mega plus point - very calm inside indeed; not noisy!    NB - the majority of guests staying did not have children with them there was another couple with toddlers and ourselves with child staying there at the time but this did not appear to be a problem for staff or any other guests so I would definitely rate this as a family friendly hotel. We have been back 5 days and I can't wait to go back!    Staff were very helpful and housekeeping ensured that the beds were always madde and there were fresh rose petals everywhere daily! We only tried the spaghetti it was nice there are stalls outside the Kasbah where you can grab a quick bite too,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SUH777

Our room was amazing staff was beyond wonderful and the neighborhood was somewhat outside the square (but close enough to walk).    The food was amazing and we ate at the riad many nights because the food was great.    They also recommended many wonderful places to visit.

There is a Pharmacy( english speaking )and a corner shop very close by.Les Borj is typical of Moroccan riad- style hotels there are wonderful courtyards providing calm and cool in the heat of the day.The pool is set in its own terrace and is more than adequate.Our room was large comfortable and well furnished the en suite was spacious and the shower excellent.Wi-fi is available in public areas and some of the bedroomsthere is also a computer which is complimentary for guest use.Breakfast is served in a covered courtyard which gives the feeling of al- fresco eatingplenty of choice but do not expect a full english try the selection of pancakes and pastries instead.Dinner can be taken in the courtyard or inside we found the choice and quality of the french/ moraccan food very good.The staff are the hotels greatest asset they are all very welcoming and courteous english and french is spoken and they were always on hand to give advice on transport sight seeing and hangling in the souks.We stayed for 3 nights mid April and would not hesitate to recommend this Hotel and hope to return ourselves one day soon.,Date of stay: April 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NealIOW
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,JollitaMcJolly wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Another perfect performance..........,"I returned to Les Borjs de la Kasbah six months after my first visit. Last time it was my honeymoon this time it was for a quiet ""girlie break"" with one of my best friends. The visit simply confirmed my view that this place is ""Heaven on Earth"". It is perfect for a quiet romantic holiday or a peaceful get away - with the option of venturing out into the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. The building and its courtyards are beautiful and healing to sit in. The spa is fabulous and I have to say that the prices are very reasonable - try the hammam or the tonic massage (great stretching out of the body and they even massage your eye lids!). Ultimate pampering luxury. But the best part of the hotel is the staff who are all so friendly. They are the heart of the place and make it feel like a home from home. All the staff are very skilled linguists and put many of us to shame in this respect (me!) They go above and beyond the call of duty and are to be congratulated on their professionalism. This time I ate more in the hotel restaurant and have to say that I was extremely impressed - absolutely delicious Morrocan food by night (fabulous chicken with dates and figs or something stuffing it) a gorgeous chicken pastilla and duck to DIE for) but also wonderful day time snacks - if you want a simple club sandwich and chips followed by the best chocolate mousse ever for lunch then this is provided too! A word about the area the hotel is in - it is in the heart of the Kasbah area and feels more like an area the local people live than a tourist area (good!) although there are shops and restaurants that will appeal to travellers. Step outside the hotel and you are in a very interesting world but a non-threatening one and one in which I never feel harrased when I have visited - even when there was just me and my friend as two women together (take ""respectful clothing"" to be polite though). Oh yes in response to the previous review mentioning the swimming pool - it was toasty warm when we were there to the extent that steam was rising off the water in the cool air of the early morning! In conclusion if you are thinking of booking here I would HIGHLY recommend it - you are in for a treat! My husband and I are already booked to go back in the autumn and this may well become a regular thing for us money and time off work permitting.

A nice 15 minute walk along the Rue du Kasbah and we were in the main square (it was like stepping into another world snake charmers monkeys etc - what an experience) Again the hotel was a little oasis for us in this very hot city lovely pool hammam and spa. Little touches made the difference - rose petals on the bed everyday and the hepful staff with tips on how to handle the haggling!!!!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,peter e wrote a review Mar 2012,40,"Well located, comfortable with good service but left on a sour note","This is a very good hotel located in the kasbah and is a far better option to the riads of the medina. Room was most comfortable and traditional in style with good furnishings albeit it was the only hotel during my trip where despite it being early season I was given a single room as booked. Service was also very good throughout my 4 night stay and there was a free internet terminal for guests to use. The courtyard areas were most pleasant to relax in and had much character. Staff were all most polite and helpful and the breakfast choice although limited was quite adequate. Standard in rooms was very high with comfortable bed good pillows and quality towels. Good level of cleanliness everywhere and difficult to fault. Room was nicely heated at night and hot water was always available. Room rates were also good when stayed late February as had 4 nights for price of 3.  However I left this hotel feeling sour after using the self coded room safe during my stay. It was the first of 11 hotels during a 5 week trip around Morocco and I carried 20x £20 notes as a reserve for card failure/loss This money was check counted into the room safe on arrival and recounted before I left and two of the notes were short. Said nothing at hotel as had received such polite service and knew would only be told ""it is impossible"" and ""you are mistaken"" but I was not. Lesson learnt for rest of trip and the reserve remained otherwise intact until my return.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,nativelondoner wrote a review Mar 2012,50,As good as all the other reviews claimed,The enthusiasm with which other travellers had written about this riad raised our expectations - we were not disappointed. The staff were courteous and pleasant the ambience extremely tasteful and the food was well cooked and presented with a wide enough choice for us to eat dinner in the restuarant for four out of the seven nights we stayed without getting bored. We upgraded to a suite (booked through a British Airways package holiday) which was superb and made the holiday for us - not so expensive to do it £160 extra for the week. As others have written it is extraordinary how you step through a door from the hurly burly of the city into an oasis of calm within the courtyard of the riad. This riad was built in 2007 but based on traditional designs and they have done a cracking job. The pool area looked rather cramped in the photos but we found it was fine in reality. A couple of fairly minor points - service could be very slow at lunchtime (dinner was good) so allow plenty of time and the air freshener in the bathroom was a very strong and persistent scent of naphtha (mothballs) - not to everyone's taste maybe it's a Moroccan thing? Overall though Les Borjs de la Kasbah is highly recommended.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nativelondoner

On the edge of the Kasbah close to the Palace walls on a very quiet and clean street it is about 30mins. walk to the square but only 30dirhams by taxi. 30 dirhams is the standard fare within the Kasbah so make sure that you agree this with the taxi driver before getting in to avoid misunderstandings at the end of your journey.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Darlington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidR481

The Riad is about a 20mins to half hour walk to the main square and souk. Therefore it is not a centrally located venue. The Riad itself is stunning. Great ambience and the attention to detail and the service is faultless. The only let down is that...more » there are bedrooms with physical single bed. I found this is very disappointing considering that a lot of visitors to Marrakech are there on holidays - and lets face it who would want to sleep in a single bed? Let alone sleeping in a single bed while on holidays for 4 nights? Aside from this I could not fault the Riad. It is run and managed very well location wise is fine as long as you don't mind the walk. The facilities are well maintained; swimming pool clean and peaceful outdoor space for you to enjoy the sunshine and to relax. Breakfast is well seved; freshly squeezed orange juice each morning Morroccan pancakes fresh fruit.I would recommend the Riad as I really enjoyed the ambience it offers but I would probably not stay there again given that I was allocated a room with a single bed,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RL333

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,js777-777 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Customer Service Commitment,Sometimes it's worth doing the extra bit of homework Les Borjs de la Kasbah is definitely worth consideration to anyone planning a trip to the heart of Marrakech. Although this Riad is situated near the Old Royal Palace and in a quieter part of town (no bad thing) it's an easy and enjoyable walk to the key sights.    I first stayed the Borjs de la Kasbah a little while after it first opened and I recall there were some inevitable but very minor teething problems. I am pleased to report that after five years the establishment runs like a well oiled machine: quiet unassuming and efficient. Not the very cheapest Riad but you always get what you pay for and worth going for one that's established and well run.    I stayed overnight en route from Essaouira and so was only able to have breakfast. In short I concur with many of the other reports excellent quality and great attention to detail.    Before this trip I checked out a few other Riads via Trip Advisor but decided to stick with what I knew and I'm pleased I did. However one of the more recent T-A reports for Les Borjs stated that the pool was unheated – I feel I must correct this as the manager told me over breakfast that they'd recently replaced the pool's heat pump at considerable expense!    I shall continue to recommend Les Borjs de la Kasbah to colleagues friends and family.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,chriscSussex wrote a review Feb 2012,40,A Peaceful retreat from the bustling Marrakech,On arriving for our first visit to Marrakech it was early evening we were a little daunted when the taxi driver drove us up the Kasbah to the hotel.  On arriving we were greeted and shown to the bar where we then given a cup of Morocco mint tea. Then a quick tour of the Riad and to our room.  We booked one of the Suits and it lived up to expectations. Beautifully decorated and rose petals everywhere. Bed very comfy!.The view from the suite looked over the main courtyard.  The Riad restaurant offers good food and I would recommend going for the specials menu as it makes you try a few different dishes.  The one downside is that on the Riad website it says heated pool and this is not the case in fact it was icy cold and even putting our feet in was painful.  The Riad is well located at the end of the kasbah and is a 15-20 minute walk to the sooks.

My room was one of the smallest yet it was warm inviting comfortable and I loved its cosiness and charm. A great shower lovely toiletries provided a soft robe and rose petals on the bed all helped to make this hotel that bit above average.    In fact I loved it! Breakfasts were good with plenty of choice - suggest you don't leave it to the last minute though. The bread cakes and yoghurts are homemade and delicious. The cook will prepare you an omelette or boiled egg if you wish.    I took the Cookery course which was a lot of fun and interesting too. However the actual food I had cooked was not all that interesting in taste when I came to eat it later that day. I notice that others comment on the food being bland - I ate dinner her on two other occasions and then the food was excellent and perfectly seasoned for the dish!    Situated at the far end of the Kasbah I enjoyed walking through this very friendly area and could sense the community spirit here. I didn't take the obvious main road route to the main square as my knowledge of the Medina told me it was quicker easier and more fun to go that way.    Would I return? Without a doubt!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,ReinhardW wrote a review Feb 2012,50,DELIGHTFUL AND GOOD VALUE,I have been to the fascinating city of Marrakech more than 20 times over a period of some 40 years and have previously always stayed in 5-star hotels and riads but was attracted by the excellent reviews this rather less pricy small hotel attracts. I am glad to say that my partner and I were not disappointed.  The southern part of the medina is somewhat less touristy than the northern end perhaps because it is a fair (but interesting) walk to Djemaa el Fna and the Koutoubia though less than 15 minutes from the Bahia and Badii Palaces and Saadian Tombs. We were tired enough at the end of the day to dine in something we would not normally do; however Les Borjs de la Kasbah offers an excellent dinner package if you dine in at least three nights and the food is interesting and good. A small supplement for a Moroccan-themed dinner with music and belly dancer was well worth paying. We had no time to use the pool or spa but both looked inviting.  The conversion of several houses into a charming boutique hotel has been done most sympathetically and with good taste. Modern comforts have not diminished authenticity. The multilingual staff were invariably smiling and readily accommodated special requests. The complimentary airport pick-up on arrival and the serving of mint tea and cakes whilst checking in are nice touches.

That happened to us two times and we ended up at Les Borjs de la Kasbah. Thank goodness! This is an oasis. Marrakech is a busy noisy exciting place and when you are done touring what you need is a place like this. Believe it or not you can walk down a sketchy alley full of donkeys motorcycles bikes pedestrians people and go through the doors into a ""riad"" that offers peace and tranquility. The service is great the food is excellent the rooms well decorated and clean. I understand in speaking with the staff that this used to be the #1 rating in Marrakech and it should be! We stayed at five other hotels during our three week trip in Morocco and by far far far this is the best hotel we stayed at. Dinner is great at the hotel -- while you can have Tagine -- you also have a large selection of modern cuisine which is a great break from the standard dish. This was the only hotel to offer a computer and if you want to make international phone calls all you have to do is go to the front desk.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Thomas M wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Marrakesh over New Year 2012,A very nice and in certain ways authentic hotel.  In the middle of the Kasbah where you would not expect a hotel anymore it is like an oasis for tourists.  The hotel offers a very calm extremely friendly and service orientated atmosphere. The rooms are offering all kind of standard features a western tourist would look for. The hotel has its own hammam and pool and the organization of trips in and around Marrakesh help a lot to explore the entire region.  The food in the restaurant is great and offers for everybody something delicious.

The place is beautiful and very clean with very fiendly and attentionate personnel. Everything was thought of to make your experience a memorable one: from the decor of the rooms to comfy morrocan salons in the patio. Its is located at the southern limits of the Medina and close to the Royal Palace and the Tombeaux Saadiens. It is a 20 mns walking distance from Jemaâ El- Fna in an area where you get a full immersion in the local life.

Out of the loud hustle and bustle of the centre but an easy walk in which I think was well worth it. It's so loud that after a busy day exploring coming back to the quietness and chilling by the pool with a nice bottle of rose (£10) was something to look forward to.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,davidandmel wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Wonderful hotel,This is a fantastic place in the southern medina about 15-20 minutes walk to the main square. We thought this side of the medina was more authentic and less touristy than the other side and the best museums are around here. The owners have put a great deal of thought into this hotel - it is the little things that make a hotel perfect and they have truly thought of everything! We booked a suite through Expedia which was just wonderful - a four poster bed lovely sitting area and a large bathroom with yummy toiletries! We arranged an airport transfer through the hotel as our flight landed quite late and the mint tea and biscuits on arrival was a good touch. The room was looked after very well and there were fresh rose petals scattered on the bed every day - we also had fresh roses in the room and a fruit basket. Breakfast was very good (the fresh orange juice and fluffy scrambled eggs were particularly good!) and we ate in the restaurant every night too. The food was very good and we just couldn't face the madness of the medina in the dark!! The staff are a credit to the hotel - do leave some money in their tip box on checkout. They are worth every penny!  We had a hammam in the spa which was great and lunch by the pool one afternoon which was delicious. Because this is a proper hotel there is a 24 hour reception and the staff can arrange anything you wish.  All in all we would say this is one of the best hotels we have ever been to and would love to return one day!,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidandmel
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,faiers wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Oasis of calm and charm in Marrakech,Close to the Royal Palace down a narrow street in the ancient walled city of Marrakech Les Borjs is a group of ancient riads joined together to make a charming little hotel based around several inner courtyards. The staff were very efficient and friendly the breakfast was a comprehensive choice and the spa area delightful. I particularly rated the hammam. Marrakech is an intoxicating blend of cultures and the narrow streets of the Kasbah are a vibrant mix of astonishing sights and smells. You will see tiny shops selling spices storks nesting on chimney tops people tempting you to buy things a hurly-burly of chaotic traffic from horse-drawn carts to hooter-happy taxis. All the while the heady scent of open-air cooking draws you towards the massive main square.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,docppm wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Excellent hotel with superb service,We stayed their with our 2 year old and we were well looked after by the staff.  they went out of their way to make life easy for us and with a 2 year old in tow people should know that this can be a challenge.  Yes the excursions were a bit over priced and our guide was a pain but hey its probably not the hotels fault as any registered guide would cost money.  My advice would be to stay away from this and look to tour the city yourself.  Its not that hard!!  The breakfast was fine and maybe it was us but we got a great variety of things to eat everyday which we relished as otherwise the food is not to everyone palette in marrakech.  The hamam experience was great fun  i only wished we hadnt left it till the last date.    The hours we spent at the jama al fanaa drinking mint tea were well worth if you can find a good enough spot.    Overall i was dreading the trip with my 2 year old but was pleasantly surprised by all the fuss they made of him and he even got cuddled by the belly dancer the hotel had got for one nights entertainment.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Philip L wrote a review Oct 2011,50,A Gem in Marrakech,Marrakech now has a new town with all the world famous retailers and top hotels. But if you want a 5* small hotel with alot of character within walking distance of the main square in the Medina and yet quiet and relaxed Les Borjs de la Kasbah is perfect. They pick you up at the airport which immediately takes the strain away and then after some refreshing mint tea on arrival in their courtyard you find some fruit and gorgeous little cakes in your room along with rose petals on the bed. What a start !!  Also noticed that when you stay in many so-called top hotels the towels are not always large and soft. These were and it was just one of many small details that makes this Hotel rather special.  Day trips to the Atlas Mountains and Essaouira guided tour around Marrakech were all arrangd through the Hotel and excellent. The swimming pool had loungers and large shades for everybody and the spa was well worth the several visits for a massage.  The buffet breakfasts were very good and there was a good deal on the evening meals. We stayed seven nights and three of these meals were outstanding two were good and two were just O.K. We were told they would make sure that all the meals were up to their normal high standard. Their wines were very good and reasonably priced.  We had a wonderful stay at Les Borjs where all the staff were friendly attentive and smiling and have already recommended this Hotel to our friends..,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pipster229

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,ChrisCooke wrote a review Sep 2011,20,OK But not worth the money,Do not get me wrong this is not a bad boutique hotel but it does not live up to the claims on the website or some of the other reviews on here.    The main problem was lack of consistency and small details which you expect when paying this sort of money in a place such as Marrakech.    We stayed for a week in a deluxe room and the main part of the room was nice enough with a good sized bed and plenty of wardrobe space.  However the en-suite was a little shabby and the shower was no use for anyone over 5 foot tall In addition there was little hot water to be had (Only had a proper hot shower on two days out of the week).    Service on the first few days was very patchy but did pick up when more guests arrived. Standards of service should be just as good whether there is one guest or 30.  Excursions  The hotel charges a large premium for excursions booked thru them and for this I expected a much better service (and some protection). Most of the excursions seem to be based around getting as much money out of the guests as possible and there were a number of occasions when we felt rather uncomfortable with the hard sell tactics that were deployed on every single excursion we undertook.  SPA  Use of the SPA and Sauna are at addition charge (Should you really charge for use of the sauna?)My wife and I both had the Hammam and Gommage unfortunately the Hammam ran out of Steam and we were left sitting in a old room for 10 minutes until they fixed it.  My wife also had a couple of massages and she was happy with those  Restaurant  The biggest disappointment was the restaurant. When you consider they charge near enough western charges the standard and service were nothing like those of similar hotels in France.  If you arrived at Breakfast after 8:30 there was not a great deal of choice left (we only managed to get croissants on one day) and on a number of occasions I had to ask the staff to top up the coffee or orange juice) and generally service was not good.  We had evening meals in the restaurant on 3 occasions the first was actually reasonable (though still over priced compared to similar local restaurants) on the second occasion service was reasonable but the food was disappointing (very overcooked which is OK if you order a Taging but not for sliced beef). However on the third occasion my wife and I both had very upset stomachs so suffice to say we did not eat there again.    Overall if Les Borjs wants to appeal to the sort of clients who like true 4 star service it needs to improve both its standards and its consistancy,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,nottingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCooke
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,sznids wrote a review Sep 2011,50,"Simply stunning, cannot wait to return",My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful 4 days in Marrakech and were fortunate enough to have stayed at the stunning boutique hotel Les Borjs de la Kasbah. From the moment we were collected by the friendly driver (transfers are free if you book directly via the website) and arrived at the hotel we knew we had made the right choice. The owners of the hotel have managed to create an incredibly tranquil ambience something impossible to believe achievable given that one of Africa’s busiest squares Jemaa el Fna is just a 10-15 minute walk away.    Our room a premium Double overlooking the courtyard area was very spacious and well equipped with everything you could need for a short stay. The bathroom was a particularly generous size and had the benefit of a separate shower and bath. As with all of the facilities the room was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. The pool area provided a welcomed break from the scorching midday temperatures as were the comfortable seating areas located in the shade around the main courtyard.    If you are planning a stay at Les Borjs de la Kasbah I thoroughly recommend that you eat at the hotels ‘Le Jasmin’ restaurant. It was by far the best food that we ate during our stay in Marrakech and the French & Moroccan menu was complimented by an impressive wine selection something that we found difficult to find in the other restaurants we tried in the area. The snack menu offered by the poolside at lunch times was also very good value.    The staff at the hotel were all absolutely fantastic we simply could not fault the service we received during our stay and we were very sad to leave. We are already planning a return visit to Marrakech and will certainly be booking this hotel again.

Made a fuss of us as it was honeymoon with petals etc on the beds and a nice message. However the highly-moveable twin beds that were REALLY soft werent that conducive! We said so in our questionnaire and had a much better double on our return from a second centre. The pool is lovely and the bar really nice. The food in the restaurant is excellent. (if pricey)  We did the cooking course and the chef was really helpful and informative. He even came out to speak to us on our last night dinner to explain the recipe for dish we loved.  Very good facilities and you dont feel like leaving especially considering the 30 minute hike to the Djmaa Square in the August heat! There is nothing much around there though so you need to go to the square to eat if you are on a budget.  Also the Medina is buzzing and very busy with traffic- watch yourselves as you walk through.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,andrew b wrote a review Aug 2011,50,A beautiful place to stay,I stayed with my wife and two adult daughters. The outstanding feature of the hotel was the quality and friendliness of the service. Nothing was too much trouble and extra touches included providing a bucket of ice for our own wine we had bought and agreeing to provide evening meal service later than usual. All the staff were warm and helpful and this created an important atmosphere of welcome and relaxation. The rooms were beautiful although a slight disappointment was one having only a shower and no bath but the outlook from the bay window was very appealing. Air conditioning was an important reliable feature of the rooms given the 40 degree heat!!. Touches like arrranging flower petals on the bed and artfully folding nightware were also very good. Breakfast was vegetarian and very good quality although some things run out (pastries) if you eat later as we did on one morning. My family very much enjoyed the spa and pool day too which was relaxing in such a peaceful environment. Dinner was good value and the first meal was excellent. There was some disappointment on our second meal when the steak that was ordered as rare came well done. My daughter then asked for some more jus to go with it and was given a vinaigrette tasting mixture and poured it over the meat before she realised what it was. She ate the meal rather than ask for a replacement but it was spoilt. Also my other daughter ordered a lamb dish the same as mine on the first evening and this was a less generous portion and not so skilfully cooked.    We would thoroughly recommend the hotel for all the above positive reasons and also as it is so central to Marrakesh yet is so peaceful and beautiful. It is only a 15 minute walk to the square not 25 as reported elswehere. We would have stayed longer if we could!    General recommendation for the future. We booked through expedia and paid a very high price for the airport transfer whereas if we had booked direct with the hotel the transfer would have been free. The hotel could consider this policy as other expedia hotels (eg Deux Tours) do not charge. It was also slightly disappointing that the hotel forgot us on arrival and we had to phone to be collected despite email confirmations beforehand.    Could the hotel also consider providing complimentary water especially in such searing August heat as we found it expensive to keep paying bar and mini bar prices,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewb526
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Baozao wrote a review Aug 2011,40,Great Choice but on departure it got weird...,From the courteous staff to the lovely surroundings and the great food...this is definitely a good choice for Marrakech.    It is about a 20 minute walk from the centre which is good as you get to see plenty on foot en route. Very near to the Saadian Tombs (about 8 mins) but everything else is just as easily reached on foot. Don't be put off by the hustle and bustle and lack of any real maps...the medina is worth exploring.    My room was small but perfectly clean and comfortable. Although this is a hotel it has a very 'Riad' style to the way it has been designed and decorated. The only complaint with my room was that there was a subtle wiff of stale water in the bathroom but that was eliminated by keeping the plug in the sinkhole!    To avoid any annoying illness that might spoil a short 4 night trip I decided to eat only in the hotel. This turned out to be a very good choice! Breakfast has a reasonable variety of food which won't leave you wanting. The pool snacks that I tried were all really good portions and very tasty and the Moroccan dishes in the restaurant were to die for! The vegetable tagine is just about one of the best things I have ever eaten...I'm not kidding. It might be worth noting that as a Vegan I had no problem in this hotel getting what I needed.    The pool is an absolute God send in the heat of the medina and the courtyard is also a lovely peaceful place to relax and have a tea.    The only thing that left me wondering was a situation on departure. I was told that the credit card terminal wasn't working and that I would have to go to the cash point to get the money out to settle the bill. This also happened to a couple who were leaving the same time as me. We all said 'no way'. Not only it that not safe it's not appropriate. There was some faffing about and they finally got the machine to work in an office next to the reception. They then tried to charge me for an extra night (I had booked a stay 4 pay for 3) so there was some debating and math going on before they realised their error apologised and adjusted the bill. I didn't know until afterwards that this had also been the case for the couple who were leaving the same time as me. We could'nt decide if this was just bad luck mixed with a genuine error or someone trying to scam a few tourists?

After reading so many rave reviews on Tripadvisor we expected a lot more than we actually received.  The Location of this hotel is a lot further from the main sights than we were led to believe. The main square is a good 25 minute walk from the hotel and when returning later in the evening we were continually pestered by young boys near the hotel asking for money which became a real nuissance. The rooms are adequate but not plush and the toiletries in the room were basic and a dissapointment. Pressure in the shower fluctuated daily.  Breakfast again was ok but nothing to get excited about and was not very varied.  The staff all seemed friendly enough but one day by the pool i asked for some mayonaise with my toasted sandwich I had to ask three times before it eventually arrived. when it did it was old and had oil running arround the rim of the bowl and so could not eat it!. Staff seemd to be wandering around in a bit of a dream.  So sadly my husband and i were dissapointed with out stay at the Borj hotel.

One evening the riad held a traditional moroccan evening with entertainment belly dancer musicians and we had a fabulous time.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Levoyageur wrote a review Mar 2011,50,an oasis of peace,This is a beautiful hotel created from a riad and several old houses which blend to make a luxury hotel with the rooms looking on to courtyards full of flowers orange trees and fountains. All the rooms are different - our party of 8 ladies took the 4 twin bedded rooms two being standard rooms and two deluxe. There really wasn't much difference in them- the deluxe rooms being a little bigger but they were all furnished well with easy chairs comfortable beds large wardrobes with rugs cushions and walls in soft earth colours.The bathrooms were very large and had a large bath with shower separate shower cubicle and some had double sinks too. They were all spotlessly clean  The hotel staf fwas one of the best things about the hotel. All spoke perfect English and nothing was too much trouble for them. They were obviously proud of their hotel and genuinely seemed to enjoy their work always smiling and very helpful.  The hotel is within the walled Kasbah but a 20 min walk from the main square. We never felt threatened when walking and taxis were easy to find if you didn't fancy the trek. We also walked to the Saadian tombs Badia and Bahia palaces and the souk. The city is exciting  colourful and frenetic- it was a delight to return to the peace quiet and comfort of the Borjs. It also has a swimming pool great to cool down in.  The breakfasts were excellent- great choice of fruits cheese breads and freshly squeezed orange juice which was wonderful and eggs cooked to order. We ate in twice in the evening as there are no restaurants close- the only negative feature of the hotel.The food was good not exceptional but about the same price as the central restaurants  If I return to Marrakech I will definitely return to the Borjs- it is lovely!,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Marlborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Levoyageur

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,RJB21 wrote a review Mar 2011,40,Lovely combination of modern convenience and traditional charm... but a little overpriced,A friend and I stayed at Les Borjs de la Kasbah for five nights at the end of January for a girls' break away. We paid 1400dh per night for a premium twin room (although we did get one night free as they had an offer on at the time so paid 5600dh in total). This also included free airport pick-up (although we had to pay an extra charge for transportation back to the airport at the end of our stay).    When we arrived we were greeted with mint tea and Moroccan sweet pastries (little baklava-style things). This set the tone for the rest of our visit - the staff in the hotel were very polite friendly and helpful. Our room was a reasonable size and very comfortable with a large bathroom (including a tub as well as shower). It had every modern convenience but also traditional charm complete with flower petals on the pillows every evening.    The hotel itself is a lovely a complex of six small town houses and a riad. It's pretty well integrated though so you can't really tell that it wasn't originally built as one building. The rooms are focused round a series of courtyards one of which includes a small swimming pool with lots of little tucked-away sitting areas.    Other facilities (as well as the pool) included a computer with internet access for guest use; a few books and games (chess etc); a bar; and a restaurant. There's also the hammam of course where we spent a relaxing afternoon one day. (We opted for a package which included hammam time with an exfoliation treatment with Beldi soap and a body poultice of volcanic clay - this cost 250dh each but we got a 20% discount on this as guests of the hotel.)    Breakfast was served in the hotel's restaurant which is half inside and half a courtyard with a glass roof which was very charming. The only problem with this was that there were several little birds (similar to sparrows) that flew into the courtyard every day and would brazenly tuck into the breakfast which was laid out there - not a very appetizing (or hygienic) sight! It could easily have been overcome I'm sure by keeping the food in the inside area rather than the courtyard area; or using a hard plastic cover instead of just cling film which the birds could peck through.    Breakfast itself was pretty good though (although most people seemed to avoid the dishes that the birds went for which wasn't everything) -- it included pastries cakes/breads cereal fruit etc as well as freshly-cooked eggs (scrambled/omelettes etc) and Moroccan-style pancakes (a little like very thin English crumpets in that they have air bubbles in the same way very tasty).    We also ate in the restaurant a couple of other times as well once for lunch and once for dinner. It was convenient to have a restaurant on-site and the food seemed to be quite good quality. But it was more expensive than equivalent places we ate in the town I think.    As well as the on-site hammam/spa treatments the hotel organises various other activities. We had a cooking lesson one morning which was one of the highlights of our trip. We paid 400dh each for this which included all the ingredients the chef (who gave the lesson) and someone from reception (who acted as a translator). We spent a couple of hours cooking and then enjoyed the fruits of our labour as lunch. It was a nice way to find out a bit more about Moroccan cooking and talk to local people in a relaxed way.    The hotel also organises various tours and excursions. These were very convenient as they left from the hotel but they did seem a little expensive. If you're considering booking one it seems to be the norm to do so once you've arrived so you don't need to worry too much about deciding in advance.    We decided the book two trips through the hotel in the end for the convenience as much as anything else. Our first was a day trip to the Ourika Valley -- you drive through the valley and stop in a few places for photos and end in a village where you can walk up to a waterfall (which wasn't as spectacular as I was anticipating I have to admit). It cost 350dh each and basically just included transportation there with the hotel's resident driver - you had to pay extra for a guide up to the waterfall and lunch etc.    Our driver was friendly enough but a little disingenuous I felt. A couple of examples - although we were advised by reception before we left that a guide to the waterfall shouldn't cost more than 100-150dh and not to pay more the driver presented us with a guide that he said would cost 200dh and that there was no alternative which we found a little strange; also we had understood from the information in the hotel that the driver wouldn't stop at any shops etc en route unless specifically asked to but we did end up stopping at a perfumery (which we'd actually been told was just a garden before we stopped) a pottery and a Berber house which again we found a little strange as we didn't want to make any purchases and had said so. It was all a bit uncomfortable and we did not enjoy feeling pressurised by an expectation that we were going to buy something (when we'd said to the driver at the start that we didn't want to). We did enjoy the trip and it was interesting to see the surrounding countryside but it didn't quite meet the standards that we were used to in the hotel itself.    Our second excursion was an evening trip booked to the Fantasia at Chez Ali. We paid 500dh each which included our transport there and back a meal and the entertainment (Berber tribes singing and dancing plus a horsemanship display). We mostly went as my friend is interested in riding but I found it quite an enjoyable evening too and there were mostly lots of Moroccan people there (ie not just foreign tourists).    Over all I'd give Les Borjs de la Kasbah a thumbs up. We enjoyed our stay here but I think it probably is a little over priced and as described above there were a few 'spoilers'. Plus I'm not convinced the excursions offered the best value either.    Marrakech itself an interesting place to visit it a little overwhelming to someone who hasn't travelled much outside Western Europe and North America. As two girls travelling alone we didn't feel intimated though which we had worried about beforehand. The poverty especially the kids begging took some getting used to though. I did actually suggest to the hotel that it would be nice if they had a place in the lobby (alongside their staff tips box) to donate to a reputable local charity but didn't really get a response to this!    One tip if you don't want to take a pricey guided tour is that the open-top bus tour (the bus touristique) offers a good introduction to the town.,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJB21

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,TricksBerkshire wrote a review Feb 2011,50,Superb!!,Everything was perfect! We were picked up efficiently from the airport by the hotel's driver. On arrival at the hotel we were given a wonderful welcome with a very relaxed check-in drinking complimentary mint tea. Because they had realised from the DOB on my passport that my birthday was a few days after our trip (not the reason for going I might add!) they gave us a free room upgrade. I expect all the rooms are probably very nice and I think the upgrade just gives you that much bigger a room. Our rooms were both superb. The bedroom and bathrooms were clean and spacious and full of character. The rose petals were a sweet touch! Because we were only at the hotel a short time we didn't use the spa or pool facilities which although small would have done the job perfectly if we had wanted to use them. Breakfasts were continental style not a huge choice but nothing to complain about. We ate a couple times at the hotel (lunchtime and evening) and all the meals were very good. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly and made you feel that nothing was too much trouble for them. In our opinion the hotel was in a perfect location. Far enough out to be quiet and away from the hustle bustle but still only a 15 or so minute walk into the centre of things. I based my choice for this hotel on the reviews that I had read and I'm so pleased I did. It was superb and I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a short stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Berkshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TricksBerkshire

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,morganna72 wrote a review Feb 2011,50,A gem of a place in a great location..,I was looking for a few days away alone to combine relaxation with a bit of culture and came across an old Guardian travel article about this place. Looked at the hotel website and decided to go for it. They collect you from the airport for free in their very nice hotel minibus. You would never find the place alone as it is within the labyrinth of old streets within the Medina. Upon entering the small entrance you cannot be disappointed. The little central court yard is so tranquil and beautiful and the reception staff charming especially the lovely Nadia. In fact all the staff are extremely kind and very unobtrusive. I had a small double room at a very good price (considering most place charge supplements for solo travellers). Lovely with a gorgeous bathroom although I will agree with another reviewer that the beds are very very firm...maybe that is common in Morrocco? Anyway super clean nicely furnished with s luxury feel. Great breakfast too. Location wise I thought it was perfect because you feel you are staying in an authentic living working part of the ancient city as oppose to the bigger chain hotels which are in the newer part. A 10 walk and you are in the mad Jemaa el Fna square where it all happens. Lovely to get back to this peaceful hotel at the end of the day (and as a single woman traveller I felt completely safe). Great spa treatments too with a lovely pool. I will definitely return.,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morganna72

Stepping from the bustle and dust of the narrow street we were welcomed into a cool calm and beautiful riadh. Smiling girls greeted us with hot mint tea and our room was perfect - large and beautiful. The feel of this hotel is one of luxury intimacy and warmth though I'm sure it's refreshingly shady in the Summer! The attention to detail extends right through the building from the architecture and furnishing to the service and the food.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,mauraudingbeasts wrote a review Jan 2011,50,"Oasis of calm, tranquility and comfort",I stayed here with a large group of extended family and we had a genuinely wonderful time so wonderful in fact that we spent much more time in the hotel than we would normally on a holiday to such an interesting country. The attention to detail at Les Borjs is second to none every tiny thing has been thought through and the little luxuries really add to your stay. From the authentic artisan-made fitting and finishings to the monogramed towels and flower petals on your pillow I can't think of anything I would add to my marvellous experience here. The food is of particular note and especially welcome to the many vegetarians in our party who found eating out a little difficult in the rest of Marrakech. Considering the 5 star luxury on offer the price is extremely reasonable and the location is excellent walking distance to the main square through a fascinating old fashioned Kasbah. The hotel staff are all fantastically helpful and professional but maintain a distance that is comforting to uptight Brits like us. They were particularly helpful when the King's convoy potentially blocked our way to the airport without them I would have had 12 stranded family members including a 90 year old woman and three babies! They also helped us arrange a day trip to another city recommending hotels attractions and transport. The hotel beds are amazingly comfortable an the ambiance is quiet without being staid. I didn't visit the hamam but some of my family did and absolutely loved it. I can't recommend this place highly enough it's really worthy of being voted the number one hotel in Africa.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mauraudingbeasts
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,msabian wrote a review Jan 2011,40,"Not overly luxurious, yet cozy & with friendly service",I stayed in the Borjs recently among other places in Morocco. This was my last stop before I headed back home. The hotel is very comfortable and clean and the young staff very helpful friendly and attentive. The rooms are somewhat modern and well laid out. The food is very good breakfast in particular. As the hotel is an amalgamation of numerous smaller riads it does feel a bit less personal than a single riad unit.  In spite of what most places say all over Morocco (they all tend to tell you that given their privileged location you are always right at the centre of the action!) Les Borjs is not 5' away from Djemaa Fna but a good 15/20' walk instead.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,EuropeanVoyager wrote a review Dec 2010,50,"Fantastic hotel, one of my top 5 ever. Super staff",We stayed here for five nights after a tip from a friend. Gorgeous rooms: we stayed in three different rooms one suite and two doubles because we had booked three nights and decided to come back after a trip to Essaouira. Pool is very nice and cosy not perfectly fit for a 3 and a 5 year old but there was a small strip where our kids could stand in the water. The architect did a fabulous job.  One very very small thing to think about is that the suite we had (room 202) is above the kitchen and so when people clean up or prepare breakfast you can hear them. But we're not complaining we loved the room anyway. This is no issue in rooms 205 and 305 that we had later and are on a different courtyard. Staff was wonderful breakfast excellent. Superb bathrooms.

The course was just perfect. We could choose the menu in advance (out of three) and we prepared 3 dishes and the tea. Meriem showed us how to do it and then we were practicing ourselves so we could watch take notes and cook. Nadia translated everything into English always with her smile.

The hotel is truly an oasis of peace and quiet in the middle of hectic and overwhelming Marrakech. The interior courtyards were very impressive with fountains palms and beautiful tiling all around. The room was very comfortable and the staff even spread roses around our bed and bathroom for our welcome. Excellent value for the money. The breakfasts were also very tasty. The only drawback is its location. It's about a 20 minute walk to the main square the Djemma al Fna (unsure how to spell it) through narrow streets where cars and motorbikes barely miss you as they buzz by. I would recommend making a right as you go out of the hotel and walking on the main road along the kasbah walls.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kevhurtbuddy

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,alibrsv wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Oasis of calm in the madness of the Marrakech Kasbah,I spent 5 days with my mother and aunt (both seniors) at Les Borjs de la Kasbah (BK) in late Sept.2010. It was the first visit to Marrakech for the ladies and the bustle of the Kasbah was a little overwhelming for them. Each time they opened the doors of BK they felt as though they were entering an oasis of calm leaving the madness behind.  The hotel is built to traditional riad style with the rooms looking over a beautifully tiled courtyard. There are a number of communal areas which open onto the courtyard and can be used for having tea reading or just spending some quiet time in a comfortable and relaxing environment. The whole hotel is scrupulously clean decorated to an very high standard and the staff work extremely hard to ensure your every need is met.  The only small drawback is that the hotel is at the far end of the Kasbah meaning a 25 min walk to get to the Djemma el Fna which in the heat and crowds was a struggle for the ladies. However walking to the Bab Agnaou meant picking up a 'petit taxi' was a cheap and easy way of getting around town.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,PhillD81 wrote a review Sep 2010,50,Excellent adventure at the Borjs de la Kasbah,Just returned from a wonderful trip to Marrakech staying at the Borjs de la Kasbah - probably the best idea I've had. Great riad in both location and the quality of service they provide giving you excellent meals a good sized pool for relaxing in or by (some people from other hotels paid for meals so they could use it).  The single room is roughly equivalent in size to a city hotel but with nice Moroccan styling and superb air conditioning (necessary in 40 odd degree heat of August). Also there were nice touches such as rose petals on the bed on arrival the well stocked mini-bar and the bathrobe for the spa treatments.  The meals on offer were excellent 3 course meals or the option of a la carte dining if you preferred being half-board I was given a meal of the day menu with two options each for starter main course and desserts. Breakfast was Moroccan pancakes crepes croissants etc... But the best meal was the Moroccan evening where dancers and musicians played while you were served a set Moroccan themed meal - an excellent evening.    I also took a couple of the excursions using the Borjs minibus which despite the heat was largely comfortable and Abdul the driver was extremely good and informative - speaking French and English. The trips to Ouarzazate / Ait Benhaddou (where Lawrence of Arabia was filmed) and Cascades d'Ouzoud (waterfalls) were fantastic - if a little expensive for one person - check to see if anyone else would like to go so you spread the cost.    Marrakech itself is a little crazy and hectic at times but the hotel is like a oasis of calm very quiet with excellent and attentive staff who litterally cannot do enough for you. I would definitely recommend this hotel as the best value in Marrakech and plan to use it again someday.

The food in the restaurant was of a very high standard warranting the higher price than other local restaurants.  The pool was excellent for relaxing out of the very hot midday temperature it also has a bar which serves reasonably priced snacks and light lunches.  There were several lounge areas close to the bar both inside and out with free wifi and even a computer free to use for internet browsing.  We found that our room was excellent very well decorated in the traditional Moroccan style with high quality bedding towel's bath robes naturally produced soaps and very effective air conditioning.  The bathroom was consistently decorated with the rest of the room with a very pleasant bath and shower.  We also went on the fantasia horse show excursion which although slightly expensive was really good 5 course meal great entertainment and travel to and from it which was about 30 mins.  All in all we found that the hotel was great quality had fantastic service and was in a great location about 15 mins walk from the main square so you are close to the culture but have all the amenities you would expect from a modern hotel.  This hotel really is an oasis of calm and comfort in a very hectic city really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again and recommend for anyone wishing to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hailsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rbarron6
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Guildford_Gal wrote a review Jul 2010,50,Lovely Riad in the Chaos of Marrakesh,This is a gorgeous hotel in the middle of the craziness that is Marrakesh. The rooms are well appointed with air conditioning for the summer or heating as we needed in the middle of winter! Rose petals on the bed everyday were a lovely touch.    The pool is lovely to relax by after a day wandering around Marrakesh. The hammam and massage were good too.    Had dinner there a couple of times which was good but by far the best was the mint tea and little moroccan cakes and biscuits that we had at least once a day in the relaxed bar whilst we were there.    The staff are great all of them were extremely helpful and it was interesting to talk to Francoise about the environmental practices that they try to employ at the hotel.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,P0P0LA wrote a review Jul 2010,50,A real gem in busy Marrakech,I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend and I think we couldn't have chosen better. Staff is really friendly and helpful rooms are clean and comfortable the mint tea is perfect!  We've also taken a day trip to the atla's mountain organized by the hotel which was also great.  They have a very nice restaurant too.  We have absolutely no complaints about the hotel - Marrakech in the other hand was kind of disapointing... streets are crazy traffic is just non sense and when you go to the market thousands of seller practly force you to buy stuff. You get lost easily and local people try to confuse you even more so they can charge you later to help you get back to a familiar spot...

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Guy S wrote a review Jun 2010,50,An oasis in the crazy Kasbah!,My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights to roughly coincide with my birthday. From the moment we arrived at reception the welcome was warm and friendly - as was the complimentary mint tea! We had booked a superior room which was pretty large very comfortable and well appointed (and on special offer at 4 nights for the price of 3!) .    We ate out each night except the last when we had a very enjoyable meal in-house which was pretty reasonable pricewise. The first 3 nights we ate at Chez Chegrouni (authentic unlicenced on Main Square nr Cafe de France) Le Marrakchi (touristy with belly dancing!) and Riad des Mers (specialist seafood in a riad) all of which were excellent but Chegrouni on the main square was without doubt the most authentic & best value for money. We had excellent lunches at The KozyBar (Place Des Ferblantiers nr Bahia Palace) & The Old Post Office (New City behind the new Post Office).    We tended to do our sight-seeing in the mornings & get back to the hotel late afternoon to relax by the pool or in our room before having an aperitif in the courtyard before dinner. One day my wife and I had Hamman treatments which were very relaxing and excellent value for money. The buffet breakfasts in the hotel although not abundent were excellent - including the made to order pancakes cooked before you!    We visited many of the sights both in the Medina and in the New City and overall had a fabulous time and found eveybody to be very friendly. One of the better places we found for shoppong as an alternative to the main souks was the Artisan Centre on Rue Mohammed 5 which is a co-op and haggle-free zone! The Main Square at night time is a crazy place & you need to have your wits about you but we never felt threatened despite walking wherever we could rather than taking taxis.    We would recommend Marrakech and more importantly Les Borjs des La Kasbah without hesitation and would specifically mention a number of their excellent staff who made our visit a bit more special - Mustapha in the Bar; Fatima at breakfast (plus the pancake lady!); Nadia at reception ; Assiza in the spa/hammam ; Senna at the pool bar ; Naoul ; and last but not least Mr Tayeb the manager who gave us a lift one day to Jardins Majorelle when he thought the taxi driver was asking to high a fare!,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stronty

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,minisha060 wrote a review May 2010,50,An oasis,Five days in Marrakesh is about three days too long. But staying in this Riad made it much more pleasurable. The staff are attentive and welcoming the rooms clean and spacious and although located in the kasbah you would not hear a thing once inside the Riad walls. We don't normally eat in hotel restaurants but the aggressive hassling from the locals meant we stayed in to eat at the Riad more nights than not - the food was excellent (the steak and the lamb dishes were superb).    We booked a guided tour on the afternoon of our arrival (you can get lost in those souks!) - in about three and a half hours we saw all there was to see of old quarters; the next afternoon we saw the new city. The main square at night is a sight to see but be warned - you will not be left alone and we even got people asking for money just to take photographs. The activities in the square seem set up purely for tourists and you can't just stand look and enjoy unless you retreat to one of the cafes around the sides. On reflection I wish we'd spent three days in the Atlas mountains but as stated above the Riad made everything so easy.    Having travelled all over the world I found Marrakech the one city that I couldn't wait to leave. Being so heavily reliant on tourism it would do well to remember not to bite the hand that feeds it - I didn't want to give a single dirham to the local businesses there who treated tourists aggressively - we are cash cows there to be fleeced. The friendliness of the locals soon revealed nothing more than a desire to take you to an uncle's shop or to ask money for 'accompanying' you to your location. So be warned and gird yourself whenever you leave the Riad.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nairobi, Kenya",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minisha060
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,falcon3760 wrote a review May 2010,50,A Riad for relaxing,Stayed here for 5 nights in early May and we were very pleased with our choice. It's not really a Riad which tends to have only a few rooms and limited facilities it's technically a hotel since it was formed by combining several Riads. The advantage of this is that it has many more facilities such as a nice swimming pool spa full service restaurant and bar and an internet room which you might not find in a normal Riad but is still relatively small so still feels quite personal.  In terms of decor and ambiance I'd describe it as comfortable and pretty rather than seriously upscale and luxurious. We visited plusher place like Villa Flores and Jardins de la Koutarbia which are maybe more at the luxury end. However this is no bad reflection on the Borjs as the decor is tastefully done but it is more of a 'kick your shoes off' style ambiance which we much preferred. It is as others have pointed out a very pleasant haven to retire to after a day in the madness of Marrakesh Medina.  There are two main courtyard areas the one at the back being home to a pleasant swimming pool with a small cafe for lunch and drinks plus the spa and hammam. The front courtyard with fountain is classic Riad and a lovely place to sit with an early evening glass of wine (still too cool in early May to dine outside) and includes a Majlis style sitting area at one end and a library/enclosed sitting room opposite. The restaurant and seperate bar are also situated off this courtyard.  We opted for a suite (303) which was situated away from the main courtyard and found this to be very comfortable spacious (though I suspect the standard rooms are quite modestly sized) and surprisingly quiet with the morning birdsong the only thing likely to interrupt your sleep. Importantly there isn't a mosque within near earshot so you won't be disturbed by a 5am morning call to prayer amplified through speakers which we came across in other riads/hotels.  Food is a pretty good quality not haute cuisine but nicely prepared and tasty. In a city where hygiene is a consideration the kitchen can be viewed through a large glass window which is re-assuring. Breakfasts were the standard fare of fruit yoghourt pastries Morrocan pancakes and eggs any way but most if not all were home made (including all the pastries and even the chocolates after dinner). We can vouch for there being some skill in the kitchen because we took advantage of a cooking course where with the chef's help we prepared our own lunch of Moroccan Salad and Chicken Tagine with preserved lemons. This was a fun and informative morning and thanks are due to the friendly and helpful chef for being patient with us.  It's a good point in this review to make a mention about the staff generally. In addition to our chef all the staff were friendly helpful and pleasant to deal with. It was one of the things that made the stay so relaxing and so was much appreciated.  Marrakesh actually has a surprisingly large number of attractive looking Riads and hotels. I think the Borjs would suit those who appreciate quality but want the ambiance to be more relaxed rather than hushed tones-a place where you can be comfortable. I think Borjs de la Kasbah fulfils this brief perfectly.,Date of stay: May 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/falcon3760
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Biscouaz wrote a review May 2010,50,Perfect Riad for your Stay in Marrakech!,Nadia welcomed me with a smile and I was offered a mint tea with cakes when I arrived; my room was spotless I found that it was very convenient to have a restaurant pool Spa Internet cafe on site. Prices were very reasonable. Breakfast is great. Location is really good 15mn walk from the main square. They also had a Moroccan evening just before I left with dancers musicians etc. A perfect spot for your holidays.  Another plus for me: i was able to have a Moroccan cuisine course with the chef; being a food lover I thought that was a really nice touch.    Un riad absolument fantastique pour des vacances paisibles; j'ai particulierement apprecie la gentillesse du personnel surtout de Nadia qui avait toujours le sourire. Le riad est bien place et vous permet de vous relaxer aux abords de la piscine au Spa ou bien encore dans les salons amenages a cet effet; vous pouvez egalement profiter d'un coin Internet tres appreciable lorsqu'il s'agit de confirmer votre vol de retour ou d'organiser les excursions.  J'ai eu l'occasion de beneficier d'un cours de cuisine ce que j'ai enormement apprecie; le Chef etait tres sympatique et tres professionel.  Le petit-dejeuner est excellent jus d'orange frais fruits frais crepes cereales etc; Myriam qui s'affaire derriere la plaque de cuisson et vous regale de ses crepes Marocaines.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Grj wrote a review Apr 2010,50,The most perfect place to be stranded,We were due to stay for 3 nights at the Riad but it ended up as being 9. We were stranded by the ash cloud and no flights and whilst this had its problems the staff made us so welcolm and were extreamly good at accomodating us. This is the most charming and delightful oasis in what can be a mad and chaotic city  even the Kasbah has its moments just outside. We wondered where we were travelling to on arrival when the streets seemed full of humanity  then to find the delighful patio and mint tea and be enchanted by the place. The rooms vary in style we are uniquely able to comment having been in 3 and seen others  but most have a space and charm you will fall for although the dawn chorus of birds took some getting used to!  The bar has a good range of well priced drinks and the Maroccan wine is a delight to sample especially the Cuvee de President rouge.The restaurant meals are lovely and the Maroccan cuisine excellent the veal tagine especially. I loved the breakfasts with the pancakes and the eggs and these varied over the days a great start to the day.  The pool area is great although the water in April was a little cool to swim in and a shock on our system but in the summer ideal.  Then the staff are just superb I think its invidious to pick them out as all were so gracious multilingual and so charming you really felt the benefit of a small Riad in this way. However Mohammed the manager and Nadia did so much to try and help in the no flight predicament I could not ask for more from them. Mustapha on the restaurant was also very friendly and absolutely charming.  I thoroughly recommend this Riad why try anywhere else La Mammonuia at twice the price would not touch the personal service we received in our hour of need.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,CaravanGirl wrote a review Mar 2010,50,A tranquil haven in the centre of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.,We had a really tough job trying to decide on a hotel in Marrakech as there were such mixed reviews of most places. Eventually we settled on Les Borjs de la Kasbah on the basis of what we read and kept our fingers crossed until we arrived. We couldn't have been happier with our choice! As soon as we arrived (the taxi driver had nto problem finding the hotel and gave us free bottled water on the journey too!) we were presented with a pot of mint tea and beautiful Moroccan pastries. A guided tour of the hotel followed and we soon realised that there were some amazing facilities especially bearing in mind the size of the hotel. Our room though not huge was lovely. The bathroom was enormous with two showers and two sinks!    Throughout our stay here we found the staff were all wonderful they couldn't do enough to assist us! Every day our pyjamas were folded beautifully on our beds. The fresh flower petals on the pillows etc. were a lovely touch. We ate in the hotel restuarant on two evenings and were very impressed with the food. The breakfasts were simple but very nice too.    As a city Marrakech is fascinating but very busy and chaotic. This hotel was perfect for relaxing in between wanders up to the square and through the souks. On one day we went on a hotel-organised trip into the mountains which we really enjoyed.    I would highly recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if ever I get the chance to revisit Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaravanGirl
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Visited2 wrote a review Mar 2010,50,Les Borjs de la Kasbah a beautiful quite retreat in the heart of the kasbah.,Just come back from a birthday trip with the 5 other girls. We stayed in Les borjs de la Kasbah following an article my friend had read in a magazine. The hotel was beautiful and the hotel staff could not do enough for us. When we arrived we were invited to have mint tea then were given a guided tour of the facilities before being shown to our rooms which were all different and very beautifil looking into the inner courtyard. Attention to detail was brilliant the beds turned down nicely and rose petals scattered on the bed and in the bathroom. There were towels supplied around the heated pool which also had some great showers. Food was excellent and very good value for money. A great experience in a mystical city.  Would recommend getting a guide to show you around we did and went on a 4 hour trip which was fantastic having the culture explained and finding some truly hidden gems we would have just walked passed.  The only down fall was trying to get some loose change to tip when out and about it was quite difficult but we managed it in the end.  We were initially worried about the dress code but there was nothing to worry about as european casual dress is acceptable its just a case of being sensible and not going out with next to nothing on remember it is a city not a beach.,Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Barrow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Visited2

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,jowett wrote a review Feb 2010,50,Superb,We thought the Borjs would be good from the previous reviews but it was better than we had expected. We could not believe how comfortable quiet and relaxing it was when just out side the door the noisy chaotic daily life of Marrakech continued. The room we had was clean and very spacious and every day the cleaner arranged the bedspread and groups of rose petals in different patterns. The bed was large and very comfortable. We had air conditioning and more important on a February evening good heating. The facilities were superb the spa well equipted pool heated and plenty of very comfortable places to sit and read. The Borjs is at the south end of the Kasbah which is about 15 mins from the main central square which is very busy and where most of the visitors head for. The Kasbah is more of a locals area and we felt more welcoming. We wanted a more relaxing time so ate in the hotel most evenings. The Maitre D and staff could not do enough for you The food was excellent and the best was breakfast with home made pastries freshly cooked pancakes and eggs.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Gareth wrote a review Jan 2010,50,"Hotel great, location great",Ok - it was my first time I had stopped in a boutique hotel but was a great find through TA. First thing to say is don't be scared of the first time you drive to the hotel. The hotel is an oasis in the middle of the chaos of the kasbah. The staff were fantastic and nothing was to much trouble. We booked the suite and was a great size and very clean. We eat in the restaurant on the first night the food was fantastic it just lacked people as there was little atmosphere. Breakfast was great and fresh omlettes / pancakes were available when needed.    Location it is about a 20 minte walk to the square but the sights and smell from the Kasbah were fantastic even though tourists stick outlike a sore thumb we felt very safe and were always greeted with smiles.    We did not use the spa in the hotel mainly as we wanted to share the Hamman together and they could not fit us both in however we walked to the top of the rue du kasbah and found Alhambra spa this was great and we spent several hours getting pampered. I heard that the Bains de Marrakech were also very good.    We also found the Sultana to eat in it is a hotel however the restaurant was fantastic and staff were great we did try the restaurant just around the corner however we were disappointed for some reason the Italian influence on Morrocan dishes did not go.

The street outside the hotel is crazy chaotic and utterly Moroccan - the atmosphere once over the threshold is soothing tranquil luxurious and utterly gorgeous. All the sites and sounds of Marrakech are on your doorstep - the Djmaa el Fna is only 10 mins walk (or a short cab ride) away and the royal palace is at the end of the street.    The rooms are spacious spotless and really comfortable - the best bed I have slept in in YEARS! Huge shower in the giant bathroom and twin sinks with soft and fluffy towels and gorgeous cosmetics from the on-site hammam.    Nothing was too much trouble for the young energetic and friendly staff whatever time of day we were asking for assistance: reception staff ensured we were heading in the right direction giving useful advice and ensuring that taxi drivers didn't rip us off. The afternoon mint tea they offered was particularly welcome after a hard day pounding the street of the souqs and the buffet breakfast was fresh delicious and always varied and interesting.    The onsite spa was fantastic - the best facial I have ever had and although we didn't have time to swim in the pool it looked very inviting.    If I could award 11/10 for anywhere on earth this would be it - we'll be back as soon as we can!!!

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Blues9 wrote a review Dec 2009,50,"Authentic, friendly and excellent facilities",We travelled to Marrakech for a 3 day break in November and booked Les Borjs following the reviews on Trip Advisor. I can honestly say that it exceeded all expectations.    All the staff were friendly and helpful and we were greeted on arrival with mint tea and Moroccan pastries which we thought was a great touch. We did have a moment of anxiety as we weaved our way through the Kasbah to find it in the taxi from the airport but once you step inside it really is an oasis you can enjoy after the craziness of the city.    The attention to detail was superb and the rooms were both authentic but had all the modern facilities you would expect in a good hotel. The bathroom was very spacious and the staff decorated different patterns of petals throughout the room every day we were there.    The heated pool was fanatastic to swim in after a day in the city and although we didn't use them the spa facilities looked excellent.    Its a 20 minute walk to the main square which is an experience in itself but we felt totally safe in the area and the taxis are so cheap you can always take one if you've had enough of being sold to or cajoled to eat somewhere !

The hotel was all it said it was and more. Nadia and Mohammad (an asset to any hotel) could not have been more helpful friendly and good humoured. Nothing was too much to ask for - from booking trips restaurants taxis and even lending us money until the banks opened!  The hotel driver was great and was there to meet us at the airport on arrival and departure. He also took us for a day trip into the Atlas mountains where we learnt to haggle very quickly and got a reasonable price for our guide to the waterfall.  Marrakesh itself is crazy with lots to see and do and the location of the hotel is very near to everything. A walking tour of the town is recommended (our guide was brilliant) Then to come back to the peace and tranquillity of the hotel and a swim in the pool was heaven. The spa treatments are not to be missed The rooms are comfortable and clean with much needed air con.

Rooms are really very nice huge bathroom comfy bed and air con rose petals scattered in different ways daily around the bed and bathroom.

Restauraunt was ok felt that for the price it was expensive for what we got (but this was a problem with Marrakech in general food if you went to decent places was not cheap at all I dont mind paying for decent food at all but felt the prices in this place were really expensive for what we got).  The one downside which slightly soured our stay was one of the daytrips we took. We paid around £40 each for a trip up to the atlas moutains and this for what we got was expensive. Yes we got our own car and hotel driver who was helpfull to start with stopping off at a couple of local shops (which we were told they were not meant to do and after seing him get a cut of what we bought from one of the shops I realised why we were there!!) he then took us further up the mountains to meet a guide who took us for a walk/hike this was really good but we had been warned by reception staff not to pay more than a certain amount for the guide so I wasn't suprised when the guide asked for a third more than the maximum price we were told we should pay so I said what we had been told and was then shocked when the hotel driver said we should not listen to what we had been told and should just pay! But I stood my ground and after some haggling got the price I wanted but the drivers actions really wound me up and on the return journey the drivers mood had suddenly changed I'm guessing the cuts he'd been getting at other shops on the route had not been as much as he expected for the mountain guide. This was a real shame.  Overall though fantastic hotel friendly staff awesome rooms dont bother with the hotel day trips and dont expect a cheap break in Marrakesh!!!,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speedbird1London
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Shawfield wrote a review Sep 2009,30,"Nice hotel, shame about the service","My friend & I didn't want to share a double bed so had to pay extra for a superior room with twin beds; would expect a choice of standard rooms with double or twin beds.    Before travelling we arranged by email with the hotel to be picked up at the airport (at an additional charge not free). We arrived earlier than expected waited 2 hours no lift appeared. We had no option but to pay extortionate taxi fare to get to the hotel. When we finally arrived reception was unattended no staff around and all the room keys hanging up in full view! Turned out all the staff had gone to break their daylight fast as it was Ramadan. Surely they could have taken it in turns instead of deserting their posts all at once?    When the receptionist finally showed up he said straight away ""our driver went to the airport but there was no flight with the number you gave us"". We showed him the booking confirmation with the flight number on - it was correct! Eventually we were shown to our room - very pleasant & clean with efficient air-con which we really needed. The hotel was very quiet and in a great location within walking distance of the main sights. Breakfast buffet was ok & you could order freshly cooked stuff (omlette etc) as well. The freshly squeezed orange juice was lovely. We ate in the hotel a couple of times and found the meals quite good although not gourmet but the service tended to be slow. The poor barman did his best but if you went early he was struggling to serve drinks and man the restaurant on his own. I think all this is down to indifferent management & could be much improved.    The excursions offered by the hotel seemed quite expensive so we didn't go; spoke to some people who had expected their trip to include visiting a Berber village but only saw it from a long distance away. We didn't use the spa but found the pool area very pleasant.    Outside the hotel was colourful fascinating & a great experience. However be prepared to be grossly overcharged when you buy anything from restaurant meals to peanuts at a market stall (I'm not talking about souvenirs etc which you expect to bargain for). We found the food bland & the restaurants in the medina didn't serve any alcohol but the mint tea was great. Also recommend the avocado juice - lovely & creamy & makes a change from orange juice. Overall a good place for a long weekend but if staying longer you would need to escape the city.",Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Ash,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shawfield

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Jessica2376 wrote a review Aug 2009,40,A lovely riad with lovely staff,After a delayed flight we were ready to relax. The driver was waiting for us at the gate and patiently waited longer as we queued for cash (which never came as the machines at the airport had run out.)  Upon our arrival at the hotel we were pleased to meet the charming and good humoured Mohammed who introduced us to the hotel with a brief tour before showing us to our rooms where our luggage had been delivered. The big but cosey room was a pleasant suprise with rose petals on the bed and icy cold aircon.  The riad proved to be a soothing oasis with staff helpful but not imposing a lovely pool and clean rooms and facilities.  The walk to the medina was a little intense particularly in the claustrophobic august heat. Dodging mad moped drivers and cycles weaving in and out of streets full of busy locals it was certainly a taste of the frenetic city life of moroccans outside the touristy medina. This is really the only drawback of the hotel which would have been perfect if it was located on the quieter and more relaxed north of the medina. But we were first timers and I'm sure more experienced travellers would have no problem navigating the city streets.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting. It felt like a five star experience for a very fair price.,Date of stay: August 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessica2376

It is a beautiful boutique Riad. We had read about it following a review in the Observer which noted that the owners had used local Moroccan artisans to convert the Riad that the staff are paid double the minimum wage and that locat herbs and lotions are used in bathrooms etc. The Riad is a haven of peace and traquility in this wonderful mad city. The staff are so attentive and helpful. The Hamman and massage facility is great. The pool was a blessing in the August heat. The only thing to consider is the 15 minute walk to the main square but you get to see some crazy Marrakech sites during this walk.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Judith M wrote a review Jul 2009,50,A genuine boutique hotel- really fabulous.....,We arrived having spent time at 2 other Riads in Marrakech and the Borjs de la Kasbah really stood out as a special place to stay. The hotel is not a Riad as such (which means there are more than 6 rooms) instead it is a slightly larger property which means great service and better amenities. We were impressed by the beautiful pool as very few hotels in the medina have a proper pool we also loved the hammam and spa area. The patios library and lounge area add to the range of spaces to relax in. Our room was large and beautifully decorated with great air con (not always easy to find but essential in July) a seating area and lovely argan oil toiletries in the bathroom. The property has been fabulously well renovated and feels both modern and very traditional it is how I imagine staying in a converted palace would feel. We really loved this place and would definitely come back.,Date of stay: July 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matilda73

The hotel is an oasis in the centre of the Medina with staff that are friendly attentive and helpful. Even the food was wonderful. With just over 10 minutes walk to the centre of the action (souks shops bars etc) it was the perfect place to stay. The rooms are beautifully decorated to a high standard with typically Moroccan details and cleaned to a very high standard with wonderful finishing touches like fresh rose petals sprinkled across your bed and sumptuous bath towels and dressing gowns laid out for your use.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,PeoniLondon wrote a review Apr 2009,50,"Great riad in Marrakech, Morocco",Les Borgs de la Kasbah Marrakech.  Date: April 24 2009  I have just returned from a weekend at this fabulous riad in the heart of Marrakech close to the Kasbah. I was really impressed with it for several reasons. Firstly the look and feel of the place transports you back in time with its open-air courtyards authentic tiling and Moroccan detail everywhere.  Les Borgs was originally seven houses and the owners have created a charming old-style boutique hotel with real character.  Secondly for such a small boutique style hotel - it has just 27 rooms - it has all the facilities and amenities of a much larger property. For example a relaxing and decent-size open-air pool on the rooftop and a luxurious spa.  Bedrooms are to a high spec from beautifully-tiled bathrooms to flatscreen TVs. Most rooms overlook the main courtyard and the suites overlook the pool area.  Staff have a can-do attitude which is refreshing too. They arranged a friend's birthday party and just got on with it and everything went like clockwork.  Last but not least I loved the fact that it was so discreet with a door and small sign on the outside neither of which suggests the rich interior the other side.  I recommend it highly.,,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeoniLondon
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Panda86 wrote a review Mar 2009,10,The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Recommend you stay well away!,"We stayed here for the final night of our honeymoon. I paid extra for a 'deluxe' room. When we arrived they had no water. Instead of a king bed we had two singles pushed together (obvious from the headboards that were fixed to the wall). When I raised this with the desk they laughed at us and said ""well that is a big double!"". It was the most uncomfortable experience I have had in a hotel.    We also had booked a treatment in the spa. We had booked at the same time but they said we had to go one after the other. So my husband went first while I read my book by the 'pool' (if you can call it that). I then went up for my treatment. I sat there for approx 30 minutes before anyone came over. My 40 minute treatment lasted 10 at the most.    We stayed in 3 hotels on our trip. This was the worst location and I felt the most unsafe whilst here. We couldn't locate a good restaurant near by either.    Oh and the taxi they arranged for us. The driver ordered his live chicken at a hatch in the wall whilst we were in the back too. I had managed to avoid seeing the killing of chickens in public until then!    I booked this hotel based on the tripadvisor reviews.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,UkLive4Hols wrote a review Mar 2009,50,Oasis of tranquility,We spent four nights at Les Borjs de la Kasbah in early March 09. We had booked a premium room and although we didn't see the standard rooms we were more than pleased with the room. It was lovely and warm the bathroom had a heated towel rail which was a bit of a luxury for the cool mornings and evenings. The bed was huge and really comfortable the service was first class and all staff were very attentive and courteous. The bathroom was huge and the towels really fluffy. The two bathmats (one for the shower one for the bath) were gorgeous - heavy and thick!    There weren't many guests most of the time and even when the hotel was full on a couple of nights it was still tranquil and we hardly saw anyone. The buffet breakfast was more than sufficient (cereals croissant freshly cooked pancakes fruit toast eggs cooked in whatever style you wanted plus freshly squeezed orange juice). We ate a good breakfast and then didn't need to eat again until the evening.    The walk to the Square was about 20 minutes - there is a short cut through the alleyways half way up Rue de Kasbah. We enjoyed our daily walks up to the Square often finding a slightly different variation to our route and always noticing something different each time. It's not a quiet peaceful walk as you're walking through markets past persistent shop keepers etc but it's all part of the Marrakech experience. We didn't tend to walk back mainly because we'd done enough walking by then but could get a 'petit taxi' back for about 20 Dirhams (1.60GBP). Watch out as you can get charged 50 Dirhams - if you can't haggle one taxi driver down then let him go and try another - there's no shortage of taxis.    There was free internet access in one of the lounges and also Wi-Fi if you had your own laptop. Wi Fi wasn't available in the bedrooms but we never had any problems getting on to the one PC for occasional checking of emails.    This one of the best hotels we've stayed in - relaxing and small so it doesn't feel like a hotel.

The staff could not have been more helpful or friendly they were simply superb. The hotel is a 20 minute brisk walk from the square but we didn't find this a problem and it was a good way to experience the street life by day or night.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Brenda R wrote a review Jan 2009,50,fantastic hotel and city,Stayed at Les Borjs for a long weekend in August 2008 with my best friend and my 18 year old daughter. What a fab hotel and fab city!!    We arrived in Marrakech quite early and when we got to the hotel the room wasn't yet ready. We were given a cool drink and seated in a shady outdoor lounge area with some big comfy cushions to wait. They said it wouldn't be long - but in fact it did take quite a while. When we did get into our rooms they were lovely. Deep colours lovely tiled shower room and nice and cool.    As in all of Marrakech alcohol is difficult to find except in the hotels as it is obviously a Muslim country. The hotel did some nice cocktails limited choice of wine all quite pricey. We only had breakfast in the hotel which was a bit ropey - and worst of all - swarming with wasps! For someone who is allergic to these pests not ideal.    The actual hotel is delightful. All built inside a high wall like an oasis of calm in the midst of this mad city! The weather was hot and sunny so it was lovely to sit in the courtyard gardens or relax on a lounger by the pool. Everywhere clean and all the staff very nice and helpful.    Marrakech itself total madness 24/7. We tried to walk to the main square the first day - big mistake! It's such a maze of streets outside the hotel we got completely lost in five minutes even with the map! After that we jumped in a scarey taxi each time. All about 100 years old probably no mot's or even driving licences! Still cheap and fun - so who cares?!!    The square is great fun especially at night time when the food sellers come out. Where else can you see people queueing up to eat sheeps brains? Not in Oxford I can tell you. The whole place is filled with hundeds of people locals and tourists alike and apparently like that every day of every year. Beware getting caught taking photo's during the day the snake charmers and 'dentists' - don't even go there - try to get you to pay for the priviledge. The souk all around the square is extensive and you can get some great bargains. We bought leather bags and slippers glass lanterns the usual fake watches etc - all cheap as chips.    The Moroccans seem to be quite friendly - obviously haggling is the done thing - but if you do decide not to buy some of them can turn nasty. We didn't feel threatened at all even as three women on their own although my blonde daughter did get a lot of attention from the men some even asking for her photo with their children! Mostly it was harmless banter and did not feel pervy or threatening.    One day we took a taxi to Nicci Beach Resort which is out of town about 45 minutes in a cab. This is a fabulous place - very boutique hip and trendy an oasis in the desert almost. We got there at 12 noon opening time having called ahead in advance to ensure entrance. It was very quiet then with chilled out background music playing. There is a huge pool area with swim up bars and beach areas all surrounded with big wooden sun loungers with thick white mattresses or four poster beds with white canopies over - heaven! Mind you - you have to pay a minimum spend to sit in some areas so you can only sit where theyput you if you don't want to shell out a fortune.  As the day wore on the place filled up with all the beautiful people. The background music was replaced by a DJ playing the funkiest tunes and everyone was dancing - some out of the water some in. The drinks and food were very expensive - but it was all about the experience and that was great. They shut up around 6pm for an hour or two then re-open as an outdoor club in the evening. We left around 5pm and the road outside was filled with lots of very large shiney black sports cars and 4WDs.    If you get a chance to go to Marrakech you should definitely go it is a true culture shock. The only downside was the food - everything was grim. People rave about the cous cous and tagine stews. Well - maybe if you are truly starving. A big pile of tastless cous cous with a load of soggy vedg on top is not my idea of fun. Consider Marrakech if you're on a diet.    All in all a great weekend and Les Borjs a great place to stay. We noticed on our drive out to Nicci Beach a lot of the big hotels are way out of town so you would be in a scarey yellow taxi for most of your stay if you wanted to come to the square and the souks.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Straightalk wrote a review Jan 2009,30,OK but not brilliant!,I'm surprised that this hotel receives such regularly good reviews as it is OK but certainly not that brilliant.    The buildings themselves have been very well renovated and the majority of rooms overlook the cental courtyard which is lovely with a number of lounge areas around the sides including the bar.    Maybe it was the time of year that we went but the hotel is COLD and the rooms take a long time to heat up from the single aircon/heating unit mounted close to the ceiling. The public areas (esp the bar) are also very cold and lack atmosphere - a real fire in this area would transform it. I'm sure in the summer it is a cool haven from the busy medina but be warned if you go in the winter!    The rooms are nothing special and are a little tatty around the edges. The beds were somewhat uncomfortable. Bathrooms are tired. Breakfast is basic although the freshly cooked moroccan pancakes are a nice touch.    Be warned that they will sting you for MAD40 (about £3.50) per small bottle of water from the mini bar on check out which strikes me as a mean touch and the exchange rate is better on the Rue Kasbah.    The hotel is not difficult to find but is a good walk from the 'action' of the main square (20-25 minutes). Taxis are an experience! In a city so bereft of good (or even passable) restaurants the saving grace is 'Tatchibana' a wonderful Japanese restaurant which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The nearby 'Sultana' hotel is also good with a fabulous terrace overlooking the Atlas mountains (but expensive). Alternatively try Cafe de la Poste in Gueliz.

After that they totally give you a tour of the hotel and services they are super professional and its quite impressive. The rooms are very very nice and the bed was the most comfortable I have slept in in years! The rooms are clean and rose petals are left on your bed and towels each day. The position of the hotel means it is extremely quiet in contrast to the bustling centre of the old city.  It's Restaurant food is also excellent.

The room was very spacious had air conditioning fridge etc and a very nice big bathroom.  The pool looked wonderful with a nice private sun lounging area and the spa was beautiful. We had massages which were great!    Oh there is also an internet room a big screen TV room a very cool bar and probably few more rooms too in the different courtyards - it all felt very luxurious and exclusive!    The breakfast has a good selection - try the pancakes! We arrived quite late in the evening so ate in the restaurant and it was to a very good standard indeed!    We thoroughly recommend it as a luxury spa hotel on the edge of the medina (which is still close to the centre),Date of stay: September 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dave_london_ukLondon

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,LeePaul wrote a review Aug 2008,50,A fantastic little hotel,A lovely quiet little hotel tucked at the bottom of the Kasbah but within walking distance of all the main sights in the Medina. Accessable by taxi which is a real plus as the walk home from the Djemaa el Fna after a good evening meal is a little long. The room we were in (203) was a fair size and very nicely decorated. Only minus was a bit of damp in the bathroom around the toilet area but we could happily live with this. The pool was a lifesaver in the very hot afternoons and the snacks on offer were all excellent. The staff could not be faulted and nothing was too much trouble. They will also change money for you at a fraction less than the banks were offering but well worth it as it done away with the hassle of having to go to a bank. Also they have a small bar which served ice cold beer which was a plus as only one of the cafes and resturantes we visited sold alcohol.    All in all probably the nicest and most friendly hotel I've ever stayed in.,Date of stay: July 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,South Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeePaulCox
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,JP80-Worldroamer wrote a review Jul 2008,50,"Great Riad, Great Service, Good Location",Hotel:  Lovely Riad in the south of the Medina. Nicely decorated with good amenities. The pool was a god-send in the heat. Well maintained and kept very clean.    Room:  Suite 202. Big size with all the mod-cons. Unfortunately there was smell but didn't stop us from enjoying the room. I believe it was coming from outside. Room 205: Premium room good size again with all the mod-cons    Staff:  Very helpful and courteous. Nothing was too much trouble. They truly went above and beyond the call of duty from getting us taxis toiletries and making sure our stay was comfortable.    We had the opportunity to meet the owner who came to speak to us about our stay. This was a great gesture and showed that she was trying to make sure that guests were well taken care of.    Location:  15mins walk from the Jemma el f'na square. We walked to most of the tourist attractions.    Food:  Breakfast was good with eggs made to order. Pool menu was good and of good quality.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Seemonkey wrote a review Jul 2008,50,Beautiful le Borjs,One of the few riads with a Swimming pool proved useful in the 40 degree heat.    We stayed in one of the suites and if your budget allows request one. I believe they make all the difference    The staff at le Borjs are etremely attenstive and the level of service second to none and seem genuinely pleased to speak and help you.    breakfast is continental and very healthy.    The restaurant meals are priced reasonably ( lower than most restaurants ) about £10 per main dish and are much better quality than most of the restaurant swe went to.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,alanthomaswatson wrote a review Jun 2008,40,"Very nice, but not very Moroccan",We stayed in the Borjs as our last stop on a tour around Morocco. The hotel is very comfortable and clean and the young local staff very helpful friendly and attentive. The rooms are well laid out (although possibly a little small) and the air conditioning is a blessing. The food is very good and we had breakfast each day one lunch and one dinner. Our only grumble with the hotel is that it feels like a hotel and not a riad. The hotel is an amalgamation of numerous smaller riads and feels to have become a bit less personal and less Moroccan in the process.    Don't get me wrong if this is the only place you stay you'll probably love it but you'll miss out on a great deal that Morocco has to offer. The walk into the Djeema al Fna is also quite lenghty (about fifteen to twenty minutes).,Date of stay: May 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanthomaswatson
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Eklasse wrote a review Jun 2008,50,Ten out of Ten,One of the true highlights of our very recent trip through Europe and (we just got back) was “Les Borj”. Everything people have written about this property is accurate. Beautifully designed clean tasteful and serene. The perfect oasis from the noise and heat outside in the Kasbah.    From the moment we arrived and was escorted to the lounge to Mint tea everything encouraged you to relax and unwind.    Our suite (303) was lovely with a sitting area and great bathroom. It overlooked the pool and also a quiet courtyard and caught the afternoon breezes through the many windows.    The in-house restaurant is excellent and we enjoyed a digestation dinner as well and the great breakfasts. Orange Juice will always remind me of Marrakech as it was always freshly squeezed and cold.    The pool is excellent and lunch is available poolside as well – which was a treat.    The hotel has its own Hamman and we took advantage of this experience along with a wonderful massage afterwards. A great way to unwind after being shopping in the Souks. I highly recommend it!    The staff are very courteous efficient and professional and completed a wonderful stay in Morocco.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,MKRC wrote a review May 2008,50,Fabulous Riad,A warm welcome and complimentary drink greeted our lunch time arrival and then we were shown to our room 203 which was charming spacious and well equipped. A tasty snack lunch beside the pool followed before we ventured out into the Kasbah and Medina. Our breakfasts at Les Borjs were excellent - a vast array of cold items with eggs beautifully cooked to order. We did not dine at Les Borjs preferring the novelty of eating with the locals in Jemma al Fna or dining at Cafe Arabe - large portions - and DareSalem - a former palace in the Souk now serving up acceptable local dishes including musicians and a Belly Dancer. Throughout our stay the friendly staff at Les Borjs were very helpful arranging taxis and sightseeing. Marrakech is delightful - fascinating but not threatening very warm (in late April) but not opressive with friendly people who even in the Souk manage to avoid pestering the tourists.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,JaimeNorway wrote a review May 2008,40,One Week in the Kasbah,My husband and I stayed a week at this hotel together with my in-laws. When we arrived we were treated with mint tea and cookies. That was a nice touch for our arrival. There were fresh roses and nuts in the room.    The location is nice but a bit far away from the central market if you are a night owl. It was a bit difficult getting around due to the fact that my mother in-law was on crutches but it was convenient that a taxi could reach this hotel (not so for many other hotels in the city).    The breakfast buffet was fabulous. I am still missing the Moroccan pancakes the fruit cup and fresh orange juice. I think it is great that they offered Moroccan food for our breakfast buffet.    We tried the restaurant one evening but couldn't say it was extraordinary compared to many other restaurants in the city. In this area of town it was a nice restaurant.    The spa was nice but we preferred the spa down the street better (Les Bains). The spa down the street had a few more treatment options at comparable prices. But it is convenient to have the spa in the hotel and the women in the spa were very friendly.    The only thing that we did not like was that they did not give us new roses or fill up the nuts during our stay. It made us feel a bit unwelcome towards the end of the week. It is a petty thing perhaps but since they spent so much time on details on everything else I would recommed that this is changed for future guests.    We unfortunately did not get to swim in the pool since it was only 15 degrees in the water during our stay. I am sure it would be fabulous for those coming in warmer months.    Overall this hotel is great. No hesitations to recommend on to anyone else.,Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,Norway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaimeNorway

How refreshing to find a hotel that lives up to the photos on its website.    The hotel was immaculate - clean calm and peaceful. Staff were the most helpful you can imagine while remaining unobtrusive and the hotel was unbelievably peaceful.    Our room was beautiful bed unbelievably comfortable and what a great shower! The attention to detail throughout the hotel was incredible - from the design of the hotel as a whole to the rose petals in the room on arrival.    The food from the restaurant was delicious and the weather was good enough to eat in the courtyard (see pictures). It wasn't hot enough to swim in the pool (dipping in our toes was enough!) but it was good to enjoy the sun loungers next to the pool at the end of a busy day.

Our suite (room 205) was lovely but my friends room 107 although large - didnt have any windows overlooking the courtyard and there was a unpleasant smell in the bathroom. They were immediately shown 2 other rooms and picked 106 which they felt was more pleasant. The hotel recommended a personal tour guide. Unfortunately his English was quite poor and having him with us for 4 hours was a bind. We complained to the hotel on our return and they immediately refunded us 50%. The guide took us to a herbalist centre and the salesman was very good and we all spent rather a lot of money. All the pots had a website address www.rosa-huile.ma which made us feel assured that when we got back to the UK we could follow up with any queries. Unfortunately the website does not exist and their email does not work.  Marrakech was a great experience.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Gary_and_Mandy wrote a review Feb 2008,50,Fantastic!,"We stopped for 4 nights in February and booked a premier double room direct with the hotel. There was an offer on their website which gave one night free in four night stays which meant our room worked out at about £75 per night. There was also a choice a free taxi either to or from the airport. We decided to be collected on arrival. After a long wait to clear customs we went through to the arrivals hall where our driver was waiting. We arrived at night and our first view of the streets of Marrakesh was unbelievable. There were people EVERYWHERE! Transfer time to Les Borjs was around 20 minutes. Location was superb - within the medina walls and a 10-15 minute walk to the main square Djeema el Fna.    When we were shown to our room we were absolutely delighted. It was brilliant. Very spacious and very clean. Fresh flower petals had been thrown around - superb! The separate bathroom was also very spacious and very clean. We had a lovely view of the courtyard (see photo). This was an excellent place to sit in the warm day or the cooler evening. There was also a pool area with a cafe where you could relax if so desired.    Breakfast was excellent with a cracking selection to choose from. I had freshly made pancakes with honey every morning. Mandy had freshly made omelette. There is also a bar and a restaurant at the hotel. We ate once at the restaurant and the food was excellent though slightly on the expensive side compared to what was available elsewhere. Alcohol was available at the bar which was often welcome after a ""dry"" day in the city.    At all times the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.    Marrakesh is a tremendous city with lots to offer. We will definitely return and will definitely use Les Borjs again.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,gone2011 wrote a review Feb 2008,50,Wonderful charming hotel. Great position in the ancient walled Medina,This lovely hotel rates as one of the best we have ever stayed in. Definately 4 star comfort and facilities. It's not austere and impersonal like some of the larger multinational chain hotels but warm friendly and inviting. Absolutely first class. Every day our room was decorated with rose petals sprinkled and arranged artistically with care. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. The restaurant is lovely and the standard of food is good. They do serve wine etc unlike many places.    What a great place Marrakesh is. Everyone is friendly and there is not too much hassle from traders. There is some begging but hey these people are poor. We tried to give 10 dirham to as many needy souls as we could. The Moroccans struck us as a sophisticated and interesting people - getting on with their busy lives. We ate at the stalls in the Djamaa El Fna square and didn't get food poisoning!    We did a day trip to the coastal village of Essaouira which is much more tourist orientated and were happy to return to Marrakesh.

On arrival staff very welcoming and the obligatory mint tea was served. Our room was very nice but the shower did not work we where told it was being fixed 2 days later still no shower but the Management moved us to another room which was bigger but unfortunately the toilet leaked we where assured this would be repaired but it never was still it was nothing major so we put up with it. The hotel itself is peace and calm and the decor is done to the highest standard it was a real pleasure to go back to the hotel after being in the madness of the souks of Marrakech. Be warned stepping out of the main doors is a bit of a shock from wealth to poverty in one easy step. The staff are very polite and helpful and the restaurant is worth a visit food is great breakfast is a buffet try the pancakes I could'nt get enough. Spa was good value and worth a visit and the pool is a good size but get them to heat it up water very cold this time of year.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Gingerpumpkin wrote a review Jan 2008,50,Calm in the Kasbah,Spent 5 days at the Borjs just after New Year with my wife. The hotel orgainised an airport transfer for us and we were met by the smiling driver. This set the tone for our stay. I cannot praise the staff highly enough who were extremely pleasant helpful and courteous at all times. They simply could not do enough for us. At one point we asked for a table to be booked at a popular restaurant. However as it was closed at the time of our request the reception staff said they would try for us while we were out. Unfortunately it was fully booked but the receptionist had phoned round other similar establishments without prompting.  Our room was well appointed warm (it got distinctly nippy outside at night) and spacious. The whole ambience of the hotel was one of calm. The Spa was tremendous and extremely reasonable as far as price - my wife maintains her facial was the best she has ever experienced. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice and had the most excellent orange juice we have ever tasted. However there was one slight downside. Although the staff in the restaurant were fantastic the same could not be said for the food. It was fairly expensive and can only be described as adequate. My wife's steak was distinctly tough. I would suggest perhaps not eating at the hotel (apart from breakfast) as there are plenty of good options in the city.  Location wise this was very good being reasonably close to the very centre and near to the Saadian Tombs and Badii Palace.  Quite simply this was one of the best hotels my wife and I have ever stayed at.  Marrakech is an interesting city but take the option of taking an excursion out to the Atlas mountains and beyond. We did this through the hotel and had a thoroughly wonderful experience. If you've not been to north Africa before be prepared to be hassled by children begging for money and/or sweets (and be prepared for verbal abuse if none are forthcoming) and to be hassled by shop owners. This can be quite a culture shock if you have not travelled in this region before. If you have you will have experienced far worse. I would put the experience at a par with Turkey.  Be wary of a chap on a moped who will stop you near the hotel and assure you he works in the hotel and can show you an Artesan co-operative which will only be open that day. He doesn't and it isn't but don't worry too much if you get taken in - you won't be hassled at the co-operative.  Also be wary of the snake charmers in the square. They will demand extortionate rates after you have had your photo taken but a raised voice soon getsthem to back down.,Date of stay: January 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,North Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gingerpumpkin

From the moment we made our first enquiry the hotel staff were unfailingly helpful and polite - something that was a theme throughout our stay.  The hotel is very new and located about a 20 minute walk from the main square - something to be very grateful for as the square (and most of Marrakech) is mad and it was wonderful to return to our little oasis of calm.  The rooms (we had a suite) are spacious and well-appointed (we loved the rose petals on our bed every day!) All rooms have a/c and heating (we went in November and its cold!) The breakfast is fine (omelettes etc are offered as well as an extensive continental option). We ate in the hotel restaurant a few times - the food is good although the restaurant is a bit souless.  The spa is fabulous (great massage) and the pool area is very nice (not sure the pool ever gets any sun though!)  The staff are this hotel's greatest asset - all of them are young and incredibly willing to help even when faced with rudeness from some guests (not a fellow Brit I'm delighted to report!)

Our check-in was very relaxing we were seated in the court yard and given mint tea while we completed our registration cards. We were shown the 2 rooms that had been allocated but asked if they could be located together and the staff were more than happy to oblige - nothing seemed too much trouble. No lugging of cases was necessary they appeared in the rooms very promptly - I would have no hesitation in recommending this Riad for a stay the service was 5*. The spa at the hotel deserves a special mention - and a massage should be a must do !! The pool area was great for relaxing only be warned the water was very cold. Lunch sat around the pool area was a treat from all the hussle and bussle happening in the Kasbah.    We were on b&b and this was fine continental style but plenty of choice.

The bedroom was very spacious stunningly decorated and overlooked the main courtyard. The bed was enormous and incredibly comfortable with lovely linen sheets. The large bathroom was wonderfully equipped with a large bath and separate shower. The complimentary toiletries were a delight and the bath milk was a tonic so soak in after a long journey from England. The food at the hotel was a delight. Breakfasts were served in a beautiful courtyard and include a wide variety of tempting foods including fruit salad pastries freshly squeezed orange juice and home made yoghurts. We ate twice in the hotel for evening meals and were very happy with the food we recommend the tagines! The hotel is laid out so that there are rooms around the central courtyard for guests to use. The swimming pool area of the pool is a lovely place to spend some time when the heat becomes strong during midday. Throughout our stay the staff were friendly and accommodating and worked hard to ensure that we felt relaxed and enjoyed our stay.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,PT2001 wrote a review Aug 2007,50,"Classy and relaxed, we loved it","We have just come back from a week at Les Borjs de la Kasbah. We absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend it.    The building is in excellent conditions with one wing (spa-swimming pool) just opened in Spring 2007. The overall impression is of a classy and welcoming environment with good attention paid to details like rooms decor furniture plants etc (even ambient background music in all communal spaces and courtyards).    This is in between a riad and a hotel so expect a very articulated architectural layout with courtyards stairs etc as in a proper riad with the level of service that you normally find in good international hotels. There is even a spa with a small (10m) but very pleasant open air swimming pool.    Our room was clean and spacious and the standard of room service was definitely up to scratch. The staff couldn't be more helpful and nice and all of them seemed more than happy to go the extra mile for the guests if necessary.    The restaurant is definitely worth a try. We normally avoid hotels restaurants as they tend to be overpriced and bland but the chef at Les Borjs de la Kasbah definitely knows his stuff and we've eaten in quite a few times. The dishes were all well above average and quite frankly overshadowed most of the other restaurants we tried in Marrakech.    Overall this is a classy and sophisticated hotel incredibly quiet and a real haven in the hustle and bustle of the medina.    The hotel is also in a very good location. It is in the Kasbah so guests have the opportunity to experience the ""raw"" heart of historic Marrakech but at the edge of it in a relatively tranquil area close to the Royal Palace. This makes it easy to direct taxi drivers when going back to the hotel. Taxis are definitely a plus of Marrakech there's plenty of them around and they're dead cheap (provided that you are prepared to haggle) but the medina is confusing even for taxi drivers so to be able to give them precise directions to your hotel can be invaluable.    In conclusion we've had a fantastic time in Marrakech and this is also thanks to Les Borjs de la Kasbah. Should we decide to return to Marrakech we would definitely stay there again.",Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PT2001
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,RLN wrote a review Aug 2007,50,A fab hotel with great staff - an oasis of calm in hectic Marrakech!,This hotel was a joy to stay in. It's beautifully designed with Morrocan tiling traditional brass lamps a fountain in the courtyard etc.    The rooms are spacious (I was in a double deluxe) with very comfortable beds (Egyptian cotton sheets) adjustable air conditioning units room safe cable TV (English language channels: BBC World Euro News and Al Jazeera) phone mini bar (with complementary water). There's a lot of attention to detail such as little overhead lamps that come on when you open your wardrobe doors so you can see inside them easily. The bathroom was a good size too with two sinks and a combination bath/shower (the suites seem to have separate bath and shower units).    The hotel was very clean throughout. The maid would leave flower petals in pretty designs on the beds which was a nice touch.    The pool area was great - comfy sunbeds with lots of small tables and parasols. If enough people were outside a waiter would come out to keep an eye on whether anyone wanted a drink or some food. Another example of the attention to detail was that beside the pool were - one set per gender - a toilet two hot showers and some lockers. (Contrast this with Nikki Beach where we spent an afternoon where you had to walk back to the cafe and down a staircase to find some loos).    Breakfast was a buffet of: fruit salad homemade yoghurt (delicious) pastries (also delicious) bread (with a toaster) freshly-squeezed orange juice cornflakes pancakes eggs (boiled scrambled or omelette) cold cuts of meat cheese jam and probably some other things I've forgotten. The coffee was excellent.    Location is slapbang in the middle of the kasbah which means you get to see where the people of Marrakech live - we realised on our trip to Nikki Beach that there's a huge area consisting of nothing much but soil and palm trees that's being developed and that's where most of the big hotels seem to be - not exactly in the heart of things! The walk to the main square took around 20 mins (maybe half this time is spent dodging mopeds and other pedestrians!)    Finally the best thing about the hotel was probably the staff. They were a lovely bunch very friendly always smiling. I remember seeing one waiter Mohamed when he was on poolside duty deciding off his own bat to redo the display of wine bottles etc which had got a bit dusty. I can't see many guys in his position in the UK setting themselves tasks like that - most of them would be round the back of the hotel with a fag and a copy of The Sun!    In summary: top class staff top hotel. Would definitely go back there and would recommend it to anyone.,Date of stay: August 2007,,Cambridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLN
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,TheCarvers wrote a review Aug 2007,50,Go now while you can,"This small and intimate privately owned ""hotel de charme"" is situated in the heart of the madness of the kasbah but is an oasis of peace and tranquility with staff for whom nothing is too much trouble.    Our bedrooms were excellently furnished and all had air-con (which you will not find in all the ""5 star"" hotels in Marrakech). Personal touches such as baskets of fruit and rose petals on the bed (and bath mats!) added to the charm.    When we went the pool and hammam complex had just opened and is absolutely spot on. A wonderful place to spend a few hours relaxing after sightseeing (with good and reasonably priced lunches available). Everything was superbly clean and well maintained.    The set 3 course menu at 200 Dh is excellent value for money providing food to the highest quality prepared by the Paris trained chef. Most drinks are reasonably priced although spirits are probably close to UK hotel prices. There is a good choice of Moroccan and other wines.    This hotel is definitely going to become one of the most popular in Marrakech and is already attracting a wide range of European clients so go now while you can.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,js777 wrote a review Aug 2007,40,Authentic Marrakech experience,I stayed at this Riad back in late January not long after it had opened and after learning that it had been recently featured on TV I thought I’d add some comments. This is my first TripAdvisor review although I do feel appropriately qualified; because of my job I stay in hotels around 30 times a year and have travelled across the Middle East.  The one thing about Morocco is that by European standards it’s a relatively poor country. However it’s rich in tradition and is a million miles from most European destinations. Les Borjs de la Kasbah is a medium-sized Riad (less than 20 bedrooms) located in the old walled city or Medina – it’s located in a quieter side street quite close to the Royal Palace. The main tourist areas such as the Souk and Djamaa El Fna Square are approx 15 minutes walk though the sort of streets and alleyways that one would typically associate with Marrakech. The Riad is not a part of a chain or a faceless western style hotel and therein lies it’s advantage it’s most definitely Moroccan in feel and charm. From what I could tell no expense has been spared in renovating these buildings – the traditional workmanship mentioned in an earlier review is evident throughout the property. In my view this is an essential element adding to the authenticity and ambiance of the holiday. The one thing that struck me was the sense of a small team running the operation as a team something you don’t get with larger hotels or chains. The team strives for high standards that European visitors demand and overall they achieve it with flying colours. The rooms are tastefully decorated and the furnished to a very high standard; Egyptian cotton and quality beds mean that I slept very well indeed! The courtyard arrangement within the Riad is quaint and adds to the calm contrast to the city. In addition to a flat-screen TV my room had its own air-conditioning unit and I can only assume that this was standard equipment in all the rooms.  I was impressed by standard of the kitchen and restaurant the team appear very committed and the restaurant itself is organised so that al fresco dining is a part of the mix regrettably too cold for us to try in January! We found the restaurant so good that we dined there each night of our three day stay. The bar is cosy although running a bar seemed new to the staff; after all the hotel had just opened and Morocco is after all a part-Muslim country.  All in all this Riad offers a unique opportunity to stay within the city walls but well insulated from the hustle and bustle of that environment. It’s an extremely comfortable hotel and recent addition of a pool it has everything one would need for a Marrakech experience. Would I stay there again? Absolutely!,Date of stay: January 2007,,"Chepstow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/js777
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,AlisonPLondon wrote a review Aug 2007,50,superb riad,This riad was one of the best places I have ever stayed. The service was second to none the riad beautifully decorated the ambience incredibly calm and restful and a real contrast to the bustle of Marrakech immediately outside. The location is great - about 15 mins walk to the main square of the medina the riad does a very competitively priced 3-course meal in the evening and all in all I don't think I've ever stayed anywhere that represented better value for money. I can't recommend it too highly.,Date of stay: July 2007,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonPLondon

From the moment we walked in the door the service was superb; they couldn't do enough for us. Our 7 year old daughter was travelling with us and they bent over backwards to make sure we all enjoyed our stay and that her needs (food etc) were catered for. As far as we could tell there were no other children staying.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,brindlg wrote a review May 2007,50,Great hotel,This Riad is a lovely place to spend a few days - the staff are friendly and helpful and the accomodation is spacious.    Despite being a Riad it maintains good quality 4* hotel type service and facilities (flat screens in rooms etc). Reception were perfectly happy to book all our dinner reservations and spaces at Nikki Beach and Plage Rouge (both recommended if you like good pools and a nice lunch).    Eating in the courtyard of the hotel is a little expensive but good in quality. There are a wealth of great restaurants in the city and I would suggest going elsewhere for a wider experience.    Get a card from a cab driver who will look after you for the whole stay - I think this is a common practice just make sure you don't pay higher rates than required.    The place is extremely peaceful the only downside were some babies staying which can spoil the Riad style experience.    While we were there the Spa/Hammam had not yet opened - this is not to say there was any noise or evidence of any work at all.    In summary lovely place with great staff. My rating is 5 to reflect that the price was also reasonable. The location is within walking distance of the main square (a long 30 minutes though) but I would recommend using the cheap taxis to get around. Don't let that stop you having a stroll to experience the busstle of the town however!,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brindlg
Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Golfingwidow wrote a review May 2007,40,Fantastic location,Delightful spot - really well positioned for visiting Marrakech on foot. Kings Palace is round the corner and main square 10 - 15min walk away. Great haven of peace and quiet to return to at the end of a busy day wandering round the bustling Medina the beautiful Marjorelle Gardens and the wonderful museum.    Taking a relaxing cup of tea in the open lounge was always a pleasure at the end of the day. The room opens on to the main courtyard and the sofas were so comfortable. The whole hotel is decorated to a very high specification. Beautiful drapes bedcovers and magnificent ceramic tiling all in shades of green terracotta and beige add to the ethnic but luxurious feel of the hotel. We particularly liked the double sinks and lights in the cupboards to help you find your clothes. The staff were extremely helpful very polite and always smiling - nothing was ever too much trouble booking taxis changing money for us etc.    We appreciated the excellent meals provided by the chef who was always keen to know personally if we had enjoyed the food.    When the swimming pool and hammam open shortly this will be one of the best small hotels in Marrakech. Will definitely return and recommend to friends.,Date of stay: April 2007,,Abergavenny,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Golfingwidow

Breakfast is very basic  (for 100DR is poor) Hotel was more a less empty during my stay (3 rooms our of 16 booked). Also dont ask reception to exchange your currency (as doorman will get you a very low rate!). Service was also poor in most areas (except the resturant which was excellent!).

Our intention was to stay with friends for 3 nights in November. Our flights were booked trips planned and the November break was a present to celebrate our friends Ruby Wedding Anniversary.We have just been informed by the Riad that our rooms have been double booked! The staff offered alternative accomodation nearby and stated that a new staff member had not checked the bookings when making our reservation. Beware and triple check your booking before planning the rest of your trip! My initial thoughts are that the whole Riad had been hired out and our booking cancelled as a result.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,cheltenhamexplorer wrote a review Mar 2007,50,Unbeatable Comfort,Arriving at Marrakech Airport I was met by a driver organised by the hotel and within eight minutes I had arrived at the huge city wall which encloses the Medina and through the magnificent Baba Agnaou gateway. I'm heading for the hotel through the chaotic exciting and very exhilerating Kasbar with mopeds horse-drawn carriages taxis exotic smells pavement cooking and lots and lots of happy people. Suddenly chaos became calm as I stepped out of the taxi to be welcomed by hotel staff (how did they know when I would arrive?) into the tranquility of what surely must be the best find in all of North Africa a new 18-room riad hotel near the Royal Palace right under the city remparts called LES BORJS DE LA KASBAH. Opened in 2006 after four years converting six townhouses and one riad into this style gem by Mike and Francoise Bruce-Mitford the owners and an up-and-coming young Moroccan architect. The interior is traditional Moroccan with acres of deep-cut white plasterwork hand carved by local craftsmen - often carved without the aid of templates or stencil drawings - and all the walls are polished tinted plaster shedding a soft glow on everyone. The large bedrooms some with their own terraces have very spacious ensusite bathrooms. The best feature besides unbeatable comfort are the beautifully coordinated fabrics and drapes so carefully chosen by Francoise to give each room its own style. Throughout the hotel unusual and interesting paintings hang all of which were chosen by Francoise who toured the local art galleries and studios to discover emerging Moroccan artists. Continental breakfasts is served in the dining room or on your own terrace with oodles of fresh organe juice and the legendary Moroccan pancakes plus wonderful pastries and yoghurt and fab. coffee. (You can choose cooked but with this morning fare you can have Full English back home!) You can stay around for lunch and dinner in the Jasmine Restaurant where French cuisine with traditional Moroccan specialities is served. The head chef with an excellent reputation was persuaded to join the hotel's team as his dream is to make the Jasmine 'the best one in Marrakech'. I stayed for three days and was enchanted by the friendly professional young Moroccan staff and when the many readers of this site visit the hotel do introduce yoursleves to le Directeur M. Tayeb who is an absolute 'pro' and has huge local knowledge as well as the ability to steer this young fledgling hotel to stardom. Soon to open is the Spa with pool jacuzzi hammem and poolside bar.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,doctorjer wrote a review Mar 2007,50,Unexpected paradise,"As we climbed out of the taxi late last Sunday evening and looked into the entrance hall of Les Borjs de la Kasbah it was difficult to imagine that this was the project that had caused so much heartache and angst. Electricity seemed to have arrived and the staff were charming and most hospitable.  The rooms have been most imaginatively designed the smallest manages to look spacious with good use of colour and texture. Sab has at least one alternative career up her sleeve!  My room was very welcoming it was warm and friendly. The BK motif on the pillow cases and towels in the terracotta colour that was to become so much part of the landscape on our trip to the Atlas mountains looked very smart. The towels were so luxurious.  All the guests had one thing in common they were old friends of Sab and Mike and they wanted this project to work.  Dinner prepared by a reserved young chef was delicious. The lamb particularly fell off the bone.The combination of chicken green veg and icing sugar was extraordinary.  Day one was cold and damp and the hotel badly needed a plumber. We dealt with it all by going out and seeing the sights of Marrakech. Would it have been better to be wife number 1 or 4? Secretly I thought the life of the concubine would have been the most fun.  Rows of spices leather wear scarves and carpets enticed us into the souk. Later exhausted we sat down in a herbal ""supermarket""  Blue sky greeted us on day two and off we went to the Atlas mountains. Our ability to say ""no"" was severely tested as armfuls of jewellery was thrust under our noses. Land adjacent to the river was terraced nothing was wasted. The Berber house was pristine and we began to understand why the mint tea was poured from such a height.  The ceiling in the bar was unlike anything we had ever witnessed. We had dinner here again and the sea bass fillets were simply delicious. What a shame the restaurant was not full.  I have told so many people about this place since I returned that it will always be full and the B-Ms had better get their rooms booked for the rest of the year now !  Carpets have been bought and we were so proud of our bartering skills. Mint tea had become commonplace and we could not understand what Mike meant when he said that this hotel had been dificult to open. Everthing seemed to run so effortlessly.  We will return to see the spa and hamman perhaps not as soon as May though after all it takes a long time to switch a light bulb on in Marrakech.  To Mike and Sab thank you for including me in your select group of clients and for your wonderful generosity while we were there.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,sofabed wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Enchanting and Intelligent,We had a warm welcome from the reception staff and when we turned to go further into the hotel there was an enchanting sight; the way ahead was set out with candles in elegant lanterns at every turn and all around the courtyard. (we arrived after dark of course!)    The hotel is nearly new but it looks like it could have been there for a century or two. The carved plasterwork and painted ceilings are done exquisitely and it still has the handsome proportions of an elegant prosperous family house.    Our room overlooked the courtyard where orange trees and bougainvillea were beginning to respond to Spring. The room was spacious and furnished with what I assume is locally made furniture the bed was generous (I am above averagely tall) and comfortable and the bathroom was nicely done. The breakfasts make you feel an honoured guest; freshly squeezed oranges eggy toast speciallity griddle cakes and much more.    The dinners in the hotel were of a really high standard good ingredients imaginatively prepared and served elegantly by friendly staff. The chef is a bit of a star and a large picture window lets you see him at work in an immaculate kitchen. I can picture being there in April or May and eating under a starry sky. My favourite was the chef's sea bass.    The receptionists are well able to organize excursions for you and have plenty of local knowledge and the transfers to and from the airport went without a hitch.    The owners gave us a tour of the hotel and we were able to see several of the other rooms. The conversion from houses to hotel has been done very intelligently and with two charming smaller courtyards and a few single rooms there would be many possibilities for extended family get-togethers etc. Coming soon; and we saw the building works looking well on target will be a pool steam room and beauty treatment floor. This will be a fine place to go for a relaxing break and it is all the better because plenty of space has been allocated to public rooms; both indoor and outdoor.    Here is a charming hotel that has style peace and quiet good food comfort and a very efficient staff.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Laurent K wrote a review Feb 2007,50,Charming and full of character,I was told of this hotel by a friend which opened at the start of 2007 and decided to make my booking for 4 of us for a 5 night stay (28/01-01/02). It's an 18 room affair with a spa and pool opening later in the year and is ideally located in the southern part of the Medina called the Kasbah. It's about 15 min walk to the main square.    The hotel arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the airport at their expense which was a good welcoming touch and the driver was very friendly and helpful.    On arrival at the hotel we received a lovely warm welcome and traditional mint tea. The hotel is very tastefully finished in traditional Morroccan design with tiled floors everywhere Morroccan paintings local style rugs and intricate wood and plaster work. In the centre of the hotel is a pieceful courtyard with dining tables and rooms off there for reading and relaxing.    The bedrooms are all individually designed and no two are the same in neither finish nor size. We had a Suite which is huge and has a sofa with two armchairs and a coffee table desk minibar and flat screen tv.    The bathroom had twin basins a bath and a separate shower with the most comfortable towels I've ever used. Bathrobes were also thrown in for good measure.    The hotel hasn't skimped on the bedding either with really comfortable matresses and egyptian cotton bedlinen. Rooms also have a safe and reasonably priced minibar.    Rooms also have heating units (needed in the winter) and a/c for the summer - but do ask reception to show you how to use them as it's not obvious and it can get cold.    The cleaners always left a nice touch with rose petals carefully placed on the bed and around the bathroom - this did seem to appeal to the women more than me though!    The staff were always professional and delivered service to the highest of European standards without being in your face. The receptionist was very happy to organise a trip to the Ourika Valley and a guided tour of the town for us - both of which were very good and worth the money.    The restaurant is one of few (in the Medina) to have a drinks licence which is important to most of us Europeans and the food is excellent. The fixed price 3 course menu changes every day and is cheap at 150 dirhams (less than £10) so we ate there most of the time. There is also an a la carte menu which is also good value.    Their wine list is mainly Morroccan wines which I was sceptical about but was pleasantly surprised by them and recommend sampling a few bottles.,Date of stay: February 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lozkb

It was very pleasant to relax in the two different lounges in the early part of the afternoon sipping a mint tea and enjoying the brilliant blue skies above the courtyard that has been well designed with colorful climbing Bougainvillea flowers and a centre marble fountain.  We would love to return at another time of year and experience the pool and spa area which will be completed  in the near future.

Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Miranda B wrote a review Dec 2006,40,beautiful new conversion,Les Borjs de la Kasbah is a new hotel converted from six traditional houses set against the city walls of Marrakech next to the old palace (a borj is a watchtower). It is beautiful with inner courtyards complete with orange trees fountains and bourganivillia. Fine plaster-work wood carving and hand made tiles give an air of opulence and authenticity. Our welcome was warm and we were well looked after throughout our stay. The food was excellent and the rooms charming. The electricity had a few teething problems going off momentarily a few times and the water was sometimes warm rather than hot but as we were the first guests so we expected it and it didn't in any way spoil our stay.
