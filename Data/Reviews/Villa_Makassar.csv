Villa Makassar,Fabio C wrote a review Mar 22,50,Great Marrakech experience in a cozy riad with extraordinary gentle staff,Very nice and cozy riad. Gentle staff nice room great service. Convenient location in the old city centre near to all major touristic spots but out of the chaotic very central area. We arrived late on a Monday morning after a rather tiring trip and they were so kind to offer a free breakfast!,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z3601XWfabioc
Villa Makassar,Katinka wrote a review Jun 2022,50,The most amazing experience,This Riad is the most amazing place. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. Marrakech is a busy city but as soon as you walk though the door here you feel at ease and completely calm. The Riad is amazing for art deco lovers. The rooms are beautiful and so is the rest of the Riad. There is a spa a pool and a jacuzzi on the rooftop. The breakfast and restaurant are very good and high quality. I would definitely recommend staying here if you have the chance. I will be returning!,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Apeldoorn, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katinka_F89
Villa Makassar,Lesley B wrote a review Mar 9,50,"Classy, chic hotel",We stayed at the Makassar hotel for a week and from the moment we walked through the door felt at ease as though we had stepped into another world from the busy streets of the city. Privileged to be staying in an original design art deco riad. The room and bathroom were really special made out throughout to an art deco design. We were charmed by the house buntings hopping in the interior courtyard while we enjoyed a leisurely breakfast where we were offered a selection of cakes and refreshing fruit salads and yoghurts and copious amounts of coffee. All the reception and restaurant staff were friendly and helpful. Trips and transport seamlessly arranged. A good location within easy walking distance of the main square and the Bahia Palace.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesleyb875
Villa Makassar,Denn15711 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Beautiful hotel with incredible staff,The hotel is beautiful with really thoughtful art deco design in a very grand building. The staff are incredible particularly the new manager Samira who helped with making a restaurant booking for us and organising treatments and taxis.    The roof terrace was lovely and the weather warm considering the time of year. The top pool and jacuzzi were not in use but that didn't matter we used the jacuzzi in the spa.    The rooms are lovely and well equipped - we stayed in a junior suite - boutet de monvel. It's a nicely decorated dark room situated on the first floor with the courtyard below and benches outside. The shower is very modern with a radio and cool lighting.    Breakfast there is really good especially the fresh orange juice and cake each morning.    We had dinner in the restaurant one night and it was nice. You can buy wine with your meal or the mint tea is good.    The hammam and treatments were very relaxing ... would recommend.    The hotel is located in the old town and we felt very comfortable walking through the souks to the main square for haggling with the very friendly sellers. We bought lots of little trinkets to bring back.    A lovely experience overall in Morocco and cannot wait to come back.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Hove,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denn15711

Villa Makassar,Saul P wrote a review Feb 2023,50,5 Night Stay,We enjoyed an excellent stay at Villa Makassar for 5 nights in late Jan.    Visual:  Taste may be subjective however I loved the stylish art deco decor. Everything was clean and housekeeping ensured our room was kept tidy throughout.    Atmosphere:  Perfect if you're looking for a quiet relaxed stay. With a relatively small number of rooms it's an escape from the madness of Marrakech. It gives the hotel a very personal feel with staff trying their best to accommodate you (personal thanks to Samira). The rooftop was ideal for chilling out in the sun too.    Experience:  Overall it was a great place to unwind. Not too far from the centre of the medina (about a 15min walk) so it was easy to explore the city on foot. Loved the hammam in the downstairs spa - just need to book it and use of the jacuzzi in advance. Only criticism would be the WiFi was a bit patchy but more of an excuse to enjoy your surroundings!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721saulp
Villa Makassar,Jo C wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Amazing! Loved Villa Makassar!,We stayed at Villa Makassar for 5 nights in November and had the best time! Villa Makassar is so nice! You walk in through a modest entrance where you wouldn’t even really notice there’s a hotel from the outside. Then you step inside to an oasis… calming music gorgeous designs soothing scents and fresh mint tea and cookies are there to welcome you upon arrival.    The room was spacious comfortable and clean. Large bed and every day they would clean the room and light fresh incense so it smelt amazing. The Art Deco style all around the hotel is beautiful and gives it a unique feeling.    The staff are amazing and will go above and beyond to make sure you have a good stay. They also helped book excursions and brought out cake on my birthday to make it extra special. The spa was soooo nice and relaxing and we had great massages.    We had a 3 course dinner at the hotel on the first night- delicious! Every morning for breakfast they brought out different treats and were happy to cater to special food requests any time of day.    Honestly can’t recommend this hotel enough and would definitely stay again next time we’re in Marrakech.    Thank you so much to all the staff for making our stay so lovely!,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocT6947OT

Villa Makassar,Yasmine wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Splendid Experience - Couldn’t Recommend Enough!,We spent a few days shy of two weeks in Marrakesh sometime in mid-August this year.    Our trip was filled with wonder and adventure. The area in the Old Town in which Villa Makassar stands in was ideal for us - the hotel’s immediate surroundings are calm yet well-connected and the hotel is just down the road to an array of vibrant local shops businesses and squares.    Luckily for us we travelled during a relatively calmer time of the year - there weren’t many tourists. The staff at the Villa Makassar were extremely accommodating and proved themselves to be excellent hosts like none other.    We stayed in the Junior Suite which offered us everything we needed. The breakfasts were an absolute delight we still dream of them to this day. The lunch and dinner services are just as excellent.    The spa services were relaxing and helped us regenerate before our day trips that the hotel helped us organise. We recommend the trip to the Atlas Mountains!    We cannot express how grateful we are to all the staff at the Villa Makassar from the cooks to the cleaners from the reception staff to the spa specialists and finally the administration. We will definitely make our way back and we’ll definitely be staying with you again!

Villa Makassar,George W wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Amazing experience,The most amazing experience from start to finish we would definitely recommend and return here in the future. The staff were all so friendly and attentive the hotel was beautiful cool stylish relaxing.  No time limits with food you could eat drink or snack when ever you want.  It was quiet and peaceful a good distance away from the busy markets. I recomend you eat breakfast downstairs in the courtyard and dinner and drinks on the rooftop terrace. I don't usually leave reviews but I would give this place 10 stars if I could.

Villa Makassar,Victoria W wrote a review Jul 2022,50,A WEEK IN PARADISE,Coming back to the Villa Makassar felt like coming back home the wonderful staff made an absolute fuss of us and I have to say our rooms were spacious and stunning with beautiful Art Deco objets .  With all the Covid issues we weren’t able to travel for a long time  so I can’t tell you enough how great it was to come back and be spoilt this way !  We each had an hour massage in their spa  the masseuse used this delicious verveine oil  a fantastic way to start our holiday in Marrakech.

Villa Makassar,Phoebe wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Wonderful hotel!,Myself and my Fiance spent 5 nights at the fantastic Villa Makassar in May 2022 and honestly we wish we could have stayed longer! The hotel itself is so beautiful and interesting- the stunnng pool and roof terrece are just what you need after a busy morning exploring Marrakesh. We stayed in the superior suite which was beautiful! What really stands out though is the staff- they make the place. They are incredibly friendly and always go out of their way to help you and make your day. The food is also delicious- there's always a different breakfast which is a fun surprise each morning! The location is also great as it's about a half hour walk into the medina which means you're at a perfect distance from the hustle and bustle and can have some calm.

Villa Makassar,William M wrote a review Jun 2022,50,"I need to write 5 reviews!!! Fantastic place, fantastic people.",This is the most personable hotel I have ever been to and I have stayed in some nice hotels. They will greet you with a warm welcome. On occasion I sat down and talked with several of the people while there. They were encouraging and helpful.    The airline destroyed my suitcase - Tumi. Zipper mangled and unusable - large number of teeth gone. They sent it out and had a new zipper in 1 day. Cost was about $15. They personally walked us to a store we needed to go to. Wasn't far but not readily identifiable. My special thanks to Brahim. I would like to mention everyone but he really helped.    It is a beautiful historic hotel/house. Very spacious and comfortable. When you enter you are in a comfort zone which is a nice contrast to the streets of Marrakesh. There is a small pool area and a spacious rooftop area. It feels like you are in a very nice home. The art deco touches were done long ago.    Easy walk to get to some places like Bahia Palace and Djemaa El Fna.,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V5991DRwilliamm
Villa Makassar,yassine zaimi wrote a review Jun 2022,50,honeymoon package,The coolest lobby in Marrakech….  As you'll learn if you visit the Villa Makassar - Art Deco Hotel & Spa is a truly impressive architectural. It's a great spot to relax. I would argue that the location architecture SPA and service make this the best place to stay in Marrakech.    My wife and I checked in at Villa Makassar - Art Deco Hotel & Spa on 05/23/2022. Registration was very easy and every staff member I encountered from the check- in to the cleaning staff were delightful and eager to help. the restaurant food was THE BEST EVER. The manager was very friendly. we then went to our room. we found food ready in the table as requested with a Moroccan Mint tea. The fridge was very cleaned and filled with soft drinks.    We had a great massage by one of the staff that I really forgot her name she was very knowledgeable and friendly (I recommend everyone to ask about this lady I believe her name is Kamar). The swimming pool SPA was very clean and warm.    We loved the roof top specially for breakfast. I Highly recommend it!    we will definitely come again…….,Date of stay: May 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yassinezaimi
Villa Makassar,Max Davey wrote a review Jun 2022,50,"Beautiful Art Deco Riad in Kasbah, Marrakech",We had an incredible 5 night stay at the Villa Makassar in Marrakech. All the staff were friendly attentive and helpful and our hostess was brilliant. She very kindly upgraded us on the first night!    The Suite Deluxe was very luxurious and spacious. All the facilities in the room were brilliant and we slept well. Everything was perfect.    We had a fantastic time exploring the culture in the city and when it got too hot/we needed some downtime we spent it either on the roof of the Riad next to the cool jacuzzi or taking a dip in their non-heated pool (which was much needed in the 37-degree heat!) The pool was a highlight - felt like a hidden/private spot for us to cool down.    The restaurant was brilliant - the quality of the food was incredible. It was heavenly to have a quiet spot to eat and relax away from the busyness of the city.    This was the holiday of our dreams and Villa Makassar was a huge part of that. Thank you for helping us create unforgettable memories. Couldn't recommend it enough to anyone staying in Marrakech.,Date of stay: May 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxDavey
Villa Makassar,Joanne wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Absolutely Perfect,Beautiful Art Deco hotel in Marrakech!  Interior beauty topped only by the staff who are more than accommodating with the answer to everything being “as you like”.  Reception was elegant and very welcoming.  Breakfast served everyday in our choice of setting… restaurant in our suite and the stunning terrace. Service was impeccable.  Our room was extra fabulous and the spa services were the best experienced in all of Morocco  There are many luxury options in Marrakech. We visited and dined at some of them but would undoubtedly choose Villa Marrakech for a number of reasons….  1. The staff!!! Professional accommodating welcoming and wanting you to have the best experience possible. I cannot thank them enough.  2. This is a small boutique hotel only 10 rooms allowing the staff to provide personalized service.  3. The terrace. We had visited other hotel terraces in Marrakech and the steady stream of tourists made me very happy to return to the privacy and beauty of ours.  4. The location in the Kasbah allowed us to experience the authenticity of a true Marrakech area.  5. By far the best dining experience in all of or 3+ week stay in Morocco. One of the very best in all of my travels. Youssef took personal care to prepare a visually stunning table and this was accompanied with a playlist of our favourite music. Their talented chef prepared a 5* dinner. Every detail was meticulous.    We will most definitely return  ❤️❤️,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoJet737

Lovely authentic interior combined with charming & attentive staff. Trip to their ""Domain"" (country villa) in the Atlas mountains was also very good.    Fascinating architecture complemented by period art and sculpture.    We stayed in Rousseau Suite which was large and comfortable with small balcony and view over the courtyard.

The staff were incredible and could not have done more for us; Khadija in particular was fantastic. She was very friendly helpful and nothing was too much of an ask. The rooms were well put-together and spacious. The lobby and terrace areas were extremely relaxing and comfortable. The location is also very good; about a 15-20 minute walk to the main square in the Medina positioned on a relatively quiet (well quiet for Marrakech at least) side street. From start to finish we could not have asked for more and Villa Makassar really made our stay in Morocco. It was so great to be able to return to this oasis of calm after a day out in the Medina or in the desert.

Villa Makassar,Rick M wrote a review Feb 2020,50,A bloody amazing holiday,After a slight frustration with getting responses on offered room upgrades and airport collection we arrived and were bowled over by the hotel and staff.    Literally nothing was too much trouble for the team. They were not just polite and helpful but gave the impression that making your stay wonderful was a pleasure for them. They give you space to enjoy the facilities but are responsive and helpful at any time. Wonderful.    The hotel and rooms are spacious elegant and both beautiful and comfortable. The pool and roof terrace are often able to be enjoyed alone like you have your own private space.    Location wise the place is GREAT. Based in the Kasbah area there is a vibrant energy right outside (although you do not hear this from within) - and the markets and main square are a short (10 - 20 minutes depending on how much you amble) walk away.

Villa Makassar,Luke1405 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Probably the best hotel I've ever stayed at,We stayed at the Villa Makassar in February 2018 a little off season so it felt as though we had the place to ourselves.    The inner Riad courtyard is the perfect relaxing antidote to the hive of activity outside the hotel at the end of a day at the Medina. The art deco interior is to die for - I could spend hours on end sat relaxing at one of the many cosy and quiet spots with a mint tea or a whisky. The staff were so attentive and friendly that my only dilemma during the stay at the hotel was choosing which of the many serene corners to sit at.    The meals were excellent and the place had a real rhythm to it as day turns into night and back again something which is perhaps harder to master at a modern hotel. The hotel provided transfers to and from the airport and a selection of day excursions from Marrakech we chose Essaouira.    The location was ideal on a quieter street but still only a short walk to the heart of the action.,Date of stay: September 2018,,"Blackwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luke1405

Villa Makassar,Xtranjera wrote a review Jun 2019,50,5* service and great location,Karima was an attentive host and paid attention to the details. The Riad is tucked away on a quiet side street but still close to the action in the Kasbah. Breakfast was tasty and filling - eggs made to order upon request. Upon late morning checkout we were given two takeaway sandwiches for our trip home which we never even requested - so thoughtful and appreciated.    Wish we could have stayed longer to use the spa facilities.    Shower taps are a bit funky and need a bit of TLC.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United States,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xtranjera

Villa Makassar,Beat10975 wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Just ok,We stayed for3 nights at this Riad. Our experience was mixed. Our emails for an airport pick up went unanswered so we had to call and do the needful. The check in was good and car and driver sent for pickup was waiting for us. The location of the hotel is 10 minutes walk to Jemaa el Fnaa and Most sights like Badian Palace and Saadian tombs are a short walk away. The room however was a tad disappointing as was small and so was the bathroom. The bed was very comfy and seemed to be queen sized. The breakfast was included and was very good. The dinner recommendation for a fine dining restaurant was not too good as the place was extremely expensive and the food and service just ok.  The girls st the reception were however very helpful in arranging a driver and car for a day to see sights around the newer parts of the city like Jardin Majorelle.

Our Riad the Villa Makassar gave us a wonderful welcome of mint tea and cakes and advice on what to do in Marrakech fior the rest of the week. Our first thing was to enjoy the traditional hamman and massage. The spa here is excellent and you can relax in the indoor pool afterwards. I would like to thank the ladies in the hamman and Ouidad on the reception who always helped us when we had been out exploring the city. We took a private drive with the hotel chauffeur Mohammed to the Atlas Mountains and we thoroughly enjoyed visiting the olive oil factory and our selfies with the camel. The decor here is very tasteful dark colours to bring out the Art Deco theme. Our daily breakfast was always a surprise with the selection of Morrocain cakes and choice of eggs. The hotel is situated within a 15 minute walk to the big square and transfers for visiting the Majorelle gardens are easily arranged by the reception. The roof terrace is very comfortable too.

Villa Makassar,Stephen C wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Perfect place to stay in Marrakesh,We took a family trip to Marrakesh and were fortunate enough to stay at Villa Makassar. We loved everything about it. The rooms and public areas were beautiful (the owner collects art and objects from around the world and has a great eye) the food was excellent the staff gracious and the location perfect. Someone from the hotel met us at the airport and when we arrived the owner himself gave us a tour of the Villa and very helpful guidance about how to see the city. During our stay the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. They suggested places for dinner all of which were excellent and made reservations for us. When our daughter had to leave the hotel at 4am for the airport they provided transportation and even prepared breakfast for her before she left. Those little touches were very special. We will certainly return to Villa Makassar on our next trip to Morocco.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9824UCstephenc

The location of the hotel is quite good - it is about a fifteen minute walk into central town but through a very smoggy area and so recommend learning the back routes! The service at the hotel was very good and the staff could not be politer. The food is a mixed affair - some stuff was excellent and others not so good but on the whole a very safe haven and a nice place to eat - if a little expensive. The room was ok but incredibly dark and no morning light comes in. The other rooms look beautiful though and the shared areas are beautiful so I think we just got a bit unlucky.

This is a beautiful riad with incredibly helpful and friendly staff. We were upgraded to a bigger room upon arrival at no extra charge and Khadija the front office manager was always around to offer advice offer recommendations and make bookings. For two people who had never been to Morocco it was invaluable.    The hotel itself has a beautiful roof terrace where we enjoyed some drinks at sunset and had complimentary breakfast in the morning. The room was clean nicely decorated and A/C hot water etc were all in tip-top shape.

Art Deco in style original furnishings sculpture and artwork.    In the centre of the kasbah 20 mins walk from the main square and thé winding craziness of the souks.    The riad has a dining room external terraces to eat at ground floor level a large roof top area with sun loungers tables and chairs a bar and a jacuzzi. Downstairs you will find a small pool.    There is a beautiful spa and hammam with amazing treatments to indulge yourself after haggling in the souks.    The ambience is perfect from the moment you step inside the door leaving the dirty chaos of the kasbah behind you.    The first thing that will strike you is the entrance hall (pictured) it’s gorgeous.    Then the next thing that will strike you is the service. From Belinda at the front desk to the other staff. Friendly smiley - nothing a problem. They were all so nice they made the difference from this being a good to a great break.    We had time to do a cooking class in the kitchen and it was really a great activity - fun and tasty!    The only complaint was that it was difficult to get email response to questions before hand from Juliette and when we met her she was the only staff member who seemed to be less customer oriented that the rest of the team.    We would definitely come back and would advise anyone coming to Marrakech to choose the Villa Makassar.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lutry, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goombie
Villa Makassar,Ahmad U wrote a review May 2018,50,Outstanding Stay,I would highly recommend staying here when visiting Marrakech. Mickey is an outstanding host to his guests he makes you feel at home! When being in or near the Medina it is hard to find a well kept Hotel or Riad in the middle of all the action. This property is very clean updated well decorated and the amenities are fantastic.

Villa Makassar,David H wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Beautiful place,Stayed here in April 2018. Amazingly decorated in the Art Deco style throughout. Rooms are each unique and based on a different painter - we stayed in the Mondrian room. Within walking distance of a lot of interesting sites and sights. Food was good. The roof terrace could hold 50+ people which is strange given the limited number of rooms. Perhaps they hold events?

Villa Makassar,Jayne T wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Beautiful hotel,"I stayed for 4 nights in early March with my mum we had changed the booking last minute as i was due to go with a friend. The hotel were fantastic and changed our room to a twin with no trouble.  The staff are incredible at Villa Makassar and couldn't do enough to help us. The owner met us on arrival and we were served peppermint tea and some pastries whilst he explained where to visit and how to get around the city which was super helpful as it was our first time.  The hotel itself is stunning and one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed in the roof terrace was perfect spot for breakfast and catching some sun in the afternoons and relaxing in the hot tub.  The only negatives are that the weather had been cold so the main pool was out of use which was a shame on the warmer days. The rooms did not have tea or coffee making facilities although we were provided with a kettle for free when we asked which was perfect for us. Our room did not have a full length mirror but these were all minor things that did not impact out stay.  Having read previous reviews stating breakfast was ""basic"" i wasn't expecting much. We were pleasantly surprised breakfast was like a 3 course meal! Fruit or yoghurts then a platter of pastries cakes (the savoury pastries were my favourite) and bread. Then you had an option for cooked eggs - sadly these didnt come withtoast so a bowl on scrambled eggs on day one was a biy strange but we had omlettes after that which were lovely.  We only ate at the Villa once and it was lovely but a little more expensive than other places around the Medina.  The walk from villa to the main square is about 20 mins we did feel slightly intimidated in the smaller streets of the Kasbah but the hotel staff always reassured us we were safe.  Just dont let the ""helpful young boys"" give you directions or help you get around as they will expect money after. Anyone who has done any research about Marrakech will already know this.  All in all i couldn't recommend the hotel enough. The staff make this place incredible and certainly were the highlight of our trip.

Villa Makassar,v22mon wrote a review Feb 2018,10,Do not book this hotel!,I and my family totalling 6 members including my father who is disabled booked a 5 day holiday to Marrakech 10th-14th Feb 2018. We booked through Expedia researching throughly Villa Makassar was the hotel we choose because the website showed it having 4.5 stars the reviews were great and the photographs looked amazing.    Having arrived at Villa Makassar on 10th Feb 2018 at approximately 12.30pm we were shown in by the reception manager and then left to wait around for over an hour whilst she booked us in considering the hotel has only 10 rooms and there were no other guests to be seen I couldn’t believe it took that long even then only 2 rooms were ready which we accepted and deposited our luggage within (Juliette the manager emailed me a few days before asking what time we would be arriving so she knew our eta.). Once the third room was ready around 3 hours of our arrival we were shown it the bed was a mattress on a plank of wood attach to the wall and the room only had a filthy a jacuzzi there was no shower.....how do you expect people to shower in a jacuzzi?? Not happy with this we asked for another room this room boasted a non working air conditioning unit (the temperature was around 6 degrees at the time) and it smelt damp once the reception manager said the AC was fixed it and was switched on it was blowing out air that smelt of sewage. The final room shown had to be accepted as it was getting late and we were all tired from waking up at 3am to travel this room again had only a bath no showering facilities no towels and was cold.    We stayed positive and wanted to begin our holiday so had lunch it took 30 minutes for a waitress to appear and take our order then another hour before it arrived arrived. We asked for some drinks which arrived another 30 minutes after our lunch had.    Later in the evening we asked for heaters and more blankets as the rooms were cold these took many vists to reception by us to be delivered to our rooms.    In the morning the included breakfast consisted of small muffins burnt toast and burnt omelettes again these took over an hour to arrive whist we waited sat in the cold dinning room wearing out coats.    We decided to leave the hotel and book Hotel Movenpick as my father who is 70 years suffers from diabetes was constantly shivering and needs to eat in a timely fashion in order to take his medication Villa Makassar were not accommodating to his need whatsoever ever which angered us immensely!    The reception manager did not seem concerned that we left the hotel after less than 24hours even though we had booked to stay until 14th Feb and paid fully no apologies or offers of reimbursement as no doubt our 3 rooms were resold and the hotel has profited.    Do not recommend this hotel whatsoever and would not even rate it 1 star if I had the option to!!!!!,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/v22mon

We had a bit of trouble trying to find our transfer at the airport (arranged by VM) but Juliet was incredibly helpful over the phone and even tried to call once we were in the car to check we were on our way.    From the moment we entered the riad we felt completely relaxed - from the tea and treats awaiting us in one of the cool lounges to the completely hassle free check-in. Our room (the Mondrian room) was a little small but had all the amenities we needed and suited us perfectly! We found the staff incredibly helpful and friendly with Yosef being our favourite face around the riad!    We ate breakfast on the terrace each morning and found it to be simple (which most Moroccan breakfasts are) but delicious - we stayed in a few other riads / hotels in Morocco and this was our best breakfast by far! We had dinner at the Villa once it was a little expensive but incredible. My boyfriend reckons it was the best lamb he’s ever had!!    We treated ourselves to a Hammam Duo treatment which included a Hammam scrub and wash. It was a bit cramped for my boyfriend (he’s 6ft5) and we found it a bit odd having only one lady looking after both of us but we left feeling very refreshed!

Villa Makassar,RuzChowdhury wrote a review Nov 2017,50,A splendid stay in an absolutely amazingly gorgeous hotel.,A hidden gem if you haven't discovered this hotel already!! A great location walking distance to the market Jemaa el-Fnna and the Souks in Kasbha amongst the hustle and the bustle yet tucked away so you can feel completely at peace once inside the Hotel. Villa Makassar is beautifully presented and every corner of the hotel is adorned with amazing art pieces and work that one feels obliged to discover and take in. The rooms are stunning and the interiors of each room is beautifully thought out and presented. We were a group of 4 my brother who has disabilities was catered for as we emailed the hotel before hand and they were very efficient in calling us and adhering to his needs. My sister (who is expecting) and her husband were upgraded to a stunning room they were very surprised and delighted at the thoughtfulness of the lovely Khadhija the front office manager. The staff were beyond nice respectful and very very helpful. Khadhija is at the front office and dealt with all our queries so well and ensured we were thoroughly informed in all our request and problems we kept running to her with.  Breakfast can be a little slow after you order but when you are waiting in the beautiful roof terrace you hardly notice the slight delay. We also had lunch at the hotel a few times and the food at all times was lovely. I would definitely recommend their lunch menu especially the burger which actually comes as 3 small burgers absolutely delicious!  As we stayed 7 nights we had 30min Hammam 30min Jacuzzi and 30min full body massage included  which was fantastic and great to do especially the massage after a long day climbing the Atlas Mountain.  In all a fabulous hotel with fabulous staff and we got to meet the brains behind the concept of this hotel Mr Fouad Graidia. A very pleasant and humble gentleman who spent hours talking to us and making us feel at home especially my brother. I would highly recommend Villa Makassar to anyone going to Marrakesh and have already told all my family and friends of this little gem!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuzChowdhury
Villa Makassar,Alex N wrote a review Nov 2017,40,"Great stay, could be improved",All in all we had a great stay at Villa Makassar. We don’t usually stay in 5 star hotels so for us it felt like a real treat but others who are used to staying in luxury could be disappointed if they had similar problems to what we did during our stay. The hotel could be amazing if they work out a few of the issues that we’ve listed below.    Hotel - Beautiful interiors great welcome with mint tea and Moroccan biscuits almost all of the staff were lovely and very helpful during our stay. Great roof terrace views of atlas mountains in distance. Pool was freezing cold so we were unable to use during our stay hot tub on roof terrace was also quite cold both us and other guests didn’t seem to be able to get it to heat up any more.    Spa - A great plus to have. As we stayed 7 nights we had a 30 min hammam 30 min jacuzzi and 30 min full body massage included. The massages were fantastic. The hammam was DIY and no one had explained what you had to do or what anything was in the room so me and my husband had to work it out ourselves which was a little disappointing. The first time we booked to use the jacuzzi a couple of days in advance but it was cold so we had to rebook for another day which was disappointing but the jacuzzi was lovely once it was the right temperature and very relaxing with the coloured lights and music.    Location - Great to be in amongst the hustle and bustle of the Kasbah. Fairly easy 20 minute walk to Jemaa el-Fnaa and the souks. 2 great restaurants on the same road as the hotel (Clock Cafe a minute walk and Jardin at the hotel next door). There were building works directly next to the hotel going on during our stay wasn’t a huge disturbance for us luckily but something to consider and definitely something the hotel should make guests aware of before booking.    Food - breakfast lunch and dinner were all excellent at the hotel. We ate there 5 out of the 7 nights during our stay because the food and service was so good. I have food allergies and the kitchen and staff went above and beyond to make sure I was well catered for.    Room - We booked a suite no 11 lovely and big with a nice rainfall shower and big bath in the ensuite. Had a nice feel to the room although was quite dark but that didn’t bother us. The mattress was very hard which wasn’t a big problem for us but worth noting for anyone sensitive to this. We had a continuous problem with the air conditioning in our room as it gave out a very nasty smell the two times we tried to use it in the middle of the night when waking up too hot. I’m not sure what the smell was but it made us both feel quite unwell especially my husband who felt unwell for most of the next day. After the first time we were told it was fixed but we then had the same problem. When we let them know about the second time we never heard whether it had been fixed or not and because it was so unpleasant we were too scared to try it again so we just opened the windows instead (luckily it was cool in the evenings when we were there this would have been a huge issue if we had stayed during the hotter months). We also had problems with the TV and DVD player in our room. After 2 different staff members trying to help it seemed you had to unplug the satellite to be able to use the dvd and vice versa. It took us several days to figure it out with the help of confused staff who didn’t seem to understand the set up either we ended up barely using it as it was too complicated. We also found the DVDs provided didn't work in the dvd player other than one.    Despite the few issues we had we really did enjoy our trip and the hotel it was just a shame that we had these problems and hopefully the hotel with fix these for future guests if they do this would be an amazing hotel.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexn725

Villa Makassar,Cmottley10 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,A Beautiful Oasis,From the moment we booked the hotel through Expedia we received a welcoming email informing us of airport pickups if needed and the delights of the SPA. I replied back informing them we where on a late flight so would be arriving late. From the moment you push open the Riad door you step into tranquility. On arrival they showed us to our room and delivered refreshing mint tea along with pastry's. They even kept the restaurant staff on to accommodate us for a meal.    The Riad/Villa is quite beautiful and has a lovely terrace with umbrellas creating shade. There is a large hot tub on the terrace which my husband and I enjoyed (it had a cool setting). There are only 10 rooms so expect personal service we could not have asked for more. The location was great for us we have visited Marrakech many times and enjoy the Kasbah area it's only a ten minute walk to the main square and souks and there are several highly rated restaurants and Spa's close by. The restaurant at the Hotel is super and rates highly for Fine Dining at reasonable prices too. As we had booked for seven nights we were upgraded to a Suite on the last night they may have wanted our room but it was a nice gesture to give us. There is local building going on close to the Villa but this did not impact on our stay.    To summarise if you want luxury a high level of personal service in a unique beautiful Art Deco building in the Medina this is for you we would certainly revisit.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lancashire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cmottley10

Food however is really excellent -our traditional welcome meal was outstanding. The roof terrace lacked shade which was important in temperatures of 30+. The swimming pool on a different floor also lacked shade and seating. The hotel is also quite a hike from the Medina centre.

The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. We had a small issue with the air conditioner and were given an upgraded room which was a very kind gesture. We used the pool once after a day of walking in the heat and although small was a nice relaxing and refreshing experience. We also used the spa which was lovely. Breakfast was included and we loved the tasty coffee and cheese bread in the courtyard. The manager was kind enough to give us late check out and we had an evening flight. This was truly appreciated. I would highly recommend this Riad! The staff and facility was wonderful . It was slightly out of the busy area but a short walk to all the sights.

Villa Makassar,Singerqp wrote a review Aug 2017,40,"Beautiful Riad, Lovely Area, Great service. Disappointing ending",Walking through Villa Makassar's entrance hall you're offered a complete escape from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. It's grand entrance hall infused with smells of orange and cinnamon create a warm welcome. The Riads are beautiful the pool refreshing and the staff are so helpful.    BEDROOMS  Our room was okay. The bathroom was perfect but our bedroom did not look like any of the pictures viewed. Clean and well presented but for the price point the walls needed painting and the seating chairs at the end of our bed felt like they were straight out of a skip. The bedroom did not have the Moroccan charm that is so evident in the rest of the hotel. The bedroom felt a bit more premier inn than 5 star hotel.    BREAKFAST  Was a collection of cakes eggs and bread. Although very tasty and all are homemade I would recommend a menu and choice here.    SERVICE  The service was great. The reception team are really helpful talk you through the history of the Riad and create a welcoming calming and relaxing atmosphere. They made everything feel easy.    DISPUTE  Throughout our stay we enjoyed items from the minibar and were happy to pay for these. On the morning of our departure we were presented with a bill for items that we were told were separate to the minibar. When we mentioned this to the staff they informed us that this was no longer the case but they were happy to pass us on to the owner to raise the complaint further.    What resulted was an incredibly deflating end to a lovely trip. The owner became aggressive and lost his temper on the phone. He kept speaking over us and I had to rationalise and calm his fury. Not the customer service you expect from a 5 Star Hotel and when you have spent over £500 at the business.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Singerqp
Villa Makassar,MissKitty92 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Perfect Birthday,We visited back in February for my birthday and found that Villa Makassar really made our stay. The staff are attentive and extremely friendly and helpful. The Villa itself is beautiful and was so nice to come back to after a hectic day within the city. The time of year we went it was very quiet and sometimes it did feel a little abandoned. For example the roof terrace was used in the mornings but it wasn't ever set up as like in the photos despite the weather being great. It seemed they might be doing some renovations to part of it though. Just an observation and not a complaint! We enquired about the use of the spa facilities and booked a slot. The facilities were great but we were sad that this didn't include the free massage that we got booking through Prestige. Nonetheless the Spa Therapist was very helpful and friendly and we enjoyed our relax in the pool and steam room. We were impressed with the breakfast and the choice we were given. We were always offered eggs and had a selection of pastries cakes crepes tortillas homemade yoghurt smoothies and fruit salad as well as fresh orange and coffee. We never needed lunch we stocked up so well at breakfast! Julia and her team are wonderful and we would definitely recommend to others and stay again when the time comes.

Villa Makassar,brad686 wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Fantastic!,We carefully weighed all our options for Marrakech and chose this riad for the reviews ambiance location price and parking. Villa Makassar did not disappoint. The photos and the description are accurate but they do not fully convey the beauty of the space the size the mood the people. Everyone was super accommodating the total experience was relaxing enjoyable comfortable. As with another riad that we stayed in there is a majestic open air courtyard/restaurant area which is very relaxing and invigorating. The other half of the restaurant enclosed with the bar is where we ate a wonderful dinner and it has a very chilled out lush atmosphere. Nice room comfortable luxurious bed awesome shower too. My only issue was a perfume scent in the room. I thought this was unnecessary and I am allergic to perfumes so took the little pot with the essential oils or perfume out of the room and gave it to the staff after which I was fine. Everyone was super helpful with parking bags etc. Wish we had more time. I would definitely stay there again.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burlington, Vermont",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brad686
Villa Makassar,Lindsay M wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Perfect Escape,My husband and I were really looking for a location that allowed us to both explore the local area but also to have a break and relax. This did exactly that! The Riad itself was beautiful. Stunning decor calm and our suite was perfect. It's our first day back in London today and we have both said we are missing our peaceful and delicious breakfast already.  As we were there a week we were lucky enough to try most aspects the hotel offered. The spa was lovely an amazing relaxing massage jacuzzi and steam room. We also had a beautiful 3 course traditional meal one evening. The lamb was the best I've ever tasted! Lunch and snacks through the day that were available were always really nice too.  As the breakfast was so substantial we often only had 2 meals a day - and we found that a good place outside of the Riad was at the Clock Cafe down the street. An amazing little place and twice we joined them for their buffet when they broke their Ramadan fast. The food was amazing as was the atmosphere :)  We booked one of the excursions the Riad offered and spent a day up in the Atlas mountains. If you get a chance to do this I would really recommend slightly cooler temperature than the city so hiking was ok and the tour guide and local Berbers were so friendly. A 3 course lunch was included in a guest house in the mountains - again - after a few hours of walking this was amazing. Make sure you ask to see the waterfall on your walk - perfect to paddle and cool down and great for photos.  The facilities in the Riad were always quite quiet which was perfect for us. The pool was lovely I think only once did we have to share it with anyone else due to the times when everyone was exploring. Also the rooftop bar was amazing in the evening.  The final and most important point of the stay - the staff were great. They couldn't do enough for us and they we so friendly and accommodating. Every day there were fresh juices or smoothies to help yourselves to in the heat - and often they would bring these to your room unannounced as a lovely (and welcome) afternoon treat in the heat.  I can't thank them all enough for the stay we had a great time didn't want to come home! We would definitely return although I might try in peak season next time just to see the difference.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christophermE2616HC

Villa Makassar,spartaBristol wrote a review May 2017,50,Great Hotel nicely Located,This is a very nice boutique hotel to stay at. About a 20 minute walk from the main souks but pretty interesting wandering along a road with little traffic and interesting local shops and people. Very safe we had no problem walking to and from the souks at all times of day and night.    Zainab the manager greeted us on arrival with mint tea and showed us a very large room with a king size bed overlooking the court yard. We did not eat at the restaurant as it was not very busy so we felt woul;d lack atmosphere. Unfortunately in April the rooftop lounge area was also closed so we could not use or review that.    The staff were very good and nothing was too much trouble. They arranged taxis to other restaurants (and recommended some) and to various tourist attractions.

Villa Makassar,Nick T wrote a review May 2017,50,An oasis in a great city,The hotel was relatively quiet as rising temperatures meant it was no longer peak season. However even at 40c the AC and natural cooling of the inner courtyards worked well and meant we felt very comfortable in this Oasis. The location in the Kasbah district meant it was a lot quieter than the Medina and could also be accessed by car.  The team at the Villa could not have been more helpful and made our stay a joy. Breakfast was far removed from the large buffets often found in hotels; having a more intimate personal feel with eggs local breads jams fruit yoghurt etc. The room was relaxing cool quiet and with a large bathroom area so all in all very comfortable and clean  We used the restaurant one night but the fact the hotel was quiet meant it lacked atmosphere plus it impacted on the menu so we preferred the other meals we had in Marrakesh. Lunch however was simple and very enjoyable.  We used the spa one afternoon and would recommend it highly prices are fair and the experience was memorable  All in all I would very happily go back although it does look like building work will soon commence next door which may disrupt the wonderful tranquility of the Villa for a period.  Marrakesh it self exceeded our expectations so all in all a great time.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Worcester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickJT999
Villa Makassar,camcat81 wrote a review May 2017,50,An oasis in the middle of the Kaspar,We stayed here for 4 nights in May and couldn't have picked a better place in my opinion. Other reviewers have said the staff couldn't do enough and that's 100% true. Zainab the manager was outstanding as was all the other staff. We went on a trip to the souk and randomly saw one of the kitchen staff who made sure that we visited the right shops and that we didn't over pay for taxi's before riding off on his bike home just because he recognised us. The villa was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. On arrival you are greeted by the intoxicating smell of orange-cinnamon oil. It was so lovely I had to buy some!    The rooms are thoughtfully decorated with someone that clearly has good taste. Also never too hot which I did worry about. Food was lovely - I recommend the French toast at breakfast and lamb shank for dinner.

We missed a reservation at Nomad restaurant which had been hard to get and the concierge was able to secure us an excellent table on another night. The staff is very friendly helpful met our every need. Excellent food (dinner) was served in the high atrium central atrium it is calm quiet after the chaos of the medina.

It is situated about a 20 minute walk from all the main attractions but plenty to see and experience on the way. Staff at the riad were exceptional very friendly & welcoming we had dinner first night which was a bit disappointing we both had the tagine which was quite dry other items may have been better. Breakfast the 1st morning was the best went a bit downhill after that. Home made yoghurt selection of buns/cakes etc followed by eggs anyway you like them. After that it was a hit or miss if you got fresh fruit salad always received buns/cakes but no more eggs :-(  I experienced the hamam clay scrub and hour massage & highly reccomned it!

However we were very impressed with the level of service we received upon arriving at the hotel and the restaurant food and staff were superb! We did stay in one of the suites and truly enjoyed the spacious room and the beautiful décor. Though I have to admit that we were not particularly fond of the window in the toilet room that had no curtain and a clear view to the rooftop next door; we felt the need to bathroom with the door closed and the lights off. As I shared we had to leave early the next morning and unfortunately there was a miscommunication with the night staff so a prearranged breakfast was not available at our departure. Considering the price we paid for the room (breakfast included) we were a bit disappointed that we had to eat at the airport.

Villa Makassar,Jeremy H wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Exceptional in every way - Highly recommended!,We stayed in Villa Makassar for 4 nights and were really very impressed with the entire experience! I've stayed in a few places in Marrakesh over the years and like anywhere there is good and bad. Villa Makassar is at the very top end of 'good'. It has 10 rooms so is very 'boutique' in style so the staff can afford to invest a lot of time with each guest ensuring that they feel well looked-after. The property itself is lovely - Very well appointed full of 'Riad' character and has a luxurious feel. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff - They will literally bend over backwards to accommodate any request. I was particularly impressed with the condition of the rooms and the attention to detail so far as maintenance is concerned. Keeping a hotel 'ship-shape' is a challenge to many hotels but not this one! Everything is well maintained and everything works!

Villa Makassar,Sara B wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Beautiful Oasis in the medina,Spent a wonderful and relaxing week at Villa Makassar with my sister. We were looking for a quiet place to unwind and we did! It was an oasis of calm hidden in the narrow streets of the busy and noisy Medina. Villa Makassar is very well located: close to the airport and walking distance to places to visit (20-30 mn to Jma el Fna square - if you find your way). The art deco design and furniture are beautiful and zen. At our arrival we were given the choice between two Junior Suites. Both of them were inviting and one had a private Jacuzzi but we decided to stay in the Junior Suite on the ground floor which was more spacious. There was always a nice fragrance of orange and cinnamon in the room and it was very clean. The welcome and service was excellent everyone was very friendly and most helpful. At the reception we were also helped with very good recommendations of places to visit and eat.    The spa with its traditional Hammam was a unique experience (get prepared to leave with brand new skin...) followed by a great massage.    The food at the restaurant was delicious and the breakfast varied and generous and it was still served quite late too which was an advantage. It was excellent to have breakfast on the beautiful roof terrace which became our favorite place. From there you can admire the view to the roofs and snowy mountains soak the sun or read in the shade. We had 25-30 Celsius in March...    We can only recommend this place!

Villa Makassar,Julia L wrote a review Apr 2017,40,5 stars for staff and the service!!!!!,We booked 5 nights at Villa Makassar through Prestigia a website that offers luxurios hotels for good deals. I will start with the only downside I can find because the rest of the stay was lovely. Villa Makassar advertises to be a five star boutique hotel. That is not 100% percent accurate. While there are some rooms that surely meet the expectations of a five star stay our first room did not. It was a small room that did not have enough storage space for two people which lead us to have cosmetics on the floor the installations were beautifully designed but they need some renovation.  Now to the good part:First off when we expressed that we were disapointed in our room Julie the manager did everything to change our room and even upgraded us. Although we could not upgrade us the same day she offered us a suite for the next day which was very nice! Suites are lovely at Villa Makassar you will enjoy it a lot. This leads me to the staff at Villa Makassar: The people working here are amazing! I was stung by a bee and my face was swelling over night. I went to see the night manager because I needed Ibuprofen to stop imflamation. He asked an employee to bring one from home which was so helpful. Thank you so much!!!!!! Also when we went on day trips to the souks or to Ouzoud Waterfalls they were waiting for us with refreshments the instant we came back. (I still don t know how they did it!) Our room was cleaned twice a day! Fruit was waiting for us on our first night when we arrived late. Everyone in the hotel was super friendly helpful and funny! If you need any information and recommendation be sure to ask! If you are a design lover you will love this place it is full of 1920s sculptures and furniture! We didn t manage to eat there but heard that the dinner is very good! The hotel also offered free airport transport which was extremly helpful given we arrived so late.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Barcelona, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliakY7209GH
Villa Makassar,Nicholas B wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Great stay,Just back from a 4 night stay at Villa Makassar. We were impressed before we arrived to be offered a complimentary transfer from the airport by email and that level of service continued throughout our stay. The Riad really is an oasis of calm - it is set around a 20 minute walk from Jma el Fna square which means it is away from all the noise and pesky tat-sellers. In fact the walk back from the square in an evening or even in the early morning gives you a great insight into local Marrakech life - within a few minutes there is an egg seller (with caged chicken laying eggs) a butcher (we saw a local pick a live chicken which was then butchered) and a fuel seller (with a great pile of coal and lots of gas canisters to match!)    Anyway I digress!    Villa Makassar is art deco in style and as mentioned in some previous reviews the rooms can be a little dark however this did not bother us. We had the Grande Suite - extremely spacious with it's own balcony looking over the central courtyard. There is a large bath and shower (which wasn't too powerful but was adequate). The air conditioning did a great job keeping us cool in the 32 degree heat.    Room service left a jasmine oil (we think) burner in the room after leaving and this meant that you came back to a really refreshing scent - lovely touch.    Breakfast is Moroccan/Continental style and we took to having it on the rooftop in the morning when it was still quite cool.    The riad has a Hammam and I had a body scrub which was a refreshing (though rough) experience!    During our stay we had an issue with an external hotel where they were hounding us for money they thought we owed them - the villa staff were very helpful in this regard and we could not have managed the situation without them - again great service from Villa Makassar!

We did find the rooms we stayed in a bit too dark for my liking but then it is a Art Deco Riad which we were aware of when we booked. The roof terrace is beautiful ( shame the swimming pool was down stairs and not on the roof) well equipped with lots of single and double sun beds plus dining areas which was great for breakfast and dinner or some where to chill with a glass of wine. We were served complimentary Virgin Mojitos a couple of times whilst sun bathing which was a lovely surprise. We ate dinner twice here and the food was excellent as was the presentation.  There isn't any real negatives to the Villa perhaps a coffee machine in the rooms would be a bonus though having said that we booked a hot air balloon ride and had to be up at 5.30 they had coffee and a light breakfast waiting for us before we left.

The food at the restaurant was top class. The chateaubriand is not to be missed.

In line with many of my previous reviews it is the service which makes this place stand out.    Starts with airport pick up (included) where because of an easy jet c##k up our arrival was one hour later as they had not added summertime plus the 1 hour queue on morrocan immigrations (do prepare for this) and our lift just waited till we were there... also no atms in the airport- beware.    Check in was a relaxed atmosphere and despite being 10.30 we got the full Makassar experience- minted green tea pastries and some time to take in the villa - it is stunning a Art Deco jewel and generally well presented.    Next to that they kept the chef in in case we wanted dinner (we did) and it was lovely- freshly cooked to order- steak ( medium rare for me 9/10) and tangine for my wife 7/10 after trying some others excellent product quality which you won t get in town but the day long smouldering in a wood fire is missing if you have it in a restaurant....  Desserts were well presented but sweeeeeet something we would learn ""normal"" in a country where they put sugar on their savoury pies...  All day breakfast served wherever you might want it- great! Service a bit slower than in Europe but you are on holiday...    Next morning the lady on reception was very helpful showing us were we were on the map the main sights made dinner recommendations and gave me some helpful advice regarding my restaurant ideas- no attempts on any upsell again full marks    The villa is in the Kasbah quarter and as others said in a perfect position close to the manic centre but away from it enough.... few taxi drivers know it but as they seem to struggle with other addresses too it might be a professional rather than property issue.    The building is a maze and you walk from one stunning antique furnished room to the next numerous courtyards with water features make outdoor space for warmer days  We mainly enjoyed the roof terrace from which the Atlas Mountains can be seen a green oasis of calm    We had booked a junior suite (room 5) which was tastefully decorated but perhaps a bit dark for my taste ( I accept this fits with the Art Deco theme) but I would prefer brighter rooms this would also make them look bigger (the room was quite narrow and long) overall Sam and storage more than sufficient  Please note that the furnishings are genuine antiques and therefore not spec' d to current norms and our bed was a bit wobbly (as long as you just sleep in it....)  Stylish bathroom with some water pressure and temperature issues at time - here perhaps less techs oversized rainfall heads with something more apt to the local supplies might be better - this not to be critical but as I gave five stars I need to put in perspective.

It was a clean comfortable and stylish room with a sunken jacuzzi style bathtub in the middle of the floor. Whilst it was wonderful for a relaxing soak in the evening it wasn't entirely practical for a quick shower before heading out in the morning.    The location is on the outskirts of the medina which we really liked as it was far enough away from the craziness of the souks but still within walking distance.    We had a wonderful breakfast every morning in the rooftop bar area. Each day was a little different with breads fruits eggs Moroccan tea. The homemade yogurt was amazing.    The staff are wonderful genuinely friendly and can't do enough to help you. They helped us to arrange a wonderful anniversary dinner arranged us a driver on a number of occasions and do so without being intrusive.    The spa was also nice and we treated ourselves to a hammam.    The hotel was fairly quiet during our stay which made it feel like a real oasis.

Villa Makassar,florencegane wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Heaven/Paradis,"We stayed 5 nights at the Villa Makassar and we can honestly say it was the best experience we have ever had in a hotel. Definetly the highlight of our 5 days in Morocco and here is why :    1 - The hotel itself is absolutely stunning : the decor is tastefully done and you can tell that it is well maintained and cleaned. Every where you look nothing is out of place. The atmosphere is relaxing and you can hear the birds sing in the morning. Fluffy day beds are waiting for you on the roof terrace as well as fresh towels.    2- We were upgraded into the most beautiful suite of the hotel because the heating wasnt working in our room : the suite was gorgeous and possibly the size of our 2 Bedroom flat in London !! :) Had a huuudge bathtub made in traditional stone which could host my boyfriend and I at the same time easily !! True relaxation. Again nothing out of place or ""dirty"" or broken. The room was cleaned every day and incent was burning when we came back : divine !    3- YOU HAVE TO TRY THE SPA !!! We booked a pack that included hammam scrub mask and massage and it was the BEST spa experience of my life ! I consider myself extremely difficult to please on that matter and this one did not disappoint. The only downer was my massage I did not enjoy it my masseuse was not very experienced. But my boyfriend LOVED his so he had better luck that me. The star of the show if definetely the hammam/scrub/body mask part. Heavenly and thouroughly executed by our therapist.    4- The are not enough words to thank the staff of the Villa : from the day we got there to the day we left we were treated like royalty. A few examples : our suitcases were carried for us in our room mint tea and pastries were served while we were checking in the concierge offered to post our post cards for us as we could not find stamps on a Sunday we were upgraded instantly to the best room they could offer the lovely cleaning ladies were always smiling the restaurant manager noticed I liked a certain pancake so the next day he had some made for me I didnt even ask ! Everyone was lovely caring and discreet. We really felt at home.    5- The location of course is great located in the Kasbah (old jewish district) it is 5-15 min away from the main attractions. It is in a local area so not touristy at all. Locals generally mind their own business and pay no attention to you. Beware of the motorcycles !!

Villa Makassar,MaYuGuo wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Art Deco paradise in Marrakech,Villa Makassar is a boutique hotel located in the Kasba area of the medina. Location is great as it is out of the main touristic area but you can walk to the main square and some of the attractions in 10 to 15 minutes. This is an important point as Marrakech Medina is notorious for people getting lost in.  Villa Makassar is an Art Deco themed hotel with many antique furniture. The design is of great taste evocative of the 1920's and 1930's style. Every room is unique with a link to the period. As we came from Shanghai we were upgraded to the Sassoon suite (picture enclosed).  Service in Villa Makassar is the highest level and very attentive. They also have a restaurant that served us the best tajin we had in Morocco. This is highly recommended for Art Deco fans or anybody looking for a great hotel to enjoy Marrakech,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Shanghai, China",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaYuGuo

I didn't see the standard rooms but the decoration of the Riad is particularly stylish. More so than any other we've stayed at in Marrakesh.    The location is pretty good. It's set to the south of the city but you can walk to the souks in 10-15 mins.    There was some building work going on next door which was a little unfortunate as we ended up going out to avoid the noise so check with the owner before booking.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benstopford

Comfortable quiet spacious rooms with modern bath facilities a roof with an incredible view and amenities galore left us very satisfied and happy. Hotel staff was incredibly helpful and very polite at all parts of our stay - especially the lady at the front desk (I'm sorry I forgot your name!). 5 stars!    We did the hammam downstairs (for a fairly reasonable price) and that's a special treat too.    While a little bit of a walk from the main square/attractions it's nothing unreasonable and the proximity to Clock Cafe (a must go) is fantastic!

Villa Makassar,Sophia Wright wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Mini honeymoon break at the Villa Makassar,We stayed at the Villa Makassar for our mini honeymoon break a week after we got married.  We had booked this Riad based on the great reviews we had seen on trip advisor  previously and it most definitely lived up to the reviews.  Firstly when we arrived at the airport we were greeted by a complimentary private taxi to the Riad which was a great touch.  When we arrived at the Riad the staff were very welcoming and even upgraded us to a suite as we had just got married.  The Riad was clean and had some great Art Deco decor once you stepped out of the villa you are in the heart of the old town which is a culture shock but you really get to experience 'real' Marrakesh.  The complimentary breakfast was great and was a mixture of western and moroccan breakfast was served wherever and when we wanted before 11am. This was a great option as one day we had to wake up early to go on an excursion and they arranged the breakfast to be served in our suite.  Overall our stay at the Villa Makassar was great the location is perfect for exploring the old town but once you step into this beautiful Riad you are in your own oasis away from all the hassle and bustle of the town. We would definitely stay here again only criticism was the occasional drain smell in our room. This did not last long and would not put us off staying here again.

We were greeted with delicious mint tea and the warm radiant smile of Siham the manager who offered our choice of three different rooms. The villa has been carefully designed with much attention to detail to create an ambiance of comfort and luxury. The staff were consistently attentive but never overbearing and we felt perfectly welcome throughout our stay.    We also had a spa treatment during our time there which was a good experience. Our only suggestion would be to have a male available as well for the massage part (though we did book this service last minute so it might be available normally). The masseuse did her job well but we both are pretty strong guys and it would take a quite a lot more muscle to work the tension out of our backs. The hammam experience was wonderful!    We had high expectations for a getaway in Marrakech and Villa Makassar exceed them.

We asked for changing room because we didn't want jacuzzi and they transferred our baggage and everything while we were out traveling.    Two of us didn't feel well 'cause of a bad orange juice in Jamma el Fna so the stuff were considerate and heedful and treat us very good.

Having all travelled extensively and experienced top hotels in the past the bespoke service provided at Villa Makassar rivalled that of previous experiences.    All staff were committed to making our stay as special as possible. Particular examples of this were the initial welcome and discussion over our plans with the owner offering to confirm reservations and arrange transport a surprise birthday tea including cake for the birthday girl and even a surprise visit from the manager who came to the restaurant that we were dining at especially to wish us goodbye personally.    Meal timings are flexible and the answer to many of our questions were ""as you wish."" This really summed up the experience. All staff were happy to make us happy and if that meant breakfast at 3pm then so be it!

Villa Makassar,Mel wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Style for miles,In startling contrast to the chaos of the streets of Marrakesh you walk through the arched polished entrance and you are immediately transported into another place and time. You have seen the pictures you know that it’s an Art Deco riad – but what is staggering is the attention to detail. Round every corner is something beautiful and unique from the roof terrace with bespoke furniture to the accoutrements that decorate every facet of the building.    We had the Rodchenko room and as far as Russian Constructivism goes it's probably not the most adaptable of art movements in terms of interior design but the prints were cool and the room was neat and had a sense of whimsy that I love.    This isn’t the luxury of say Royal Mansour it isn’t the price tag either – but this is the luxury of pure fantasy. Where the ambient jazz floats through the courtyard and you can sit in the reading room and imagine the ghosts of artists and writers sipping from highball glasses. The staff were also very friendly and so helpful from reception to housekeeping. We were bought cold drinks when sat by the pool and some snacks while we enjoying the evening on the roof terrace. They even brought over the biggest club sandwich known to the human race one evening nice touch. I only wish I could have taken a tour round the whole building to enjoy every bit.    The world is a big place and I’m not sure I will be going to Marrakesh again but if I did would I go back to Villa Makassar?

Villa Makassar,Ghizala S wrote a review Sep 2016,50,"Amazing, beautiful and tranquil Riad",I booked this riad after reading the reviews on here. The villa is located in the Kasaba area of Marrakech it's not too far from the hussle and bustle of Jemil al Efna square.    We arrived at 11 in the morning as we had a very early flight from Gatwick the hotel staff were so lovely and welcoming. We were offered breakfast whilst our room was being prepared this was such a lovely gesture as we had arrived earlier than the check in time.  The Riad is very deceiving from the outside but inside it is very spacious and light we ended up changing rooms as we wanted a room that had a shower. The manager was very gracious and allowed us to pick the room we wanted from the ones that were available. All the staff in the hotel were lovely and were always more than happy to help. Mr Mahmood and Mr Yousif couldn't do enough to help us and we're always on hand if we needed anything. The rooms were cleaned everyday sometimes even twice a day. The moment you enter through the doors your senses are greeted by lovely music and the smell of orange blossom. The breakfast area is beautiful and the breakfast is delicious we were served traditional breakfast every day and we enjoyed it.  I really can't fault this place it is ideal if you are looking for a peaceful quite place that offers you personal care and service.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GhizalaS

The beauty of this place lies in the warmth and welcome of the staff the calm atmosphere attention to detail and almost above all the discretion of the whole place and the people that work in it.  They don't enforce themselves on you - no rigid dining times no fuss out of sight but always available if you need anything and only too keen to help.  The hotel itself is even more than the pictures. You have to be in it to appreciate the detail and thought that went into lovingly recreate this art deco era.

Villa Makassar,renusaini9 wrote a review Aug 2016,20,Not a 5* in the slightest - needs an overhaul,I booked this hotel as a surprise to my husband for our wedding anniversary after reading the reviews. We arrived late in the evening and were upgraded to a large suite which was very nice of them. We were shown to our room and it was boiling and had a sewage smell which we told the porter. The air-conditioning did not work and after over an hour of trying to sleep in the room we had to move to another room- this time one with two single beds - hardly ideal for a couple there to celebrate their anniversary. We appreciate that things can go wrong but I was shocked the next day when despite calling the manager and asking her to sort it out she sent up a guy that wasn't an engineer (he pressed the same button we pressed all night and admitted it wasn't workingeven though I asked to speak to her and for her to come up she didn't. Eventually that day we were moved to a third room - by this point we didn't care that it was dark we were just glad the air-conditioning was working. I think the hotel air conditioning just doesn't run well as we also had a fan on every day.    The rooms were clean and nicely decorated although the shower didnt work properly and I was shocked that the duvet was not changed daily. I noticed on one evening that the duvet cover that was changed had blood on it - not very nice and so we didn't use a duvet all night and left it on the floor. The next day the duvet was picked up with the same cover and put on our bed. That was horrible and my husband went to reception to ask for a change which I am glad they did quickly.    There was a gentleman there that was lovely! He arranged our breakfast every morning and was incredibly helpful. He has the true makings of a good manager and I am sad to say was more helpful and attentive than the manger herself. He arranged a cake for us on our actual anniversary which was lovely and was so helpful trying to find a memory card and suggesting things we could do. He truly made us feel welcome and nothing we asked him was a problem for him - he is the reason we have given an extra star to what we would have. He truly is an asset to the place.    I also have to say that the restaurant was not open on the days we were there- we were told that there would be room service but of the 3 times I asked on the day I was told either that there was no food or that the kitchen was closed. I have never been to a 5* place that has no food. The saddest thing was on the day we asked it was our anniversary so we were looking forward to a romantic anniversary dinner - in the end we went to La Mamounia (which I have reviewed) and on the first day we asked about food we were referred to the hotel next-door which was lovely (again reviewed separately the les Jardins de le medina). To make it worse on our return to the hotel the owner was having a feast with his family - that is pretty shocking.    Personally I do not think this is by any means a 5* hotel - 4 at best and a good 3*. If they open the restaurant adjust the air-conditioning and make it a little more lively I think this could be a good place but until then I would not personally recommend staying here. It is hard to find (almost every cab driver struggled to know where it was) and the local area isn't amazing. Lastly I think that the manager needs to step up and act like one. On one occasion my husband walked into the reception to find her asleep on the sofa - talk about unprofessional. She expects her team to do everything whereas she should take it upon herself to help guests.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renusaini9
Villa Makassar,PW76 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Art Deco Delights,I’d seen Villa Makassar featured in a recent Telegraph article of the ‘ Top 10: best riad hotels in Marrakech’ so it was great when i discovered they had (affordable) availability for a trip to celebrate my 40th Birthday!    It’s in a great location - in the Kasbah quarter within the walls of the medina - near the Saadian Tombs and the royal palaces (not that you can see much of that besides the outer walls) which allowed us a more authentic experience of Marrakech rather than being stuck on the outskirts of the city in a ‘tourist compound’ and having to be shuttled in/out of the city. When we first arrived we were slightly concerned if we’d ever find our way back to its front door through the winding local streets but the local Kasbah mosque was a useful local landmark and Jemaa el Fna square is a 15-20 minute walk away - whilst trying to avoid the local scooters!    During our stay there was only 1 other couple there (maybe as it was Ramadan) and we were kindly offered a free room upgrade. We also had free wifi in the room and our first access to the downstairs Hammam and Jacuzzi were included in our stay - though i’d recommend trying the Hammam Ritual Makassar experience along with a ‘refreshing’ dip in the courtyard pool.    The hotel has a really nice relaxed vibe and is gorgeous aesthetically - with quirky art deco furnishings and architectural details mixed with luxurious modern comforts. The staff were very accommodating (even making me a surprise birthday cake) and also arranged our airport transfers and a driver for when we wanted to sample some local restaurants that were further away - i’d recommend Comptoir Darna La Maison Arabe and Dar Cherifa. We didnt eat in the hotel restaurant but (as well as my tasty cake) we enjoyed the daily breakfasts which you can wherever you wish - your room courtyard restaurant or up on the sun soaked roof terrace.

From arrival to departure we were always treated with exquisitely attentive yet discreet care. I'm an avid swimmer and each day I had the pool to myself followed by late afternoons or early evenings on the roof top deck with a glass of Moroccan rose and olives. After a full day of activities either sight seeing in the Medina or day trips to the Atlas Mountains or beach it was always a pleasure to return to this property. We were upgraded to the lovely Chambre Rousseau at no extra charge which came with a balcony overlooking the interior court yard. Breakfasts were always well thought out and varied with ample freshly squeezed orange juice coffee yogurt and a variety of sweet cakes crepes and Moroccan bread with butter and preserves. As other reviewers have indicated the property is conveniently situated to important tourist sites and reasonable walking distance to the central square. We arranged for a trip to the Ourika Valley in the Atlas Mountains and to the coastal town of Essaouira through the Villa Makassar and were pleased with the price quality of the driver vehicle and guides.

Besides the awkward showers/bath experience we loved this place. Youssef (Maître D') had all the answers and took great care of us every morning making sure we had what we needed for our day out.

Villa Makassar,Ashid S wrote a review May 2016,40,Fabulous Moroccan Gem!,This boutique Art Deco style hotel is in the old town about 20 minute walk to the main square and the souks. It's ideally placed for exploring the old narrow streets. If you get lost (like we did) look out for cafe clock. It is just down the same street from there.    We loved the fact that the raids are located on unassuming little streets which hide expansive little gems like this hotel behind a large door that opens out directly on to the street.    The hotel has around 11 rooms all decorated in a unique style. We stayed in room 4 which was narrow but long and had a nice large bathroom. The room was generally comfortable but we found the bed a little too firm (I guess we were being a little too picky). The hotel arranged for some extra layers of mattress toppers to make the bed more comfortable which did the job.    The breakfast is traditional Moroccan and there is no choice offered on what you are given in terms of breads and pastries. You do however get a choice of eggs and coffee or teas. Yousef is an absolute star and always has a smile and a welcoming words to start your morning.    The restaurant Le Makkasar was listed on the best restaurant guide we were given on check-in but the restaurant was mostly empty. We tried it for dinner one night. Being vegetarian the check prepared 3 exceptional courses that were not listed on the menu. These paired with an excelled selection of wine. Of course the restaurant is not as cheap as eating out in other restaurants in Marrakech but we thoroughly enjoyed it. Well done chef.    Whilst we had dinner the talented in house musician/ maitre d'hotel Ismail sung a number of songs in English making the experience special.    The pool area is small and enclosed by high wall which offers privacy but restricts sunshine. The water was quite cold but we enjoyed the swim in the heat.    Our package included a 30 minute hammam (steam room) and jacuzzi visit. The hammam traditionally includes a scrub however we were told the free access was self service only which was mildly disappointing. We were not offered an option to upgrade for the scrub. My wife also had a pedicure (paid for) at the spa which was average (she found it all little unhygienic compared to what she was used to as the implements such as the foot file had been used previously and didn't look very clean). This may be something for the spa to reconsider and is the only reason for the 4* rating I have given for an otherwise excellent hotel.    Overall it was a lovely 4 night stay in a great location. If you get a chance try the cafe clock. This is a community cafe which has regular evening local performances and events. It's nice to get a glimpse of local culture and hang out with the locals.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashids

This riad is situated on one of the larger streets about a 15 minute stroll from the main square. A great option if you have never been to Marrakech before. The building is spacious and very well appointed throughout. The staff are pleasant and helpful. The food is excellent and they have a very good wine list. It is more expensive than other options but you get what you pay for. The wifi is generally good beds are comfortable bathrooms are unusual. We stayed on the top floor it was quiet and chic. My only criticism is the lighting is minimal or low level which is lovely at night but a bit annoying in the day. We didn't use the pool but did use the roof terrace. The sun beds are super comfy! It's a lovely space. We used the spa and had the most amazing massage at a great price! I didn't like the little boxed fish tanks in the ceiling it was upsetting for me to see these lonely goldfish without any plants or other stimulation.

Villa Makassar,gericka wrote a review Apr 2016,50,diamond in the rough,You walk up to this huge unsuspecting door and you wonder where on earth has the taxi guy taken us! But open the doors to a little gem of a hotel... luxurious sophisticated stylish tranquil. perfect for little romantic getaway or just to be close to the city centre for some site seeing. Everything is walking distance or a really short cab ride from here get lost in the maze of souks in Jemaa el Fna and the billions of stalls the colourful YSL Jardin Majorelle El Badi Palace and Koutoubia Mosque or just take in the history and architecture in the medina.    Our room was on the second floor looking into the little riad. Throughout the day it had a flock of sparrows fly in and out of the branches of the trees really enchanting. Room was clean cool our bed was massive and comfy it was beautifully decorated but bit dark. Quiet at night. Roof garden is cute and tranquil had comfy loungers and gets some great sun.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gericka
Villa Makassar,a f wrote a review Apr 2016,50,An amazing place with brilliant staff.,My wife and i stayed at Villa Makassar for 3 nights and really didnt want to leave. It was a special weekend away as was my wifes 40th birthday so we wanted a perfect weekend. We read the reviews but didnt expect the reviews to be exceeded. I cannot recommend this place enough. A very nice driver collected us from the airport and took us to the door where we were greeted by such a nice man (we were in awe of the place so forgot his name!). The room was amazing we were offered a choice of 2. We wanted to make the most of our stay so had advised Juliette in advance and she advised us on a city guide and a guided tour of the atlas mountains. Our guide of the city was called Abdul and he was a complete gentleman who educated us on marrakesh and the history of morocco as well as an insight into the people and places it really was not what we were expecting and was a fantastic way of spending a few hours; we learnt a lot. We were wary of wandering around marrakesh on our own as we had listened to too many people our experience was that the people are lovely but it can be intimidating late at night but what city isnt. We arranged for a guide to take us to the atlas mountains his name was Idris and was such a lovely man it felt like a friend had taken us out for the day. He showed us places that tourists wouldnt usually visit and gave yet another insight into this amazing place i fully recommend a guided tour from Idris. The staff at the hotel were amazing very relaxed but catered to every need without any fuss. Yusef the waiter always had a smile on his face and was so welcoming in everything we asked for. The hamman spa experience is not to be missed! We are going to try and recreate this at home. Our only regret is that we should have stayed longer but that will happen next time.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6645CHadamf

Villa Makassar,Jo B wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Lovely place and amazing staff,Pros:  Beautiful communal areas sophisticated and chic;  Lovely roof terrace with sun beds to lounge around on;  Staff amazing so friendly and helpful;  Good location just south of the medina but within reach of all the main central areas;  Food in the restaurant very good and breakfast was simple Moroccan style but always very tasty;  Free wifi    Cons:  Rooms were small (we had a prestige room) and dark;  The layout of the rooms could've been better - eg no plug near mirror to use hair dryer lacked storage space;  Rooms were very noisy and not sound proofed enough so we were woken several times during the night and early morning by birds or people moving round the villa;  Pool was lovely but surrounded by high walls so the sun couldn't reach it when we were there so not warm enough for a swim - probably fine in high summer;  Service was very slow eg on the roof terrace there was a bar that was supposed to be open all day from 10am but there was never anyone there to take orders and consequently you had to go down to reception to ask for someone to take an order for lunch or drinks and would have to wait 30-40minutes for someone to arrive - this is a shame as the staff were all so lovely and helpful when they did arrive so can only assume that there weren't enough staff ?    That said we had a really good time and would recommend this villa despite the points raised above. It was also pretty well priced for what you got. If they can address some of the cons then it really could be the perfect place!,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V6414VDjob
Villa Makassar,Bolen wrote a review Mar 2016,50,AMAZING ART DECO GEM IN THE KASBAH,My wife and I stayed five nights in this amazing hideaway in the heart of the Kasbah. Everything about Villa Makassar if first rate. The place itself is brilliantly designed and perfectly furnished. Everything is spectacular original Art Deco. Our deluxe suite was a massive room off an open-air courtyard. We had our own terrace and a giant bath. The room was filled with fine art and furniture. The staff provided personal caring service. They went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. Thank you Claudine Josef and Rabi. Highlights were breakfasts and dinners in the Riad's restaurant a deluxe Hammam in the spa and quiet moments on the rooftop terrace. Also the location is excellent. Just a short walk to Marrakech's main square through ancient streets and alleys brimming with local life and colour. If you like old-style service and comfort in an artistic setting you will truly enjoy this gem in the heart of the Medina.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ottawa, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bolen
Villa Makassar,ekf74 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,I would move here tomorrow (if it weren't for the rest of Marrakech),This is one of the most meticulously curated hotels I have ever been in. There are no corners cut anywhere. The design is beautiful the decor superb the customer service over the top. After a long day fighting your way through the souk this place feels like paradise. But even if it were in Paris it would still feel like paradise. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Villa Makassar,Simon wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Beyond 5 Stars.... Best Hotel I've ever stayed at.,"There is so much to share about this well hidden jewel under the African sun. I have stayed in some spectacular and unique hotels all around the world but this is something even more memorable.    So I invite you to sit back dear reader to relax and perhaps pour yourself a glass of wine and allow me to indulge you with the tale the Villa Makassar from the perspective of a couple of English travellers.    Your experience of the hotel starts long before you start packing as they mail you to enquire if they can assist you in arranging airport transfers and confirming your travel details. Not an automated spreadsheet no sir a warm and personally typed note from the owner.    When one arrives at Marrakesh from London becomes acutely aware that the world looks somewhat different one drives down large avenues lined with gardens and palm trees then with hardly a warning the car veers off into a tiny gateway in the sandy covered wall signalling that you have entered the 1000 year old Medina. After driving past King Mohammed VI's humble abode the car squeezes into a tiny lane and abruptly stops outside a large and ornate door.    With some trepidation you crack open the door and something remarkable happens your eyes struggle to adapt to the dimmed lighting in the gorgeous entrance hallway. You are ushered into the sumptuous lounge sink into the feature sofas and check in commences.    The staff look after every detail and immediatley start to ""fix"" things excursions reservations transfers. Nothing is too much. We were most privileged to have an opportunity to discuss our trip intentions with the owner over Arabic Pastries and a glass or two of Mint Tea. A more kind informative and warm person you will not meet. He took time to answer our every question to alert us to the latest street scams (there are many in the Kasbah and in the main square) and to help us to understand the correct costs of standard things like taxi fares etc.    You are then given a tour of the entire walled hotel (essentially 2 x quadrangles a huge roof terrace and bar a small plunge pool and the restaurant and kitchens). The spa is under the main quadrangle and is worth a look just to feast your eyes on a stunning example of interior design. Another interesting feature is the ""fish tank"" kitchen. There is no part of the spotlessly clean kitchen or any food preparation that cannot be witnessed from the square.    There are 2 classes of room each individual in every respect and following a tour of the entire hotel you are shown your room and briefed on its features.    The decor is magical with subdued lighting stunning furniture delightful art deco design features and object d'art cleverly arranged to magnify the experience. The bathroom is gorgeous with a huge feature shower and in our case the most stunning towel rail (it was elliptical shaped and stored the towels as well as warming them) as well as a heated floor. Naturally there is WIFI throughout which enabled us to be able to have a video call with our children from the Kasbah!    A lovely nights sleep is followed by a relaxed breakfast with the warmest and most considerate service. We had local Breads/Pastries/yoghurt with fresh orange juice and tea.    Now my dear friends some of you are a little more focussed on the self indulgent practices than I am but with some gentle coercing I was convinced to try the spa package at the hotel. I was washed steamed scrubbed (and I mean every inch of my hide!) oiled rinsed and then massaged. We had the spa package as a couple and it was such a treat. The hotel had arranged a BIG day for us with a day long excursion into the mountains (a ""must see"" dear friends) followed by a spa treatment then a dinner at the hotels excellent restaurant (more of that later). The spa is sumptuously arranged and the tepidorium has a remarkable feature of ceiling fish tanks....    After a brief interlude to put on some fresh clothes we descended to the restaurant for dinner and were treated to the best of Morocco and washed down with a surprisingly good local drop of vino. The food and service were Michelin star standard and to be frank it was like finding a discrete dining room being run by the staff from the Savoy grill.    If you have any doubt of the ability or intent of the staff let me assure you that they are totally focussed on making your stay something magical. As we went to depart our local tour company messed up our airport transfer we had limited currency left and our stress levels were rising like a Russian space rocket. Claudine the manager quickly arranged a cab paid on account and took payment from me via card. We arrived on time and with a sensation that we had never really been in any jeopardy.    When you think about it that is the most precious feeling a hotel can impart to a guest.    To the Owner and staff Sam and I would like to express our sincere thanks you made a long weekend into the trip of a lifetime I even heard the phrase ""This has been the best day of my entire life"" from my partner after the day that the hotel arranged for us. We cannot express more heartfelt admiration.",Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sumoman
Villa Makassar,Jessica M wrote a review Feb 2016,40,A peaceful retreat in beautiful Marrakech,My husband and I stayed here in February 2016 for three nights and absolutely loved our stay. It was our first trip to Marrakech and we wanted to experience the hustle and bustle of the Medina whilst having a little piece of calmness to return to each day.    The Riad is on a quiet street and very well located to the main square in the medina (10-12 minutes walk) inside it is spacious and calm. The art deco style is lovely and offers something different. You can see how much time and effort has been spent furnishing the hotel/riad to absolute perfection.    The bedrooms are lovely although a little on the dark side. There is a wonderful roof terrace and spa.    The service we received was absolutely fantastic. Everyone was so friendly we booked 2 guides through the front desk - one to take us through the medina and souks and another to take us to the Atlas Mountains both guides were wonderful and very well chosen by the hotel.    We only ate breakfast at the hotel and all other meals we had out although had we have stayed for more than three nights we certainly would have eaten in one night. The breakfast was lovely; you don't order anything instead they'll bring you a section of fruits local delicacies breads pancakes etc. and freshly squeezed juices. The restaurant manager remembered what drinks we asked for on our first morning (breakfast tea and fresh fruit smoothie) and always made sure they were ready for us each morning at breakfast.    I have removed a star for two reasons; firstly as already mentioned the room was too dark - understandably the style of lamps chosen were reflective of the art deco style but it would have been useful if they'd included more of them as the low lighting made it difficult to read (and apply make up with confidence) :-)    Secondly; wifi was an issue - it only works in the restaurant lounge area and lobby it does't work in any of the bedrooms. For three nights it was actually rather refreshing not getting caught up in the digital world when we were in our bedroom but because it was our first time in Marrakech we needed to come down to the lounge area quite often to check locations of restaurants reviews local maps etc.    All in all it was a truly wonderful experience and we absolutely loved Marrakech. We will definitely be back.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jessica_tdn

On arrival we were welcomed with traditional Moroccan tea and told about excursions available before given a tour of the hotel and finally being shown to our room - what a fantastic start!    Our room was compact but had everything we needed for a four night stay including a large shower and bath robes both of which are a thumbs up from me.    The hotel staff could not have been friendlier and were so attentive to your every need nothing was too much. They arranged all our tours and the providers were all great.    We tested out the Hammam/Sauna and the Jacuzzi plus I had a facial and a massage in the spa which were both lovely.

If you are into style and architecture of the Wiener Werkstätten and the Bauhaus you will find an amazing riad not only in references in its style but also in a grand collection of ´little masterpieces´. Reminds of a sophisticated home. Taken into account that this kind of atmosphere needs some space it is preferable to take on of the suites.

We stayed in room 7 on the top floor and aside from the TV only working for French channels for some strange reason it was very clean spacious and comfortable.

Everywhere one notices the thought that has gone into the fine detailing. Service was brilliant and the Hammam jaccuzzi was provided free although due to the heat I nearly passed out after only 10 minutes because my heart was racing dangerously and I felt very faint.

Villa Makassar,Chris M wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Amazing service and attention to detail with a willing smile,It was my wife's 50th birthday and she wanted to go to Marrakesh and I wanted it to be special. I did all the booking in secret and got an immediate and helpful response to my online booking.  When we arrived it was the smell that first lifted our mood - orange blossom fragrances throughout the hotel. Our luggage was dealt with we were given a tray of exquisite biscuits and mint tea to acclimatise after the journey. Then Ishmael gave us a tour of the hotel's layout and features.  Many of the rooms are themed on great artists and we initially got the Mondrian room which was moody and colourful.  We ate in the hotel that evening and the food was of a very high standard indeed and with a great choice of wines to match (try the Cuvee Presidente red!).  For the next few days Selma and the team ensured that we knew about the main sights looked after our needs and jumped on any problems like a blown light bulb with startling and un-intrusive efficiency.  Breakfast on the roof terrace got us attuned to the day very quickly - shaded against the heat and bright sunshine on the well-designed art deco space. Every breakfast contained fresh and ever-changing local pastries and was delivered with smiles and care.  On the final day we tried the hotel spa. We had no idea what to expect but the well-bring package exceeded anything we could have imagined. It was four hours of total head to toe pampering scrubbing oiling washing and massaging. It was the ideal conclusion to a perfect week in this hot and bustling city.  I cannot praise this hotel and its attentive staff highly enough. It was the little touches the pre-emptive nature of the way we were looked after - you felt akin to royalty for the entire time.  You simply could not imagine a more wonderful way to be looked after in this often daunting and chaotic city. It felt like an oasis and the staff felt like friends.

Villa Makassar,GspotJulian wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Excellent hotel with pleasant helpful staff and the best spa we have had to date A++++,"My wife and I ventured to Marrakesh despite all the negative reviews from both colleagues and the internet. We booked our flight and the Villa Makassar separately and were both more than a little apprehensive following the recent events in Tunisia. Not much choice on carrier so it was a Ryan Air flight. To all those negative reviewers on Marrakesh ""Is there only one Marrakesh?"" The one we went to was welcoming offered adventure and a step out of the box holiday wise. Firstly we were offered free transfer from the airport by the hotel delivered safely to the oasis that is Villa Makassar. We were given tea and local pastries and then a tour of the hotel and all its facilities by the receptionist before being shown to our room. The room more than exceeded our expectations it was beautiful. We ate in the hotel on the first night as we were travel weary. Excellent food excellent staff and impeccably clean. On the first venture out it is easy to get lost as all the streets look the same and you do get people directing you in the wrong direction however get clear directions from the hotel and stick to them you soon get used to the way. We ate out every night and never once had any stomach issues again wet wipes give you an added sense of security. All the food we had was piping hot beers were cold and the street sellers not too imposing although it can be fun if you engage in some bartering. DO NOT TAKE TRAVELLERS CHEQUES! You cannot change them in any of the banks or hotels despite The Post Office in UK recommending them. We had to rely on out bank cards and cash because of it!  On the 2nd day we decided to experience the Spa and went for the steam room and mud treatment face and body massage. It has to be the best we have ever had to date - Thank you to all the spa staff at Villa Makassar you were excellent!!

The roof terrace of the hotel was amazing! absolutely gorgeous and a real sun trap. My only slight complaint was the room was very small and very dark. No main light only lamps and i had to use the torch on my phone to see things in the wardrobe. The room was also very hot overnight.

Villa Makassar,Traveller07_10 wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Tranquil Oasis in Magical Marrakech,We booked for a week's stay at this Riad near the Royal Palace in the southern Casbah area of town. As with other Riads this small hotel entered through an inconspicuous door was very spacious inside with two large 'atriums' complete with water fountain and large olive trees swimming pool Spar and restaurant. The place is decorated/furnished in Art Deco style with beautiful artefacts from across the world. In keeping with this style the rooms are a bit dark though amply lit. The bathroom fittings are modern; in some cases a bit too modern i.e. more form/beauty than function/practicality. The beds are comfortable if tightly fitted into the space; we competed to see who could scramble into bed (from the bottom) first !    The restaurant menu was short and unchanged during the 7 days of our stay; Thereby encouraging us to eat-out more often. A trendy local 'cafe' called 'Clock' was a handy first-day visit; the owner even lending us local cash to tide us over till the next day...an indication of the kindness and welcoming nature of the Moroccan people!!  The lunch/dinner food is beautifully prepared & presented. The breakfasts are joyful; with fresh fruit-juices eggs how-you-like endless tea and coffee AND the most exquisite breads pastries and cakes you could wish-for.....all graciously served by Youssef.    The big plus-point here is the staff: the whole place is run by just a handful of well-trained and dedicated people for whom nothing is too much trouble. We also availed of the Spa facilities especially the Hammam & Scrub Jacuzzi and body massage...all accompanied by the mandatory 'mint tea' and delivered by the friendly and efficient Fatima and Latima.    It is a short taxi ride to the main area of activity: the huge square at Jamaal-El-Fna and the surrounding maze of Souks. The square itself was Eastern magic during the day; with snake charmers (sic) oil&perfume stalls juice-stalls and several cafes...then in the evening turning into a mass of 'fast-food' stalls each hawking their pretty-same Moroccan food of salads grilled meats & fish couscous and tagine.    We availed of the hotel's touring packages each with nice car&driverNooritel : the City Tour which takes-in the original walled Medina and the New Town called just 'Europe'; then a trip into the Atlas mountains including a visit to a genuine Berber village/house and and climb up to waterfalls.    All in all this was just the calm relaxing - but also exciting - break with warmth & sunshine all through that we were looking for.

Villa Makassar,Jimbo2189 wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Wonderful,Such a lovely riad in a quiet corner of the Medina. Great location friendly staff and delicious food. Hotel is amazingly decorated each room has its own individual style with furniture that the manager has collected on his travels (he is lovely and made us feel very welcome). The tajin we had for supper here on our first night was the best on our trip - and we went to some fairly high end restaurants.  The only negatives: as it wasn't peak season the bar on the roof was closed so getting an afternoon drink could be a challenge so we often went to the next door hotel to have a pre supper/afternoon drink. Also the pool area is fairly small which means that if another couple are in there it does feel like your intruding by going for a swim.

Villa Makassar,BEP0426 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,An Elegant Oasis in Marrakech,My brother and I stayed at Villa Makassar in September and it was the highlight of our time in Marrakech! From the moment we set foot inside the walls of this lovely riad we knew we needed to extend our stay - and extend our stay we did! The villa is decorated with beautiful art deco pieces the owner has collected on his travels around the world - and we were lucky enough to chat with him throughout our stay! Each room has its own aesthetic and the vibe throughout the property is peaceful luxury. The villa's location in the Kasbah was close to but a pleasant distance from the craziness of the souks. I was so happy to retreat to our little paradise at the end of each day! The staff was warm caring friendly and professional. We truly felt like we were among family as we ate breakfast on the gorgeous roof terrace or listened to Ismail play the guitar in the evenings. I was sick after our trip to the Sahara and Marion went out of her way to get tea honey and lemon for me. Just what a sore throat needs! We took advantage of the pool and the hammam (the steam room was amazing and everything was spotless!) and felt so lucky to have both within our hotel. Best of all we got upgraded part way through our stay. Thank you Villa Makassar for spoiling us!

Villa Makassar,ivy C wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Beautiful hidden gem hotel with fantastic friendly staff,I stayed at Villa Makkasar with a friend of mine during August. And I would like to say the staffs were absolutely fantastic and friendly. There is not one bad thing I can say about the hotel.    It was so calm and peaceful and if you would like a hideaway from the hustle and bustle this is definitely the place for you. We literally had the terrace to ourselves to freely absorb the sun.    It is still very convenient to get around to places and staffs have always been helpful to arrange taxi on our behalf and provided restaurants and activities recommendations.    Inside the hotel beautiful decor and Art Deco furnitures are found everywhere. Intricate details of our room has really impressed us. If you are a fan of Art Deco interiors be prepare to be taken back of how beautiful everything really is inside the hotel!!    We have also tried the Hammam spa inside the hotel and it was just so relaxing and guest can enjoy the access with privacy which is what I love about the spa.    Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and I would personally stay there again next time I'm in Marakkesh !,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ivytc

The rooms and stay are fine. It is very close to some of the major tourist attractions. My only grouse is that they were giving exorbitant rates for days trips and we had to rely on an external transporter who gave trips at half the price.

The bedroom was lovely - we managed to get upgraded since it was my partner's birthday and the communal areas of the hotel were perfect for relaxing after a day in the souks.

The location is perfect - easy walking distance to everything and I felt secure here every night. We stayed for 3 nights and really appreciate the hospitality demonstrated. I had a minor issue on the final night there and the owner resolved it in an exceedingly fair manner. At night when I came in I would chat about some of my experiences with the guy at the desk (can't remember his name - great guy with a beard) and he would give me ideas on what to do next. I really could not have asked for more from the staff.    Spend some quality time on the rooftop terrace. Fantastic.    Although this Riad is where you should stay I wouldn't recommend it for the hammam (it was alright - not fantastic - I wanted the black soap used and she didn't - there are others that are closer and cheaper). Also - a hammam should be a social experience and this was really really private so perhaps only if you are really shy.    Regarding the restaurant - first night we stayed here the food was fantastic. The last night there the food was mediocre and expensive compared to what is in town. Spend the time and go look for food down the side streets - get recommendations from bearded front desk guy!,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Arlington, Virginia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisae75

We were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived and throughout our stay. Our suite was absolutely beautiful and a very calm serene place to come back after a busy day's sightseeing. You simply wouldn't know that you were in the middle of a bustling  noisy city. There were plenty of other areas to relax in too including a chill out room with a fireplace a roof terrace and a spa.  We ate 3 main meals in the hotel during our stay and very much enjoyed both Morrocan and International food. There was also a good selection of wines. There was a choice of eating in the dining area or on the roof terrace. Both were very pleasant experiences and was accompanied by one of the staff playing guitar. Breakfast was also delicious with local pastries orange juice fresh yogurt and fruits and a choice of eggs. The great thing was that you could ask for breakfast at any time of the day and wherever you wanted to eat it!  We also indulged in a hamman which was excellent and we would have liked to have used the enormous jacuzzi but we ran out of time.  The thing that really stood out for us at this riad was the impeccable service. Everyone was so lovely and courteous but without being overbearing. Nothing was too much trouble and we were always received with a smile.The owners of the riad took a genuine interest in making sure that we were happy and well looked after.

With a lovely roof garden and external courtyards. Our room was cool and beautifully furnished with a lovely ensuite shower room. They had even decorated the room with roses to welcome us.    We ate in the restaurant on the first night and enjoyed a beautifully presented meal which was extremely tasty and well cooked.    We had a hot few days and tried to make use of the pool which was extremely cold and in shade for most of the day. The roof terrace though provided an oasis of tropical heat and calm with showers to cool us off and attentive bar staff when needed.    Great breakfasts which were different on each day and could be taken wherever you wanted it.

Villa Makassar,Paul T wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Boutique Oasis,Villa Makassar is a small luxury Art Deco boutique style hotel / Riad with only 10 rooms. The rooms vary in design light source bath / shower option and size. Some rooms allow ample storage space. Each room is unique stylish and luxurious. Fouad the owner is passionate about his Art Deco collections and designs.    On arrival we were greeted by Noura who is warm welcoming and very approachable. Fouad then personally showed us around; again very personable as are all the staff from front reception (Noura Kaoutar and Ismael) to the waiters chefs and spa ladies. The Hammam spa treatment is a must.    Villa Makassar's recommended tour guide Nouredine (Nour) is great. Definitely worth travelling with him to see the primitive Berber Village and Atlas Mountains.    Special thanks to Rabi Mohamed and Youssef who go out of their way to cater for particular individual needs; they are truly missed. All the staff are accommodating including those behind the scene.    We enjoyed listening to Ismael who plays the guitar and sings during evening meals. Most of the meals were exquisite and varied. The dining area is comfortable and intimate although you can eat wherever you like and whatever time you like including breakfast! A real homely feel throughout.    Villa Makassar is an oasis of calm tucked away from the busy souks yet close enough to walk to most of the authentic attractions in the old town. Other attractions are just a short taxi ride away. Local shops for any essentials are also on the doorstep.    We would certainly recommend Villa Makassar to friends and family.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Farnham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/762pault
Villa Makassar,ChrisFMH wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Superb hidden gem of a hotel,I stayed here for a couple of days for my wifes birthday treat. The hotel (only 10 rooms) is simply superb. A welcoming pot of Moroccan tea greeted us upon arrival. The staff are attentive and ever helpful and the decor is lovely. The hotel even presented my wife with a cake on her birthday - lovely touch. This is a peaceful retreat from the bustling streets of Morocco but only a 15 minute walk to the centre of the Madena. The restaurant is very nice the food delicious and staff helpful. The Spa is a real treat also and I highly recommend the body scrub and massage. Probably the best review I have ever written - and I have written a few bad ones over the years.

Villa Makassar,Kathryn J wrote a review Mar 2015,50,An Oasis in the crazy Medina,When our car arrived at the hotel I though I had mad a big mistake as the area is busy but on entering the Riad we were met with a calm relaxing atmosphere. We were ushered into the sitting room and given tea and pastries after filling in some paper work we were shown round by the owner who is obviously very proud of this place. The deco was superb everything came together. We were shown to our suite Villa Radchenko very well apointed  huge shower very spacious the only fault we had was the bedit was a little on the hard side which we are not used to but apart from that everything was very comfortabe.    The common areas are very well decorated and the music playing really sets the mood.    We ate the first night in the restaurant and the food was suberb very well presented and very tasty the waiter was very attentve and courtious and the local Morrocan wine was excellent. Breakfast the next morning was also very good beautiful pastries and eggs coffee was also very good fresh squeezed orange juice absolutely delicious.    Check out was easy and we were given a free transfer back to the airport.    We didn't use any of the spa facilities but it looked amazing.    Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff here they all made us feel very welcome we were given a pair of lovely slippers each which was a nice touch.    I would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Marrakech and I would stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheffgal
Villa Makassar,Skigrowler wrote a review Mar 2015,40,A nice hotel in a quiet backwater of Marrakech,"We hadn't been to Marrakech and had always wanted to go and recently booked a trip through Secret escapes to Villa Makassar. The hotel frontage was a door through a wall in Old Town which was perturbing to begin with but became one of its charms. In the centre of things this hotel is not but it's only a 15 minute walk to the main square and very close to the palaces and mosques for those more interested in the historic monuments. It is a bit of a trek to new town and the more modern hotels bars and clubs. this is not a hotel for anyone wanting to ""party"".    However as a quiet hotel this place is fantastic. The staff were amazing so friendly and welcoming. The Hammam was great and the prices for food and drink were more reasonable than some of the more renowned hotels. It is decorated in art deco style but with a Moroccan theme. It is a small and quiet hotel but with good sized rooms and interesting decor. Biggest downer for us was that our room didn't have a shower but the bath was spectacular.

When we arrived at Villa Makassar we were met by the owner and shown around the hotel by him he explained where he had picked up the many beautiful pieces of furniture and accessories from he was so proud of his hotel and as well he should be it was a stunning place. The hotel also sorted out our trip to the Atlas Mountains which were spectactular and I was so glad I had packed trainers as it was a little hair raising in places but our wonderful guide helped me and told me where to place my feet! I had a hammam massage that evening in the spa and the lady that did it was lovely  I have never had one before so did not know what to expect but it was thoughly relaxing after our trek up the mountains!.

Villa Makassar,Michael H wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Beautiful,On our first trip to Marrakech we were very lucky to choose Villa Makassar. Situated about 10-15 mins walk from the famous Jemaa el Fna at the south end of the Kasbah district near the old royal palace the riad is an Art Deco project fusing classic Moroccan opulence and the golden age of jazz. The surroundings are very attractive and the rooms comfortable but what really distinguishes the riad is the warmth and kindness of the staff. The restaurant is quite expensive for Marrakech but the quality of the food is excellent - we didn't eat better anywhere else in the city during our trip. Also worth noting is an attractive roof garden with loungers and a bar... a nice oasis to read or take a break from the bustling street life. Our trip was a celbration for a major birthday and we were very kindly upgraded.

This gorgeous Riad is in a perfect location for exploring just 10 mins walk from ""the big square"" (you will hear this phrase a lot when you visit Marrakech!).  From the moment we arrived the staff were so friendly and attentive. Christian the amazing concierge will take all day long to welcome you and show you around the facilities. It really is a recurring feature of everyone you will meet in Marrakech - friendly warm helpful.  This Riad has everything - a beautiful spa downstairs (you MUST try the hammam so beautiful) you can eat anywhere anytime you like and the food is outstanding a gorgeous rooftop terrace for just relaxing in the sunshine.  The reception staff are more than happy to help you with excursions or tours. They organised a guided walking tour for us and it was so worth it because our guide showed us a really authentic side to Marrakech that we might not have otherwise discovered on our own.  Our room was spotless and the bed was super comfortable. each room is individually decorated with unique authentic 1920s décor. There are only 10 rooms in this Riad so it never feels crowded or busy.

In short this was the finest hotel I have ever visited. The decor and opulence of the Hotel can be seen from the photographs but what really sets it apart is the staff and the understated discrete way in which the whole Hotel is operated. Service throughout was exemplary.    One small example being the offer of a suite on our day of leaving to shower before the evening flights this was unexpected and unnecessary but very welcome and an indication of the care and approach taken by the Hotel to guests.

Villa Makassar,Geoff S wrote a review Feb 2015,50,An excellent base to explore the city from,We stayed a total of three nights at Villa Makassar and found it to be very well placed to explore the city on foot - its about a 10-15 minute walk to the main square (Jemaa el Fna) and the souks.    The hammam in the spa in the basement of the Riad was fantastic - a completely new experience and to be recommended without question. The spa staff were fantastic - the massage I had fixed my long-time damaged shoulder completely. Coming back to the Riad after a long day walking around the city an hour in the massive Jacuzzi washed away sore feet and tired muscles.    We only ate dinner once in the Riad but the quality was great - you will be hard pressed to find alcohol anywhere in Marrakech in the variety and quantity we see in Western Europe but Villa Makassar had a good range of wine and beer.    The Riad is decorated in an art deco style and was very clean and well maintained - our room was spotless.    The staff in the Riad were very warm friendly and helpful - booking us a tour into the Atlas Mountains on our last day which was amazing.

Villa Makassar,sydney_chick wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Perfect Choice for Marrakech,When I was booking accommodation in Marrakech I was considering lots of different places: hotels roads everything. I very nearly booked the Sofitel as it was a safe choice however I was interested to see something more authentic for my experience in Morocco ( no disrespect to the Sofitel intended). I am SO glad that I did. Villa Marrakech is the perfect Moroccan experience for those who want to stay in Marrakech. Here's why:    Firstly the villa is located in the Kasbah area and as others have said is a short walk to the main sights in Marrakech (particularly the Badii Palace and Saadian Tombs which are very close by) but also for the main square and Koutoubia Mosque. It is a safe area and the streets are buzzing with life at all times of day. I was travelling with a female friend and neither of us felt unsafe at any time and trust me we did not blend in at all - she has bright red hair I have blonde hair.    Secondly the villa itself is a true oasis from the activity in the streets and as soon as you enter you feel a great sense of calm and relaxation. The villa is designed with original Art Deco furniture and this really sets it apart from many other villas. The villa is stylish and authentic and the orange blossom fragrance oil that burns is wonderful. The rooms are a good size and our bathroom was incredibly large! Again the rooms carry on the Art Deco style and are very tasteful.    Lastly the service is perfect - everyone that we met at the hotel was charming polite and would do anything they could to serve you. Breakfast is included and was delicious we particularly loved the freshly squeezed orange juice and the Moroccan pastries. We also ate lunch and dinner in the hotel at least once during our stay and again were thrilled with the quality of the food and the service. The terrace area was the perfect place to dine for lunch (we did this twice!) and relax.    Overall I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel for people who want to experience authentic Moroccan service and accommodation. Give the bland four star chain hotels a miss and stay at the Villa Makassar.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Holmes Chapel, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydney_chick

This Riad is located inside the medina and is within a walking distance from major attractions in Marrakech. From the moment that you arrive till the moment that you check out the staff will do anything that is possible to make your stay absolutely perfect. Every member of the staff seems to be ready to satisfy all your needs. This is the great thing about staying here: you will fell at home. Rates included breakfast which was delicious and options changed everyday. Rooms had very good size but were a little bit dark. It would be great if the lightning of the rooms were more powerful. Other downsize is that the wi-fi didn´t work properly in the room located on the first floor. There is also a spa which is wonderful with a beautiful hamman and offers many therapies and massages.

Service was exceptional and really personal something I couldn't have predicted. The manager was great but all the waiting staff were first class especially the very kind chap that serves breakfast.    Our room was nice big and comfortable but a few points to note  1. Bath with a shower head and makes showering pretty hard and the bath is huge so takes a long time to fill.  2. The toilet seat in our bathroom was broken. We should have said something as it prob would have been fixed.  3. The air con smelt a bit funky  4. Due to the nature of the hotel building its not easy to lie in bed beyond 10am without being woken by noise. It wasn't terrible but you should be aware    Food was great too.

Manager and reception was always helpful and tried to accommodate all the time.  The only downside are those Marrocan style doors that need to be insulated in some way as soundproofing is really bad. Kitchen noise and plates banging since 8am are not most relaxing thing on holls. Also due to courtyard roof being covered due to adverse weather all the smell from kitchen went into the rooms since early. Bed mattresses are too hard for myself but maybe heathy option to others:) i felt broken every morning.  Reception is always helpful with bookings at restaurants and taxis. One big downfall that Visa cards were not accepted on departure and quite stressful when flight departing in couple hours.

While staying at Makassar we booked a treatement at the hammam and had a misunderstanding regarding the booking which were taken care of great by the hotel staff when we arrived. We can really recommend you to book a traditional hammam treatment. We also ate at the hotel and found the food excellent (you can for example have a tagine with seafood which we didn't find at any other restaurants during our Marrakesh-visit).

Villa Makassar,Manclaw wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Hidden gem,we booked VM for our second wedding anniversary which from reviews seemed to be a good choice. Upon arriving at Menara Airport we were faced by a wall of hotel drivers but we located ours and wove our way into what can only be described as a truly manic city; VM is located down a very narrow side street in the Kasbah; initial signs were a little disconcerting until we came through from the dusty street into the lobby which was beautiful. We were greeted warmly by Quentin the new manager and all things VM and Marrakech were calmly explained to us including a tour of the entire property top to bottom (while we were served with but of course mint tea and Moroccan pastries).    The hotel itself is small ( only 10 rooms) but has a v large roof terrace external plunge pool ( unheated) and internal pool ( heated) with spa facilities and a pretty good restaurant. Each day after the madness of the outside world the hotel and staff provided an excellent feeling of sanctuary.    We opted for the Grand Deluxe Suite Double which we could only describe as magnificent with its own terrace and windows into one of the central courtyards; fitted out with Art Deco furniture and art rescued from the La Mammounia refit auction years previous this worked very well; everything worked and fitted.    Breakfast each day was at whatever time suited you wherever you wanted it. Excellent service at all times: food was varied and of good quality ( breakfast was included). Oddly only once did we seem to be served orange juice from a carton ( all other days it was evidently freshly squeezed).    We regularly retired to the roof terrace in the late afternoons after hard days in the city; bar service was excellent. We were lucky in that being there in low season we largely had the place ( and staff) to ourselves - this was perfect for us - others may prefer lots of hustle and bustle but to be fair there's plenty once you venture outside.    We had supper in the dining room one evening which again was to a good standard: choice of European and Moroccan fare was good. We were treated to an impromptu performance by one of the reception staff who was an excellent musician - quite a performer. Wine list was fine though to be fair wine lists across restaurants in Marrakech were generally pretty limited which is probably one of those things.    Location after initially appearing odd in fact proved to be excellent ( walked around Gueliz and Hivernage; the more modern section of the city where the larger chain hotels are and were delighted that the Kasbah / Medina areas were so much more charming and lively.) hotel was probably only a 15 minute walk from Jemma al Fna Square; be warned the streets here are narrow and to the unwary treacherous but after a couple of trips up and down you get used to mopeds cars trucks bicycles and people all competing to use the same restricted space - this is a feature of Marrakech!).    Quentin and his staff ( all who generally had a good grasp of a combination of English and French so could always be understood) worked hard to please all guests and were extremely affable and welcoming: we booked a number of trips including medina guide and atlas mountain trip through reception: good recommendations and worth checking their contacts as a starting point ( and good value).    Overall we were extremely impressed with the hotel itself location services and lovely friendly staff. However a couple of very minor things were worthy of note which could be looked at improving ( none of which really affected our stay to be fair) (i) wifi needs to be more consistent ( while I accept this is probably a Morocco- wide issue it should be possible to sort I would have thought) (ii) in the suite's bathroom there was a huge square bath with handheld shower - we tried having a bath but after 2 hours of trying to fill it it was only perhaps 6 inches deep ( and couldn't retain heat) while the shower head was indeed fine with decent water pressure and temperature it really needs a bracket on the wall to be able to shower properly - not since being a student have I had to shower like this and (aesthetics aside) wouldn't have expected to do this in an otherwise well equipped and effective establishment of this nature (iii) if you're going to have a nespresso coffee machine in the room provide daily fresh milk (iv) while the tv wasn't terribly important if you're going to offer it with cable channels it's not really great to only have one english language channel ( CNN at that) - try to get a wider set of channels ( would have thought it wasn't too difficult to get BBC news for example?)    In summary a gem of an establishment. Would thoroughly recommend for a trip to Marrakech and would be keen to revisit in the future - well run and extremely friendly hotel all in all.

Villa Makassar,SW6SCR wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Art Deco Heaven!,I adored this property.    Set in the south of the Medina it was well located for many sites and only a short walk away from the square and souks.    It was easy to find which is always a plus in Morocco and walking into the entrance hall was incredible. I felt like I'd stepped back in time.    The style of the property internally is gloriously Art Deco with the occasional nod to Morocco. You had the feeling Bertie Wooster would feel very much at home here.    I stayed in one of the larger suites full of antique furniture from the time - amazing wardrobes desks and bed. The bathroom just stunning with 1920's mosaic bath.    They had a great sized swimming pool which is rare for a riad and definitely a plus after a hot day in the Medina.    They also have an amazing roof top bar where I enjoyed breakfast (amazing Moroccan pancake with olives - I should have asked for the recipe) but I can imagine is the perfect for a cocktail in the evening.    The staff were lovely. The Managers were excellent hosts and the owner was a delight to meet and clearly very passionate about his beautiful property - just as he should be - I'd move in tomorrow if I could.,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SW6SCR

As a solo traveler safety was my biggest priority. The management went above and beyond in accommodating my requests and helped me organize and make travel arrangements around Marrakech. The riad is wonderful and absolutely beautiful! The architecture has so much unique characteristics and you can tell there was a lot of thought but into each detail in the design process. The food is amazing (I recommend the seafood risotto) and the roof-top terrace is a perfect way to unwind after a busy day in the city center. The staff is outstanding and always made you feel welcome. I would recommend this riad to anyone visiting Marrakech. I can't think of a better place to stay and I will definitely be back!,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Denver, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100leighs

We stayed in the Villa Makassar and were treated to a wonderful experience from the staff who couldn't do enough for you and the most amazing Spa session which was truly incredible. The management led by Quentin and Bilyana was never overly demanding but were always there to help with directions or in our case a wonderful bar/restaurant for our last night where they organising a table overlooking the city. Being 15 minutes away from the main square it was just far enough away from the crowds but an easy walk in and out each day. With a small outside pool and a wonderful roof terrace with sunbeds laid out and most importantly a bar where we enjoy nice glasses of wine each afternoon when we came back after a mad day in the Souks we totally chilled. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and stay there again a little gem with people that make you feel welcom.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ebog

The rooftop is huge lots of space to relax on the cozy day beds. There are extra showers to refresh yourself but you also have a big pool within the riad.

Meals can be served at any time and wherever you fancyeven on the secluded delightful roof terrace. The menu offers a choice of International and Moroccan dishes all those we tasted were cooked to perfection with many we had not experienced before but would certainly go back for.

Villa Makassar,markscarlet wrote a review Oct 2014,40,"Stylish but, need details sorting",Having recently stayed at Villa Makassar I can re-iterate some of the previous reviews these led partly to our booking a four day break. I would add to those as follows;    Anyone who has walked in Marrakesh knows the street scene and the entrance into calm as you step through the door. The Art Deco (mainly French1910-39 ish when I think they ruled this part of the world) design an overall design deserves praise in concept and in the main execution. Polished plaster window proportions detail of ceilings light fittings chairs animal and bird influence straight cuts and lines square steel dark colours light colours lack of colour sculpture and a celebration of things unashamedly made by machine tools and welding.    The welcome and staff are in the main delightful some detail is less so. Any star rating generally lists facilities however sometimes less can be more and vice versa. Our room Paul Jouve is quite cosy very dark reasonable in size but suffered drain smells (due to water being drawn from traps) at some times of the day (air admittance valves required somewhere). The toilet cistern needs setting up or a small replacement seal. Had 10% of light bulbs blown (as has the whole building). It also needed one or two other little handy-man fixing jobs including the safe box. Thankfully crime seems low in Marrakesh so does any chance of anything being completely finished. This is deemed character in some places here at the rates charged maintenance should be pro-active and if re-active at least timely. Note-paper no envelopes or pen?    At this point I nearly forgot the reason I have sat and wasted half an hour at this keyboard. It was because with respect to mattresses there can be hotel quality and hotel luxury. The one in Paul Jouve is the former being the most unforgiving (read uncomfortable) hard one my wife and I have encountered anywhere in the world at any price point burn it now. It alone means I would be unlikely to consider return or recommendation. The lovely linen on it deserves better.    Maid service spot-on.    The pool is lovely on hot day though and no I don't mind the morning chorus either.    Anyone who knows the size of me may think I would mention food. The restaurant service is excellent for breakfast and dinner and the drinks not overpriced for this sort of hotel white wine could do with being cooler though. It is a shame more people have not found it and made it is busier in the evenings here and on the lovely roof terrace. The choice of having the breakfast anywhere is a nice touch as are many others in the public areas listed here on TA.    You are in the top few in Marrakesh you could be so in the world. So to detail finish your lovely concept hotel off the owner who I have not met should perhaps travel to Corbie France take Ismail and Eve (excuse spelling if wrong please) stay for a couple of days at where I remember as the most relaxing stay we have ever made your namesake Le Macassar.

Villa Makassar,Ian C wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Marvellous Makassar,Hotel is authentic in its styling to Marrakesh but delivered with a tasteful Art Deco twist. Being located in the traditional Medina allows for a short walk access to the real Marrakesh experience the market is only 15 minutes away. Hotel is darkly intriguing with very friendly staff who are attentive but not intrusive. Hotel Manager Eve looks to make your stay special and works hard to achieve this. We enjoyed a traditional Hamman in the tranquility of the spa and loved relaxing on the terrace which was quiet and relaxing. Room was beautifully designed and clean with everything we needed. Food was excellent and well presented throughout although I felt there might be more light lunchtime options to eat.

Villa Makassar,KingarthurIV wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Calm amongst the chaos,Villa Makassar is the perfect retreat if you want to get away from the hustle bustle and madness of Marrakech. Located only 15 minutes from the main square (Jemaa El Fnna) the hotel is only a short stroll to most things in the old town (or a very short and cheap taxi ride if you are disabled/old/lazy).    The staff are incredibly attentive; going above and beyond there duty. The rooms are individual and uniquely decorated. One tiny disadvantage of most Riads are the rooms are a little darker than your prosaic plain apartment block as they're located in the heart of the city. A price I would happily pay.    I would echo some of the other reviews by saying more could be done with the roof terrace which is great for sun lounging but could be given some life for the evening.    Thank you Villa Makassar!

Villa Makassar,TonyB B wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Denise & Tony Visited Villa Makassar,We recently spent 4 nights in Marrakech and stayed at the Villa Makassar. We quite late and were collected as arranged by the taxi to transfer to hotel. The hotel is located in the old medina and we had to travel on narrow roads to get there. From the outside the hotel looks unassuming but after passing through the entrance the hotel opened up into a central courtyard and was quite spectacular - tastefully decorated and maintained to a very high standard.  On arrival we were greeted by Ismail. After our complimentary refreshments he showed us around the hotel and even though it was quite late and the restaurant was closed he arranged for us to have a light bite to eat. We had a Grand Luxe Suite which was truly spectacular and provided us with everything we needed for our stay.  The reception staff were always very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Eve the hotel manager was extremely helpful and always gave up her time to assist in making our stay memorable.  The spa is well worth visiting and provides an extensive range of treatments. The food at the hotel was of a high standard and traditional but they will provide alternatives if requested.  We really enjoyed our visit to Marrakech whilst the weather was hot the hotel provided a wonderful tranquil sanctuary to escape the heat and just relax.  The hotel has a fantastic roof terrace which we feel is underused - maybe some parasols and/or evening entertainment or BBQ evenings would make it a more usable space?.  Thank you to all at Villa Makassar for providing us with such a memorable trip to Morocco. We really enjoyed ourselves and have recommended it highly to family and friends.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonybb2014

Service was good staff couldn't be more helpful or friendly - Eve was a great example. Food was good breakfast was better than expected. The room was OK but despite having 3 different wireless networks my one gripe was the lack of a stable wi-fi connection in the room....basically never worked - didn't complain too much because the idea was to switch off for the short break but still wanted the opportunity to connect! Also the in room safe is not worth mentioning - if you are concerned about valuables then be warned its small and can be carried away quite easily. The location is just OK. Its a little out of the way from the main square (20 min walk) and there really isn't too much around the Riad....meaning that you have a walk every time you go in/out anywhere....other than this would recommend for a quite spa base.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iMrVampire

We arrived late and had no problems with check-in or the transfer the riad had arranged for us everything worked smoothly and we were swiftly settled in our comfortable room. If I had to make one small complaint it is that the lighting is dark in the rooms and not too practical.    there is plenty of space to relax in the riad in afternoons with the roof terrace for sun worshippers whilst we enjoyed a swim in the pool and    Do have dinner on the rooftop whilst you stay - we did and it was a truly magical experience excellent food with excellent service surrounded by the sounds of the city.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18suea
Villa Makassar,Sandie O wrote a review May 2014,50,"If you only visit one riad in Marrakech, make it this one",If you love cool stylish and sophisticated surroundings with wonderful staff a spa and great restaurant then look no further. We have just spent four nights at the Villa Makassar in the Kasbah in Marrakech and believe me everything good that's been written about this hotel is absolutely true. We arrived after a very long day and walked into an oasis of calm and tranquility. Built around a stunning courtyard this is no ordinary riad. It has only ten rooms all individually furnished with genuine art deco furnishings statues and paintings which are truly wonderful. Every detail has been hand picked from the taps in the bathrooms to the stingray (yes really!) covered table in the lounge. The owner Fouad has spent a lifetime collecting wonderful pieces which are there for everyone to enjoy and he took great pleasure in taking us round when we arrived.    The staff can't do enough for you they were wonderful - never in your face but always around if you needed something from breakfast in the little courtyard to one of the best tagines I had during the whole holiday organising trips guides and taxis to restaurants and generally advising about the best places to go. The riad is really centrally located in the Kasbah just a short walk from the big square and the souk and the amazing thing is that however mad and noisy the streets outside are once you are through the front door you could be in another world it's so quiet and peaceful.    I can really recommend the hammam where you're massaged to within an inch of your life then covered in black soap - but you come out with skin as soft as a baby! The spa is beautifully cool and very stylish - they even cut my husband's hair for him. Now that's what I call service!    This was our first visit to Marrakech but I seriously hope it won't be our last - but we'll only come back if we can stay at Villa Makassar.

Villa Makassar,FlorinD568 wrote a review May 2014,40,"Beautiful art-deco villa, nice facilities, good location/ but service& quality-price ratio need to be improved","Stayed at Villa Makassar for 2 nights in November 2013 out of 4 days in Marrakech.  This is a villa in a good location and the facilities are quite nice: I especially liked the terrace (nice benches and sun beds)-perfect for breakfast & chilling out-where you're surrounded also by a lot of art & nice decorations.  - On the ""pros"" side: the villa is beautiful quiet common spaces are large& spacious. Facilities are ok [although pool looked small] & it is impressive that there are a lot of art objects (chairs decorated windows statues fountains etc]. In all fairness this place is special & I think the owner put a lot of efforts in renovation.  - On the ""cons"" side: we had a twin room it was small a bit dark & bathroom quite small too. Not 5-star standards and it must be pointed out that the service was not a 5-star either. We had to wait for over 1 hr and 1/2 for check-in after we called twice to let the reception know about the arrival hour [allegedly the room was not ready]. I was invited to have a hammam while waiting for check-in [I though it's courtesy] but surprisingly I found it on the invoice at check out. In the end reception was helpful took note of this & finally took it out from the bill but it required 20 min of discussions.  Overall: a pleasant experience beautiful decorated villa - but in my view they still need to work on the price-quality ratio and improve the service for an advertised 5-star riad.",Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlorinD568
Villa Makassar,Tarsun wrote a review May 2014,50,Surprises,I just cannot stop raving about the riad it's serenity the service the food and most of all the decor.    Clearly a labour of love the place has been meticulously designed with an eye for detail and a lot of the pieces have a history if you're as lucky as we were to get a guided tour of the place. Having stayed in many luxury hotels all over the world what stood out for me were the hospitality the homely atmosphere and the little nooks and crannies hidden throughout; whether it's the outdoor pool area the lounges the terrace or the spa. There are plenty of places to hide and be transported to a different world. Just step outside the riad and the chaos of the medina envelops you. Okay so the bath in my room was not the most practical & the room was a tad on the dark side; the decor is aimed at decadence so it was a small price to pay.    The meals we ate there were delicious freshly prepared and far superior to those served in the restaurants at Jemaa el Fna.    Although the riad was fully occupied during our stay it did not feel busy. The staff have all the time in the world for you and mentioning something to one member means it is cascaded up or down to the other staff. I've found many a hotel where such communication is lacking. The riad is perfect for adults looking for tranquility and luxury not too far from the action in Marrakech.

Villa Makassar,munchandco wrote a review May 2014,30,A let down......,"Stayed here for 3 nights in April. Have mixed feelings about this hotel.    The hotel has been decorated beautifully the staff pleasant and friendly. It was clean. Location is good.    We enjoyed the escorted tours around the city which they arranged as well as a day trip into the valley (caveat you are taken to ""tourist"" stop offs on the valley trip but as long as you accept this is the way it works in morocco then it is worth seeing and doing).    We only ate breakfast at the hotel (too quiet for dinner). Each day we were served a variation on a morrocan breakfast which was ok.    Onto the spa which was nice. Whilst the front desk talked to us about their spa menu and encouraged us to book a treatment we only realised after checking out that part of the hotel rate included a free hamman per room which was not offered and we had forgotten about. A shame.    The rooms are quite dark which some people might prefer but it didn't help that there was no full length mirror - even in our ""deluxe"" junior suite! However to the hotel's credit they did eventually arrange for one to be fixed onto the wardrobe door. The children's room although classified as a suite was not much bigger than a normal double but our deluxe suite was a very good size. Be warned though there is no overhead shower in the deluxe suite but one of those huge stone bathtubs which I find impractical - it takes forever to fill and too uncomfortable to lie in.    However some faults have unfortunately let the villa makkassar down and I am only posting a negative comment because after our experience I don't feel it is suitable for families and they should be aware before deciding to stay there.    When I made the booking I explained we needed a room suitable for a family of 5 and gave the ages of our children (14 12 and 9). I was told that the most appropriate accommodation would be a deluxe suite plus a junior suite which I went ahead and booked on a pay in advance non refundable basis. I was therefore expecting the rooms to be interConnecting and/or suitable for families. However on arrival although the rooms were next door to each other they were not connected in any other way. Whilst we often have this arrangement on holiday it normally wouldn't pose a problem. However in this case we were only allowed 1 key for each room so this meant if the kids wanted their door locked at night then they would have to hold onto the key and lock it from the inside and if we wanted access then we would have to knock on the door and vice versa with our room (the only other alternative was keep both doors unlocked all night). Hardly a safe situation and one which we were very uncomfortable with.    We had arrived at midnight and so because we were all tired and it was too late for the front desk night cover to do anything we reluctantly accepted the arrangement. However there was a laissaz faire attitude when we complained to the manager the following morning. Given the chance we would have checked out there and then but we had paid for the duration of our stay in advance and there was not a lot we could do.    Also it was annoying to pay a supplement for a deluxe suite which was a more expensive option and which we thought was being allocated on some ""interconnecting"" basis suitable for families when in fact it didn't offer any benefit at all.    Nevertheless what was almost worse was the smell of drains in both rooms but especially the children's room which was foul and unbearable. We complained about it daily and were told it would be dealt with. The first day housekeeping lit a candle. The second day the manager promised to bring a special machine to deal with the problem but it didn't help in the slightest. We were then told that every riad has the same drain problem.....but somehow I find this hard to believe. They refused to take money off the room but as a concession offered a free treatment for the kids to have a Hena and hair braided in the spa. I wonder if some rooms are more susceptible to the drain smell and these rooms are allocated to guests that have paid in advance so that they have no option but to put up with it...?    We had booked the hotel partly because it advertises itself as having a heated swimming pool so our plan was to tour the city in the morning and come back to the hotel for an afternoon swim and lounge by the pool. In reality the outdoor pool was not heated and was freezing cold. It is very small with one narrow sofa for lounging and framed by high walls so that the whole area is shaded by the afternoon. There is a very large separate roof terrace but no swimming facilities on the roof and apart from 3 cabana type sitting areas there were no umbrellas and therefore there was no respite from the heat. Consequently it was too hot to lounge there.....although I am sure it is delightful in cooler weather.    Although a beautifully decorated hotel all in all the hotel's layout didn't work for us and it let us down on too many other levels as well",Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"La Fortuna de San Carlos, Costa Rica",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munchandco
Villa Makassar,Israt A wrote a review May 2014,50,A very special stay,Villa Makassar was like one of those surprises in life-totally unexpected and thus all the more beautiful for it. The place has been lovingly and passionately decorated by its elegant and warm owner whom we had the good fortune of meeting and talking to about the villa. This place is clearly a labour of love. The Art deco inspired decor is so special and at every corner you discover a painting or sculpture that catches your eye. There are so many different nooks and corners on the property where you can go sit sun bathe or listen to the birds at -there is real sense of peace and privacy which perfectly complements the hustle bustle of Marrakesh. Brilliantly located within the red walls of the Kasbah and just 15 minutes away from the main square once you step in through the doors suddenly all the chaos and colours melt away and you are greeted by sheer tranquillity and luxury.    We stayed in the Rosseau suite which had an amazing space and wonderful light. The real treasure in this stunning Riad is the staff who are so professional attentive and courteous. They go out of their way to cater to your every need and with beautiful smiles that reach their eyes. They were able to advise on things to do and can also set you up on some tours in the city or further away which have been personally vetted by them so the quality is really high. The food at the villa restaurant is impeccable- all meals are freshly prepared and so sumptuous and flavourful.    What makes this place so special is that despite the luxury service and elegance of the edifice-it feels like home! Intimate it is a perfect haven for couples and also works for families (I stayed there for 3 nights with my sisters and mum and we loved it). A luxury and comfort that is not pretentious and that you can mould into so seamlessly while leaving all your everyday troubles behind. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a memorable stay with personal service. Villa Makassar is a vital part of the wonderful memories we will treasure of Marrakesh. We left it and missed it even as we checked into a 5* hotel in another city. I have never felt that way about any hotel/establishment before...the sense of actually missing the walls the space soothing shadows bird song and staff.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/israta
Villa Makassar,Shaz151 wrote a review May 2014,50,Best holiday thus far!!!,My sisters and I has the most amazing 3 day break at this beautiful villa. The brilliant reception from the owner and staff was second to none and we immediately felt as though we were home away from home. The individual rooms we had were beautifully decorated and the Art Deco style of the villa was beautifully finished which made our stay exceptionally comfortable.  The spa treatments especially the hamman was the most relaxing experience I have ever had and would go back for another session with the really attentive staff and amazing massages.  The staff were always happy to assist with anything and always served you with a smile nothing was too much trouble. The location of the villa in medina made it easy to explore Marrakech at the heart of the old town. The villa has so many quiet areas and places to relax it made it easy to enjoy quiet family time. We really got a wonderful surprise on our last night after being upgraded to a superior room. Thank you for the hospitality and look forward to coming back again soon.  S.

This place is massive its about three or four riads together so it feels like you have it to yourselfs i think its only has 10 rooms and suites  The owner Fruad (fred for short )was so passionate about the riad giving us a tour of every area  It was so nice to meet someone so passionate about his riad and making his guest's feel totally at home and explaining where he had sourced all the beautiful furniture from around the world was amazing everything had a story attached to it .  The spar was amazing with the hammam and massage being probably one of the best treatments ive ever had  the location is great 15min walk to the main square and souks .  Fred arranged everything for us with no pressure we had a excellent day trip to the atlas mountains to see berber villages waterfalls mountain walks and lunch .  He recommended us a restaurant for saturday night his recommendation was spot on just what our group wanted .  i can honestly say that there is not many hotels i would go back to just for the fact that its good to try different hotels but i would definitely go back to villa makassar and hope to very soon such a amazing place and only 3.5 hours from london    Thanks Fouad for this special trip i will never forget your special riad in Marrakech,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/star-glenn

I researched the villa on the internet before I arrived and the place really is as stunning as the photographs. The owner Fouad has excellent taste and each area has been furnished to a very high standard. It is a truly peaceful haven to come back to after all the bustle of this very busy city. The staff really couldn't do enough for you and I must give special thanks to Ismael and Rabii. The food was excellent with lovely freshly cooked breakfasts.

Villa Makassar,rogerwharf wrote a review Apr 2014,50,Return visit,We don't usually go back to the same place let alone the same hotel but Villa Makassar in Marrakech has proved the exception and for very good reasons. Morocco is a relatively short flight to a warmer climate and our last visit in June 2013 to Villa Makassar was such a treat we decided to return this year in April. Once again we were not disappointed. The standards of service and accommodation met all our expectations and the overall atmosphere of the Riad was peaceful and relaxed despite being fully booked.    There was a change from last year but a change for the better. The new chef has introduced an extended menu adding international cuisine to the existing Moroccan dishes. We ate in the Riad's restaurant 4 times this visit and on each occasion the food was of the highest quality and beautifully presented.    As other recent reviews have stated the staff the owner and the setting are all perfect and its location in the old part of Marrakech means it is in easy walking distance of all the historic parts of the city that visitors would want to visit. For those that want to travel further afield then the staff will make all your arrangements for you with a minimum of fuss. We went on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains and that was very special with excellent guides and booked by the Riad at a really reasonable price.    We are already thinking about our next visit.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerwharf

The staff were very friendly and helpful nothing too much trouble.We ate there on three nights. The food and service in the restaurant was excellent..

Villa Makassar,Richard_Harpum wrote a review Mar 2014,40,"Amazing art nouveau décor, wonderful staff",We stayed in Villa Makassar for a week in March.  It is a riad in the Kasbah at the south west corner of the Medina. It is an island of luxury in a sea of relative squalor which seems to be the same as most of the riads in the Medina.  The villa is set around two courtyards with around 10 guest rooms a restaurant various sitting rooms a hammam (spa) an outdoor pool and a large roof terrace with plenty of room for sun bathing etc. The Jacuzzi was huge and wonderful.  They have spent a fortune on the art nouveau décor which is very well done throughout. Our suite was VAST and there were some nice touches like rose petals on the bed and even down the loo! The bath was also huge and inlaid with art nouveau mosaic.  The staff were wonderful throughout our stay. They all spoke good English and could not do enough to ensure that our needs were met.  I would like to give Villa Makassar 5 stars but there were too many “rough edges” to warrant this.  Although the décor is amazing our room was starting to look “tired” and it was expensive (at around £250 - £300 per night) compared to 5* hotels in other countries especially as most facilities had to be paid for.  On the first evening we ate in the restaurant. The food was good but there was not enough of it and it was quite pricey (like most decent restaurants in Marrakech). The following evening we took the complimentary meal that was part of our package. They “shot themselves in the foot” with this as the portions were small and the food “average”. So we did not eat there again. This may explain why the restaurant was virtually empty every night unlike many other riads and restaurants in the area where you often have to book a table.  Although we are not TV addicts we do like to watch the news occasionally if it is available in English. Although there were hundreds of satellite channels available most were either in Arabic or French. Apparently some other guests were able to receive Sky News in English but it was not available in our room and they were not able to fix this during our stay despite several attempts. As they have been open for 3 years I would have thought they would have sorted this out by now.  Because there was no double glazing it was quite noisy in our room especially first thing in the morning when we were often woken by the call for prayer (around 04:45) and then the birds (someone shoot that pigeon!).  So overall a beautiful place with delightful staff but with room for improvement.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richard_Harpum
Villa Makassar,BigStac wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Great Service from Front Desk,A girlfriend and I stayed here on our first trip to Marrakech recently. The hotel itself was beautiful and the service we received from the young lady at the front desk (I can't remember her name but she studied in Spain and had a great sense of humor) was perfect….she called taxis for us made dinner reservations and answered all of our typical tourist questions. We really felt like we had someone to help us in a place where we did not really understand how everything works. I will definitely go back!    Side note: The souks were great for shopping especially as an interior designer but as Americans we definitely paid higher prices! be sure to start at 10% of the price they ask and be willing to walk away…..know what your max price is before you start talking to them!,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigStac

Villa Makassar,champagnetravels wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Great location,Myself and a friend just got back from a long weekend in Marrakech. As with the previous reviewers we received a nice welcome with mint tea and pastries. We were given a tour of the riad and finally shown to our room. We had the twin room. I was initially worried as some reviewers reported a bad smell butour room smelled lovely the whole time we were there. They had orange scented oil burners in the room whcih was a nice touch. The room size was perfectly fine but some elements let it down. There is in-adequate space in the bathroom for toiletries. We were two girls so had lots of lotions and potions and nowhere to put it. Not even a shelf in the shower area. The shower also sprayed water all over the floor after every shower leaving a soggy mess. We also found the room incredibly dark which was lovely for a lie-in but not very practical for applying make up and getting ready.    Breakfast is at anytime you wish which was also a plus as you don't have to rush. We never received a menu or much of a choice. Breakfast generally consisted of a small bowl of fruit each with 2 or 3 sweet pastry type things. On one morning chocolate cake. I love cake but not really first thing in the morning! A wider selection would be nice.    We used the jacuzzi one afternoon- very nice and huge! You could practically swim in it. A good tip- they have a heated pool next door and for a small fee you can use it. We spend a lot of time next door as we felt villa Makassar lacked atmosphere in the evenings. They have two lounge areas with fireplaces but the fires were never lit and the riad was freezing. We never saw any other people in the evenings. Everything was very very quiet. We sat in one of the cold lounges on the Saturday night and apart from a man doing some painting there wasn't a soul in sight. No background music nothing. You could hear a pin drop. Obviously some people would appreciate the silence but as two 30-something girls we wanted a bit of life. Again I highly recommend next door for a glass of wine by the fire. And musicians most nights.    We liked the location of the villa as it's one of the few accessible by car/taxi which is great after a night out. The staff were all very nice and helpful on the occasions we needed anything. I would recommend Villa Makassar for a romantic weekend or if you like things very quiet. We enjoyed our time here but if I would to go back I'd try somewhere a bit more lively.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/champagnetravels

Villa Makassar,Ian C wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Perfect For Marrakech,Straw Berries and Cream  Roast Beef and Horseradish  Gin and Tonic    All of the above compliment each other perfectly as do Villa Makassar and Marrakech! The Noise Colour Splendour and Vibrancy of Marrakech is both exciting and exhausting a calm relaxing place to stay is a must. Look no further than Villa Makassar.    My Wife and I celebrated my 50th Birthday with a 3 Night Stay at the end of February.    The Driver collected us from the airport as arranged and transfer to Villa Makassar was around 15 minutes. Once we arrived it was hard to believe that we were in the right location as the area does not look as though any Hotels would be located there.    However nce you go through the Impressive door everything is transformed into a World of tranquillity and luxury. Our welcome was warm with a guided tour and refreshments.    The Room we booked was a Deluxe Suite but were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the Grand Lux Suite which was fantastic.    During our Stay we booked the Hammam which was a real experience not to be missed.    The Meals in the Hotel are Tasty and there is a choice of Authentic Local dishes or a more European Menu.    The Hotel Booked a table for us at a Top Restaurant which included Belly Dancers which we both enjoyed. Taxi was also booked through the Hotel which was good value. The Driver was also friendly and safe! Unlike many of the other Taxi Drivers in Marrakech!    The only slight issue was on one occasion there was a smell of sewage in our room but the Hotel dealt with this by providing incense Lamps. I don't blame the Hotel for this as at the end of the day we were in a City that does not have the same sanitary standards as we do in the UK. . They dealt with the problem in the best way that they could very quickly.    The whole experience was great for my Wife and I we both loved Marrakech and Villa Makassar. The Service and Style will stay in our memories for a long time.    Thanks very much to Fouad and his Team.

Villa Makassar,ReviewerII wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Places like this need 6 stars,We stayed in Villa Makassar last week and had a completely exceptional experience from start to finish. We were collected by the airport by their representative who was charming and informative and dropped us at this elegant and delightful riad. Fouad met us and sat us down with a cup of Moroccan tea and pastries and talked us through the riads concept and construction and then showed us around all the parts before taking us to our room. A wonderful space open large massive comfortable bed two wardrobes bang and olufsen tv fabulous bathroom with a stand alone bath huge shower and fabulous touches the water snake skin head board the cups brought back from the Taj Mahal the chairs bought from La Mamounia just lovely. This really set us up for the rest of our trip where the whole concept of this riad is you do everything on your own time. Wake up when you like call down and say in 10 minutes I'd like breakfast on the terrace and hey presto breakfast! Which leads me nicely to food.    The food here is amazing breakfasts of fruit salads yogurts fresh baked cakes pastries and breads luxurious jams Moroccan tea which we loved and juices. Then if you want more eggs anyway you like whatever you want. We had dinner here too and the food was excellent at dinner in fact the apple desert was sublime and the best desert we had in Marrakech and we did eat in some fantastic restaurants. The lemon chicken tagine comes highly recommended too. I'll leave it to Fouad to tell you the story of the chefs pedigree!    House keeping was fantastic. I can not fault it in any way at all everyday everything was as clean and tidy as when we arrived and yet I only actually saw them in our room once! They seemed to know when you were on the terrace or out and worked around you whatever the time of day. The general cleanliness and neatness of the whole riad was without fault.    We used the spa too which again world class. If you book spa treatments you get the whole area to yourselves so that's the jacuzzi/small pool and all the small but perfectly formed treatment area. We had the hammam body scrub and massage package and I don't want to give too much away because it'd spoil your surprise but what an experience delivered by two of the friendliest most professional people I have encountered and both my husband and I have had treatments in some of the best places in the world and I would come back here for this treatment over all of them.    The riad is beautiful and you can tell the love and dedication that has gone into it's renovation it has a history too so you do feel that you are in an amazing building. We loved it's position at the end of Rue de la Kasbah it felt like being in the real Marrakech walking down after sightseeing and seeing the shops and sellers and children playing football around us. It was a fifteen/twenty minute amble to Jemaa el fna but you really get to see some sights just getting there. And you can get a cab up to the door which is unusual here and worth it when you have cases.    Finally almost! The staff are amazing. 10 rooms and 20 members of staff you don't get better looked after than that. All of them were friendly charming accommodating and professional happy to chat with you and share stories of their lives which we were so happy to hear and really added to our experience full of humour and kindness. They know we have a choice over where we stay and they really want to make sure you have a great time we genuinely believed that. Happy to make recommendations bookings and help when their silly guests loose their cameras phoning all over Marrakech! I find it hard to single out staff as they were all amazing but Jusef and Noelle were just brilliant.    And if you are considering Marrakech and another destination then I can tell you that Marrakech is vibrant busy chaotic so different an experience to other short breaks populated by some of the funniest and nicest people you could wish to meet.

Villa Makassar,Travellingflan wrote a review Feb 2014,40,"Lovely place, but not without its problems",First off - this place is gorgeous. Certainly the best example of art deco design that I've come across. It is also as the other reviews state a calm quiet oasis in the middle of what is a frenetic crazy place. The moment you step in you leave the world outside behind. However while it is a truly lovely place to stay it did have a few issues.    Location: At the far south end of the old city in a relatively quiet street of the Kasbah. Everything in the old city is at walking distance - all the monuments and the markets. Great location for the old city.    Design: Absolutely brilliant example of art-deco combined with subtle touches of Morrocan design. The public areas are wonderful especially the two libraries/sitting rooms downstairs.    Rooms: This is where the problem lies. We had booked a deluxe suite but the room left us slightly shocked on arrival. For starters the room had a disgusting smell that hits you in the face the moment you walk in. Secondly the room itself was narrow stuffy overheated and extremely dark. We also noticed that there was a 5cm gap between the door of this room and the wall itself! This meant that when the kitchen that was located below the room closed at night our room was flooded with the greasy smell as they aired the kitchen out. On the contrary though this room had an amazing bathroom - beautiful art-deco touches full of light a big bathtub a rain shower and lots of space. The bathroom itself was almost as big as the room. We weren't happy with this room though so we requested to see if any others were available - they showed us the only other room available at the time which was even smaller - and surprise surprise this room stank as well. So we declined the offer and stayed in our suite - requesting them to do something about the horrendous smell - suggesting that they could perhaps use one of their incense oil burners in our room? They did but it surprised us that they did not think of it themselves before offering us the room! Then we discovered that the bathroom drain was dirty and clogged. They arranged a plumber to come look at it who cleaned it out with his hands and it was sorted. We also discovered that they had only supplied us with one hand towel between two people so we requested an extra towel which was delivered. However the receptionist (one of the two French women) decided to be condescending about it the next day and went on to explain how many towels hotels typically supply and how drains work (!). This one person was incredibly rude and patronising (contrary to the rest of the staff who were all polite charming and did their best in the face of any issues) and we were glad we did not see too much of her during our stay. Her attitude really annoyed us. We also thought that for a hotel that charges as much as it does they really should buy a new set of guest towels because the ones they supply have clearly been used a million times and are nearly threadbare!    We were however promised an upgrade to the Grand Suite as a gesture of goodwill on our last day and we gladly accepted. The Grand Suite was absolutely lovely - and we noticed that the service we received in this suite improved vastly as well. But here's the catch - while the room was gorgeous and one of the best we've ever stayed in (and we've stayed in a lot of gorgeous design hotels around the world!) the bathroom attached to this room was entirely another story. For one it did not have a shower. It had a hand shower attached to the bath which was impossible to use without sitting in the tub. It was also much smaller than the bathroom of the deluxe suite we were in earlier. And to our utter amazement while this bathroom was well-appointed in other respects - in a hotel that prides itself on its art-deco theme and does it rather well - this bathroom had Indian (Rajasthani) decor! Quite befuddling and completely out of place. Also little things in the suite itself - for example two large beautiful art-deco lamps frame the desk - and neither is plugged into a power source and there is no way they can be plugged in either. Why are they there then?! Still we had a lovely stay in this suite and we appreciated the gesture. Strongly recommend to give the lower suites a pass and book the Grand Suites right away. The deluxe suites are certainly not worth the price but the Grand Suites are even at the top rates they charge. Had we know this is what we would have booked.    Food: This was the highlight of our stay. The food here is simply the best we had on our trip and we ended up eating in most of the time. The service in the restaurant was also really good - and almost everything that we tried on the menu was delicious. Highly recommended!    Service: Most of the staff and management were excellent - they do their very best to please and nothing was too much trouble for them. In fact Juliette the manager met us personally to review and sort out the issues we had had early in our stay. That was a nice touch and we truly appreciated it. We just wish we hadn't come across this one lady (mentioned above) whose attitude was supercilious condescending and patronising. With that kind of attitude she really shouldn't be in that job.    Overall a great place to stay in despite all the (minor) issues. We felt that this hotel lacks attention to detail - a lot of little things are wrong which add up to a large number and end up impacting your stay. Still they do their best to sort things out and make your stay memorable. If we return to Marrakesh we will still stay here - and hope they would have sorted things out by then.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingflan

Villa Makassar,neetubhi wrote a review Jan 2014,50,A stylish tranquil haven in the middle of the bustling medina,Myself and my husband stayed at this riad for 4 nights last week and we both agree it is the most stylish and lavish place we have both stayed. It's nestled in an unassuming road in the heart of the medina and it's very easy to get to jamna el fna from the riad on foot. Behind the front door however is a totally different world. From the moment we arrived we experienced brilliant customer's service from all the staff and nothing was too much trouble for them. Service was always prompt and efficient. Their moroccan food was particularly good and we actually opted to eat in the riad on more occasions than we initially intended because of this. We had a really enjoyable cookery class there too. In terms of the riad itself we were blown away by every aspect. A stunning courtyard was surrounded by gorgeous living and dining rooms done up in art deco style. Every aspect of the interior design from paintings sculptures furniture and fitting and fixtures were original art deco pieces and it was such a visual treat for us. I think the biggest selling point for us however was our art deco bedroom suite the photos on the website don't do justice to this magical room...id come back to marrakech for this alone! Excellent value for money too we honestly don't have a bad word to say about villa makassar.

Our dinner was delicious & breakfasts were plentiful with homemade yogurts breads & pastries plus eggs if you wish. The rooftop terrace is a wonderful space to soak up the sun or stargaze. The hammam & massage were lovely & most welcome after a day in the souks. It is a reasonable walk to the main square but worth it to stay in such a peaceful place.

Besides being spotless the rooms are beautiful and each so different (we were lucky enough to get an upgrade on our last night which was very kind).  You just feel so at home here - there are several rooms downstairs where you can just chill out as well as the pool and the rooftop terrace (we had breakfast up there one morning). The breakfasts are amazing as well!  The staff are all great especially the manager. One of our bowls we bought from the souk was damaged when moving rooms and he was so kind in replacing it.

We found a great package which included accommodation transfers and some food.    Villa Makassar was like a hidden oasis - the rooms and the Riad were beautiful. The rooms were all individually decorated and were stunning.    The location was great if you wanted to be in the old town and the Riad organised taxis/minibuses for us to take us to the new town - mainly for the evenings.    The food was delicious; we had dinner one night at the Riad and then we had our breakfast on the roof top terrace each morning. All the food was freshly prepared.    The staff were amazing - and very attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We also used the spa facilities which were great too.    And Juliette who helped me organise the hen do was a super star. She gave me advice answered hundreds of my questions made me feel confident and comfortable about everything I organised for the hen do and ensured the bride-to-be and all the hen's had an unforgettable weekend.

There was complimentary wifi which was invaluable when looking online for places to visit and the breakfasts were excellent.

Villa Makassar,Surreyadventurer wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Outstanding in every way,Literally just returned from a stay at Villa Makassar and was so overwhelmed by Souheil the Director and his wonderful team that although its close to midnight I wanted to right this straightaway . The villa itself exceeded all of my expectations. It is a truly unique and beautiful building furnished impeccably . But that isn't at the heart of the Villa..Souheil is. He is supported by an amazing group of people for whom nothing is too much trouble. Once they know you prefer tea to coffee at breakfast .. It magically appears . Want to eat outside. No problem. All way above anything I've experienced anywhere else in the world . However what makes this do special is that Souheil really does care about his guests who are encouraged to think of the Villa as home. This philosophy was certainly evident by the care I have received over the last 5 days in particular. Unfortunately I was taken ill the day before I was due to come home and had to have surgery; a scary prospect when not on home territory. Souheil just took everything in hand as if I really was a family member ! He called the Doctor ensured my partner could get to and from the hospital. Liaised with the hospital when translation was needed  visited me in hospital with beautiful flowers... His care was endless. I could just go on and on singing the praises of this kind man and his staff who all helped me and my partner at every opportunity. Souheil ... We will be back and I would encourage anyone wishing to visit Marrakech to make it a priority to experience this truly amazing rhiad.,Date of stay: September 2013,,"Twickenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Surreyadventurer
Villa Makassar,Melissa M wrote a review Sep 2013,50,"Beautiful and relaxing riad, made our holiday!",I can't really praise both the staff and setting of Villa Makassar enough. My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights and have just come back today.    We'd never experienced staying in a riad before and weren't sure what to expect. Upon arrival we pulled up into a small busy street within the medina walls of Marrakech. The unassuming doorway led into a gorgeous tranquil space with high ceilings and two beautiful courtyards. The decor is Art Deco and very tasteful; a nice twist on the traditional Moroccan riad architecture.    We were greeted warmly and served traditional mint tea. We were told to treat the riad as our home during our stay - breakfast would be served whenever and wherever we liked (huge bonus!).    The hotel is spacious and quiet as there are only 10 rooms so perfect for an adult relaxation break. There is a huge roof terrace and a nice pool area. Staff are very attentive and there are little touches that enhance the experience of staying there such as sun hats on each of the sunbeds and the fact that staff bring you towels when you're by the pool or on the terrace sunbathing.    The breakfast was a wide selection of Moroccan pastries / pancakes which was lovely. We had 60 minute massages in the spa which were excellent - the spa area has a jacuzzi and hammam which all guests were free to use.    Our room was the S. Delauney junior suite and we were delighted to have a jacuzzi bath robes and slippers provided.    Upon check out we were very kindly provided with a room (which was actually an upgrade from our suite) to use free of charge until our flight which was late in the evening. I've seen from other reviews that they have offered this to many other guests which just shows the consistency of the excellent service they provide.    The location was spot on close enough to walk to all the main attractions within the medina walls.    Lastly we had a day trip to the Ourika Valley included in the deal we had purchased with the hotel that was a great experience particularly the visit to a Berber house and the hike to the beautiful waterfalls.    All in all I'd say this is the best hotel experience I have ever had which is why I was so keen to leave my review.    I will be highly recommending Villa Makassar to friends and family and hopefully returning some time soon!,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissam569
Villa Makassar,Taslima Y wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Absolutely amazing!,The hotel is situated in the old part of town (Medina area) literally 10 mins walk to Jemaa el Fna. You have to go through a few small roads to get to the hotel but after a day or two you will easily find your bearings. The hotel itself is immaculate. The owner really took care in designing this place and the little details really made it unique. The staff were great really friendly and provided the best service we could have ever asked for. We ate at the hotel restaurant a few times and the food was great. I took advantage of the Spa facilities which were fantastic and the girls down there were so lovely. The managers are great anything we needed they would arrange and also get us the best prices. The area which it is located in is quite busy at night but you cannot hear a single thing behind the Hotel walls. It was an incredibly calm and relaxing retreat. Only tiny negative was that our room had an odd smell but I can't complain because soon as we mentioned this to the manager he provided scented candles everyday without fail.    Overall it was an amazing hotel with such fantastic service and ambience on top of that the staff were incredible and treated us like family.

Villa Makassar,Gina407 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Art Deco oasis in Marrakech,Villa Makassar is a beautifully tranquil riad in an excellent location in Marrakech. It is beautifully appointed with care in the Art Deco style obviously a passion for the owners. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and the rooftop is a quiet spot for lounging and breakfast. The staff were extremely attentive. The hammam was one of the best that I have been to- relaxing invigorating and served by a professional staff.  The only problem I had was a bad odor in the room as it had just rained and apparently that can be a problem with sewage - fortunately I was able to move to another room that was smaller but it was so lovely I didn't mind downsizing. I would not hesitate to recommend this riad as it is a welcomed break from the sights sounds and smells of Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Oyster Bay, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gina407
Villa Makassar,Stephanie M wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Fantastic stay in stunning Art Deco surroundings,I recently spent four wonderful nights at Villa Makassar. It was my third visit Marrakech but the first time I had stayed in a riad and I can honestly say that it was an amazing experience. As a fan of Art Deco I was in awe of the beautiful collection that villa possesses particularly the pieces from La Mamounia. The staff were so kind and helpful and assisted with recommending and booking places to visit and ensuring that we were comfortable at all times during our stay. The relaxing atmosphere in the villa certainly made it feel like home. The rooms are stunning and very comfortable with individual décor. Quality of food served is of a high standard and my mother would definitely recommend the pastilla as it is the best she has ever tasted. Spa staff also provide excellent treatments particularly the hammam experience. We were also able to keep our room until check out so that we could enjoy our last day without rushing to pack. Very few places would offer this facility and was a very kind gesture. My mother was also offered another room on the first night to make her stay more comfortable which was very kind of the staff. Many thanks to Souheil and his wonderful team for looking after us during our stay.

Rooms are luxury rooms with high end technology everywhere. The staff is always smily: they support you in every situation from booking restaurants till contracting the price for a cab.

Villa Makassar,FAMILYOFFIVETORONTO wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Home away from home,This is a long review but I have so much to say and I promised it is worth the read!    Arriving at the huge beautiful door outside the alleys of Marrakech gave away little to what paradise I would find inside. My husband and I travelled from Toronto (via Paris) with our 3 boys ages 3 6 and 8. After combing tripadvisor for the perfect Riad four our family we decided on Villa Makassar. And oh my what a decision. My words cannot express the feeling of tranquility as they opened the door. The candle lit hallway and perfumed aroma set the mood for Marrakech. We were immediately greeted by Souheil the manager who we had been corresponding with from Toronto. As we proceeded through the villa we came to an open courtyard and two beautifully appointed 1920 styled lounges. Further into the villa was a dinning room second courtyard and kitchen. Souheil kindly showed my bouncing boys the pool area. To my delight the pool was nicely shaded and protected from the Morocco Sun and relief from the 45 degree heat. The area around the pool was quite narrow and seating was limited but enough for the children to play. Once we finished the ground floor tour we headed back to one of the lounges where Souheil had arranged for fresh fruit cold water and 3 bowls of ice cream! We learned quickly what “Marrakech time” was as we leisurely had a chit chat and then were leisurely shown to our rooms.    ROOMS:  The Parental suite was a large room with a king size bed and an adjoining room with two single beds and a rollaway for the toddler that they had pushed together as per my request. The décor stayed with 1920 theme with dark woods a curved chest of drawers and writing table in the boys rooms. Both rooms had flat screen tv’s and built in closets not a lot of drawer or table space for longer stays. The master bath had a huge almond shape tub and the children’s room had a stand up shower both very clean and modern.    I must say that this Riad and the unbelievable service made Marrakech for us. Never have I found a more hospitable establishment. The riad felt like a home away from home. My boys roamed freely around no safety issues. They even started breakfast alone under the watchful eye of our waiter and cook who greeted them every morning with hugs and kisses! One afternoon my husband and I booked a hamaam treatment that Souheil insisted that we tried while he looked after the boys. Souheil gave us the feeling of ease and comfort. After our 2 hr treatment we found the kids playing with him with smiles on their faces. Souheil honestly felt like family just half way through our stay. Our hamaam experience was also like no other. I highly recommend it.  Lastly we also took tours a city tour and the Atlas mountain tour. Souheil had arranged our driver Noorideen who spoke very good English and was very informative. I also recommend booking this through the hotel for less hassle.    I will finish by saying that this Riad and especially Souheil made our trip. Coming from the west I am a service oriented person especially travelling with young kids. I am so happy that we choose the Riad experience rather than a 5-star American style hotel that I could get anywhere. Staying in a Riad ensures you that personal service where the staff anticipate your ever move to make your stay more comfortable without being annoying. Souheil arranged for our tours negotiated our taxi’s made reservations in the best restaurants and loaned us a Marrakech cell phone to arrange for our pick ups from the restaurants when we were done. I highly recommend this Riad. Thank you to all the staff of Villa Makassar    A few tips:  -laundry was no extra for the kids a complete BONUS  -elevator for the stroller  -extremely safe environment and child friendly  -free wifi,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Thornhill, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FAMILYOFFOURTORONTO

We arrived late evening and Souheil had arranged a beautiful romantic Moroccan Meal on the terrace lit with Moroccan candle lit lanterns it was out of this world. The following morning the same little table was dressed on the terrace for our breakfast and laden with freshly squeezed orange juice pancakes French toast and other wonderful nibbles followed by omelettes and toast. We had a tour around this beautiful riad with suprises in each area. A lovely refreshing Pool to cool off in on what was a scourcher of a day a beautiful sun terrace (straw hats included to keep the heat off yr head) and an amazing Spa area with Jacuzzi pool and treatment rooms. The Art Deco design of this hotel is of outstanding beauty and really mixes well with the oldy worldy riad and the fresh plants and greenery make it truly exotic. The Villa is very central and only a ten minute walk away from the main square we had fun along the way buying a magic carpet as a souvenir of our stay. We had paid for a junior suite beautifully designed in art deco but were upgraded to the most amazing luxury Asian Art Deco Theme Suite across the way which made our stay even more amazing. The staff were absolutely fantastic so kind caring and on hand at all times. We had a Hamamm scrub in the Spa and the experience was out of his world our skin was like a babies when we left and you felt comfortable in the company of the beautician at all times .. a real must at villa Makassar. The food we experienced during our stay was amazing the cook was on hand and so friendly. From club sandwiches to the amazin Moroccan soup everything was cooked from scratch with fresh ingredients.

Villa Makassar,rogerwharf wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A real find in Marrakech - home from home,Our first trip to Morocco and Marrakech was made entirely memorable by the superb reception and service provided by Villa Makassar. A Riad in the Medina with 10 rooms all of which are presented in genuine art deco style as is the whole Riad. Everywhere you look you see pieces and furniture from that period. We stayed in the Leleu room (a great upgrade) with the furniture all from the designs of Jules Leleu. The room was a picture as we arrived and Juliette who showed us round the whole Riad made clear that this was to be treated as our home for the next 6 nights. And that is the beauty of this hotel - you feel like you are at home with staff whilst there when you need them not pressing you always smiling and polite but also friendly.    The freedom to come and go as you please around the Riad making use of all the wonderful facilities such as the peaceful roof terrace or the cooling pool. The Spa facilities were excellent and the massages that we both enjoyed were of the highest standard.    We ate dinner twice during our stay and on both occasions were treated to home cooked traditional Moroccan food which was delicious.    Never having been to Marrakech we found the advice of the staff and the manager really helpful when planning our days and our situation in the Medina meant that we were never far from the sites of interest and the hustle and bustle that typifies Marrakech.    We travel frequently and like to vary our destinations but we have promised ourselves that we shall be returning to Marrakech next year and Villa Makassar.

The hotel appears to pay little attention to detail and it is not up to the standard we were expecting after reading the good reviews. Although there were some redeeming factors (we were upgraded to a very pretty suite and the manager organised us a salad after hours even though we did not book dinner) I would look elsewhere even if I had to pay marginally more.

Having spent a while reading the previous reviews on trip advisor before we went we arrived with high expectations.    The Riad surpassed all our expectations. As soon as you walk through the door it is like walking into an oasis of calm and tranquility. We were greated by the owner and Souheil the general manager paperwork was kept to a minimum and we were shown to a lovely cool lounge area with mint tea and pastries before being offered a tour of the riad.    The Riad itself is about 15 mins walk from the main square and only about 5/10 mins walk from the square for the jewish quarter with shops and restaurants as well as palais badi and the saadian tombs.    Facilities:    The Riad itself is just beautiful the courtyards lounges and seating areas are maintained to a high standard the roof terrace was one of the highlights of our stay. Perfect for a relaxed breakfast chill with a book on one of the daybed sun loungers - lovely padded cushions with towels and lovely big straw hats so you can stay nice and cool or a sun downer drink watching the walls glow orange in the sunset - just gorgeous and so peaceful it is easy to forget you are in the middle of a city!!    We also used the pool area - the pool isn't heated but is warmed by the sun during the course of the day - it is rather chilly but lovely to cool off in! I only ever managed a paddle but my husband swam and assured me it warmed up over time.    One of the great things about the Riad is the peace and quiet you don't have waiters hovering over you every minute making you feel you should be buying drinks etc. Instead there are buttons around all the public areas that you press should you need assistance like towels or drinks. I loved this aspect of the Riad as it meant you could really enjoy time together and as there are only 10 bedrooms and plenty of different areas to relax often we didn't see any other guests despite the Riad being pretty much full the whole time we were there.    Spa    As the weather was so good whilst we were staying and we did so much sightseeing we didn't have much opportunity to use the spa but did have a 1 hour massage each. The spa area itself looked lovely with a jacuzzi pool the hammam and treatment rooms. My massage was excellent - very relaxing and well done    Food    We ate at the Riad 3 nights out of the 7 we were there. One was a complimentary meal we received as part of our booking. On one of the evenings we chose to have a cookery lesson with Fatima the chef where we learnt to make moroccan salads and tagine - a great experience and the Riad arranged for Abdul to translate for us as our French is a little rusty!! On our final night we tried the couscous and a lamb tagine. Every meal was equally as good - the food is freshly cooked - you need to let the Riad know in advance if you plan to eat that evening as Fatima goes to the market and buys the products and herbs and spices fresh for each meal. Fatima is an extremely talented chef who seems to put her heart and soul into her cooking!    Breakfast was a great experience. We ate on the roof a few mornings and sometimes down in the restaurant - it is really up to you. Breakfast again is freshly made - we usually had homemade yoghurt or fresh fruit followed by a selection of baked goods - varying from moroccan pancakes cakes french toast and rolls. Different every day - served with Fatimas homemade jams and then the opportunity to have eggs as well. - we only managed lunch one day as the breakfast was so substantial! The orange juice served at breakfast tastes amazing!!    Service:    What sets this Riad apart from others is the staff who work there. Having spent time in Asia last year we didn't think we would find the kind of service experienced there again ... how wrong we were!! The staff go above and beyond to ensure your holiday is as special as possible! Nothing is too much trouble everyone in the Riad smiles at you and over time it really felt like a home from home.    During our stay it was our first wedding anniversary and Souheil and the rest of the team did so much to ensure we had a special stay. We were given a cake had our room covered in rose petals and as a suprise after spending the day out of the Riad visiting Essaouria we returned to find out that our room had been packed up and we had been upgraded to a suite for our last two nights - they had even moved everything for us!    One of the nicest things about the way the Riad is run is the fact your happiness and enjoyment of your stay is at the centre of everything. Throughout our time at Villa Makassar the whole team provided excellent service recommending restaurants - including booking for us and arranging the taxis directing us to points of interest arranging guides making sure we had a drink after we checked out before we set off for the airport giving us our room until we need to leave for the airport late afternoon.    They are so determined to improve and be the best they can - we were asked by a number of the staff how our stay was if there was anything that we thought could be improved on.    We have never been so sad to leave a holiday and would recommend Villa Makassar to anyone who wants to experience ""Real Morocco"" have a unique experience and have the relaxation and flexibility that comes from being in a small riad compared to a large hotel.    We will definitely be back!",Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Farnborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emsi999

Villa Makassar,Andrew S wrote a review May 2013,50,"Excellent service, good location, beautiful building",What a beautiful place; the Riad was absolutely stunning the finish was excellent and the whole place is very well maintained.    Location: The Riad is located about 10-15 minutes walk from the main square and the souks; it's not very far away and it's a nice walk. The location itself is near the old city wall and quiet.    Service: The service here was excellent I mean really above and beyond what you would expect. The manager spent some time with us coming up with places to go drawing where they were for us on the map and talking us through how to get there and what to expect. Additionally all those working here were very helpful and courteous. When we had dinner the waiter took the tables outside as it was a nice evening.    Rooms: The room we had was the most basic room and I have to say it was a little small BUT having said that it was n't tiny and it was very well appointed and maintained. I really like it.    Spa / Pool / rest of the hotel: The pool of the hotel is it ground level and is generally shaded also somehow the water is freezing (as it's meant to be) which is a refreshing it's a nice area. The hotel also has a Hammam which also contains a jacuzzi which is more the size of a swimming pool. It's really refreshing and a great place to relax after going out for the day.    All-in-all this is a great place to stay I know people have a tendency to rate place more highly that already have a high rating but this really was an excellent place to stay.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewsU9192DH

Villa Makassar,Katy F wrote a review May 2013,50,First-Class Service,On entering Villa Makassar it is immediately obvious that you have chosen well. It is an oasis of calm and tranquillity. The bedrooms are stylish and the bed and bed-linen is luxurious and comfortable.    As with the majority of reviews for this property I would agree the service is excellent - not obtrusive in any way but every need is carefully catered for. Breakfast is served wherever you would like it and at whatever time you would like it - how often is that the case? Usually breakfast is served at the convenience of the hotel not the guest..    I have no doubt that Villa Makassar will quickly become one of the in places to know and visit a lovely experience and one I would not have any hesitation in recommending.,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyF352
Villa Makassar,Lollylou22 wrote a review May 2013,50,Service above and beyond !!!,We spent 3 nights of our 7 night trip to Morocco here.    Above and beyond any other praise I can give was the service we received. I travel a great deal to some very exclusive hotels/resorts and never have I experienced such outstanding service. The manager Souheil Hmittou is exceptional. Nothing was too much trouble.    From start to finish. His advice was superb on all aspects of our stay from shopping bargaining places to avoid things to see. His recommendations were accurate. He went above any beyond even organising all our restaurant bookings for the remainder of our trip after our departure from the Riad. He organised the same taxi driver to stay with us all week and negotiated the cost. When the jacuzzi didn't work in out room we were given complementary hammam and scrubs. Honestly I have never seen service like it. Always with a heart warming smile and such efficiency. He is an asset to Villa Makkassar and makes your the maze that is Marrakech that little bit easier.    The Riad itself is in an easy to find street in the Kasbah area and felt very safe. Only a 10/15 min walk to the main square. The decor is lovely and it's a tranquil calm space within the chaotic Medina. They even have a small outdoor pool as well as a wonderful roof terrace to soak up the sun.    Our scrub in the Hammam was truly amazing and I would recommend to anyone staying there.    Overall a great place to stay with service that you rarely find these days. Thank you Villa Makkasar.

The service is 1st class and no amount of money could buy how well we were looked after.  Throughout our stay every little detail had been taken care of by the staff at Villa Makassar.  We stayed from Friday 22nd March to Monday 25th March for my hen weekend and when deciding where to go we were looking for something reasonably priced but a place that was special and we could feel spoilt.  We were definitely spoilt from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. Everything we needed or requested help with was taken care of. The rooms and every area of the hotel decor is stunning. When you arrived all you could see was a wall with a wooden door but when the door opened you felt like you had just walked in to the secret garden a magical place that nobody knew was there.  We had breakfasts and two evening meals at the hotel the food was gorgeous and the service outstanding.  The Villa Makassar and all the staff made my hen weekend very special happy memories that will last forever.  I would highly recommend this Raid to anyone wanting to stay in Marrakech.

Staff is fabulous and friendly. Had a great a tour of the city with Nuhudeen (sorry if I misspelt) who knows the city inside out and taught me the secrets of an authentic tangine and a wonderful hammam scrub in the spa where the lady even washed my little chemise without any prompting which was incredibly touching. At the end of my stay the owner Fouad even gave me a bigger basket for my hand luggage so that Ryanair would not charge me 20 euros per kilo of excess luggage - I did not pay a penny more!

Villa Makassar,PhoebeSharman wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Beautiful haven in a bustling city,My mother and I recently stayed in Villa Makassar and were thoroughly impressed by the Riad as soon as we walked through the door. You would never expect such a beautiful place to be there when you're on the manic but amazing streets in the Medina.  We were met by extremely friendly and welcoming staff and the level of help and service we received throughout our stay never wavered. The riad itself is stunning the furnishings and layout are amazing and the fact that the owner spent five years travelling the world to find them gives it a lovely touch. It is so calm and peaceful you could easily never see another guest if you wanted to and we certainly were never disturbed by anyone despite there being a large group of women staying there at the same time!  We ate in the hotel for dinner and lunch on two separate occasions and the food was delicious we certainly would have eaten there more were there not so much else to explore in the city!  On our fist full day Juliette organised a tour guide for us for the morning he was a very friendly chatty man who took us to all of the main attractions gave us some great advice on haggling eating and where to go and what to see. He also took us for a proper Moroccan meal which was fantastic.  We also experienced a traditional Moroccan Hammam in the hotel spa where we were scrubbed to within an inch of our lives and left with glowing soft skin. Certainly worth a try if you stay just don’t expect it to be relaxing.

Villa Makassar,Paul E wrote a review Mar 2013,50,"A tranquil, luxurious oasis amidst a busy city",We stayed at Villa Makassar after seeing an offer for the hotel on Travelzoo.    Villa Makassar is a tranquil luxurious oasis amidst a busy city run by a passionate owner and helpful staff. Stepping in off the street through a large heavy door you’re instantly met with the scent of orange blossom and the gentle sound of a babbling fountain in the interior courtyard. After a traditional complimentary minty tea in the comfortable lounge we were given a tour of the building by the owner Fouad. It was fascinating hearing about his five year long quest to renovate the Riad in an art deco style picking pieces from around the world and bringing them together to produce a striking visual.    Our stay felt luxurious and relaxed the highlight being a breakfast of the freshest sweetest local orange juice Moroccan pastries and minty tea which we took daily on the roof terrace in full view of the Atlas mountains. We also took advantage of the traditional spa (the ‘Hammam’) for a steamy full body scrub massage and pedicure. The staff looked after us very well recommending and booking excellent restaurants and trips at our request. Any problems we had were swiftly taken care of.

Fouad and his team have created a unique and luxurious palace where anything is possible and nothing is too much trouble. The hospitality is outstanding – it was like staying at a very good friend’s house because the staff made us feel at home straight away and couldn't do enough for us. They were generous discreet and attentive and the service was impeccable.    My boyfriend took me to Villa Makassar for my birthday and the staff made it unforgettable – from the flowers in my bedroom and bathroom the night before to an amazing breakfast on the roof terrace in the sun. They even went to the trouble of recording my favourite songs on a CD and putting a flower decoration of Irises on the table (my middle name)!    There are only 10 bedrooms but the riad is enormous so it feels very private and you could easily spend a whole day there without bumping into anyone else. Every room has a different personality and a different story with pieces of art collected from all over the world. They have thought of everything and the passion that has gone into creating the riad is obvious from the moment you step inside from the open log fire in our room to the goldfish in the ceiling of the spa to the chairs that match the mosaic fountain in the middle of the riad.

Villa Makassar,NYCGirl718 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,Wonderful Experience,My husband & I had the extreme pleasure of visiting Marrakech and stayed at the Villa Makassar via Living Social deal in September 2012. Even before arrival to Villa Makassar I was in contact w/ the owner Mr. Fouad Graidia. He was extremely gracious and assured us that we would have a great time staying at the Villa & Marrakech. The trip did not disappoint! As a lover of Art Deco I absolutely loved the decor vibe and style of the Villa. The staff were extremely welcoming & gracious and made us feel nothing short of family during our entire stay. My husband got to experience first hand the joys (not) of having your luggage lost for 4 of the 7 days we were there. The staff made daily calls to the airport trying to track his lost luggage and laundered what he had on daily without request to do so. The fantastic experience extended to the guide that works wi the hotel Noureddine. Nour was knowledgeable and beyond fun. The outings exposed us to the many sides of Marrakech which was extremely rewarding. We would do it all over again in a heartbeat and if we ever get back to Marrakech - Villa Makassar would be our choice. My only regret is that it took so long to finally write the review - life in the U.S. is unfortunately back to normal.

Its a 10minute walk from the riad to the souks or the staff will call a taxi to take you anywhere you want to go. As another reviewer noted the riad truly is like a oasis; as you step in from a visit to the dusty noisy (but not to be missed) souks you find yourself in a beautiful tranquil space that is perfect for relaxing. Not to be missed! Highly recommended!,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BritinUSA6

From the moment we were met at the airport we felt in solid welcoming hands. The staff were extremely professional kind and so hospitable. They helped us quickly find our bearings in the Medina and devise a plan for our stay. The meals were lovely and the hammam is a hidden gem. The staff there is also fantastic.

Beautiful rooms and spa but the best things were the lovely roof terrace (very quiet very peaceful) and the immensely helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble. We ate breakfast on the roof terrace every day highly recommended.

Our room was beautiful with everything you could want. On our first evening we had dinner in the restaurant and the food was incredible as was breakfast on the roof terrace. Whilst there we had a hammam and a massage and both left us feeling with an incredible sense of well being and calm.  All the staff are warm friendly and go out of their way to ensure that you have the best possible stay and that your every need is met.

Villa Makassar,kimbobbc wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Stunning and fantasic service,This was my first visit to Marrakech and I had forgotten that I had come to see the city!. The accommodation and the staff were outstanding. From the time I arrived to the day I left I felt so welcome and safe. The art deco design is fabulous and there is so much attention to detail - it seemed weird having a bang and olufsen tv in the room - but it also added to the quality. I came in the quiet season - but i think that meant i appreciated it more - it's a secret you do want to share - but not with too many people. The food was good and the portions were huge...but i still managed to eat it all. I cant express enough how much the entire team made me feel welcome - everyone was very friendly and genuine. it was a great relief from the madness outside - i mean that in a nice way. but it was very calm and serene in contrast to city life outside.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimbobbc

The staff were friendly and helpful and tried very hard to please. The waiter even brought me crepes when I asked if the breakfast (served on the roof top)was a traditional Moroccan breakfast because he thought that I was unhappy with what we had!  They arranged a tour (a little pricey) for us with a very knowledgable guide that spoke english and looked after everything we needed. The room was clean and pleasant although a bit small as rooms in riads tend to be.

Villa Makassar,Eurodis wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Missing Marrakesh,MY boyfriend and I visited for a 7 night stay in October and this being my first time buying a living social deal I did not know what to expect -- however the hotel service and accommodations far exceeded my expectations! I enjoyed the fact that the hotel is on the smaller side and therefore the service is more personalized;Fouad the owner greeted us upon arrival and helped with the arrangements pertaining to our Living Social deal as well as making us feel instantly right at home. He also had arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport (and take us back) and everything went seamlessly. The entire staff was so lovely and accommodating and had wonderful recommendations. We could call each morning and request where to have breakfast but I must say my favorite spot was on the beautiful roof where I also enjoyed laying in the sun and relishing in the quiet as there was only ever 1 other couple at most while we were there. I would highly recommend the spa Hammam package - this was amazing and a highlight of the trip!!! The location of the hotel is also excellent - located within walking distance to the center and gardens. We also had an incredible guide that the hotel arranged for us - we had one day trip included in our package and some of the sites I wanted to see were outside the city so we decided to do a few trips. I had no idea it would be just us and the guide (Noor) and he was so knowledgeable speaks excellent English was so entertaining and just a lovely person. We felt so taken care of during our stay I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. As well as Marrakesh in general - I would definitely love to go back and see more and recommend others travel here as well!,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eurodis
Villa Makassar,slyskiesh wrote a review Nov 2012,40,"Couldn't fault the service, beautiful rooms",My boyfriend and I came here for 5 days in September. When we first arrived we were in awe of the place it was one of the most beautiful hotels I'd ever seen. The room was spacious and I loved that is came with a jacuzzi! We made a good use of the pool each day it wasn't a huge space but luckily we were the only ones that seemed to go down there so was nice to have it to ourselves the whole time! One of our only criticisms would be that where the pool was built it was beside a wall and so the whole pool was usually in darkness by 3/4pm and so if you wanted more time in the sun you would have to go up to the roof. The staff were second to none and couldn't do enough for you there was always someone around you could ask for help/information/food/directions and they were so friendly you sometimes ended up in half hour long conversations with them. The highlight of the place is by far being able to have breakfast on the roof. I couldn't think of a better way to start the day and the food was amazing with something new everyday! The Villa Makassar and Morocco was an amazing experience and I would certainly recommend to all my friends and family to stay there if they ever went to Morocco.

As soon as we arrived at the airport everything was taken care of: Our driver picked us up and drove us to the Riad; Never in our dreams could we have imagined the treasures that laid behind the discreet entrance door of Villa Makassar!    We were fortunate to be personally greeted by the owner whose passion for Art Déco was evident. He showed us around and spoke about the many artefacts and art displayed around the Riad which he gathered during his travels around the world.    Our room was simply luxurious the breakfast generous and the staff discrete and very welcoming.  We opted for a half-board stay and over the next 4 days we were spoilt and enjoyed delicious meals.    Special thanks to Raouia head the SPA a miracle-worker who spoke perfect English.

Villa Makassar,Deborah S wrote a review Oct 2012,50,An amazing oasis in a truly wonderful country,"My husband surprised me with a trip to Marrakech. I couldn't have been more delighted with the villa he chose. It is a true diachotomy of serene accommodation and exciting chaos of the city. What a beautiful place to return to after a day of climbing the Atlas Mountains or shopping in the medina.    When we first arrived at the villa on a flight from Spain it was nearing midnight in Marrakech. The evening clerk greeted us with such warmth and said ""Come in you are home now. It is late and we will take care of the paperwork tomorrow. You must rest now."" At first glance we were in love with this special place.    Foud and the staff are amazing and most accommodating. From the attention to detail in the decor to the amazing meals (thanks to the fabulous chef) to the special spa - hammam treatment and the roof-top deck...it is spectacular. In the mornings you wake to the enchanting sounds of call to prayer. I cannot say enough...    We will be back again to visit our friends at Villa Makkasar. There was only one problem.

My first experience was with Fouad the owner who responded to every email request quickly and thoroughly. When we arrived the staff was very welcoming and the atmosphere was serene. We had the good fortune to have a chance to meet Fouad on our first night - it was a pleasure to speak to someone who loves what they do and takes pride in their business. The attention to details in the riad were incredible with absolutely everything thought of to make it the perfectly 'Art Deco' themed escape. Our food was delicious and massages were divine. I have been to Marrakech 6 times and would definitely return for a stay with Fouad and his staff. It was very well located to anywhere we wanted to go and we could not have asked for more attentive service. We went to Marrakech this time for a special occasion - my partner's birthday.

Every last detail is taken care of the mirrors the cabinets the silver tea pots the deco cutlery the beautiful lamps and artwork. This all leads to the amazing ambience created.

Villa Makassar,Philip F wrote a review Sep 2012,50,"A Place for calm, quality and excellence",We had a wonderful stay at Villa Makassar made all the better by the caring attitude of all the staff and the fantastic decor that is found within this riad. It is plainly evident that much work has gone into the redesign of the Villa and sure enough it has taken 5 years of very hard work to achieve the standard that is very self evident.  It is also very clear that the quality found within Villa Makassar is not just in the building and decor it is also found within the staff attitudes and their approasch to their work. We enjoyed dinner on the first evening having arrived late due to delays at immigration and as with everything at Villa Makassar the meal was delicious from start to finish and nothing was to much trouble.  The Villa is situated in old Marrakech near the Kasbah region and not to far from the Royal Palace. Although only just in old Marrakech he Medina is within walking distance taking approx 15 - 20 mins at a pace to suit the weather. Taxis into the Medina area cost for the 4 of us approx 50 dirham if this was preferred to walking particularly if returning to the Villa after a days sightseeing.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"St Helens, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reunion_8

Villa Makassar,PurplLife wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Must for Art Deco lovers,When i got out of the taxi i couldn`t even imagine what will wait me inside. Simple walls of the building like through all Marrakech. But after the doorman opened the door i was getting inside gorgeous dark hall with stella statue in the end of it. Very nice first impresion. Villa itself is a redisigned riad and it was made in a great way. Owner have a great taste. He mixed gorgeous objects made of precious materials to creat a special and unique athmosphere for each room. I got a room after Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann with a great mix of real old Mamounia pieces of furniture wich was bought on the auction with beautiful modern details like a great python skin covered head of the bed or pink slope skin jewelry box. Bathroom was really big as well with a nice roof window so u can have natural sunlight in the shower in the morning. There are 2 pools - indoor in the spa and open one. Water in the open one is a lil bit cold but ok. From the spa u can use elevatore to get to the roof top terrace with the bar ( it was clothed when i was there) where u can tan all day long. At the sitting room there are a lot of albums about art and decoration so i was spending part of my eve lying on Corbusier`s chaise lounge watching throuh them. As i was there during non season time ( Ramadan) i was all alone there so service was all up 2 me (regarding breakfast dinner and so on). Hotel have its own really strong character and spirit. Should be visited in Marakesh.And in contrast to bustle Medina area i was really feel i want not to get out of this beautiful place.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Moscow, Russia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PurplLife

Quite modern lots of dark wood and furnishings in the rooms.    Our aircon didn't work in our first room so they kindly moved us to another room. Then the TV stopped working so they opened up the adjoining room for us to use the TV in there.    Its a shame that there were not more guests I think we were the only people for most of our 4 night stay but it was low season start of Ramadan and 45-48 degrees everyday!    The food / breakfast was very good - no complaints there. The hammam was also nice with the scrub and massage.

Villa Makassar,Linda L wrote a review Jun 2012,50,A nice way to treat yourself :),Everything one would expect and more from a 5 star accommodation can be found in Villa Makassar.  We checked in late in the evening as we had just came back from the desert… but straight away we were very impressed with the décor and the details of every corner of this villa.  In the morning we were greeted by very kind and professional staff. The very delicious continental breakfast was served very generous portions and breakfast is served at anytime at last someone understands that when you are on holiday you don’t necessarily want to set your alarm to make it on time for breakfast!!  After breakfast we were shown around the beautiful villa we had the opportunity to have a peek at the other rooms and immediately you realise that every room was unique and done up to the highest standard. We were very impressed by one of the rooms and the management team offered to upgrade us to this room as it was available (great customer service)  The Villa has a beautiful terrace which is very well maintained and clean towels were available at all times  The swimming pool was very nice and clean.  The sauna hammam and beauty spa downstairs are very nice and have a very nice ambiance. Again the finish was of very high standard and little details that you can’t help but appreciate like aquariums above you whilst relaxing in the spa room.  I would def. recommend the massage. The lady was very professional smiley and lovely.    We had dinner and couple of lunches. The dinner was very good and the dessert was exceptionally tasty.

Villa Makassar,JessicaRevilla wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Nothing Short of Amazing,I came to Marrakech with my sister. Being two women traveling alone we were nervous at first. However we immediately came to realize how safe the city was. Our riad was beautiful! The art deco theme was gorgeous the service staff was fast and were warm and friendly. As soon as we got there the manager met us took us on a tour and let us pick our room. We were allowed to stay in a senior villa even though our living social promotion said junior suite which was nice! We stayed in the Victor Sassoon room. It was spacious clean and decorated beautifully. We had a tv and a dvd player which was great because we brought a lot of movies. The bathroom was extremely modern and also clean. We also had a table with two chairs and a leather couch. Perfect room for two people. The daily breakfast was very good and the lunch menu was delicious. The terrace is absolutely beautiful and the perfect place to lay out in the sun. The manager Soufiane is amazing and made us feel like we were at home. He's hysterical! The office staff organized every single excursion for us. We didn't have to do anything! They even hailed our cabs for us. Everything was taken care of. If you only speak English ask for Nour as your driver. He took us everywhere we went stayed with us all day when we went out and was almost like our bodyguard. He has great experience even working with royalty from England who come here. He would take us for our excursions during the day and then take us out to Marrakech at night and made sure we were okay all night. This vacation was simply the best and staying at Villa Makassar made it even better. Next year we plan on going on a Eurotrip with our parents and we are planning to bring them to Morocco and of course staying at Villa Makassar!,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaRevilla
Villa Makassar,leighv wrote a review May 2012,30,Gorgeous place but...,Like the other reviewer - this hotel was booked via a promotion.    First impressions - excellent. We arrived at the Villa around 11.30am was welcomed paperwork was kept to a minimum and we were escorted to a reception room where we were served green tea and pastries excellent. Then we had a small tour of the Villa - again excellent. We were then informed that our room was not ready fair enough and we elected to then go to the roof terrace to relax. At 13.45 over 2 hours later - still no room. Nobody came to inform us how long the room was going to be - whether we wanted to have something or perhaps go somewhere nothing. It wasn't until I went downstairs and asked - I was asked whether I had my room yet was then escorted to the room - which still wasn't ready.    We then decided to explore a little - so we came back to the Villa later in the afternoon. Firstly the satellite box wasn't working. I tried one of the members of staff tried another member of staff tried and finally the manager (owner?) tried. Still nothing.    When I had alerted the staff to the TV issue I also had to ask about the time of the dinner as well as the breakfast because there simply just isn't the info in the room nor is it communicated. I additionally requested a bottle opener and one of the members of staff said that she would speak to the boss. No corkscrew was received. 30 minutes later I went on the search for the elusive corkscrew and found out why I hadn't received it. The manager (owner?) was at reception and when I asked for a bottle opener he dispatched a member of staff for one. But then he had a few words with me.    He asked me where I had bought the wine and that normally they don't allow outside alcohol to be brought in from outside. FIne - but my view is that unless I'm told then how can I abide by these 'rules' but I apologised and said that I wasn't aware - which I wasn't . But the second part of the conversation was more troubling. He then told me that because we had such a great deal on the room then basically he needs to make his money somehow so..... Question: so if I had paid top price would I be able to bring in alcohol - the indication was that I would. It would have been nice if somebody had come to tell me that's why I had received no corkscrew rather than me again asking for it.  End result: the member of staff came to my room - I gave him the bottle of wine he opened it and then took the corkscrew away. All very very strange....    The 'piece de la resistance' was when I reviewed my bill when I got home. I had been overcharged!!! Not for one item - but for 2 items. It was well 'hidden' but the calculation on the bill was wrong. Am I being paranoid if I think that it's another way to recoup the difference between what we paid and what the list price is? I emailed the owner. I was promised a refund. 4 weeks later - nothing. I emailed again. Finally I got a refund!!!!    My advice to the owner/management - treat every customer the same. You have set the price for the rooms whether it's direct a promotion etc. If you don't want the business don't do the promotions but this guest segmentation/categorisation/racism will not win you many votes of approval. Nor will you create an empathy that makes guests spend on those additional items - in fact quite the opposite - they will try their best to make sure they don't.    The WIFI coverage is patchy at best - unreliable - and also very very slow.    Despite what one reviewer wrote we found the breakfast on the roof excellent. Lot's of choice ample quantity - really really good. The same goes for the included dinner Really really good.    BTW - the description of the Villa states that the outside swimming pool is heated. It isn't.    My advice - if you have the money to pay full list price stay at the La Sultana just up the road.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chippenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leighv
Villa Makassar,Lulu wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Perfect place to stay in Marrakech,As two ladies travelling alone to Marrakech we were keen to stay somewhere that felt safe as well as indulgent and we couldn't have picked a better riad than Villa Makassar for our adventure.  The staff were so friendly and welcoming we felt very special. The twin room we stayed in was spacious clean and attractively decorated. The bathroom was nice with a good shower although drainage was a little slow. The breakfast was plentiful and especially lovely on the rooftop terrace. The dinner was equally good. We had a brilliant fun hammam and body scrub experience followed by a very relaxing massage. The jacuzzi was a little cool on the first day but the current machine is a good idea for a small pool.  Villa Makassar is about a 15 min walk to the main square but it is a straight road and in a good area so we didn't mind doing it even late at night. The door has a security camera and the staff will look out for you when you return.  I really don't think I could fault the place and would jump at the chance to return.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Aylesbury,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/383lulu05
Villa Makassar,Constance R wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Just as Pictured,The Villa Makassar riad is just as beautiful as in the pictures. Everything is new and spotless. The floors are cool and the marbled bathrooms a pleasure. There are many nooks and crannies throughout the hotel where we sat and enjoyed the art the singing if birds and a cool drink. The staff is very friendly and professional able to advise and willing to help. The manager Fouad is a warm and cosmopolitan man. The day trip they arranged for us to Atlas Mountain villages and nature walks was a highlight. We were 2 single women but this is also a hreat place for a romantic getaway.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Constanceny
Villa Makassar,Sue B wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Sue & Colin Cheshire,Villa Makassar is a wonderful riad with its beautiful 'Art Deco' interior with every attention to the finest details. It is located in the hustle and bustle of the Kasbar where real Moroccon life goes on but as soon as you enter the front door its tranquility awaits. We found the owner of the villa very hospitable and his staff attentive and polite. They were wonderful helping me with phone calls to the airport to retrieve my lost luggage which arrived two days later. Our room was both comfortable and chic and the food we had a chicken and lemon tajine as well as the breakfasts were very good. I would recommend the villa also for its location only about a ten minute gentle stroll to the main square.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,marakesh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/27SueB
Villa Makassar,deborahHungerford wrote a review Apr 2012,50,elegant and luxurious,My husband and I stayed at Villa Makassar for a few days at the beginning of April. We couldn't praise the accommodation more highly. The attention to detail was outstanding and the owner Fouad was charming. He has sought and found the most exquisite artefacts from the Art Deco period and furnished his Riad with his prized possessions and made the villa quite beautiful. It is a privilege to be able to view the art and furniture whilst also enjoying the calm and serenity of this oasis in the middle of the busy narrow streets of the kasbah. The staff are all most attentive and pleasant. The manager Sofitane went way beyond the call of duty when a taxi we had ordered failed to arrive and he drove us to the restaurant himself.. A gem of a place to stay.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,hungerford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahHungerford
Villa Makassar,Fredex wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Perfect Location and warm staff,"We stayed for four nights at the Villa Makassar within the walls of the Medina and only a ten minute walk from the lively square Jamma al Fna. The hotel has been completely refurbished in an Art Deco style with original furniture and original art including 19th Century posters adorning the walls of the rooms and the public areas. We were there last week at the beginning of the tourist season but the weather was against us with average unseasonable temperatures of around 16C if we were lucky. The staff are superb and very attentive. The Spa offers a Hamman (steam room) and massage facilities with a jacuzzi. The walled outdoor pool looked fabulous but due to the weather we decided to give it a miss. The owner Fouad Graida is perfect as ""mine host"" and will make sure you have a good time. Will we go back - certainly.",Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Milton Keynes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fredex
Villa Makassar,daveo67 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,A wonderful home from home.......,My wife and I have just returned from a memorable 3 night stay at Villa Makassar. We can't speak highly enough of the accommodation levels of service friendly and helpful staff and the great location in the Medina. In particular the manager Sofiane is efficient friendly and welcoming. He arranged excellent guides for us for a walking tour of the Medina/Souk and a trip to the Ourika mountains and recommended a beautiful Italian restaurant where we dined. Our room (Jules Leleu) was stylish spacious and comfortable and breakfast on the roof terrace each morning was a particular highlight. The Riad was an oasis of tranquility away from the hustle and bustle of the Medina. We both had relaxing massages in the Spa at the Riad and there are small indoor and outdoor swimming pools. I would recommend the Riad for a relaxing stay in wonderful Marrakech and wouldn't hesitate to return for another stay in the future.,Date of stay: March 2012,,"Whitefield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveo67
Villa Makassar,LFOX79 wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Delightful,My mother & I had a memorable stay at the Villa Makassar in December 2011. We used a travelzoo voucher to treat ourselves to a trip to Marrakesh with a stay at a luxury riad :) Villa Makassar is situated down a slightly noisy street in the Medina but you would never know it as its a quiet zen of a place once you walk inside.    The voucher was a fantastic offer as it is a very beautiful art deco riad beautifully laid out with its own indoor pool and hammam. The deal included dinner as well as a hammam. Dinner was delicious; canapes chicken tagine and a delightful pastry dessert called Ktefa. Our waiter was particularly attentive and very friendly and helped teach us some arabic words to get us by during the stay :)    We had a lovely twin room. We had a problem with the shower as it didnt have hot water but as soon as we reported it someone came to look into it immediately and when he couldnt help the charming owner came round to investigate. We were promptly given a key to another room we could use for the duration of our stay to use the shower there (even though our shower was fixed the next day).    Our hammam at the riad was a fantastic experience. Do not leave without having one!    On the whole a delightful stay in Marrakesh.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LFOX79
Villa Makassar,Marion G wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Art deco heaven!!!,An amazing Art Deco riad made of two riads joined together so you have plenty of communal areas and it does not feel clostrophobic like some smaller riads do. I have NEVER seen such attention to detail and luxury in a riad (and I have visited many). No wonder this hotel has been featured in top interior design magazines! The owner is delightful and the staff very attentive. After the Mamounia was re decorated in a less art-deco way Marrakech needed a beautiful art deco place and this is it! Easy access by car all the way to the riad's entrance great central area.  And it has a pool and a state of the art spa. Note that the pool is separated from the rooms so even if kids play in it you won't be disturbed by the noise.  The riad is very quiet you won't get woken up by the call for prayer at 5am!  Could not recommend it more to anyone looking for elegance luxury and style in Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariong267
Villa Makassar,Craig M wrote a review Jan 2012,30,Living Social / Groupon? Beautiful Riad - Treatments & Food Sub-standard,This place itself is stunning however to sum it up there are two very different levels to this place and what they offer. If you stay here paying full 'rack rate' I imagine it is perfect. I had a peek at the other rooms and they look amazing. Myself and my partner stayed here on a Groupon / Living Social Deal still at 130 quid a night and as we were on the 'deal' you could not help but notice you were offered sub-standard service. The room we had was 'okay' nowhere near as nice as the others. Shower pressure is rubbish and there was a leak from the roof the ceiling into the bathroom which was left to drip onto a towel.  We were looking forward to our inclusive meal which turned out to be a joke. Soup for starter was awful one chicken leg for our mains course accompanied with nothing was actually quite tasty and dessert consisted of 3 slices of oranges & 2 Slices of Kiwi Fruit & a dusting of cinnamon. Soup & Dessert was sent back to the kitchen with not even a question to ask how our meal was. Wine was paid for and very poor taste along with the poor tasting coffee throughout the stay. Breakfast is not even worth typing about.    Do not pay for a massage as it turns out to be a back rub by one of the kitchen staff. Very annoyed we did not bring this to the owners attention.    Having said that as a whole the Riad is beautiful and if you were paying full price and if the food on offer is as suggested in their website then fully recommend it. If you are going on a 'deal' well put it this way we certainly won't be going back!,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigM885

The service from Soufiane the manager and his attentive team was superb. From when we arrivedto the mint tea provided before our free transfer to the airport was faultless. The Art Deco interior is amazing we've never stayed in a hotel as beautiful or luxurious before. Our room was so comfortableI wish I had a bedroom like it at home.We've not slept so well for ages.Very quiet.The bed-linen and pillows felt lovely to the touch.  The food was excellenta real slice of authentic Morrocco cuisineand we could even have an alcoholic drink which is hard to come by outside.The breakfast was up on the sunny roof-terracea great start to the day.There was even a lift provided for elderly/disabled residents.  The bathroom was plush and lavish. The shower was incredibleit even had music.Largethick dressing-gowns and slippers were provided.

Villa Makassar,Jo_Syd_2008 wrote a review Dec 2011,50,An oasis of calm,We had the pleasure of staying in Villa Makassar for 5 nights recently and cannot praise it highly enough. We arrived by taxi arranged by the hotel and were slightly anxious when it drew up in a narrow street in the heart of the Kasbah where nothing appeared to have changed in hundreds of years - but what a surprise as we entered the hotel through a dimly lit corridor into a beautiful courtyard where all was calm and tranquility! We were warmly greeted by very gracious staff and from then on we were treated to nothing but first class service and attention. Villa Makassar is a stunning bistro hotel restored in traditional riad style but exquisitely furnished with original Art Deco furniture and accessories - the whole building is a work of art. We were very fortunate to be upgraded to the grande executive room which was fabulous however we were able to see some of the other rooms which are all stunning each with a different theme but with the Art Deco style running throughout. During our stay we treated ourselves to a hammam in the lovely spa which we can highly recommend. The charming owner Fouad Graidia can be justifiably proud of what he has created at Villa Makassar and his wonderful staff make it very hard to leave when it is time to go!,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jo_Syd_2008

Villa Makassar,Jorge P wrote a review Sep 2011,50,a refuge from chaos,"I insisted on going to Marrakesh - it was my 3rd time always trying to find what attracts so many people.  The crowd the heat the noise the smell are the same and have not changed much in 30 years. Well it's different from what we are used to in Europe and pardon my expression that con be considered snobbish being different is not always enough. Nowadays instead of handcrafts from Morocco whose authenticity was already arguable in the 80ies when have now fake Vuittons fake Cartiers and fake Polos mixed with some plastic and a very few shops with medium quality crafts.  Modern city is disappointing - an ostentatious nouveau-riche style based on cheap ""main d'oeuvre"" where you may have a first class dinner at Le Grand Comptoir for instance for a third of price you are used to pay.  ""Harassment"" by sellers is tooooo much!  For me that's not enough and is not the definition of an ""exotic"" destination!  Villa Makassar was my fortress in this ""hostile"" environment.  Quiet beautifully decorated elegant and delicious dinners and above all a warmly and intelligent reception by the owners and employees. made my stay in Marrakesh become positive.",Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lisbon, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saojose170

The warm welcome took us through the stunning courtyard with a sunken fountain surrounded by comfortable sitting rooms furnished in Art Deco style as are all 10 individually designed bedrooms with period pieces collected from around the world. Our room was superb very comfortable with nice extra touches and incredibly quiet (no children allowed). The staff treated us like royalty nothing too much trouble and no fixed times for dining. The meals were a highlight of our 3 day stay. The Moroccan chef prepares a wide range of local dishes beautifully; we left the choice to her and enjoyed one excellent meal after another much more varied than we would have expected. The spacious courtyards outdoor pool and rooftop terrace with bar and tables to dine on if you wish with the stunning Atlas mountains as a backdrop add to its splendour.

Villa Makassar,Mae7771 wrote a review Feb 2011,50,A little gem in the Kasbah,My husband and I chose Marrakech as a weekend destination from the UK as it's only around 3 hours away from London. We were looking to stay somewhere special for 4 nights and were told about this new 'Art Deco' hotel in the Kasbah so we decided to give it a try.    We were picked up from the airport by Jaguar limo and the drive to the Riad took about 10 minutes. From the moment we walked in we knew this place would be special: we walked down this cool elegant corridor at the end of which stood an elegant Art Deco statue which seemed to greet us ! The place then 'opened' up onto a bright courtyard. We were greeted by a smartly dressed friendly (and multilingual!) gentleman who turned out to be the owner who showed us around. Every room (10 of them) looked amazing and different in style.    We slept in the Africa-inspired Clement Rousseau room which was very large and comfortable with flatscreen TV complimentary (non-alcoholic) minibar ensuite bathroom and even a large marble fireplace which they lit up for us. Meals consisted of delicious Moroccan dishes and our waiter Mohammed was excellent. We loved the Winston Churchill bar - very cosy with comfy leather seats. The hotel isn't far from Djemma-El-Fna square and souks etc so it is a great location for sightseeing as well.    This hotel was nothing like we had ever seen before so different and full of beautiful works of art. It was a lovely break from cold grey London and we are looking forward to going back !!,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mae7771
