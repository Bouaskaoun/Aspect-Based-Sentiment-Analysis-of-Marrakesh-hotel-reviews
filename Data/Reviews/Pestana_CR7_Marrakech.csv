The hotel is located at a very beautiful avenue with restaurants and shops and beautiful view from our room. The only feedback I would give is that service needs to be improved on. We would call the front desk multiple times and they wouldn’t answer and asked multiple times for towels until they brought it up.

Pestana CR7 Marrakech,Zakir P wrote a review Feb 2023,50,My second stay memorable and stellar,This was my second time in this hotel and all I experienced was an upgraded service to my already stellar visit last time a few months back. I could not praise the staff enough! Maryama and Khaleel at the check in were constantly looking for opportunities to provide better service they upgraded my room 3 times! Likewise the staff in the breakfast including Sana Fatima and Yassine were among the best of the best! Be careful they will make you feel home immediately and feed you too much :) I mostly skipped my lunch! The hotel quality and location are top notch I love the new neighborhood tucked away from hustle bustle but still accessible and upscale by all measures.

Pestana CR7 Marrakech,skarim9 wrote a review Dec 2022,50,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff!",We have visited marrakech multiple times but this is probably the best hotel we have stayed in. The rooms are immaculately clean spacious and very modern and we had a lovely view overlooking M Avenue from our balcony.    Then there’s the staff - we were extremely well looked after by Safae throughout our entire stay from the moment we arrived to the moment we left - no ask was too much and she took care of all of our requests efficiently and with the utmost professionalism and made us feel like very important guests (as I’m sure she did will all hotel guests) - she made our entire stay that much more enjoyable! Abdelilah was also another member of staff who made our stay memorable who took the time out every evening to check in with us and to ensure we had everything we needed. The staff at breakfast were great especially the two lovely ladies at the egg and flatbread station who gave us service with a smile every morning.    I can’t recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be staying here again on my next visit to Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skarim9

Pestana CR7 Marrakech,meisje_ang wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Pretty hotel including sublime service,Our first visit in Marocco and so is Marrakech. We choose this hotel based on -of course- the collab with CR7 but also the impression and reviews when searching for an accommodation. I can only say: what I saw and read before arrival which were all very positive I saw it with my own eyes.    Starting at the entrance the service was sublime. From the employees who helped us with luggage check in swimmingpool till cleaning ladies.    Every day it was a nice vibe at the restaurant where we had our breakfast. From the 5 days we stayed 3 days we got a good fast and pleasant service of Yassine. He was very helpful and also gave us good tips of Marrakech.  Also a lady (don’t know her name) was very customer focused and asked if we had any tips on improving their breakfast offer/ variety. But in our opinion it was various and delicious enough for a breakfast.    I would definitely go back to this place when staying in Marrakech.    A real recommendation!,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meisje_ang
Pestana CR7 Marrakech,Mounia wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Marrakech vacation,Would highly recommend it. It wasn’t my first choice and I’m glad the other hotels were full.  It is in the new M Avenue the new it area in marrakech. No cars nice restaurants and shops VERY clean and close to all the touristic areas.  What pushed me to write this review is the perfect service they go the extra mile to give you the best experience.  Abdelali the pool guy Soukaina the waitress the bellboy the front desk staff everyone was exceptional. Not to forget the breakfast lady (I don’t remember her name) who brought a whole buffet to our room for an extra 25dh she kept on suggesting dishes that we might want to try.  The food was exceptional as well and very filling.  My favorites were the mushroom appetizer and the steak sandwich. Actually everything we tried was good.  The only little thing is the pillows are a bit too big but the bed was so comfortable it wasn’t a big bother.  I added the view from my room,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Marrakech, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moimk

Pestana CR7 Marrakech,Sara wrote a review Oct 2022,30,Disappointed,Room service was bad and slow. They only understand French.  They didn’t understand what an iron is. by the time we explained (twice) they delivered it late (as we exited).  We asked for toilet rolls we got a trash can!  We asked for milk saches we got a milk pot with cups!    We were in a room for three but towels complimentary shampoo slippers.. etc were all for two. We didnt bother to ask for one more coz they wont understand us anyway. Everything was sign language.    WiFi didnt work in the entire room had to sit by the door to get signal.    Slow service in general. Disappointed tbh. Will try another hotel next time.    Overall if you're going because of the CR7 its just a title on the hotel.
