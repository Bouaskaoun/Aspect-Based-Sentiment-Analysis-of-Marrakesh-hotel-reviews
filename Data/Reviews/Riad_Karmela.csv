Riad Karmela,Andrew P wrote a review Mar 24,50,Authentic Moroccan experience in the heart of the medina,In the heart of the medina and within easy walking distance of all the sights in Marrakesh except the Jardin Majorelle and Yves Saint Laurent museum the Riad Karmela proved to be an authentic Moroccan experience. Set around traditional courtyards one of which serves as the restaurant the rooms are spacious and furnished with beautiful local objects. Breakfast was divine and the evening meals we had excellent. The desserts in particular were inventive. Alcohol is served throughout the day whether you’re dining or not which was unique in our experience. The staff were unfailingly charming and helpful and although it’s perhaps unfair to pick out one individual Amine one of the evening waiters is a treasure. The Riad would be impossible to find the first time on one’s own so best to organise a taxi from the airport etc through the Riad which provided an excellent map and instructions on how to navigate the surrounding narrow streets and lanes. The only downside but one that is impossible to overcome if staying in the medina - and who would want to stay in a soulless hotel outside the city walls - is being woken every morning around 0615 by the call to prayer! Would definitely return.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350AndrewP
Riad Karmela,932Charles wrote a review May 2022,50,Superb Staff,The Staff at Riad Karmela are so warm; they take time and care for all their global guests. They go out of their way to accommodate late departure times and even though we were there at Ramadan they pointed us in the right direction for all the cultural sites.    We were there on May 1st when the 'TukTuks' (small modes of transportation) were on a labour strike (TFL in London also practice this show of labor so it wasn't an imposition) as the hotel simply ordered a taxi instead to get us to the Yves St. Laurent Museum and Jardin Majorelle.    The Staff--- from the security guard who is so kind to the young boy who kicked a soccer ball around with my husband to the lovely wait staff at Breakfast who greeted everyone with their beautiful smiles and incredibly fresh orange juice--- are 5 star.,Date of stay: April 2022,,"Chicago, Illinois",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932Charles
Riad Karmela,Happy understanding customer wrote a review Mar 23,50,Lovely time at Riad Karmela,This is the most amazing place. I have stayed at quite a few roads over the years but the hospitality at this one is just amazing.  The accommodation is typical Moroccan. The food is lovely and the staff are amazing. They just can’t do enough for you.  Thank you all so much for a lovely holiday with you,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francessuzanne
Riad Karmela,DAVID s wrote a review Mar 21,50,4 night stay 14/18th March,I cannot praise the hotel and staff enough. It proved be an oasis of calm in the hustle and bustle of the medina. Good food good service and helpful friendly staff. We ran into difficulties with airport transfers and trips booked with other providers and the hotel came to the rescue sending a member of staff to collect us from where we were stranded on the transfer from the airport. Similarly when a trip pick up point was changed at short notice and the new location inaccurately given the hotel contacted the provider and escorted us to the new location. On the day of our check out we had wanted to book a massage in the hotel and reception changed the room cleaning schedule so that we could have a later check-out and enjoy our massage with time to freshen up afterwards. The private roof terrace was a nice place to enjoy a glass of wine and watch the sunset.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DAVIDs23653
Riad Karmela,D Metcalfe wrote a review Mar 19,50,A Fantastic Experience,I cannot rate the lovely staff and service we had during our recent stay for 7 days at Riad Karmela.  Bouchra and all the staff were so exceptional and helpful that when I accidentally left my coat there they posted it back to me in the UK. The Riad is traditionally decorated and in the perfect position to walk to the main Medina. The ambiance and entertainment in the dining room was beautiful of an evening with soft lighting and the lovely water feature gave a relaxing atmosphere as did the many comfortable lounging areas around the Riad. I would highly recommend it as we would definitely return.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanddmiles
Riad Karmela,Maureen g wrote a review Mar 16,50,"FIVE STAR SERVICE, THE VERY BEST ANYWHERE",My husband and I are senior citizens who spent four nights and five days at this fabulous hotel. In order to give an honest review I have to say that it is not luxurious by US standards but it is exceptionally clean and nicely appointed. What Riad Karmela has that many places do not is the best service and the utmost courtesy we have ever experienced bar none. If we needed a reservation a taxi a tok tok a meal or virtually anything the employees here are excellent in securing it fast and on time. There was nothing we asked that was too big a deal and service was delivered with courtesy and smiles. Since we do not speak Arabic and our French is high school level we were wholly dependent on this superb staff to make our stay the best it could--and they delivered big time. On arrival we were greeted by Fatima an English-speaking desk clerk who gave us mint tea and a plate of delicious cookies. She provided a map and explained where everything is and patiently answered our questions. A Frenchman who manned the desk (sorry I didn’t get his name) was funny and extremely accommodating.    The hotel is located in the complicated maze of the Medina and difficult to find even after we had been here a few days. But Karmella has a man in a jalaba stationed near its entrance whose sole job 12 hours a day is to make sure you get where you are supposed to go. He literally walks you to the taxi stand or from where the taxi drops you off which is not an insignificant distance from the hotel’s entrance.    We had a free breakfast every day but only realized on the second day that there is a sign that says you have to ask for eggs which we did. All of the other meals we had here were delicious from the tagine dinner to the vegetable pizza lunch to the breakfast omelettes. We are foodies but ate here more often because we were nervous about dining at local restaurants or eating street food. We felt completely safe dining here. There are two turtles who patrol the main dining room and several small birds that have also taken up residence there. A large friendly cleaning crew is constantly wiping dusting and mopping. We had fresh sheets fluffy towels and robes in our room daily. We did not have wash cloths which was not that important. Our room had air conditioning and TV but unless you understand the local language the TV is useless. We had a large bathroom with two sinks and a shower with a square rain head. This was our first time in Marrakesh and are beyond thankful for the supreme hospitality of Riad Karmella.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U2383PFmaureeng
Riad Karmela,Harvey B wrote a review Mar 5,50,Excellent 4 day city break - highly recommended Riad,In the heart of the Medina this Riad was excellent value for money. Well run and maintained the owners were on site and highly visible all the time. The staff were attentive and friendly without being over the top. The rooms were clean and comfortable with bottled water provided every day. Bathrobes provided and towels changed daily bedding changed halfway through our stay (after 2 nights). We chose to eat dinner in the Riad the food was well cooked and tasty and good value too.  We took 2 trips advertised in the Riad and both were well organised.  You cannot get to the Riad's main door by taxi and have to walk about 5 to 10 minutes but the taxi call the hotel and they send someone to meet you they also take you back to the pick up point when you leave so don't worry about getting lost in the maze of streets and alleyways that make up the Medina.  In short we would definitely choose to stay here again.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198harveyb
Riad Karmela,bethp02 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Totally recommend,A well run welcoming and friendly place to stay. All the staff were so helpful and considerate. Beautiful building hidden away amongst the bustle/chaos of the streets outside. Bedroom was large and comfortable and communal areas so varied throughout the building - inside and out sat by fire in the bar one day and then in sunshine on the roof. Highly recommend.

Riad Karmela,Ian R wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Superb 4 day break at Riad Zineb/Karmela,Cannot recommend the Karmela and Zineb ( which is just around the corner) highly enough. Superb oasis of peace and tranquility after a day in the chaos of central Marrakesh. I suggest Book your airport transfers with them not the holiday provider and get your currency and trips through them. Evening meals are way better than any commercial restaurant out there and much better value.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianrW4495ZE
Riad Karmela,Kim T wrote a review Feb 2023,50,"Great place to stay! Accomodation, Location and Staff - all great for me! Loved my stay here!",I booked Riad Karmela having read the reviews and noted its great location!  I was not disappointed! I was delighted with my choice! Just great for me!  Joel (owner) and his team of staff were excellent in every way! Every member of staff was so nice and personable and clearly listened to all their guests - nothing was ever too much trouble to sort any requests! They all certainly helped me with my queries!.  All the staff were so kind receptive and appeared happy in Riad Karmela which is a reflection on Joel's excellent management.  Would highly recommend a stay at Riad Karmela.  My daughter who did not accompany me on this visit wishes to visit Marrakech in the near future with me and we will be definitely returning to Riad Karmela.  Highly recommended - please book a taxi pick up direct with Riad Karmela in advance of arrival in Marrakech - it is an excellent safe service and good value for money.

Riad Karmela,TheRays468 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,A hidden gem,We have just returned from a 4 night stay at Riad Karmela. Hidden away in the Old Medina it is an oasis of calm in the busy city of Marrakech. The decor is authentic Morrocan with gorgeous tile and plasterwork lovingly cared for by their fabulous staff. The staff make a pleasurable stay an excellent one. They are friendly and always on hand to care for their guests. Dinner in the Riad is excellent and reasonably priced.

Riad Karmela,kt.schutte wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Fantastic location and service!,Absolutely gorgeous place to stay - beautiful architecture plants and staircase. Loved reading on the terrace in the afternoons.  The breakfast buffet was simply amazing: yoghurt fresh fruit an array of different breads honey and various spreads boiled eggs and omlettes cakes pancakes/ crepes and pastries. I have coeliac disease and they provided gluten free bread and cake every morning (fresh and warm)! Also tea coffee and fresh orange juice every morning (the best I have ever tasted!).  Dinner was delicious: they managed to find space for us when we arrived late on our first night despite the fact that the restaurant requires pre-booking. It was packed with people outside who were not staying at the Riad Karmela but had come to eat there.  The bedroom and bathroom was clean and spacious with lovely lighting and furnishing. Note that the rooms do not have a tea or coffee making facility.  The location is fantastic as you can walk straight out into the Medina markets and bustling streets and yet it is so quiet and peaceful inside. We were not disturbed at night and slept very well.  The staff were extremely helpful friendly and generous. We recommend booking a taxi with them for transport from and to the airport. Would love to come back again in the future - definitely recommend the Riad Karmela to everyone!,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieSchutte

Riad Karmela,Joanne O wrote a review Jan 2023,50,"Amazing, amazing, amazing.",Amazing Raid very authentic welcoming and friendly. It is an oasis in the middle of the medina central to everything. we walked everywhere! The staff treated us like royalty nothing was too much trouble for anyone. The room was very clean and the pillows were so fluffy and soft. We ate on a Saturday night and we had live music the food was delicious and again service first class. Cannot find fault at all with anything we would recommend to anyone staying in Marrakech. The city is very busy and noisy you walk through the door into the raid and you are in silence with birdsong. Breakfast was fantastic it had everything you wanted to start your day. The orange juice was gorgeous so fresh the best we have tasted anywhere. The taxi drops you off in a square very close to the raid but a member of staff comes to meet and greet you. The veiws on the roof terrace are brilliant and lovely to watch the sunset and listen to the prayer call.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83joanneo
Riad Karmela,Pami wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Riad Karmela; Amazing place to Stay,We stayed here for 4 nights 2 before our trip to the desert and 2 after we came back. We were able to leave our luggage safely at the Riad and they made sure that the communication between the tour pick was coordinated. We booked our excursion independently.  The places we stayed were different both times but the people were like family. Art on the walls beautiful integration of air water and land space was very creative.  We were 15 min walk from the square Jamal El fanaa  The breakfast was good and if you needed to leave early folks would accommodate you.  We enjoyed Marrakech and Riad Karmela was a major component.

Riad Karmela,Fahad R wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Amazing customer service,We had an amazing experience at Riad Karmela. We had requested a taxi through them to pick us up from the airport. Mohammad was waiting outside for us as soon as we got out. Given how narrow the streets are they get us as close as possible to the Riad and then take our bags in. Once we arrived at the Riad they gave us an overview of the property along with do's and don'ts while exploring the Medina. Maddy at the front desk helped make reservations for us at the restaurants taxis and excursions. We are a family of four and the suite we got was spacious and we had our own private terrace. The breakfast in the morning was nice as well. We booked the Atlas mountain excursion through the Riad and Mohammad was our driver for the excursion and he providing exceptional service through out the day. Only minor thing was that the shower did not drain properly but outside of that the room was spacious comfortable and beautiful.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339fahadr
Riad Karmela,Garyb76 wrote a review Nov 2022,40,A great Riad but is it worthy of the rating?,We booked a suite at the Riad Karmela and was ‘upgraded’ to the 5 star Riad Karmela Princesse which is next door and part of the same group. The room we got was lovely and had a 4 poster bed but I’m not sure it was a suite as we had booked even though I was assured it was.  We were able to use facilities at both Riads and actually preferred the Riad Karmela for breakfast and drinks as it had slightly more atmosphere.  Also the roof terrace was larger and had more space for sunbathing.  Breakfast was a basic continental selection and quality was ok.  We had dinner one evening and it was very good but was only a set menu available.  I struggle to think why it was awarded the high star ratings of 4 & 5 stars for each property as I felt that they lacked some factors I’d expect in such a high rating.  I appreciate that it’s a Riad and not a hotel but although all the staff were very nice and friendly none were proactive in offering service. Apart from Mohammed who was very warm and genuine.  It’s a great Riad in a quite location and we would go back as the rate was very reasonable.  But I’d go knowing I wasn’t expecting a 4 or 5 star property.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garyb76
Riad Karmela,azejo wrote a review Nov 2022,30,"Comfy beds, good location, friendly staff",We waited about 45 minutes to get into our room arriving at 7pm… the sporadic interactions did not allow us the chance to be shown the map and suggestions for getting out of the riad that evening meaning we ate in the restaurant there - there was no choice - just a starter/ main/ dessert (you will pay for 2 or 3 courses).    The soup to start was watery with too much fish stock inedible.    The couscous tagine with lamb and caremalized onions was a taste sensation and amazing!    The room was spacious bed super comfy although furnishings were basic and towels had seen better days.    Although exhausted it was impossible to sleep for the first 2 nights- the sound of bins being dragged down the alleyway at 11.30pm every night - guests leaving at 5am moving cases and chatting loudly/ more guests leaving at 6am the following night noisy neighbours (locals) having a lively discussion for 30 minutes until I wandered to reception to find someone (without avail) until the ‘security’ guard hushed them. Every small sound seemed to echo throughout the room sadly.    The breakfast was fair - a variety of meats/ cheese/ eggs/ fruit/ breads and pastries - and changed daily. Coffee and hot water were luke warm.    We were advised by reception not to do some things we’d wanted - I overheard discussion of the property getting commission for booking certain places- we used trip advisor to help our judgement but mixed this with the riads suggestions. Trip advisor came through on top!    The housekeeping / waiting and bar staff were super helpful… shout out to Mounir who ensured we were looked after well.    I’ve stayed in better Riads - but this has some charm and could be outstanding.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azejo

Extremely polite & very helpful with literally any question asked.

Slap bang in the middle of Marakech and in Medina it is amazingly peaceful once you are inside the Riad.  The room was lovely good sized comfy bed and all the extras that you would want in any hotel.  Breakfast was okay but could have done with a little more diversity. However the staff overall were fantastic. Really friendly very helpful and just lovely humans in general.  We had a number of treatments while there all of which were great too and included the hammam and 2 types of massage.

Would definitely recommend you use the Riads own transportation to collect you from the airport as we didn’t which meant it was a bit challenging to find the Riad.

Particularly Amine who looked after us so well! The food is home cooked simple and delicious. We had 3 rooms in a separate building - all the rooms were very different and interesting. The main hotel has lots of different places to sit and relax both inside and in different courtyards - it is like a tardis! The hotel is well positioned to explore the Souk. The hotel organised our airport transfers tuk tuk rides and restaurant reservations. They even arranged for someone to walk us to a restaurant one evening as it was tricky to find down little alleyways. The only downside is it is very near to a mosque and the call to prayer is very loud!!!,Date of stay: October 2022,,"England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucie-jxnes

Riad Karmela,Libby D wrote a review Sep 2022,50,A Perfect Anniversary Destination,My husband booked us a week's stay at the Riad Karmela as a treat for our 25th wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we could not have asked for better service. Our airport transportation dropped us off at a little square near our Riad. We were immediately met by a member of staff who walked us to the Riad Karmela. We were then sat down and given a pot of delicious mint tea and some local biscuits whilst the wonderful Mehdi explained to us how to find our way around Marrakesh where the best restaurants are (and his recommendations were spot on) and how to stay safe in the exciting chaos that is Marrakesh. We were then shown to our room which was breathtaking with a view of the beautiful courtyard below. Breakfast was a delicious array of fruits pastries orange juice and either coffee or mint tea. You could also request eggs prepared however you required. You can also have a very reasonably priced evening meal on their roof terrace. We had a balloon trip and a camel ride during our stay. Both times someone from the Riad walked us to our pick up point for our transportation to the activity - a really lovely touch especially during our first few days in Marrakesh when the streets can be a little confusing. One thing I would strongly recommend is to ask reception to organise your transportation rather than just getting a taxi on the street. Our journey to the Jardin Majorelle was excellent and reasonably priced. Sadly we told him not to wait and got a street taxi back and not only got ripped off but also got left in the wrong part of the city. That said that was our only slightly negative experience of our whole trip to Marrakesh. We had a massage during our stay which was absolutely lovely and we also loved the fact that the Riad had lots of little courtyards where you could just sit and relax. I cannot recommend Riad Karmela enough the accommodation is beautiful the staff (from the managers to the breakfast ladies and the waiters in the evening) cannot do enough for you and Marrakesh is hypnotic. Definitely worth booking!,Date of stay: June 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/257libbyd
Riad Karmela,Michelle J wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Great Stay at the Riad,I had a wonderful experience staying at Riad Karmela for five nights with a group of friends. The airport transfer was easy a driver was waiting with a sign as soon as we landed and someone was waiting to walk us from the car to the riad front desk. Upon check-in we received water tea and snacks. We also met Amine who gave us a full orientation on how to navigate our area of the medina arrange taxis/ meal reservations etc. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Amine particularly was very attentive and full of recommendations. Our room was clean cool with AC and stocked with fresh water bottles every day. The breakfast on the roof had a large selection and the dinner was a tasty traditional meal. There are numerous pools throughout the riad to cool off during the day and chairs to layout.

They gave us detailed information about life in marrakech the main tourist attractions what to do and what not to do in marrakech as well as the precautions to take.  It was undoubtedly a spectacular cultural and gastronomic experience in addition to the Riad being very well located inside the medina the meals in the Riad were always great and the spaces for socializing and relaxing are very nice.

Room (mareyem) where we stayed was big and cosy.  Talking about staff they were great with fantastic service. (If i knew the names of staffs I would have name them. We stayed from July 11th to 13th 2022)  Our flight was delayed so we reached Riad after 10 pm. Yet they were waiting us for our dinner even though kitchen is closed by 10 pm normally. Next day in the morning they gave us an information about Marrakesh tips on how to avoid scams direction to nearby attractions and all.  To cool off ourselves during hot afternoon we had an option to use Jacuzzi in terrace or swimming pool in it's sister Riad the next door. On our last day we had to leave before 8am therefore they were happy to provide us early breakfast.  Definitely i would recommend this Riad.

He also gave us some complementary mint tea and biscuits upon arrival which was a lovely touch.  Jamela is also very lovely warm and friendly she spoke to us everyday and is always smiling! The staff here work very hard and are all individually amazing!  We stopped in the Al Mousourah Suite which was very clean and well kept and overlooked the courtyard area.  The Riad itself is spacious and has lots of other areas apart from your room to sit in!  Breakfast and dinner is out on top of the roof terrace you can also order drinks up here and soak up the sun or just chill in the shaded area’s.  There is a plunge pool and jacuzzi which we made use of ontop of the terraces a nice way to cool off from the Moroccan heat!  I would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat because of the service and hospitality as well as the central location for the souks!

Riad Karmela,Damien B wrote a review Jun 2022,50,Five wonderful days,Booked the Riad Karmela as part of a five day trip to Marrakech to celebrate my wife's birthday. We wanted to stay in the old city and be within walking distance of the souks museums gardens and restaurants.  Our airport transfer stopped in a small square where we were met by a member of the hotel staff as cars are not able to drive the last couple of hundred metres - in fairness most streets in this part of town are too narrow for cars.  The riad is absolutely stunning. Set around two small central courtyards which provide shade during the heat of the day while our room - Aicha - looked onto the courtyard from above.  Make no mistake this is an old property which has grown and changed over the generations - it is full of little winding staircases little nooks and crannies and an African charm which you can never get in a modern building.  The room was spotless airconditioned and arranged over three levels - bedroom dressing room bathroom.  The real treat is the roof terrace where there is a bar (unusually for Marrakech serving alcohol) the restaurant sunbeds shaded areas with day beds and a jacuzzi.  There have been some reviews suggesting breakfast is not great but everything is fresh and the staff were more than happy to bring extras of anything you want.  We ate at the riad on two evenings and this was again a real treat. It's a set three course menu (there's one for the carnivores and one for the vegetarians) but everything was cooked to perfection and delicious - I would suggest that you would struggle to find food of this quality in the tourist-focussed restaurants in the rest of the Madina.  For those who really need to know - the room did not have a TV (brilliant news) and did not have tea and coffee-making facilities (fine but I missed my early morning brew).,Date of stay: June 2022,,"Beverley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HazelDamo
Riad Karmela,LawyerAbroad wrote a review May 2022,50,Superb value and great service,I travelled with 3 friends. We stayed in 2 rooms in early May 2022.    The Riad itself is accessible by foot  a short distance from the nearest vehicular road access. When you walk in  you walk into surprisingly quiet and fresh feeling space. We were warmly welcomed with mint tea and biscuits given an explanation of the local environs (and how to find some sights) and given our rooms quite early in the day.    One of our rooms Samira was on the ground floor. It was decent but (unfortunately) by mid afternoon and into the evening it had the familiar smell of the local drains - not pleasant. Having made the owners aware they moved us the next day to a much nicer room on the first floor (Aziz). My advice would be to request a room upstairs! Also on the roof there is a nice roof terrace where you could have a drink and watch the sunset.    The rooms are clean but not sterile and retain character. The rooms we had each contained a double and a single bed. The bathrooms are basic with a shower and whilst water pressure is variable perfectly serviceable. There was an aircon unit in each room and it was remarkably quiet so we slept well - at least until the 4.45 am call to prayer started! The oddity which you get used to quickly is that the rooms are locked with a padlock!    The food is very good. Breakfasts were from 8am in buffet style and we had a set piece dinner (a lamb tagline with cous cous and veg) one evening with a band which was great. Alcoholic drinks were available and not too expensive which they are not everywhere in the town.    Location is great - very short walk c 10 mins to the main market square and either way round you pass lots of the traders so you can browse. The tight alleys are densely occupied and with mopeds whizzing by pedestrians it can feel like you have to be on your toes !    What makes this place so good though is the staff. They are superb - very helpful and friendly almost like friends. They genuinely try to help. On top of that the price is so good that your expectations are easily exceeded.    With the caveat about choosing a room above ground level I'd not hesitate to recommend Riad Karmela.,Date of stay: May 2022,,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawyerAbroad
Riad Karmela,Catherine wrote a review Apr 2022,50,"Good value, large traditional Moroccan rooms, great breakfast, close to the centre",Old style Riad with lots of atmosphere huge beds real old Moroccan feel to the rooms kept clean but not sterile. No street sounds inside but the sound of the fountain playing in the courtyard outside our room was calming. There are lots of areas to sit and relax in any 3 of the Karmela properties that join each other. There are also rooftop areas where you can lie in the sun take shade under a pergola or dip in a small soaking pool. Breakfast is continental style buffet with lots of fresh fruit and the most amazing fresh squeezed orange juice. A variety of breads cheeses meats and egg dishes available too. The Marmalade is made with the oranges growing on the trees around you as you eat. Very helpful front desk staff they will order cabs or tuk tuks for you arrnage tours etc. but as with most of life in Marrakech they take their time. Like a lot of places in Marrakech this Riad is not simple to find (even our driver was confused) but well worth it once you get here. BE AWARE that in Marrakech the call to prayer at 4 in the morning is broadcast on loudspeakers throughout the area and you will hear this in your room.,Date of stay: April 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wife2G

Very relaxing hamam with good massage. In the evening after Iftar during Ramadan excellent food in the inner garden even with good wine served.  Room was spacy however bathroom a little bit dated.

Riad Karmela,Lisa H wrote a review Apr 2022,30,The staff are utterly wonderful. The property is a disappointment though.,I booked this via BA Holidays and was expecting the 4 star riad they advertised. Unfortunately this was not the actuality.    The staff are absolutely delightful and can't do enough for you. Unfortunately there is a constant all pervading stench of open sewers which is very off putting when youre trying to eat breakfast. The staff are aware of this and are lighting incense sticks but they dont really help.    The rooms don't have what I expect as a minimum level of facilities in a four star establishment - no radio or mini fridge in the rooms certainly no tv. The air conditioning worked intermittently but at a volume of a Siberian winter storm so sleeping was difficult.    If you're expecting a pool you can forget it - there isn't one. There is a lovely terrace on The roof though.    It is excellently situated in the medina but this does mean you have to get out of the taxi and hoof it with your luggage unless you're willing to chance a near death experience in a tuk-tuk.    That said the hotel uses Abdel as their on call tuk-tuk and he is an absolute legend.    I can't fault the riad if you're expecting a hostel type experience. However I paid for four star accommodation and am too old to be risking my neck down switch back narrow stairs.

They really couldn't do enough for us.    The room was beautifully designed and everything was exactly as I would have expected from a Riad...and more!    Mohammed was on the ball the entire time and couldn't do enough for us - he is a credit to the Riad and the hospitality industry in Morocco!    The location was absolutely spot on and only about a 5 min walk before you hit the main Souks...with 8 min walk to the Place Jamaa El Fna (the main square).

The breakfasts were nice the bar prices were reasonable and we enjoyed sitting on the roof top terrrace with a glass of wine after a chaotic day exploring the town. The Riad is perfectly situated only a 10 minute walk from the main square but do book an airport transfer through the hotel or you will not easily find it when you first arrive.

The beautiful traditional decor was a feast for the eyes and a photo opportunity at every corner with many private restful places to sit surrounded by greenery . We stayed in a ground floor room which had its own courtyard outside. I was grateful for that especially after a long day out in the Souks. However what made the difference were the friendly attentive staff who went out of their way to help you from the manager front of house to the ladies at breakfast and the male staff in the evenings. The Karmela Princess which is next door which is more expensive and is a newer boutique hotel in my opinion lacks the ambience of the traditional authentic moroccan riad.

Riad Karmela,PandYT wrote a review Feb 2020,50,An oasis of calm in the heart of the Medina,I am sometimes loathe to write a review of somewhere as wonderful as the Riad Kermala as I would prefer it to remain a secret! We have just returned from a 7 night stay and had a truly wonderful time. On arrival we were met in a busy square by a Riad employee who kindly took our cases and walked us through the narrow alleyways (there is no room for cars) to our destination. This was slightly disconcerting as the Médina is busy with people motorbikes and even donkeys pulling carts so we weren’t sure where we would end up! But we needn’t have worried - we went down another narrow alley and walked into the Riad Kermala with it’s beautiful courtyard complete with orange trees and a water feature. We were offered some mint tea and another employee talked us through a map of the area showing the nearby souks and some restaurant options. Our junior suite was on the top floor (lots of stairs!) and we were lucky to not only have a small seating area outside our room but also the luxury of a private rooftop terrace with views all over the Médina. We ate breakfast each morning in the courtyard served by the most courteous staff for whom nothing was any trouble. They were all charming. We ate dinner in Riad Kermala and also in the sister Riad The Princess and the food was amazing. Really really good. The souks are slightly overwhelming with every stall holder trying to catch your eye offering a myriad of pashminas ceramics jewellery and of course the designer handbags. We went to the souks most days - only a short walk from the Riad and it was always a pleasure to return to the peace and quiet.

Riad Karmela,drjudymwhite wrote a review Nov 2019,50,A real find!,We stayed two nights at Riad Karmela which is one of three Riads in the group and were upgraded to a small suite with an outside balcony overlooking the inner courtyard. This gave us a super area in which to relax. The room was very comfortable and clean but a little dark which is common in these very old houses in the medina. There is an amazing roof terrace with a panorama of Marrakech and a place to watch the sun go down.  The location is perfect for visiting the area and the gardens which are spectacular. YSL and Le Jardin Secret. Worth going to both. Breakfast was good but the eggs probably avoid. Soft boiled eggs which were hard boiled and scrambled done in the microwave probably and tough. The dinners were adequate but it did save us going out in the dark! There was not much choice with the menus.  The courtyard area and the bar with it’s open fire and lovely sofas were lovely and inviting and we met some super people over a glass of the local Moroccan wines which were lovely and not expensive.  The staff were lovely polite helpful and nothing was too much trouble particularly Khalid.  I would certainly recommend this Riad.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjudymwhite
Riad Karmela,Dilolwa wrote a review Nov 2019,50,What a lovely place to stay!,We decided on this Riad on the basis of TripAdvisor reviews and we struck gold. When we arrived we were given an upgrade to the Cuir Bronze room in the Karmela Princess which was beautiful.The organisation of the Riad is very efficient. If you book via the website they will pick you up at the airport for 15 euros and not charge you for the return journey. A tip - our driver was waiting for us behind many of the others holding up names - so don't panic if you don't see him at first. I bought the 20 euro SIM card at the airport but it stopped working after a day so it wasn't worth the money. The hotel is down a narrow alley in the Medina. The Karmela and the Karmela Princess are across from each other. We ate dinner twice in the Karmela - an unforgettable experience We had a superb tagine both nights - one chicken one beef. The starters were exquisite: a Moroccan warm 'salad' served in five different bowls one night and a delicious lentil based soup the other. The desserts were very good and the wine we ordered - Domaine de Sahari was surprisingly so. The surroundings in the restaurant are a fantasy of Old Morocco running fountains lush vegetation atmospheric lighting and beautiful traditional crockery and table ware. Best of all was the service the two lads who served us could not have been more warm and helpful. We had breakfast for the first two days in the Princess but went over to the Karmela for the third morning where we found the service and the attention we were given to be consistently better. We did the tour of the Medina - a bit expensive to be honest at 50 euros for three hours - and the guide's English was just about OK. The day trip to the Atlas Mountains and the waterfalls on the other hand was excellent value. We loved every minute of it - it was a bit of a schlep upwards [what do you expect!] but we had the company of a brilliant young guide who had the nimbleness of a chamois and ever-present to take our hands when negotiating difficult bits. The open-air restaurants along the sides of the mountain streams are unlike anything we've seen anywhere else - great value too. We appreciated the little gestures of kindness we received during our stay at the Karmela including a large complimentary glass of wine with nibbles on the final evening. We visited the synagogue museum - a great experience but found the Jemaa el-Fnaa Square which we'd heard so much about underwhelming and with monkeys being dragged by chains around their necks a bit tacky. We felt safe all the time. The people are lovely but watch out for the scooters and vans on the narrow souk passages and don't let anyone offer to show you around - even when they claim they don't want money. So we would 100% recommend the Karmela: it's a great place to stay and enjoy lovely Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2019,,East Lancashire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dilolwa

Omar collected us on arrival at the airport and took us to the riad.  2. Omar was our driver to travel around Marrakesh and we felt safe with him and his time keeping was perfect.  3. The reception team were very helpful and attentive.  4. The restaurant staff were also very good.  5. The traditional food was of a high quality.  6. The hammam and message that my wife experienced was extremely relaxing and the service was great. She would definitely have another spa session in the future.  7. We stayed in the Hassan room which was large. Well decorated and comfortable.  8. The roof terrace is a charming addition and offers another area to relax away from the hustle.  All in all we enjoyed the entire experience and have already recommended the riad to our friends.  The location is also good as it allows quick access to the souk and also the museum of Marrakesh.

The staff was polite professional welcoming and literally did everything they could to make us feel comfortable. The location could could not be better a short but very fun and interesting walk to the many Souks and the Jmaa el-fnaa as well as transit. Make sure you eat dinner at the Riad the food is excellent and they make something different each night and it’s always good. Khalid in particular took very good care of us- he offered us great recommendations for food and sights and was very hospitable- our 3 year old loved him too!

Riad Karmela,Denise L wrote a review Oct 2019,50,WOW! A lot of calm amidst the chaos of the medina!,This was our first trip to Marrakesh and I knew that we wanted to stay in a riad. Riad Karmela spoke to me from the day I started to research my trip. I didn't know what to expect from this trip and in spite of all the chaos from within the walls of the medina that greets you from the time you enter it staying at the Riad Karmela was the best decision I made! It is welcoming from the get-go with a staff that is helpful beyond belief; they addressed all our issues/questions prior to arrival and during our trip. Mohamed was the first staff member we met at the Riad as he registered us and gave us a quick orientation. They can help you with everything you want during your stay - excursions directions recommendations changing money everything! The location of the Riad is very central; you are in the heart of everything. Staying in the medina is absolutely the best way to experience Marrakesh; you get caught up with the day to day life including the haggling and you meet very interesting people. The Riad is absolutely beautiful; fresh flowers are everywhere and running water can be heard in the background! Our room was very comfortable and had everything we needed; the restaurants (although a limited dinner menu) were excellent with wonderful service (from Khalid Mohamed Amin?) and delicious meals. We had a driver Adel for a couple of days who showed us around and he was a breath of fresh air. The entire staff speaks perfect English and are very well trained; it was truly a joy to stay there. The best thing about our entire trip were all the wonderful people we met and many of them were right here at the Riad Karmela!,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Orlando, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Degenoux
Riad Karmela,Maggie F wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A Friendly Haven of Peace and Relaxation in the Heart of the Medina,We stayed for a 5 night break with our 15 year old daughter. From the initial pick up from the airport to the end of our stay the staff were great - efficient friendly caring and with a great sense of humour. The riad is down a little alley in the souks - although it's very quiet - tricky to find so best to get them to collect you from the airport plus it's much easier than negotiating your fare when you've just arrived! The driver was lovely and it was a very clean comfortable car that picked us up. We then were met by a member of staff and were given tea and briefed on everything to do with the riad as well as some handy tips for our stay - all very useful. Our room was lovely - lots of Moroccan style with really large comfortable bed for us and a single for our daughter and a good sized bathroom too. As you would expect the shower wasn't strong by UK power-shower standards but there was always plenty of hot water and they provided plenty of lovely large soft towels and smellies as well as dressing gowns. Breakfast was nice - lots of choice and help yourself so ideal for all tastes I'd say. We ate in both the Riad Karmena and the sister riad - Karmela Princess in the evening. The latter does a slightly more sophisticated menu but both are pretty good. You do have to book in advance though so worth booking your first evening meal I'd say as then you can relax. The thing we valued most staying here was the amount of space for relaxing - the roof terrace has lots of sofa space and well as sun loungers plus there are lots of comfortable spaces within the courtyards to chill with a book. It's also licensed so you can enjoy a beer or glass of wine too which is great as of course most of the restaurants in Marrakech do not serve alcohol. Moroccan wine is surprisingly palatable - they have white rose and red - and it's not too expensive really. We did a tour to the Atlas mountains with the hotel - again good value and an interesting day out and a break from the noise of the souks. We didnlt try the hamman but it seemed v good value. If you're looking to stay in an authentic riad then stay in Karmela!,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggief505
Riad Karmela,GraceNewYorkState wrote a review Oct 2019,50,A wonderful and charismatic place to stay,We spent our first three nights on our first trip to Marrakech. The riad picked us up promptly at the airport. It is tucked away in the Medina so it was very appreciated that we were picked up and taken in to the Riad Karmela. Once inside it is peaceful and quiet with relaxing courtyards and a wonderful roof top for dinners and breakfast or to sit and relax. We were greeted with hot mint tea which was also available for breakfast. The rooms were full of character and comfortable. All the staff was friendly and helpful. In particular Khalid and Bushra (sorry if that's misspelled) were helpful to us. The food was very good and we would definitely stay there again.,Date of stay: October 2019,,New York State,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceNewYorkState
Riad Karmela,nik c wrote a review Oct 2019,40,A nice place to stay,"Stayed at the Riad Karmela for three nights and found it to be very comfortable. The rooms were pretty small by hotel standards but they were clean quiet and comfortable. There is a restaurant at the nearby ""sister Riad"" but a snack service is also available but you must make sure your order is passed on as there appeared to be a bit of a communication problem between the two Riads when we were there. Having said that the staff were very friendly and helpful and the Riad is conveniently located in the Medina with plenty of cafes restaurants and shops nearby.

Riad Karmela,EnglandSurrey wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Beautiful Characterful Place to stay,When we arrived at the Riad Karmela the outside of the property gave no indication of the most beautiful interior. So peaceful and calm inside with the interior courtyard lit by candles and lanterns. Beautiful traditional decor in every area of Riad. So many rooms leading off courtyard to allow peace and quiet to read and relax. Beautiful roof terrace again with many areas to sit quietly in sunshine or shade. Sun loungers and umbrellas provided. Pots everywhere on terrace filled with flowers and plants. At night magical atmosphere on terrace lit by lanterns to enjoy meals by. Staff so friendly and welcoming and yet professional. Obvious that they take a pride in looking after their guests from Said and Boushra at front of house who answered all our questions to the wonderful Khaled and Amine who enhanced the enjoyment of our stay with their kindness and dedication when serving meals in the evening and at the rooftop bar during the day. Nothing was too much trouble for them.Don’t be put off by the location as tucked away In Medina but ideal for touring the Souks. Do book taxi from airport on arrival to the Souk to avoid problems in finding the Riad as cars unable to drive directly outside the Riad as lanes too narrow.This will give you peace of mind when you arrive as you will be met where car can reach and walked to the Riad. Our room was beautiful and overlooked fruit trees in the courtyard. Very spacious and peaceful.,Date of stay: October 2019,,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglandSurrey

Riad Karmela,Ron D wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Loved my stay in this great location,The staff of the riad made my stay in Marrakech very pleasant. They had a driver pick me up at the airport (just 15 euros the the round trip). Be sure to use this valuable service since the riad is located in the Médina and not services to the location by cars. A staff member met us at the taxi drop off to make the short walk to the riad.    I loved the common areas and eating on the roof top with their very good meals.

Nineteen rooms on several different levels surround various courtyards filled with plants and comfy sofas perfect to retreat to after a hot day in the Souks and squares. The restaurant can be found on the roof top where breakfast and evening meals are served. There is also a jacuzzi and comfy loungers on the roof top. The bedrooms are traditionally furnished very comfy and have air conditioning.  Hammams massages and facials are a treat.  The riad is hard to find the first time it is best to email ahead and order a taxi. The taxi will stop at a nearby square and the driver will take your cases for the last few minutes on foot.

Riad Karmela,Eric T wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Beyond Expectations!,This review may be a bit lengthy yet it is warranted. We did our Riad homework prior to booking. And Riad Karmela did not disappoint in any way. In fact it superseded our needs and desires. I could comment so many aspects of the Riad... its charm its cleanliness its peaceful environment its convenient proximity to The Big Square its food - from robust breakfasts to rooftop dinners... all of which were amazing.    However as a seasoned traveler a memorable trip/visit away from home always comes down to employees and service. And this is where Riad Karmela shines! I suspect the bar is set high from owner the Joel and his GM Bouchra both of whom were often there simply to help and provide suggestions. Reception was quite capably and thoughtfully handled by Madhi and Said often with welcoming smiles. Countless staff ensure seamless breakfast experiences augmented by the sun-filled terrace setting. With humor and smiles Faisal well tended the bar and unnamed drivers get you from and back to RAK safely and courteously. Quietly Hakim handled luggage effortlessly and politely.    Rooftop dinners were made delightful not only because of accomplished unseen/unnamed chefs but due to waiter Amine's quiet yet attentive presence.    But the creme de la creme was hands down the ever helpful Mohameds (two with the same name). These guys often went beyond the call of duty. Their recommendations for what to see and experience were as helpful as any hotel concierge might make. They were excellent listeners with polished assistance skills - both essential in my hospitality book.    Sure there are abundant Riad's in Marrakech from which to choose. If you are looking for warm locals who ensure exceptional service Riad Karmela deserves your serious consideration. They'll WOW you!,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Corrales, New Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricTonningsen
Riad Karmela,RBManchester wrote a review Sep 2019,50,A beautiful oasis in the middle of the Medina,Stayed for 5 nights. It's a group of riads in the Medina. They provided a pick up from the airport and we were then met by the hotel to guide us for the last bit on foot as the roads are too narrow to drive to the hotel. Staff couldn't have been more friendly. The riad is amazingly decorated with loads of quiet spots to sit and relax. There's a plunge pool and a terrace area where breakfast is served. Spotlessly clean. It's in a great location within the medina and about a 10 minutes walk to the main square - Jemaa el-Fnaa.

Riad Karmela,luke96w wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Beautiful space out of the craziness of the medina but not perfect,"Pros -  -Good location walkable to most places in the medina including El Fnaa square  -Clean and spacious room  -Friendly staff and nice welcoming  -Riad generally beautiful plenty of areas to sit and relax on the roof and downstairs. We never saw all the sunbeds in use or seating areas. There are plenty on the roof both in and out of the shade and within the riad itself.  -Staff accomating will book taxis in advance if you are wanting to get around such as to the airport and train stations and will also sort of tickets for trains and buses if you want them too. Staff also knowledgeable about the area and giving tips regarding the many scams that you will likely encounter while walking around the medina  -Alcohol served at the riad. You will struggle finding anywhere that will serve alcohol in the medina so this is a pro isnt too overpriced either  - Riad has it's own resturant if you dont want to brave the medina at night we never used it but it seemed nice and other guests seemed to use it a lot    Cons -  Private terrace not private or hugely nice (compared to the other seating areas open to all guests. The terrace is open to anyone that wants to go on it and others were using it as and when they pleased. This often wasnt when we wanted to use it so we just left them too it and we would have felt too uncomfortable asking them to leave anyway as there is no signage or indication that the terrace is private. We did have a few people come up onto it when we were using it and just chilling out again didnt really feel comfortable telling them it was our terrace especially since most other guests weren't english so it wouldve made for an awkward conversation. This problem would be easily remedied by the hotel putting up signage or a gate.  UPDATE  I drafted this review before we checked out of the riad but I will leave the above section in for context. One day we noticed that our room was not the only one with a terrace and the other terraces seemed to be only accessible directly from the room at this point I wondered whether our terrace wasnt actually private and we had been put in the wrong room. I went to raise this with reception who confirmed that our room ""Yaccout"" was one of the rooms with a private terrace. I told her that the terrace was not private as others had been using it she told me that was not the case and that there was a gate of sorts to mark it as private. Baffled I told her that there was no gate no signage nothing and that indeed people had been using the terrace. The lady then asked why I had not raised this sooner to which I replied that I just assumed it was our terrace and that it was what it was. She then got someone to come up and wrap a cable across the entry which I'm pretty sure is the kind you use to secure a laptop to stop it being stolen (photo included) and printed off ""private terrace"" on a piece of paper which they sellotaped on. I could have gone sooner but I just assumed that they cant have accidentally forgotten to put a gate there and it still raises the question as to why the sign regarding the terrace being private was ever taken down and I dont think it's right to put the blame onto us and ask why it was not raised sooner. The terrace is tidied every night so why was this not raised by staff as to where the missing ""gate"" was? I think this was a bit shoddy on the part of the riad that the signage was not already there from the off. I suspect the riad might respond defensively to this criticism but at the end of the day we paid extra for a room with a private terrace and got a terrace that wasnt private. If there was previously a sign there why was this removed? And why was it not then replaced?  Limited selection at breakfast which gets a bit boring if your staying here for a week as we were - this could just be me being fussy though  -Absolutely awful hairdryer no excuse to be using a travel hairdryer in a room a normal hairdryer should be provided girlfriend spent 20-30 minutes drying her hair  -Room on rooftop can be loud in morning and evening as people are out on the roof for breakfast/dinner/drinks etc. Mostly not a massive issue apart from one night we were kept up very late (early hours of the morning) by a group sat in the seating area right outside our door and we had a 6am start the next day.    Not a pro or a con but the hotel offers a hotel pick up for 15 euros. I would take this offer as the riad is not accessible by car and I'm not sure where exactly a taxi would drop you off and if you ask someone for directions they will charge you to take them and also might take you somewhere else like a market to buy things.    This also isnt regarding the riad but just a general tip for visiting Marrakech at the airport there are inwi and orange booths offering sim cards and for around 20 euros you can get 10-20gbs of data and 3 hours international calls (phone needs to be unlocked). If you go to the booth after passport control they will set your phone up for you this will mean you can use google maps getting around the medina instead of asking the locals for directions who will mostly likely want money or will take you somewhere else to get you to buy things. Most people we met had no idea about getting a local sim and it is so so much easier if you do the hotels wifi can be a little shaky at times so having your own data can help. Also if you do refuse the hotel transfer you might be able to use maps to get to your hotel although for the first time I would advise just paying for the hotel transfer. The driver will walk you right into the riad and help with your bags.    One last thing I noticed one review had marked down the riad on the quality of the medina itself this seems hugely unfair on the riad as they cannot make fundamental changes to the city if marrakech and in no way falsely advertise marrakech city as anything other than what it is. The medina is dirty warm busy full of scams and street stalls and it's great. But it's not for everyone if you're hoping to go for a relaxing holiday in the sun where you can chill by a pool and have a quiet stroll out for breakfast then book a resort if you like experiencing the culture of another country and seeing a different way of life then this place is great and there are plenty of beautiful things to see in Marrakech. If you come to this riad and dont like the medina do not let that reflect badly on the riad as this is not their fault might seem daft but I've noticed some of the reviews bring this up as if the riad is personally responsible for the state of the medina. I know there are some cons mentioned here but overall I would be happy to come back here and in would recommend it to anyone asking where they should stay in the medina.    Bear in mind that despite the criticisms mentioned I am still leaving this Riad a 4 star review. It is a lovely place to stay but I simply cannot give it a full five stars.",Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Garstang, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luke96w
Riad Karmela,Michael Bohl wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Wonderful Oasis,We were the first time in Riad Karmela and to tell a long story short: It was an amazing experience. The atmosphere of the house is fantastic people with much love for details and oriental designe created a warm welcome-atmosphere. When you came through the souks to this place it was like an oasis for us. All the stuff is friendly and helpful all of the time 24 hours. They help to organize everything. We sat hours and hours on the roof just to enjoy the surprising silence within that crowdy place of the medina. And in the evening we enjoyed several times the perfect dinner on the roof of riad princess the hotel besides that belongs to the project. The cook is fantastic especially the fish was incredible. Together with marokkan wine almost poetry. Finally we have to mention the wonderful stuff on the roof-terrace of Princess Karmela. We spent several beautiful evenings with the two Mohameds and Faical :-) what a perfect team. So respectful so funny so overwhelming nice and friendly. Thank you guys you were great!!! And thanks to the whole stuff. We really felt welcome and had a pleasant stay. We should come back.  Thanks also to the managment who had that vision for this kind of project and who has the look for all these details. A perfect stuff is no coincidence a perfect atmosphere as well.

Riad Karmela,Sylvia C wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Safe haven in the midst of chaos,Our family stayed in Riad Karmela for our first visit to Morocco. It was a wonderful experience from the start. The Riad had arranged for an airport pick up which I was so glad. It would be extremely difficult to locate the Riad on my own. Once we arrived at the Riad we were dazzled by the beautiful traditional Moroccan decoration of Riad. Then Mohammad welcomed us warmly with Morocco mint tea and gave us the basic check in information. The family suite was spacious and the air conditioners worked really well. Everyday we were provided bottles of water which was great! The breakfast in the roof top terrace was very nice. All of these features of Riad Karmela made me like this Riad a lot. However what made me and my family love this Riad was after our first night visit to the market. We walked back through all the twists and turns ( very grateful for google map) and about to turn to Riad. There were some men hanging out at the junction and saw us and started to say the hotel was closed. We were a little intimidated and nervous but promptly one of the workers/security Ayoub Judi walked out greeted and escorted us back to the Riad. We felt so safe and well taken care of.

From always being available to answering all questions and providing directions. They even kept the spa open a few minutes late to allow us a foot massage after a long day!  The Riad - just STUNNING.

Riad Karmela,SeeMoreTravel wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Outstanding Choice!!,Our first visit to Marrakesh got off to a great start from the moment we arrived at this Riad. Let me cut to the chase this Riad is outstanding and I would very highly recommend it to other travellers.    We were met on arrival into the Medina as arranged and guided to the Riad which was very welcome amidst the initially overwhelming hustle and bustle of Marrakech. Once we reached the hotel we were offered a choice of rooms and upgrade at a couple of the several all nearby properties within this Riad group. Both the properties we visited were excellent and we gratefully selected Riad Karmela.    First thing that stands out at Riad Karmela is the exceptional staff. Truly this staff group is uniformly wonderful and they work together as such a team. Congratulations on assembling such an excellent group of staff.    The Riad itself is really great with large spacious suites many courtyards and roof top dining. The restaurant and bar on the rooftop are very nice and the service excellent.    The location is absolutely perfect and a short walk to many attractions including the souks and main square.    We wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else in Marrakesh based on our experience at Riad Karmela.

Riad Karmela,Helen N wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Oasis of calm in the heart of the medina,We had a wonderful week in Marrakech staying at Riad Karmela.in August 2019. The riad is beautiful to be in and offers an oasis of tranquillity away from the craziness outside in the Medina. Our room which had one double and one single bed and a private balcony was wonderful. Unfortunately there was a problem with the toilet so we were upgraded to a room for three in the Karmela Princess next door. However we continued to sit in the quiet courtyards of the Karmela and have meals on the roof terrace. I particularly liked the experience of the Karmela the traditional décor the two resident tortoises and the small finches who fluttered around the courtyards and the roof terrace.. I also liked being able to hear the calls to prayer five times a day . The staff could not have been kinder and were always at pains to ensure that our experience of Marrakech was an excellent one.    Although there is wifi at the riad beware of the fact that it does cut in and out. If you are accessing it on your phone you need to be vigilant so that data is not used. Towards the end of the week our phones were stolen by a pick pocket near to Jemma El Fna so beware! Marrakech felt safe and this could have happened anywhere.    I could not recommend the Karmela enough. You should ensure that they arrange to meet you at the airport by taxi as there is no way that you would be able to find it unaided in the first instance.,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Manchester, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348helenn
Riad Karmela,Ikhlas wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"Nice Riad,",Riad Karmela is a wonderful place. The rooms are spacious and well equipped with a traveler needs. The rooms are air condition and bathrooms have sufficient hot water. They also provide an affordable laundry service. The staff is professional and willing to help at any minutes of the day. The Wi-Fi is strong. They have dinner services at a reasonable price and good quality food. The Riad is located in the heart of the Old Medina.    If they have an available spot on Princess Karmela (an upscale facility) they would upgrade you without an additional charge. Which they did for my friend who was travelling at the same time I was travelling in Morocco.    I appreciated Khalid who works as a waiter. I lost my cellphone in Casablanca and someone found it and hand it to their hotel in Casablanca. Khalid helped me to contact my friends who were contacted about my cel. He also contacted the hotel and told them to hold my phone till I come to get it.    Overall all this chain of Riads is well managed and the staff members are professional and organized. They would help anyway they can. I would highly recommend this facility for any traveler.,Date of stay: July 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162ikhlasa
Riad Karmela,RTM2289 wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Excellent stay at Riad Karmela,I traveled to Marrakesh in May 2019 for vacation. We selected Riad Karmela based on the great reviews online and we were very happy with our selection. We booked our room directly through the hotel's website which allowed us to request a 1 way transfer complimentary. We arranged a transfer from the airport to the hotel upon our arrival. We were very glad we arranged this transfer as we would have had a difficult time navigating on our own with a taxi driver through the Medina to find our Riad. Once we arrived at Riad Karmela we were offered welcome cookies and tea which was nice. We then checked into out room which was on the 2nd floor. The room was very spacious and incorporated local Moroccan decor elements. The Riad offered a complimentary breakfast at the rooftop restaurant daily which was very convenient. The rooftop was also a lovely place to watch the sunset in the evening as it offered a pretty view and lots of comfy seating. My only complaint about this Raid was the beds they were very firm to sleep on. Other than that everything else was excellent! We especially loved being so central in the Medina area we could walk everywhere!,Date of stay: May 2019,,"Kansas City, Missouri",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTM2289
Riad Karmela,Susan O wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Amazing Riad Karmela,Our family of five stayed in the lovely Riad Karmela for four nights in July. It was a haven of peace and tranquility. Our two bedroom apartment with its own private terrace was beautifully decorated and everything was immaculately clean. The Riad has several small courtyards and coves where you can sit and relax in the cool as well as a lovely rooftop where you can eat breakfast and dine in the evening. We came back to the rooftop terrace every night after dinner in Marrakech to have a drink and chat within lovely surroundings. You also have access to another two lovely Riads where there is a small pool to help you cool off after a hot day sightseeing. We would definitely recommend this lovely Riad and its amazing staff who looked after us very well.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rugby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susano707

The staff were friendly and always helpful we really can not recommend this place enough. It is superb value for money the food is great and the excursions on offer also very good.

Riad Karmela,CaribeTraveler45 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Nice Riad well located.,Riad Karmela is well situated just a few minutes walk to various museums such as the Museum of Marrakech and about 20 minutes from the airport if traffic is good. At my arrival I was served with a selection of delicious moroccan cookies with mint tea. The staff was fantastic and a special thanks to Bouchra and Abel who were very helpful.  My room Habid in the main floor was clean and spacious. The rooms are locked by a pad-lock on the outside and have a bolt on the inside not to worry it is safe. Although the Riad needs a little paint here and there it is well designed with rooftop where breakfast buffet and meals are served and the garden is beautiful.

Riad Karmela,scattycat30 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Little oasis in the middle of the medina!,We stayed here for 3 nights and couldn't have been happier! We chose to have somebody from the hotel to come and collect us from the airport (I'd read reviews about it being hard to find and I'm glad we did!) which cost 15 euros each way. The taxi has to park in Ben Salah square and the driver then leads you for 5 minutes through the medina to the Riad. You have to check in at Riad Karmela Princess which is just next door - after being given a map and information about the area/how much to pay in a taxi/how to barter when buying in the souk/places of interest to go to we were then shown to our room - we had a twin room on the ground floor which was spacious and comfortable. We spent most of first day getting lost in the medina but managed to get to where we wanted to by asking shop keepers along the route (don't ask a local as they'll offer to show you the way then expect payment). Despite being in the middle of the bustling medina Riad Karmela was quiet and tranquil (and we even met the little tortoise!) and so traditionally Moroccan we were pleased with our choice. Breakfast was nice with a limited selection of breads cheese meats and fruit and eggs could be cooked to order. We had a few issues (our fault not with riad) and every time they couldn't have been more helpful. All the staff we encountered here were friendly polite and very accommodating. You can book excursions through them (we had already booked ours so didn't) and have dinner although we didn't as wanted to try different places. If I came to Marrakesh again I would definitely stay here.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scattycat30

Riad Karmela,Appahowa wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Stay here, stop looking for other Riads",Location/Riad: This Riad is located in the perfect location in the medina 10 minutes walk to the market square. We were a little afraid that we would get lost but the directions given to us by the Riad made sure we did not. Even though Riad Karmela is in the medina we could not believe how quiet and tranquil it was! The courtyards were an oasis in the chaos of the medina. This place is BEAUTIFUL. It feels Moroccan. It looks Moroccan. It is pure Moroccan. We stayed in Fatima room with our 8 year old son and loved it.    Food: We had breakfast each day it was typical European buffet (breads ham fruits nutella) with some traditional Moroccan dishes like Morracan pancakes Moroccan fruits Moroccan eggs with tomato or potato or onion. Delicious coffee and juices.    We had dinner 3 nights. Chicken tagine twice and beef tagine once. My son and I are picky eaters and ate every bite. Just try it and you will love it. My husband had the fish dinner from the Karmela Princess Riad and loved it.    Excursions: Do not book your excursions in advance book them through the Riad. We did the Ourika Valley tour that took us to the Atlas Mountains for a waterfall hike tea at a Berber home an argan oil cooperative and stops at stores. This was my favorite. We also did the Essouria trip to the coast and a sunrise hot air balloon ride. They were all amazing.    The people: The people and their hospitality are the best part of this Riad and the best part of Morocco. Our son is named Atlas (like the Atlas mountains here in Morocco) and the people were so kind to him. They remembered his name greeted him hugged him shook his hand...it was as if they loved him from the moment they met him. Specifically Latifa who served breakfast and worked in the day throughout the Riad. She greeted him each time she saw him with a smile and kind word. Khalid was our waiter for our dinners he was so welcoming and kind. He was happy each time he saw us and so warm and friendly to our son. Mohammed (with the light eyes) did our introduction to the Riad (LISTEN TO THE INTRODUCTION!) and was warm kind informative and welcoming. Management if you read this please know that the above people we will remember as making our stay exceptional but each person at your Riad deserves praise.    Stay here. Do not keep looking. Do not think there is a better Riad in the medina.    We are now going to an all inclusive waterpark hotel for 3 nights in Marrakech and to be honest I wish we were spending those 3 nights here.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Appahowa

The “lobby” area is breathtaking with a cute little turtle to welcome you. We stayed in one of the rooms near the rooftop and it was like from a movie. Book dinner ahead of time or ask for recommendations and they are happy to help. They offer drinks and hooka/shisha on the rooftop at night and a nice little breakfast in the morning.

Riad Karmela,ryan d wrote a review Jun 2019,40,"""Petit"" karmela","Booked the petit karmela which is the karmelas sister hotel. We found when we checked in that the pictures used to advertise the hotel online were actually the karmela and not the petit karmela. The room we was given we were told was in the ""petit princess?"" This hotel is oposite the karmela and the main door was just off the main street. Our room really was horrendous the window shutters and the front door had gaps in them the room was tiny thought we would manage however after a long day travelling we couldn't use the shower as there was no hot water. Reception did move us into the princess hotel for a night and then moved us to the actual karmela hotel. I would have never in a million years booked to stay at the petit karmela if i knew what the room was like. I'm not sure if its the fault of the hotel or booking provider however the pictures advertising this hotel are not correct! After the first night out stay did improve breakfast was nice staff friendly we were told we could use the facilities at the princess so we made use of the terrace most nights which was really relaxing got some drinks at the bar and used the pool. The actual hotel is in the medina and was very central. We wasn't told by anyone that taxis could not go near the hotel so we was dropped off in the centre and a guy with a wheelbarrow put our stuff in and we walked the 10 minutes through the busy streets. This was quite stressful as we weren't expecting it and have never been to marrakesh before. This should be noted somewhere online again this may be the fault of the booking company. All in all the hotel is nice i liked the decor and is in a good central spot. I would stay again but in the princess ( we didn't know this hotel existed when we booked) the princess is more modern and rooms nicer",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194ryand
Riad Karmela,John G wrote a review Jun 2019,50,A Marvellous Marrakesh Memory,Set fairly central in the Medina you are no more than 8 mins from the big square and less than that from most of the sights in the old medina this fantastic riad with authentic Moroccan interior design was just the ticket. It never failed to amaze us the difference you felt from the hustle and bustle of medina life to the tranquillity you felt by just crossing the riad threshold! The 2 bed-roomed apartment (Kaltoum) we stayed in with access to its own roof terrace and side access to the communal roof terrace was ideal with all the comforts we needed after a long hot day navigating the maze like alleyways of Marrakesh. The staff were always considerate and thoughtful with nothing too much effort to make our stay comfortable. We were thrilled to be offered a free complimentary alcoholic departing drink to wish us luck on our onward journey - a nice touch. Equally appreciated was the free ride back to the airport as part of the package since we'd booked direct. I'd have no hesitation in recommending this riad to anyone for its location and great breakfasts. We'd also recommend the Corner Cafe 18 bis Kennaria dabach and Café Babouche 37 Rue des Banques both near the Big Square if you've just had one too many Moroccan tagines.,Date of stay: June 2019,,"Witchford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4562XTjohng
Riad Karmela,Jan P wrote a review Jun 2019,50,6 star service!!!,We often stay in 5 star hotels. Whether the Ritz Four Seasons or any of the other 5 star brands the service here is better.    It was hot on our first day and we wanted lunch but did not want to eat on the rooftop terrace (which was the only dining option). We asked for some nearby places to eat and they asked us if we wanted to eat in the gardens downstairs. Within minutes they set up a private dining area so we didn't have to eat in the heat.    The accommodations are truly authentic. Not modern but tastefully done to give you the experience of the Medina. You may be a little shocked when you are dropped off a block from the hotel and your luggage is taken in by a wheel barrel type cart. However once you arrive get ready for the best hospitality ever.    This is a unique experience. Besides walking in the Medina where mopeds speed through we felt very safe. At the Riad the staff provided a local guide upon my request to take us to the square on our first day. It was well worth the 40 Euros as it is easy to get lost in the Medina.    I would highly recommend Riad Karmela Princessa.    Jan,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"San Jose del Cabo, Mexico",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janp302

Our room was in the second courtyard on the ground floor with a wonderful access and door making it very authentic and original. The room was spacious and bathroom was large. The bed was very firm but I did not mind this. My wife did find it too hard and uncomfortable at first but since we normally sleep on a memory foam deep comfort bed it was a big change.  Staff were very helpful always there to help and answer questions.  Breakfast on the roof terrace was simple and tasty with eggs as you like them and continental style offerings (cheese croissant breads jams etc) also with fresh orange juice etc which was more than enough every day.  The location is well within the old city and the myriad of walkways but so easy to navigate and find every day.  We loved our stay and would recommend this place for sure.  It has character and charm.

But more than anything I appreciated the serene courtyard where we could sit in peace enjoy the fountain and small pool a mint tea and great French fries. We ate dinner once at the hotel and once at the Princessa next door and both were wonderful. Upon our return to Marrakech by rental car the owner and staff were so helpful getting us back to the riad navigating the crazy streets and people trying to make a buck on the confused tourists.

Although a riad obviously won't be shed by the sun the family room was a little gloomy. And for the real ear sensitives you could hear the sound of the kitchen washing machine (probably not in the other rooms though). Dinner and breakfast were nice and served in a welcoming centre of the riad. The staff was nicely friendly although we had a little stress when we had to leave early in the morning the entrance door being locked and we had to make some noise for 15 minutes until someone finally woke up. But all in all we had a very nice stay.

Riad Karmela,Bears1218 wrote a review Jun 2019,10,Very hot room and totally unfriendly staff,The air con is not working since only hot air coming out at a temperature of 40 degree Celsius. The hotel staff blamed us for not complaining earlier when we checked in as we are rushing out for a spa appointment and thought the room will get colder after switching on the air con for a while. When we complained after getting back from the dinner the staff said the hotel is fully booked and there is no way to switch rooms. At the time of 11:30 at night we were directed to another Riad passing through some quiet alleys and were shown to a room with a ceiling fan rather than air con!! We were tired and angry the staff just asked us to open the window at a temperature of 40 degrees and offer an old fan. After we complained and demanded a refund for the 4 nights we booked then we were shown to another Riad and the room finally has air con this took us 45 mins in total.    The most disappointing thing is the attitude of the staff who is pathetic unhelpful and arrogant. When we first checked in we called and asked the staff to wait for us in the car parking area they refused and never called back. We took a taxi to a close by parking lot and were left alone to find the way by google map and had to pay a porter to help with our 2 big luggages. I don’t know where does the 4 stars of this Riad come from and would only deserve a 0 star. My friend heard about our horrible stories and decided to forfeit one night of stay and move elsewhere.

Breakfast in the morning on the upstairs terrace and we ate dinner two nights in their sister hotel next door. Delicious. Also if you have never experienced a Hammam this is the place to do so. I had no idea what I was getting myself into but wished I had not waited until the last day of our trip. It was the most incredible experience.

Riad Karmela,gzyg23 wrote a review May 2019,50,Fantastic Stay at Riad Karmela,I stayed in a double room on the ground floor and contrary to other reviews it was not noisy at all. When I visited it was 42C so having (free) bottled water at reception was very nice. My room was ACed and the Riad is close to all the attractions in the Medina area so I could go to something then come back to the Riad to cool down for a bit before going out again.    The WiFi was not working well in my room but worked outside in the courtyard and lounges. I think the owners are working on fixing it so it should not be a problem in the future.    Other good things to note: 1. The Riad was able to print my return boarding pass for free (note that Marrakech airport does not take mobile boarding passes for Ryan Air and maybe other airlines as well). 2. Definitely get the airport transfer (10-15 euro each way) as the Riad is quite hard to find the first time.    Note of caution for nut allergy sufferers: Upon arrival you will be greeted with Mint tea (delicious!) and some Moroccan pastries. I was uncomfortable that the pastries were served because I had told the owners more than once (both email and in person) that I have a severe nut allergy (to which they said “ok no problem”) but the pastries clearly contained almonds. I understand that allergies are unheard of in Morocco and I do not expect to be catered for at all but the pastries probably went to waste because I could not eat them. I did not eat breakfast or dinner at the Riad in future days because of this incident. Stick to McDonalds grocery store food or packaged food from home if you have allergies!    Overall Joel and Bouchra are so kind and the accommodation was nice. I would like to return some day.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gzyg23

The bathroom smelled a little mildewy but otherwise no complaints. We will absolutely stay here again when we come back to Marrakech.    The breakfast setup was great with a fresh pot of coffee brought to the table.    the only bad things we had that a guide from the roade take us to the riad when we last on our way then he askd us to pay 20 Euros dont trast any one to show you the way its beter to call the Riad to send same one to meet you,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aleh-2012

Riad Karmela,M N wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Mistake for Room overshadowed things,On arrival it became clear that there are 3 Riads on one alleyway that make up Karmela complex incl Princess and Petit.  Main Riad is beautiful as in pics whereas Princess not sure what is meant to be as quite chintzy and Petit is small Annex with quiet if small courtyard and no facilities. Rooms small and a bit dated in Petit. The 3 all get a bit jumbled up. The Petit it turned out was where our room was even though we had never heard of it when booking. It seemed small and did not match expectations against Booking.com and then I found my room on Booking.com under Petit as standard.  Admin error or could I be seen as too cynical if I thought as this was our only night at the end of holiday we were being misled. 'Was this not explained at check in' was answer by night staff who actually then couldn't do more to overcome the issue incl dinner on house or offer of an avail suite. Very good meal indeed. Thank you.    You need to be aware of the nature of the 3 Riads when you arrive.  Main building looks wonderful at night and tranquil at day.  Petit overlooks alleyway so noisy and over one of the kitchens.    Locn is indeed very hidden away and I preferred South of the Fna Square where more locals than tourists.    This was our last night after previous days in Marrakech and Rabat so experienced several different locations and Riads and staff.     We enjoyed the Hamman and massage avail.    I make no comment on Marakech or Rabat as we travel for experience and our homework paid off helped by friendly locals and taxis.  Did a lot of walking!!  Now rest.  Marrakech ticked off.     I see that the owner takes Trip Adviser reviews quite personally and I belive I have been honest here. Only the Riad can know what went wrong with the booking especially as the Superior Room Price was on the bill.

The hotel staff where friendly and helpful when it came to our inquiries on the best places to eat and visit. Even when we arrived late at night after the front desk was closed a staff member came out and met us on the street to help us get to our room!    Not only was the food amazing but so was the entire dining experience every time we ate the riad. The food was served on the roof of the property overlooking the city.

Riad Karmela,gmena wrote a review Apr 2019,40,A friendly place to stay,It was our first time in the country and I must acknowledge that the staff was very friendly and helpful. They welcomed you and gave you a map with different tourist destinations. They were also willing to arrange reservations and transportation for you. The room was clean and the hotel was located very close to the souk. The breakfast was was not elaborate but good and filling. The best part was the freshly squeezed juice. The traditional dinner was a little expensive but delicious and convenient. The rid was even considerate enough to breakfast prepared for us when we left very early in the morning. If you are tall be careful because it is an old structure and the stairwells we're not designed for very tall people. If you hate being disconnected from the world bring a mobile device because there are no televisions in the rooms. My only complaint would be the massage. We paid for the spa service and it was not good. I felt as if my back was being rubbed with no specific technique. The good part was it is not expensive. Maybe the hamman would have been a better choice.

Riad Karmela,ChrisMelbn wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Nice Riad,In general Riads are a nice oasis from the hustle and noise outside. Karmela is very pretty and we'll decorated inside. But if you have not stayed in a Riad before (we hadn't) note it is a different experience and not the same as a hotel.    Each room is like a bedroom off a central courtyard so privacy is not like a hotel and any noise tends to echo eg. other guests talking in the courtyard or staff preparing breakfast early in the morning. Just something to be aware of as different people have differing tolerances for noise.    Karmela is also nicely positioned inside the old city wall for wandering and shopping in the Souks.    Breakfast is pretty comprehensive and the Riad is well positioned in the Medina for wandering and shopping in the Souks.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisMelbn

Riad Karmela,Lauraalisonjones wrote a review Mar 2019,20,Flew home after 2 days,Ok firstly we are reasonably well travelled in India Asia and not just 5 * western hotels. Riad Karmela was ok just. Room smelt of drains. Shower a trickle of water. Bed hard no tea and coffee in room. All rooms faced out into the communal courtyard. If you opened the window you could hear other residents snoring belching etc etc. The terrace was covered by a weird plastic sheet so no natural light. Breakfast poor. A few scraps of meat fruit bread and cold pancakes/ omelette. Get there after 8 and eat on your lap as there are not enough tables after 9 it’s all cleared away/ eaten. The spa was a bed in a room where over expensive treatments could be booked. No pool but one next door which resembled a fish pond in the dining area.  Marrakesh. Dirty smelly. Don’t get out your phone map resemble a tourist otherwise you’ll get hassled consistently and ripped off. Felt unsafe and sinister with gangs of locals working to get money. Massively overpriced I like to haggle but this was ridiculous and if you showed a slight bit of interest you were blocked from leaving the shop. We were only advised to eat at certain establishments which were very expensive and very mediocre. Poorly treated animals especially donkeys. All locals drive mopeds along the alleys so you’re pinned to the walls so you don’t get hit and suffocated by the exhaust fumes.

Riad Karmela,mikemcf wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Simply stunning,I booked this hotel after reading the reviews here on trip advisor. I had been on a 9 day tour through Morocco walking and staying in some less than luxurious places. I wanted a hotel to relax in with my wife after our travels and before our return to the drab British winter.  The hotel is located in the old town. A maze of streets and alleys. It would be easy to miss however the staff will attend and collect you from the vehicle drop off area.  Once inside the place is beautiful.  It was pristine clean.  It looks well cared for and decorated with lots of lovely touches.  Many of the rooms look out onto the central courtyard which is very peaceful.  The room itself was ample sized clean and well presented.  The staff very friendly and helpful.  The location of the hotel means you would expect noise from the nearby souks.  Nothing.  Serene.  It is a really relaxing location right beside the noise and chaos of the souks. It is a few minutes walk from the main square but takes a bit of navigating at first. A few wrong turns initially but soon mastered the route.  The food in the place was very nice.  The only two minor matters very minor and didn’t in any way spoil our stay was that the breakfast time can get busy with insufficient tables for the amount of guests. I think I just timed it badly.  And the shower was a job to get the temperature right ! Too hot or too cold. Again after a few showers I managed to master the plumbing.  It truly is a very lovely venue to stay at the location is so central yet you would think you were out in the country for all the noise you can hear.

On arrival greeted with mint tea and the most beautiful place to relax and start your holiday. What can I say our room was beautiful everything you needed and all rooms very individual. Breakfast is included in the price and more than enough to satisfy the average diner. Organised a half day tour of the medina through the hotel it cost €40 but well worth it to be shown around by Aziz and get your bearings in this crazy place. Many hours spent on the roof terrace with a cold beer and the pleasant sounds sights and smells of marrakech( all good). Nothing was a problem for the hotel do or organise and the location within the medina was perfect for exploring and visiting the local restaurants and sights. After 4 perfect nights and delivered back to the airport as easily as we arrived my thoughts turn to when we will come back and stay in the Riad Karmela again soon definitely soon.....perfect,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shane336

There were plenty of areas to relax in or to escape to. The staff were incredibly helpful advising us where to go what to see helping with the ordering of taxis etc. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Breakfast in the morning as delicious - plenty of and a wide choice - yet again great service. Our room was sizeable and very clean opening out onto the stunning roof terrace with lounging areas mini terraces and with delightful views.

Riad Karmela,Shrutikapoor wrote a review Feb 2019,30,Centrally located,This is a relatively budget Riad and you get what you pay for.  The best part about this Riad is their staff who are extremely helpful and accommodating.    Our reservations were in for the blue room in the riad. When we check in we were greeted with some mint tea and cookies and after a quick tour were taken to our room.  The blue room is a very basic room with just a bed and side tables. It has no windows or view. The attached bathroom had a foul smell coming and overall the look and feel of the room were very depressing. So we expressed our concerns to the management and they were kind enough to shift us to another room on the ground floor right next to the front desk.    This new room close to the entrance of the Riad was much nicer in terms of decor etc. but because it was on the ground floor next to the entrance it was extremely noisy. We could hear everyone walking in and out of the corridor outside our room.    The management had warned us about that and promised to accommodate us in their next door Riad the next morning. So overall our experience with the rooms in this Riad was not so good. Our experience with the management however was wonderful as they were as helpful as they could be.    The breakfast layout on the terrace is average. They have a variety of juices bread dry fruits and eggs made to order (boiled or fried egg). There are hot tea and coffee available.

Riad Karmela,Cakefirst wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Loved this Riad!,Can’t recommend this Riad enough. It was so peaceful and beautiful yet so close to the Big Market and other attractions in the old town. The staff arranged transportation from/to the airport for us. We dined at the Riad the first night and really enjoyed it. The staff also organized a day trip to three valleys and the Atlas Mountain with a local guide. There was a second local guide who helped us navigate up to the waterfall. This excursion was the highlight of our trip. Also enjoyed relaxing reading and sipping sweet tea in some of cozy nooks of the Riad near fountains and fireplaces. It was such a peaceful retreat after visiting the busy market.

Riad Karmela,Holly N wrote a review Jan 2019,50,"Nice location, beautiful property, excellent food",What we loved: Beautiful Riad in a convenient location with very nice authentic decor. The space felt welcoming and was nice to relax and lounge as a family near the fireplace and in the other lounge areas. The rooftop terrace was fabulous! The cooking was excellent. Great breakfast and the meals we had at the Riad were very good. Our favorite was the couscous Royal. Extremely good service from the waiters and the breakfast ladies. In particular I would like to mention Khalid who was attentive extremely friendly and talkative and made a point to say goodbye to us the evening before we left. We very much enjoyed the professional and kind service from Khalid. The briefing and and tea on arrival was a nice gesture and appreciated as was the driver meeting us at the airport on arrival.    What we would suggest for improvement: More portable heaters in the dining area as it was quite cold in the mornings and evenings. Some notice about changing of towels as it was random and we never knew when or if we would get new towels. More friendly personal warm service at the front desk. A better description of the hammam services and prices in English and an upgrade of the services. We were very disappointed and had no option to try another place as it was our last day.

Quiet calm and soothing. The staff were so friendly and helpful. All the rooms or suites are different ours was spacious and clean with a nice shower. The communal spaces are welcoming with an open fire in the evening and games to play. The mint tea was lovely as was the evening meal and there was loads of choice at breakfast. The riad organised a trip to the atlas mountains with lunch in a berber house it was a great day and very worthwhile to get some calm away from the medina.

Was our first time there You really need good advice to find your way in the medina and we got that support freely.  The Riad is charming very well kept inviting the different rooms to sit in and outstanding the roof terrasse where everybody can find his own little hideaway…  Breakfast very rich and healthy.  Had one full Dinner in the Riad which was fantastic Food for a real good price. Never ever had such a good ice cream for Dessert It was home made something like Vanilla with orange peel…  The staff is very helpful und supportive. In the morning the ladies would help us to find a place for breakfast and then be there refilling an cleaning in a kind and efficient way. In the evening the men would take over here we enjoyed the friendly helpfulness and also interest in our experience of the day before all shown in the person of Khalid who would welcome us like good friends and always find some time to talk...

Riad Karmela,Albertd99 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Our holiday experience 1-4 December 2018,Marrakech was a complete culture shock it was my first experience of actual life around pure poverty. Nowhere could this be seen better than at the Souk market. Hygiene was non existent. However the market was a buzz of excitement fruits vegetables clothing (copies of course) and household gift wares. Prices asked always needs to be halved then negotiate upwards to make the deal but prices are not extortionate to start with.  Bees insects cats etc are commonplace crawling over the food it was hard to find a place remotely clean enough to eat from so we were of course very selective. A bakery with fruit juice mixtures choices was very popular with us.  Our hotel Riad Karmela recommended two restaurants of excellence Le Jardin and Nomads we later found out they were the same ownership which gave us confidence to return. The food was amazing the service was good but you do get what you pay for but again not extortionate. There was a third restaurant in the chain cafe des spices which was also excellent. Again eat elsewhere at your peril. These were clean quality establishments desperately needed in this environment.  Finally our hotel the Riad Karmela was five star comfort and respect the rooms were spacious clean and well kept daily. The perfect choice. The shower power was amazing. The breakfast had a full selection of cereals fruits eggs smoked salmon and a variety of delicious bread fresh and crusty. We did not eat dinner at the hotel but it did look good. The staff were all excellent sadly the only name that comes to mind is Khalid but all the staff were happy to oblige at all times. There was complimentary delicious local tea served daily at hand with local variety of sweet biscuits and pastries which we chose to enjoy in the beautiful terrace roof. I am well travelled but this hotel and staff certainly do deserve the praise and therefore I have given it my full attention. The spa and massage was also excellent. I travelled in a party of two couples all of us were of the same opinion.  There is also a short taxi ride away the new city but this was just like any other modern shopping experience a world away from the souk.  We took an amazing 3 hour walking tour of the old city area very informative and enjoyable.  We also walked up the Atlas Mountains where people have built their houses and shops into the rocks if you can get to the top the waterfall is beautiful and plenty of restaurants along the river side.  One final point the streets at the sook are overcrowded tiny lanes which lead into a main large square these streets incorporate humans cats dogs cyclists motorbikes cars donkeys in abundance amazingly very few accidents the motorbikes in particular are a very hair raising experience almost like a motorbike track.  All in all a fabulous 3 nights 4 days holiday. Enjoy,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albertd99

The breakfast was fresh and delicious the orange juice is to die for! It is a little bit of a trek for a cab to get close but felt like a sanctuary for us. We asked them to store our bags in luggage storage while we did an excursion in the Sahara and had them collected. Everything seemed really seem less and they would always help if they could.

The breakfast is delicious and had a wide variety of options.    The only down side was our hammam and massage experience here. At 45 euros a go it wasn’t of a high enough quality the massage was essentially someone rubbing some oil into your skin for half an hour.

Riad Karmela,MDSumpter wrote a review Nov 2018,30,Unique Experience,"The overall experience turned out to be okay but an issue with my booking almost put a damper on our stay.    Negatives: There was an issue with the booking-according to hotels.com booking.com and other sites the junior suite is listed as two rooms or a room with a ""sitting area"". The pictures are also different on some of the sites. We were told three different things: 1. It's a mistake by the websites 2. They would correct the mistake and give us the difference (a couple we met had a suite with a sitting area and didn't book nor request it) and 3. The twin bed my daughter slept in was the ""sitting area"" I booked. How can the twin bed be the sitting area when I requested a booking with 3 people with a second room/sitting area. This caused a great deal of frustration; especially since our room seemed to be one of the dated ones. Hair all over floor (asked for it to be vacuumed but I guess it never happened) bathroom fixtures needed upgrading water damage behind sinks etc. What I found insulting was that I was told the room we were in is normally €160 per night (as if we needed to be grateful we only paid 135 euro)-no where online (any site) does it ever show that price for that particular room. The WiFi didn't work in our room so we had to hang out in the common area. The hotel needs more bandwidth to accommodate the number of guests staying there. The hotel staff tried to fix the WiFi issues but I'm not sure they were familiar with the issues people were having.    Positives: most of the staff was very accommodating and tried to ensure our stay was a warm and inviting one. The location is convenient just expect the area to be a busy one. I like that the hotel provides shuttle service 24 hours per day. The breakfast is very reasonable and can be filling; tons of meat pastries and fruit. The morning staff will make eggs to your liking if you simply request it. They have two restaurants and our dinner the first night was delicious-we ate at the sister Riyadh Princess Karmela. Our dinner the second evening was delicious as well-held in Karmela. I enjoyed sitting in the courtyard and chatting with people from all over the world; a wonderful experience.

I don't think we could have picked anywhere better than Riad Karmela. It is well located within the Medina and to use a cliched but nevertheless truly accurate description it really is an oasis of calm within the hussle and bustle of the souks. The dining courtyard is delightful and our room was large and comfortable. The Riad staff were without exception friendly and helpful. If you plan to stay I thoroughly recommend you arrange for the Riad's driver to pick you up from the airport.

We loved the Karmela so much it was big enough that you could find nooks and crannies to snuggle up in and hide out peacefully but small enough that you got to recognise and love all the staff.    If you haven’t been to Marrakech you need to appreciate the feeling of coming in from the madness of the Medina into a quiet comfortable and familiar place where they look after you. This Riad is stunning inside lots of space to settle down in the best mint tea and dedicated and polite staff throughout. Nothing is too much trouble.    We had a wonderful dinner the first night when we were too exhausted after two hours in immigration to go out to eat. You can get beer and wine at any time at a good price. To be honest the breakfast could do with a revamp but the orange juice is the best we’ve ever had in Marrakech.

Riad Karmela,David G wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Great riad; full of charm; superb staff.,We have just returned from four night's stay in this beautiful riad. Three or four buildings have been combined to form a riad full of charm surrounding a number of peaceful courtyards - watch out for the (three ?) tortoises which stroll around quite unperturbed by the guests. Truly a wonderful place to relax from the nearby hustle and bustle of Medina. Ideally located about 10 or 15 minutes walk to Place Jemma El Fna although this will inevitably take far longer as you stop to browse the numerous souk stalls en route. The riad has a broad range of suites and rooms all of which seem to be individually decorated with local handicrafts There is a restaurant which sensibly has a limited menu. On the occasions we ate there the food was excellent. (Try the chicken tagine with figs.) And yes you can get a beer at the riad.  Now for the staff. Joel has surrounded himself with a truly excellent team. Top marks to Said always cheerful humorous and helpful. Nothing is too much trouble for him.  Are there any negatives ? If I was being picky the internet is a bit patchy at times but there are several routers dotted around the courtyards and you can always get on-line somewhere around the hotel - if you really must.  One tip: I would suggest you book direct with the hotel who will arrange a pick up from the airport. There is little chance of a taxi finding the riad. Our pick up's went wonderfully smoothly.

Riad Karmela,chloedom2018 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,An Oasis,We stayed at Riad Karmela for 4 nights with my mum. This is an absolutely stunning Riad - a real serene oasis amidst all the crazy of Marrakech! Upon check in we received Moroccan mint tea with some home made biscuits which were lovely.    Our room was clean and the staff were helpful giving us lots of useful information that came in handy. We booked a trip to the Atlas Mountains through the Riad along with a Hammam and massage with which both great.    The only thing I would give feedback on is that for 3 of the nights (we had to move to a twin room) there was no safe or hairdryer in the room. I believe this was in the Petit Karmela part of the Riad.    However I absolutely recommend and would definitely stay again.

We so liked the design of the hotel that we set out to the souk to find similar decorations for our home!  The location is ideal for getting around Marrakesh. The only problem we encountered  was with parking our car and transferring our luggage when we arrived and when we  left though the friendly and helpful staff did all they could to be of assistance.

Riad Karmela,Awais M wrote a review Aug 2018,50,What a wonderful stay!,Me and my family stayed at the Riad Karmela and what a wonderful stay it has been.    Located in the old Medina it is a very beautifully decorated Riad. The courtyards and rooms were so cozy and had a such a homely and traditional feel to them - it felt like we had gone back to another time!    Sitting on the rooftop and having dinner during dusk time while hearing the sound of the Adhaan calling was one of our very majestical experiences.    What I really liked was that on the day of our arrival (after the mint tea and delicious pastries) we were shown a detailed guide and encouraged to explore the old city and Souk around us. This is what made the the whole experience so exciting for us as well as the excursions. Our safety was also given utmost priority.    Every single staff member was extremely friendly and treated us like their own family. We really enjoyed talking to them and they were always willing to go beyond to help us and make our stay as comfortable as possible. The staff at reception always fulfilled whatever requests we had.    I remember the guys that used to serve us dinner - One of them was a guy called Khaled. Again so very pleasant he would always make sure that my children were fully catered for and would remember the next day if we had any additional requests. Just always going extra to make sure we were properly served.    We miss our stay at the Riad Karmela and can’t wait to visit again. It’s been such a memorable experience.

We were presented with a map showing us where we were and the location of the souks and The big Square(you will get lost) but no worries people are friendly and all roads led to the square. The atmosphere within the Riad was bewitching. The orange trees water fountains and gardens added to the tranquility. We were upgraded to the Khadijah room. The interior design was breathtaking and yet calming at the same time.    The rooftop restaurant deserves a special mention due to it’s scenic views . A special thank you to Maggi and Khalid both with warm and friendly personalities who made our stay welcoming and memorable. I must add the directions given to us by the owner were spot on. Thanks.

We also thought the accommodation was excellent with exquisite furnishing and pieces of Islamic art work. Our room was well appointed and it was great opening the doors onto the large outdoor living area which was surrounded with comfortable settees and chairs.

As soon as you step through the door the hustle and bustle of the medina ends and a calm peaceful oasis awaits with only the sound of the fountain and birds.  Staff were all extremely friendly and spoke great English although we were happy to try and recall the little bit of French we could remember from school!  We very quickly got the hang of negotiating the winding alleys/scooters/donkeys/sellers to find our way to the main square and felt totally safe walking back at night.  After a morning spent exploring it was lovely to come back and chill on the rooftop terrace. The Riad sells beer wine and spirits.

Riad Karmela,Pat W wrote a review Jun 2018,50,"Wonderful riad, wonderful hospitality!",My friend and I had a wonderful three-night stay in the Zorha room at the Riad Karmela in late April. We appreciated the free transfer and warm welcome -- the warmest of our two-week stay in Morocco. The riad consists of several houses joined together so we got as lost inside the hotel for the first day or so as we did in the Medina. The location is great once you understand where it is. But the Medina is not for the faint-hearted or slow of foot because of the population density lack of signage and oncoming motorbikes. My French was indispensible for getting directions.    Our room was great and very quiet (and I am very noise-sensitive). The breakfast was super and our dinner there on our first night in Morocco was the best of the entire trip (mezes and chicken tagine)! The hotel arranged for a guide of the Medina and a driver to take us to Essaouira both at reasonable prices.    Unfortunately we left in bit of hurry as the driver was waiting so we didn't carefully check the bill and later noticed a 40 euro overcharge. I am a travel agent and one of the factors that makes me so sincerely recommend this riad is the effort that Bouchra and Joel exerted to correct the mistake and refund the money. They were wonderful! I highly recommend this riad for any travelers who wish to stay in the Marrakech Medina.,Date of stay: April 2018,,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/passp0rtpat

Riad Karmela,Ali A wrote a review Jun 2018,50,The most perfect of places!,Riad Karmela is one of those special places I was lucky enough to discover.    My Mum requested a weekend in Marrakech and who was I to say no?! She was sold before we’d even managed to check in - on sight of the Reception dwelling Tortoises she was happy!    The staff are all amazing. Happy to speak in English French Italian.. you name it. Nothing was too much trouble. We were given maps and directions (but they expect you to get lost - everyone does!) and even told how much to pay for a taxi - complete with strict instructions on how not to negotiate before you get in the car! Never quite managed to do that but it was great knowing how much we should haggle down to!    The food was delicious - both for breakfast and dinner and very reasonable. We had both meals on the beautiful sun terrace.. whilst other guests practiced Yoga... it was very funny watching limbs appear over the wall!    If you’re looking for authentic Moroccan interiors I don’t think you could better Karmela.    We didn’t want to leave and I for one will definitely return.    Definitely take them up on their offer for an airport collection!  The only thing I would suggest to the Riad... in the booking information (before arrival) do tell people the taxi can’t take you right to the hotel. When you get there you’ll see why! But we arrived late at night and felt a bit weird being asked to get out of a Taxi & told “follow that man!” That man did carry our baggage and knew his way about so we followed!

Riad Karmela,lewis s wrote a review May 2018,50,"Amazing, relaxing experience with first class service for very reasonable prices",Riad Karmela pretty much blew us away from check-in to check-out. We arrived around 9:30am and they were so incredibly helpful with our bags and informing us of all the things to do in Marrakech. They even let us run upstairs and have breakfast!! We stayed a total of 3 Nights at Karmela and ate 3 dinners there along with their yummy breakfasts’. The first night we had a suite/like room up stairs with our own private terrace then after our desert excursion (we left our bags with them) we had an awesome little room downstairs. They have beautiful decor around the hotel and plenty of open air seating that really made the Riad inviting to lounge around at. If we ever come back to Marrakech we will 100% be staying with Karmela again.

Riad Karmela,KirnwoodKate wrote a review May 2018,50,The eye of the storm,"Almost impossible to describe the moment of stepping from the wonderful maelstrom of the medina down through the low blackened doorway hidden away in a narrow alley into this riad and its calm welcoming beauty. All noise and fumes dissipate the fountain plays musically and small birds call among the orange trees.    We had a wonderful stay with hot and cool days both of which revealed different aspects of the house. There are so many intimate places to lounge and relax ""indoors"" and out - the roof seems like an endless colourful playground - and you can chase sun or shade as suits your skin.    Our room overlooked the central courtyard and was spacious comfortable and quirky - we entertained ourselves speculating about the previous occupants of the riad and their interconnected family lives.    After three days in the old town we took a trip out into the Ourika valley organised like clockwork by the riad staff. Even in Spring this was a perfect counterpoint to the city with rushing waters crossed by spectacularly ethereal rope bridges leading to colourful waters-edge restaurants and in the near distance the snowcovered Atlas peaks. The painless introduction to a living Berber culture was fascinating.    Many reviews praise the breakfasts at the riad and we agree - a huge and delicious choice each day. Highlights for us were the freshly squeezed orange juice and the cheese omelette/tortilla. We had dinner in-house on our first night only and enjoyed the food very much.    Many reviews also praise the riad staff and again we concur. Boushra's welcome and introduction was a perfect orientation for the city and I would also especially mention the friendly quiet and attentive service we had from Khaled and his colleague Mohammed. But there are many others whose names we didn't find out who also contributed to our comfort. It's a good team.

Riad Karmela,CuriousSophia wrote a review May 2018,50,The roof terrace is heavenly (and enormous)!,I have travelled five times to Morocco and I love the traditional Riad style hotels. Riad Karmela ticks all the boxes and its roof terrace and various little marble tiled courtyards throughout the property make it a wonderful relaxing stay. We also LOVED the little tortoises wandering around throughout the place!    LOCATION  Like almost everything in the Marrakech Medina Riad Karmela is a little bit tricky to find when you first arrive it’s tucked away down a small lane not directly accessible by car so ensure that you have good directions or a map pre-loaded onto your phone to avoid wandering in circles if you take a public taxi. I would suggest on arrival that you book a hotel transfer (for not much more cost than a regular taxi at inflated tourist prices) for sake of ease! Once you’re at the hotel though and have your bearings it’s easy to find and to navigate your way around. I can highly recommend staying in the hunting busting medina it’s colourful and a great experience and once you’re in the riad it’s quiet calm and cool. A real escape!    ROOM  Our room was in the traditional Riad style with antique furnishings and lost of ornate textiles throughout. The bed was very nice and a smaller single bed at the end of the room which could be used for an extra guest or as a day bed to read and relax if it’s too hot outside. There was also a bowl of fresh fruit and complimentary bottled water which was nice. We had lovely large wooden doors and shutter windows (no glass) and a large bathroom.    SERVICE  We were welcomed with typical Moroccan hospitality and given fresh mint tea and a plate full of sweet pastries and biscuits while our bags were taken to our room. The service was always friendly and staff were always nearby to help with directions or suggestions should they be needed but were never overbearing.    FOOD  Breakfast was lovely typical home made riad style food. Fresh pastries breads roti pancakes jams cheeses fresh fruits and yoghurts as well as some nice savoury vegetables and fantastic onion omelette! A great self service spread with lovely fresh coffee and juices. We loved sitting in the courtyard by the water feature with the tortoises wandering around us. Very instagrammable!    FACILITIES  The various marble courtyard and sitting areas throughout the riad are divine. Lots of quiet corners to sit and read or drink tea and chill a lovely relaxing spot away from the bust of the medina. The roof terrace is a perfect sunny spot if you want to top up your tan or read or nap somewhere sunny. I loved it up here with comfortable deck chairs and beautiful potted cacti and bougainvillea dotted around the place. There are also shaded areas with sofas covered in lovely Moroccan cushions if the sun gets too much. It’s a great spot to take in the sunset and we ended up meeting some other guests up here in the evening for a glass of wine which was rather civilised!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousSophia

This could have gone a little smoother for all with a txt message or even a written message on paper to explain when we arrived to save stress. Joel the owner /manager came and explained so we could relax.  The staff did a good job of smoothing over with their friendly service Moumid ( Mohammed) spent time learning what our needs where and doing his best with English to assist.  All the staff we met in both Riads were very courteous and informative. I especially liked how Khalid when serving the very delicious evening meals took the time when asked to tell me what was in out food so I may try recreate at least one Morrocan meal myself.  The food could not be faulted as we had a variety of starters mains vegetables desserts and sweet treats for each evening meal.  Breakfast was included each morning and I've never enjoyed such a wonderful spread of a variety of breads fruits spreads cheeses and meats to try some very Morrocan but also Continental with croissants yoghurt and variety of cereals plus fresh orange juice pips and pulp so you know its not prepackaged.    We loved the 3 resident tortoise my daughter nicknamed huey lewie and duey and giving them a few special fruit treats from our breakfast as seen below ☺️.

My only disappointment was not coming at the right time to make use of the beautiful terraces and taking a dip in the jacuzzi or having the time to make use of the Riads Hammam and Massage but maybe I will make a return visit 😊,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sidi Kaouki, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SereneEP

Its location is perfect for discovering the old city with its many souks gardens and great restaurants.Once inside it becomes tranquil and relaxingenjoying a pot of Moroccan mint tea in the beautifull garden with traditional settings.  The staff are very warm and friendly but professional. Always assist with reserving restuarants  taxis and trips if you wish. Special thank you to Bouchra and Joel (also the night crew )  It was my wifes birthday and they made a special breakfast table decorated in roses and birthday wishes. That was a suprise and she really enjoyed it.  The rooms are beautifully decorated in tradional style very clean and comfortable.  The Hammam and massage was fantastic highly recommend it.  It was our first time in Marrakech and we really had a great time. This was due to the Hotel being excellent and the staff making our trip safe and smooth.  Highly recommend the Riad Karmela without a hesitation.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B_b_i_o18
Riad Karmela,Brian K wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Recent short stay,My partner and I stayed at the Riad recently. After a somewhat inauspicious start the taxi driver that was despatched by the Riad to collect us from the railway station was waiting for us at the airport for an hour we were generally impressed. The Riad is ideally located. It's quite opulent and we found the staff to be a bit aloof initially but after a couple of days they became more welcoming. Negatives? The taps on the two bathroom sinks only allowed a trickle of water to flow so the choice was shower or nothing. Otherwise the room was excellent.  Breakfasts were superb. A vast selection of quality foods. What a great way to start the day! We ate there for the first 2 nights and I thought the tagines were abysmal. Completely devoid of flavour and warm upon arrival as opposed to sizzling. There was also no choice of mains. On the last night we ate out locally and the tanginess were positively volcanic and very tasty.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briankV8621FM

It's a very relaxing place breakfast is good with fresh local fruit dinner is not included but you get a really good value if you eat in there as well. Very good location away from the main hustle and bustle. The only improvement would be if they had even the smallest pool or if the jacuzzi on the roof terrace was operational.

Riad Karmela,lno37 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Delightful Riad in great location,We spent 4 nights at Riad Karmela and the location is perfect. It’s in the heart of the old medina and ideally situated for walking through the souks to do some shopping or stop at one of the many local restaurants. Riad Karmela itself is absolutely delightful and it really is an oasis of calm and tranquillity. The whole Riad has been stylishly decorated with a nice mix of traditional Morroccan and contemporary style. There are 3 courtyards and whilst all are lovely the main courtyard is gloriously pretty with its pool and orange trees. Breakfasts were great with plenty of choice to cater for every taste and everything was consistently delicious. The one thing that sets this Riad apart is the amazing staff especially Bouchra who went above and beyond to look after us. In fact all the staff we met were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. They all made our stay very easy be it booking restaurants or taxis organising day trips out of Marrakech or even arranging spa treatments. On that note I should mention that I booked myself into the Riad’s on-site spa for a Moroccan hammam followed by an hour’s relaxing massage. It really was a wonderful experience which I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone. I can also recommend heading up to the roof terrace as we were there in April and were able to lie out on the sunbeds one afternoon and enjoy pre-dinner drinks on the terrace later that evening which was lovely. Riad Karmela is a real gem and we wouldn’t hesitate to return.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lno37

Appreciate the excellent service like sending someone to meet us as our driver (from desert tour) was unable to bring us close to the property.

All of people working there were extremely friendly and helpful. We were provided a map with all the details upon arrival. The Riad is within walking distance to most of the attractions in medina. The Riad is really not hard to find from the center of the medina. we used maps.me it was very accurate. we walked back to Riad at 9-10pm from Jemaa el-Fnaa and felt very safe. Another good thing about this Riad is that it is about a minute walk from a small square where our driver waited for us for our tour.

The place is super super super nice with fountains in the common area and a huge terrace where you can relax and sunbathe! The food is super good even if we only had dinner there once we really enjoyed it as well as breakfast which is pretty complete. The staff is super nice ready to help you with everything starting with the city map and ending with how to deal with people in the souk (market). The entrance is lovely: a tight road (not dangerous at all) with carpets outside the little door where you have to ABBASSARTI in order to get into it.

Riad Karmela,AmandaMIller5190 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Relaxing and Beautiful Riad,This Riad is located right in the middle of the medina with is both awesome and a little cray. It's very difficult to get to the Riad if you've never been before and even more difficult to get a car to the entrance. So that means you need a guide once you're dropped off by the taxi! Don't you worry you'll have plenty of people offer to take you but they want to be paid and it can certainly make you a bit uncomfortable if you're not expecting it.  Just book a car via the Riad BEFORE your trip and upon arrival and have them come collect you once you are dropped off by the taxi (if you have phone service). If not you'll still be fine. We never had any trouble it was just a bit of a shock for you know a couple who had never been to Marrakech before who had the label TOURST all over them.    Anyway I digress. This Riad is absolute heaven. The people working at it are absolutely fantastic and offer to book different restaurants and attractions for you. I seriously can't recommend the place enough. The interior is absolutely magical. So much natural light beautiful birds chirping and bright orange trees in the middle of everything. Breakfast in the morning is fantastic and a large spread of different things from breads jams hot dishes cheeses...etc.They have an amazing rooftop terrace that we spent our mornings on to enjoy the rays of sunshine because we tend to forget what sunshine is living in London.

Riad Karmela,jonathan h wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Charming Riad in the heart of the Medina of Marrakesh,The Riad Karmela is one of three sister riads in the heart of the Medina. The other riads are the Zinab and the Princesse.  We opted to arrange through the Riad Karmela for a transfer from the airport and we were glad we did as taxis cannot get to it and you are likely to get lost. It was a reasonable €15 and well worth it.  As we were staying a week we were upgraded to a lovely room in the quieter Zinab nearby which has a small pool.  We had evening meals at all three riads and were very pleased with the food which is kooked to order so you have to reserve a table in the morning if you want an evening meal so the produce can be bought specially. This means the food is fresh and there is little waste.  These riads are really well situated about 15 minutes from the Jamaa el Fna and handy for the souks the Maison de la Photographie and other museums. The wifi connection was very good.  The staff are really friendly and helpful. We would happily stay in the Karmela or the Zinab again. They are a very stylish and tranquil oasis in the midst of a bustling dusty and hot city.  Our only criticism is that the food menus are priced in Euros and as UK citizens we took Dirhams. Of course you can pay in Dirhams but we would prefer to see everything priced in the local currency. Also the bill at the end of the stay did not have a day by day total Instead it showed the total number of beers glasses of wine main meals etc we had had throughout the stay. It would be much better to show what has been spent day by day.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanhR4061LN
Riad Karmela,gayn0r16 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Hidden Gem,I stayed here for 5 days in March my arrival was a little concerning as my friend hadn't wanted to book the collection service so we had to make our own way to the Riad thinking it would be easy to find. Id heartily recommend that you at least take up the offer of the collection from the airport as its quite tricky to find. Once we arrived at Riad Kamela we were greeted with a lovely cup of mint tea and some sweet pastries and given a blow by blow account of how to get around the Medina which was invaluable. Its a rabbit warren of narrow windy streets. The Raid we stayed in was just around the corner and was part of the group of Riads. Once we had the front door opened to us we were in a beautiful courtyard with orange trees growing in the center and a smallish plunge pool in the that was heated to 30 degrees. We had a room on the ground floor which opened up onto the pool area which was beautifully lit at night and Mohammed did his best to see that we had everything we wanted. The room was tastefully decorated in Morrocan style with a large comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. The shower left a little to be desired with a bit of a dribble that was either too hot or too cold but we put that down to ancient water systems and didn't mention it to the staff. It was a fab room the only downsides were that breakfast was served outside our room every morning which would have been fine apart from the small children that got up very early and were quite noisy outside our room but I'm sure only affected those on the ground floor. The other thing was that a sofa was outside our room and if we were lucky enough to get to sit on it it was lovely but if others sat there you felt a little confined to your room. We had dinner in the Hotel Karmela one night and the food was lovely the wine was delicious but a little expensive at 28 euros a bottle. However we were offered a complimentary drink at the end and a glass of wine the night before we left for home which was a nice touch. All in all we had a lovely time and would reccomend it to others,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayn0r16
Riad Karmela,Dan_Hemingway88 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Incredible oasis in downtown Marrakesh,"In Marrakesh especially the Medina the one thing that you can guarantee is that at one point you will find yourself lost in the hussle and bussle of a truely authentic and mesmerising city.  This charming riad is located bang in the middle of the busy medina area and offers a calm oasis of high-end hospitality just minutes from the ""chaos"". I feel it appropriate to write this after reading other reviews as this should not discourage you from staying here and to encourage you to overlook comments that this riad is hard to find. It is as equally ""hard"" (or easy..) as any other riad to find in the medina but it is head and shoulders above the rest.  Moreover the staff are incredibly diligent in detailing exactly how to navigate the labyrinth of streets and how to deal with the locals - I have never had such a long welcome briefing despite only staying for two nights. Also when you do get lost (and you will..) enjoy it pay attention to the hotels guidance and you will have a great time.  The location is perfect just outside the main market area 10 minutes from the souks and the main square with good local restaurants nearby and easily walkable to the main dining areas - ask at reception for recommendations!  The riad itself is very clean modern yet with a very authentic feel. Rooms are clean spacious and well kept with large en-suite bathrooms.  It has an amazing roof terrace with sun loungers heaters and covered areas. The communal dining area is amazing with great authentic decor and ambiance.  Breakfast was very very good with a large selection of cold and hot food and the chefs and staff are very attentive.    Most importantly the staff especially the manager are incredibly attentive and informative. We were given a long introduction to the area and how to find our way around as well directed to the best places to visit with our time available (including tips on what to expect when dealing with locals in taxis in shopping areas etc..). They obviously care a lot about your experience and and miles above the service of other riads we stayed in within the Medina. We tried to extend our booking here and even when fully booked the management went out of their way to find us a similar accommodation unaffiliated to this hotel.  I can't rate this highly enough and would recommend anyone staying in Marrakesh to stay here for at least a few nights. The riad also offers day trips to the Atlas Mountains and surrounding areas if you want to escape the buzz of the medina for a while.  An excellent place to stay and incredible value for money.    Tip: You'll almost certainly bump in to a friendly local advising you to visit the tanneries (google it). It's a great experience if you know what to expect. If it's not for you the best advice in Marrakesh is a polite but affirmative ""no thank you"".

Riad Karmela,bpwarbler wrote a review Mar 2018,30,"Quaint hotel, but difficult to find and exorbitant airport transfer cost",The Riad is extremely hard to find in the maze-like Medina. The hotel recommends getting their taxi as a result and charges 20 EUR for a short drive that should otherwise cost no more than 3 EUR.    At night locals will follow you home and then demand money because they “helped you find your way.” We has a guy in front of us “leading” us home despite us ignoring him and using GPS navigation and another guy tailing us from behind. Because of this I highly don’t recommend staying here unless you’re in a large strong group.

The hotel is beautifully furnished the rooms are very comfortable and it is very well located in the old part of town near the Souks.  Our room was on the top floor and had two private terraces. The stairs are a bit steep but if you have mobility issues this would not be a problem as there are plenty of good rooms on the ground floor.  There are plenty of very comfortable areas in the common parts of the hotel to sit and relax. The food is very good and we had breakfast there every day and dinner on two nights. The dinners were traditional Moroccan and I enjoyed both. An added bonus is that they served wine not always the case in Marrakech restaurants and we had a decent bottle of reasonably priced rose.  The staff are exceptional - friendly welcoming and very helpful.  It’s the best hotel I’ve stayed in on holiday in a long time and we will visit again.

Riad Karmela,MRGUk wrote a review Feb 2018,50,A stylish and welcoming oasis in the middle of the Medina,This was my wife & my first trip to Morocco and we’re really pleased to have chosen to stay for 5 nights in Riad Karmela. The location of the Riad is in the middle of the Medina and within a few minutes walk of the vegetable market spice market and main square. As such you feel completely immersed in the heart of Marrakech though the flip side is that I can confirm that it’s vital to get a taxi pre-ordered by Riad Karmela for the airport pickup rather than take one from the airport taxi line. This meant that the taxi could drop us off very close to the Riad and for us to be met by a bloke with the barrow to help us with our cases and more importantly show us how to find the Riad down a side street and passageway. From the hustle & bustle of the Medina the Riad is a welcome place of tranquillity. The staff were very welcoming and provided useful local information to help us start getting our bearings and decide how to spend our time in Marrakech. We ate dinner in the Riad on our first night and can highly recommend the standard of cooking service and ambience of eating in one of the inner courtyards of the Riad. It was a nice touch that upon receiving our final invoice a bottle of wine had been deducted from the dining bill as a special deal for our first night which happened to be St. Valentine’s day. Our accommodation was spacious and comprised a sitting area large bedroom and en suite bathroom – all very clean and tastefully decorated. The daily breakfast buffet was also to a high standard comprising fresh fruit juice fruit cereals omelettes breads cold meat/cheeses etc. My wife had a Hammam treatment and back massage whilst we were there and would recommend it if treatments are your thing. We also took advantage of one of the day trips organised by the Riad and visited the Imlil in the Atlas Mountains for a 2 hour trek up through ice and snow (mid-February) followed by lunch in the home of a Berber villager. If you don’t mind a bit of exertion then it’s an interesting day out. So in summary I can’t think of a better place we could have stayed in whilst visiting Marrakech and can unreservedly recommend this particularly Riad.

Services including the spa were fantastic especially when I wanted a break from the medina (and in this case the weather as my trip ended up with some rain). Dinner was exquisite. Room was beautiful the bed was very comfortable and the space in general was a tranquil place to relax from the chaos outside.    While services such as the spa and the food can be expensive for the area it is very affordable if you're visiting internationally and led to one of the most high-end stays I've ever had rivaling even that of the Westin Miyako in Kyoto.

For me I found the beauty of Marrakech lies within the Souk and Medina. The location is perfect with the famous chaotic indoor markets right on your doorstep. Stepping from the dusty alley into the Ryad is a magical experience; a feeling of calm tranquillity…silence.    The staff above all else were the highlight of the Ryad; a wonderful welcoming sufficient information in relation to the Ryad and Marrakech itself. Wonderful recommendations in relation to restaurants and sights ensured we had an adventurous and satisfying stay.    Highlights of the Ryad include the interior decor the fabously themed rooms and the private roof terrace; a wonderful spot to view the sunset enjoy a glass of wine listening to the faint hustle of the Souk below.    Facilities were great very clean super comfortable bed and heated indoor pool/jacuzzi (very important after a day exploring Marrakech).    The wifi could be better as different networks service different areas of the Ryad. The location could be a lowlight should you want an exclusive “Western” themed hotel - you will not find these in the Medina.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Switzerland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrentC93

They gave us a map and plenty of useful information about restaurants hammams and place to visit. The waitresses and reception staff are really friendly.    Room  The room was large typically decorated and perfectly clean. As it was winter (January) we suffered a little but the cold in the room and the guardian gave us a small heater we really appreciated.    Location  Really well situated the ryad is at 10 minutes walk from Jeena El-Fna place and 5 minutes walk from Ben Salah place for taxis.    Food  The breakfast was colourful and generous (fruits bread eggs smoked salmon cheeses cereals juices). Indeed they served us soy milk and non gluten food as we needed.

Arrived a little stressed and exhausted having overpaid for a taxi and then paying for directions (definitely use the Riad taxi service!!!!! Big mistake on our part not doing so!!!!!) we were welcomed with mint tea and biscuits. We were upgraded to a beautiful room which was a lovely surprise. Staff were very helpful in providing a map of the area and directions for getting out and about. The Riad is located about a 5 minute walk from the beginning of the Souk and a 10 minute walk from the main square.    Breakfast was lovely - fruit delicious fresh croissants cheese meats and smoked salmon as well as a number of other options!! The breakfast/seating area is wonderful and Very peaceful - lots of little birds chirping and surrounded by orange trees. It was also lovely to relax there after a busy day and play one of the board games that are available to use.    Will definitely return!!!

Riad Karmela,dkc484 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,So much more personal than a hotel,This is a beautiful establishment and so much more enjoyable than staying in the usual hotels. The decor is fantastic and our room (when we got moved into it) was amazing. However the owner needs to ensure maintenance is kept up to date and not rely on visitors to point out obvious faults (safe not working toilet roll holder hanging off wall toilet seat loose and a dog-eared information folder)  We had arrived to be told that we would be in a different Riad owned by the same person for the first two nights. We were well compensated for the inconvenience.  The staff are brilliant so helpful and ensuring all our needs were met.  Our only real disappointment was the evening meal. We would have liked to eat in the Riad most evenings but the set menu was mediocre at best and expensive for what we were given. It is relatively easy to pick almost any cafe / restaurant in the Medina and get a better meal for half the price.  That said Riad Karmela and Karmela Princesse are wonderful establishments and well worth using on a visit to Marrakech!,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dalmally, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dkc484
Riad Karmela,Ali M wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Heaven in the Medina,My friend and I have just returned from a truly wonderful stay at Riad Karmela in Marrakech. Joel (the owner) and his team are extraordinary. Customer service of the highest level. From being welcomed personally by Joel until our final departure everyone we dealt with was a delight. The Riad is truly a little corner of paradise within the hustle and bustle of the medina. It is calm relaxing and beautiful. The rooms are traditionally decorated spacious with a lot of character. Having spent 3 days climbing in the Atlas Mountains we enjoyed massages at the spa which were very good. The breakfasts in the morning were delicious and the coffee nice and strong! On our final evening we had the traditional meal in the Riad the fish tagine was out of this world it was one of our favourite meals in Morocco! I only wish that I hadn’t been feeling under the weather during my stay! I would recommend guests book transport through the Riad upon arrival as it will avoid being overcharged by local taxi driver or not finding the Riad. My only recommendation would be that the prices are not listed in euros everywhere however I do appreciate from discussions with Joel that the majority of his guests do use euros. (Note you don’t have to pay in Euros!) Many thanks for a wonderful stay. We will definitely recommend the Riad and Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alimE233LJ

Riad Karmela,Gavin P wrote a review Jan 2018,50,Beautiful Riad - great location - superb staff!,I stayed in this Riad late October/early November with my teenage son and my mother. We had a fantastic time. The Riad was lovely - the rooms were great - a lovely comfy bed! The property has been very tastefully restored - there is simply character at every turn!    There are various places to relax within the Riad - so plenty of room - and it is an amazing oasis of calm from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech - yet you are pretty much in the heart of the action just outside the door!    The owner manager and staff could not have been more welcoming friendly and helpful - from the initial chat over a mint tea about all the places to go - and avoid - to anything else they could help you with (booking restaurants recommending places to visit advice on how to not get ripped off getting a taxi etc).    We had a great time - the weather was perfect (30 degrees in November!) quad biking and a trip to the Atlas Mountains is a must but the security and peace of the Riad will definitely draw us back one day!

In the evening we dined on the same terrace under stars and moonlight with lit lanterns all about. It was magical. The staff is outstanding. If required they will escort you to someplace you want to go. They also arranged camel rides and a cooking class for us. When we return to Marrakech we won't consider anywhere else.

We stayed in the Riad Karmela Princess which for all practical purposes is the same riad as Riad Karmela. Great location in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the Medina with the riad itself as a quiet oasis. Wonderful rooftop-terrace and nice common areas to sit down for a cup of tea or a glass of wine in the evening.  NB! I strongly advise you to book (in advance) transport from the airport through the Riad. A car/taxi will then wait for you at the airport and the staff will meet you where the taxi stops and walk with you to the riad (cars can't get all the way due to very narrow streets/alleys). It is pracitcally impossible to find the riad by yourself the first time (don't worry this is a part of the charm of the Medina you learn quicly how to navigate:-)).,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Asker, Norway",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HegeF01

Our room was at the top of the Riad which meant we had to negotiate 2 flights of very narrow stairs but it was worth it as the room was spacious and clean.

Riad Karmela,MarkL2012 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Excellent location and helpful staff,We chose the Karmela in large part because of its location within the Medina and also from the previous reviews. We especially liked the idea of the Abdou room with its private roof terrace and booked for 6 nights in October. The location is great for access to the Medina (especially the northern part). The souks and several important sites are within a few minutes walking distance as is the main square. We spent a great deal of our time walking around and about the Medina and relied heavily on the map and information given to us on arrival at the Riad which proved to be excellent and we never became seriously lost throughout our stay.    The room was fine and well furnished and kept clean. WiFi reception was generally good across the Riad but was a bit hit and miss in our particular room so this may be worth confirming if of major importance to you. (Also there is air conditioning but do not expect flat screen TVs and other toys found in 5* hotels. This is a Riad in the Marrakech medina not La Mamounia). We used the private roof terrace on a couple of occasions and enjoyed the views over the city.    The Riad itself was very tranquil and provided a welcome relaxation from the activity outside. The central courtyard and adjoining rooms were an inviting place to rest and read. The roof terraces dotted around the building were also very peaceful.    Breakfast dinner and drinks were served from the bar/buffet at the top of the Riad. Breakfast was a perfectly acceptable buffet with choices of cereals fruits meats pastries and breads. Cooked eggs and other options were available on request. Dinner is also available and is a good way to sample traditional tagines. Wine and beer is served along with soft drinks and waters. For different menus there is an option of dining at the Princess Karmela Riad next door (which shares some facilities with the Karmela). This menu is more modern and the meal we had there was excellent.    Service was good on all occasions with friendly and helpful staff. If any minor issues arose they were very keen to sort them out to our satisfaction but it is probably worth confirming any arrangements made in advance just prior to arrival to avoid any misunderstandings.    Especially useful was the advice we received on all aspects of our stay when we arrived and during the holiday which was extremely helpful (especially regarding taxi drivers).    Overall the Riad Karmela was very much as we expected it to be provided an excellent base for our stay in Marrakech and we would return on any future visits.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hastings, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkL2012
Riad Karmela,Safaribears wrote a review Oct 2017,20,"No ""1001 Nights"" Dream",The Riad Karmela nested in a quiet alleyway just a few minutes from the souks has an ideal location to discover the Medina. On their Website they offer an airport pick-up and we can recommend it because from the small place where the taxi has to stop someone will meet you to walk you to the Riad (on your own at first not easy to find).    We were welcomed by friendly Said who after serving us mint tea and Moroccan pastries in the court of the hotel presented us a map of the city and gave us a few useful tips along with info about the hotel meals and excursions.  The Riad is composed of 3 courts decorated with good taste where it feels good to relax. The two local pets are turtles; you may want to watch your step.    Our room was really big and nicely decorated. In one of the two closets was a safe. New water bottles were given every day.  They should consider asking the guests if they really want to have their towels changed every day. I have seen that in countries with less water shortage problems; the ecological principle should work there too. To this end a little piece equipment would be missing in the bathrooms (at least in the one we had): racks to hang the towels to dry.    The first evening we decided to eat at the terrace restaurant – 3 course menu for 25€. For a bottle of Rosé add 20€. We had first various small entrees then a chicken tajine and then a plate with various desserts. Overall it was OK be only found the Tajine a bit bland. The service was super friendly and the atmosphere was really nice.  Breakfasts were served on the top terrace too. Big drawback for the early birds: The buffet is served from 8 AM on. The choice of bread sausage cheese is mainly the same every day. If you only stay a few days you will not have time to get fed up with it. The women setting up the buffet were very friendly.  During the day you may ask the reception for drinks (yes they have beer) that you can enjoy in one of the many sofas on one of the many platforms on the rooftops. At the reception you may also change money at the normal change rate or book taxis or day-trips.    Now... The big drawback of the Riad Karmela: nights are way too short. Until way past midnight (one time it was until 2AM!)  the court was really busy with service people going from a corner changing room to a WC on the other side of the court. We accept that it is really hard to manipulate those huge wooden doors quietly the echo in the court doesn't help. The construction of the Riad itself cannot be changed much and the service people do need a place... This should be better organized a more separated place from the guests with full commodities to avoid so much traffic in the halls and isolate the guests from their talks and giggles too. We don't find it right one has to endure this kind of excessive noise one will get crazy waiting for the court to be quiet again specially when you know in a few hours you'll be wakened up by the first call-to-prayer of the day.    Sorry we don't only book a room for the nice settings but mostly to sleep... this explains the rating.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stuttgart, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safaribears
Riad Karmela,Katie B wrote a review Oct 2017,50,The BEST.,Late review but I stayed here with my boyfriend back in April. Absolutely blown away and can honestly say it was the BEST accommodation i have ever stayed it. The rooms were stunning and large with an equally practical bathroom. The courtyards outside the rooms made it seem like you were in an oasis absolutely magical. We had a slight problem with our transfer from the airport but we ended up getting a taxi and this caused us no major issues and they even offered to pay for our return taxi to the airport to compensate which they did not need to do. Once you arrive at the Riad it seems nothing from the outside down an unsuspecting backstreet however once you enter it is truly the most magical stunning place. The terraces on and around the roof are perfect for sunbathing and the small jacuzzi pool provides the perfect cool off dip. I could not recommend this Riad highly enough the staff went above and beyond to make our stay special recommending restaurants and booking taxis for us as well as bringing our food and drink to the terrace. Will be retuning the same time next year for sure and am already excited about it it really sets a benchmark for all other hotels!,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Salisbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiebH5053UE

I think your priority is knowledge about the hotel and then I'll give you a little background on the area to help you along the way.    Going it on yourselves alone prior knowledge can be quiet daunting and to an extent intimidating.    We arrived on early March weekday to a stunning airport  fantastic architecture.    Have your camera ready for this one.  Very well organised airport. We both speak fluent and it speeds up things.    Outside our driver was waiting for us to take us to our Riad.    Fluent in English French and apart from a great welcome gave us tons of information of what to do where to go.  I will always remember him for being so genuinely friendly and smiling.    He drove us through some very how shall I put it. ? It's like seeing a different world and actully you are this is 7 pm and dark.    The Street so narrow we where surprised he managed to drive the car through.    You see all sorts of shops one after the other.  Butchers silk dresses scarves cobblers spice shops ( this is an experience on its own.)    You can not reach the Riad the full way because of the narrowing of the streets. So no more then a few minutes and another young man comes to help get your luggage to the Riad    Where you are seated in an steroid and someone who speaks your preferred language will come to check you in and explain and answer all your questions.    We choose someone French speaking just to practice our French and I received a right compliment when the gentleman told my boyfriend "" your wife's French if I may comment Sir is far superior to yours. She has no accent whatsoever"")    Wonder what my boyfriend though.    Anyway we booked a superior suite which is actually in one of the pictures a tourist published and I must say it does justice.    It is a beautiful room on the second floor of the courtyard.    Massive bed. lovely tapestries furniture and a very big bathroom.    We hadn't planned to get a peaceful sleep...  Well we did!!!    We decided not to wonder if in the dark without knowing our whereabouts so we had a fantastic three course meal at the Riad .    Spicy lamb tangine and lentils as side I'd have eaten there again.  Do eat in the Riad at least once I promise you  You will not be disappointed .    The siting areas to relax with the fountains covered in tea lights and red rose petals make it for a very relaxing evening.  Many guests do stay the night in after a day in the Souks. A day of sightseeing or an early all day trip to the Sahara desert.    Marrakech is full of mysteries and places and things you'll never see again.    The hotel is more then willing to provide you with all the information you need and you can even arrange s trip tour through them.    Are you in one afternoon ? Interested in learning some Marrocan cooking or a pampering massage ?    Go see the owner at reception. She is very friendly and elk help you strange everything .    I was unwell when I first arrived and she found  me an English speaking doctor for me.    The Riad has an amazing display of furniture all around. Some really stunning pieces .    Never seeing anything like it.    Oh yes don't miss the roof garden terrace.  Ideal for sunbathing till 6pm.    Yes as early as the first of March and fab to admire a sky covered in stars. We did both .    Just a word or two on caution.  Before you go out of the Riad make sure you absolutely know how to get back on your own    Never under any circumstances accept a guide. back to your Riad.  You'll be in for a nasty experience and you'll end up all shook up.    Don't agree to giving money to any stranger i the Street nor be led to a ""bar""drinking is illegal in the old city and only legal in your Riad.    Legal in the new town restaurants and hotels for the residents only.    One more piece of advice do not take s taxi unless it has the official lighted ""taxi "" and a meter.    If in doubt or frightened call the Riad they will get you back safely .    Tipping is discretionary if the service was bad DONT tip.    Lastly never buy at the price they demand first.    Walk away you'll see how fast that prize drops      I sincerely hop you enjoy this hotel as we did.

Wonderfully welcoming hosts.,My son and I arrived for a four day holiday and couldn't believe how wonderful Riad Karmela was. Tucked into the backstreets in a perfect location for visiting the Souks and places of interest. Easy walking distance from everything. You turn from a backstreet into wonderful peaceful Riad reception and seating area with fountain. Staff took time to explain how to get places on a map over a free mint tea and Marrakesh pastries on arrival. Room was spacious and very comfortable lovely bathroom. Lovely big terraces to sit and relax. Perfect breakfast. The staff were all friendly and very helpful. My son and I had a wonderful magical time.

Riad Karmela,Jessica P wrote a review Oct 2017,50,"Beautiful, Peaceful Riad in Bustling Marrakech",The Riad Karmela was a relaxing beautiful place to stay in the bustling city of Marrakech. The staff was friendly and welcoming from the moment they came to collect our luggage and we were greeted with fresh Moroccan mint tea and cookies and a thorough description of a map of the city and recommendation for how to get around. The staff took excellent care of us during our stay and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinners at the Riad which we took on the roof both nights of our stay. There is a traditional Moroccan option and a modern option and we preferred the traditional. The rooftop was a well manicured beautiful and relaxing space and it is also where we had our delicious breakfast each morning. We stayed in 6 places during our journey across Morocco and the Karmela had the best breakfast spread. Our room also had its own private rooftop seating area which was lovely and the room was perfect to accommodate the 3 of us that were traveling.

Riad Karmela,John W wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Perfect location,We loved our time at the Riad Karmela. For us it had the perfect location in Marrakesh. You can explore the souks the crazy square and The Ben Yousouf Medrasa all within a few minutes walk of where you are staying and when you've had enough of the busy market life you can bolt back into the Riad and have a relaxing hammam and massage or chill out. Perfect. An hours massage costs just 30 Euro!!  The Riad was also beautiful and felt authentic and all the staff were friendly too. We felt like we were still exploring Morocco in our Riad.  Breakfast on the rooftop was lovely too and we enjoyed watching the Sparrows flying about the place and the food was fresh and plentiful.  We also used the jacuzzi on the rooftop which takes some time to ease yourself in as it was very warm weather and water was cold!!! But we loved spending time in there. We had dinner at the hotel one evening too which was great 3 courses for 25 Euro pp.  Our room was also large with Berber decorations hanging from the walls and a large bathroom too.  There are also many places to chill out in the Riad and our favourite place was on the rooftop sunbeds in the evening where we could chat look up at the stars and drink mint tea.

Pics really cannot do it justice!! When looking for a Riad We had something specific in mind! We wanted it to have that beautiful and colorful charm of morrocco and it did not only in decor but the staff was also very special!! Any request we had was met above and beyond. We asked for a recommendation for rugs and we were walked directly to a shop where we were takin care of like no other we feel as if we met a friend!! We enjoyed hammam and massages at the Riad and everything was exceptional!! You can feel the love and care that has gone into making this place so special! We also loved our room it was aziz but all are beautiful! There is also a sister Riad next door called princess Riad absolutely GORGEOUS!!

Riad Karmela,ZoopCha wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Enjoyable stay,Staff all very friendly and the room was simple but comfortable. Joel the manager and Saeed the night manager were very helpful with all our requests and queries. Joel helped us to organise the excursion to the Atlas mountains he explained it all very well so we were able to chose one that suited us the excursion to the Ourika Valley was exactly as Joel had said it would be the guide was very good no hard selling or surprising detours. We also had help booking a restaurant and as it was late evening the hotel security guard escorted us to the taxi from the pick up point and was there to meet us on our return as women travelling together we found this very reassuring. The Riad is at a good location not far from Jemaa el-fnaa which is easy to find once you get you bearings its fairly simple to navigate (Bushra who met us when we got there explained the area on the map well) but as the Riad not on a main road some motorcycle dodging is needed in the narrow street leading up to the Riad itself. Breakfast was basic but sustainable and the staff serving very friendly however we did find the hot water in the coffee/tea wasn't always hot.

Riad Karmela,nataliexda wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Wonderful accomodation for a perfect Trip!,As three women from Germany we've visited for the first time Marrakech and chose Riad Karmela.  It was the perfect accomodation with only 5 minutes of walking through the souks from our Riad to Place de Epices and 10 minutes to Place Jemaa el-Fna. We were surprised by all the friendlyness and kindness from all the people especially in our Hotel. Everyone was very nice friendly and always helpful. The room was big and always super clean - by the way our bathroom had nearly the size of our bedroom - it was so huge and perfect for us three!  We also had a nice variety of breakfast every morning which made our start in den day perfect. Our Highlight was our own private terrace on top of our large room from from which we watched the sunset every evening.

Riad Karmela,vin3507 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Fabulous find!,Wanting a late summer sun break we opted for this Riad over out of town hotels because we wanted to be central to the craziness that is Marrakesh! It was perfect the location the service the food and friendly welcomes from Said and the staff made for a wonderful terrific break.  The Riad itself is a myriad of quirky spotlessly clean rooms and corners. On arrival the owner Joel sat us down and highlighted on a local map places of interest and some good advice on do’s and don’ts . A definite for visitors is to pre book your taxi with the Riad it will make life so much easier for you. A quick email exchange prior to our trip was all it took. Stepping into the peace and serenity of the Riad from the noise and hustle of the Medina was a little bizarre it was so quiet when you know that not 100 yards away is crazy crazy! Evening meals and breakfast [delicious] were served on the sunny rooftop terrace and after a day in the souks a glass of wine and a beer can also be had here. The jacuzzi was also taken advantage of on days when we decided to lounge around and read which was perfect for cooling off. The Riad location itself is at first a little tricky to locate but after a couple of days wandering we felt like locals although we kept our map close to hand! Once you start wandering the labyrinth of souks you will soon realise the location of the Riad is perfect within minutes you will find yourself immersed in the maze. Although the local streets / alleyways are busy we never felt intimated or threatened in fact the locals were extremely friendly sometimes too friendly when they can see a potential tip coming their way. We soon learnt to say no thankyou and trusted our map and instincts! All in all a perfect trip and we would definitely stay again and recommend the Riad Karmela to anyone who wants to experience a stay in the Medina.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vin3507
Riad Karmela,tango9111 wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Wonderful Week,"Location. Karmela is centrally located about a 10 minute walk from the main square and a five minute walk from the Souks. There are a number of good restaurants and plenty of shopping within easy walking distance. It is also within walking distance of a number of historical sites. In Marrakech it is mandatory to get a guide and driver for a day to see the many disparate sites. The staff can arrange this for you. (They can arrange almost anything.) Their prices are very reasonable and will be charged to your room. You are in the middle of old Marrakech.    Ambience: The riad is composed of three large two story courtyards open to the sky which are interconnected with sitting rooms. All very quaint and romantic. Very Morrocan. Wonderful sense of place. There is a restaurant on the terrace (roof) where one can have dinner and breakfast.    Service. The service here is top notch. Can't imagine better. The front desk is equal to any concierge I've worked with. Ask for a beverage directions excursion or anything else and you have it with a smile. We were meeting two friends here for a stay in the city and then a trip to the desert. They arrived here from Fes sick the next day it was worse and the next day they were in the hospital for three nights. The Riad had first arranged a visit to the doctor and then an ambulance to the hospital. The manager Bouchra even visited them in the hospital. We extended our stay in Markela for a total of seven nights. The Riad cancelled our other reservations and was most helpful. My wife and I had a great visit in spite of our friends' illness.    Rooms: Each room is very different. There are singles doubles suites small apartments. You name it. Some have small bathrooms other large. Alll are decorated in a traditional style. My only complaint is that our ""double"" bed was actually two singles within a double frame. If this is a problem tell them when making a reservation.    Food. The food is good and safe but not spectacular. The breakfast is included. There is always fresh squeezed orange juice coffee an omlette choice of fruits breads cheeses cold cuts etc. Nice way to start the day. At night there is a traditional Morrocan meal for $25. The ambience especially at night is perfect.  Several nights my wife and I went up to the terrace later at night to lounge and have wine and tea.    Value: The Value is superb. My wife and I went for lunch at La Maison Arabe.  The public rooms were a step up from Karmela but it was no where worth three times as much per night. (The meal was worth the trip.) And for us Karmela's location was preferable.    Would return? In a heart beat.

Riad Karmela,Sarahlou191 wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Tranquillity,We stayed here as a part of a birthday trip. Before we arrived the customer service from the team was fantastic. They gave us the exact location to be dropped off so we weren't taken on a de tour by the locals etc. When we arrived at Place Ben Saleh (nearest drop of point for cars) a member of staff greeted us and took us to The Riad where we were greeted by the wonderful Syed. We were given Morrocan Tea and a some pastries and Syed gave us some information on places to visit and how to avoid being taken on de tours by the locals. Syed then informed us we had been upgraded for free to the sister hotel Riad Karmela Princess.  Breakfast is beautiful on the Karmela Terrace with a range of fresh fruits pastries and pancakes on offer. Fresh coffee and orange juice and tea is also available.  The Riad organised our trip to the Atlas (Ourika) mountains for us which is incredible. Very friendly and knowledgeable car driver who took us to meet our guide and was ready to take us back after.  We also had a traditional Hammam at the hotel. This is a must. The ladies who did the Hammam and the massage we had were amazing and we were left feeling very relaxed. Definitely worth doing.  The Riad is based 10 minutes from Jemaa El Fna and is quite simple to get back to just study the map before you leave. You really can't believe the hustle and bustle on the streets that stepping back into The Riad you are in a tranquil and serene environment.

It has a beautiful courtyard with two resident tortoises Josh and Clara. You have to keep an eye out for them when you walk through. I had a signature Hammam when I arrived and felt the stress of the airport-to-Medina transfer float away. The staff at Karmela are beautiful ... in particular Saed who is not only professional and efficient but has a wicked sense of humour! The rooms are stunningly simple and rustic. The bed was very comfortable. Air conditioning in-room and good wifi. The owners have built a new Karmela just opposite called Karmela Princess that opened 3mths ago. The design and detail in this one is mind-blowing. Also very modern as rooms have TVs and a mini bar. The rooftop terraces on both properties are gorgeous.

The Riad itself is beautiful with many areas to sit and relax on the fine Moroccan furnishing. The staff were also fantastic going well beyond any expectations I had. They gave us useful advice on excursions and placed bookings for us with the best tour operators. No request seemed too much and all members of staff seemed genuinely eager to help.

Riad Karmela,Jacqueline A wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Highly recommend!,"After much researching we settled on the Riad Karmela and we were not disappointed. We travelled as a family of four and were warmly welcomed by Joel who spent time in giving us instructions/tips in maneuvering beyond the Riad; the souks and Jemaa el-Fnaa (large public square with small merchants hawkers & entertainers). Service was very personalised and friendly. The staff are always smiling and greeting us which made us feel at home. We never once felt unsafe as Joel for our first couple of days made sure we walked the correct direction to the square. Location is brilliant as we were only a few minutes walk to the hustle and bustle of the main square.    Meals at the Riad Karmela are delicious and well presented. The whole place is clean and secure. We felt very cared for and enjoyed the free WiFi to communicate with family and friends.    This holiday was meant as an early birthday celebration for me and to my surprise at dinner on our last night there was a bit of a fanfare as the lights were dimmed and a huge chocolate birthday cake with my name on it was brought to the table. I was so excited as the staff sang ""Happy Birthday"" both in English and Arabic. I was so touched by their kind gesture I could not stop smiling. I will never forget the warm hospitality of Joel and his precious staff members for making our holiday the best! We miss them all and Marrakech already. Will certainly return!

Good food friendly and helpful staff clean and comfortable.    Various excursions can be arranged from the riad  avoiding the potential pitfalls of booking at outside agencies. You can be secure in the knowledge that your booking will deliver what is promised.    Free wifi a free birthday cake to celebrate my wife's birthday (brought to the dinner table by singing staff) and lovely traditionally decorated rooms. Also pleasant and relaxing communal seating areas as well as various treatments such as massages and reflexology.    I would recommend Riad Karmela highly if travelling to Marrakech.

The rooftop is an awesome place to chill out and even has a cold water jacuzzi which is divine after a day walking around the Medina. Rooms are great with Air Con - again a bonus in Marrakech. We booked a desert tour through this Riad (if you are thinking of doing one book direct with Riad online pricing is a rip off) and it was sensational. One of the best parts of our Moroccan adventure but keep in mind it's A LOT of driving. What really makes this place special is the staff all the staff made us feel like we were at home.

It is only 5 minutes walk from Jemaa el-Fna and close to many restaurants souks and other things to see and do in Marrakech. The staff were extremely attentive and always helpful. We undertook 2 excursions and a hammam experience all booked through reception as well as a 3 course dinner on our final night. Breakfast was a mixture of continental and Moroccan. We ordered freshly cooked fried eggs each day to put in their delicious French baguette! The riad has a beer a few wines and spirits available which is rare to find in Marrakech. Our room was a very good size comfortable cleaned daily and replenished with soap shampoos and bottled water (the room was called 'Hasna'). On the rooftop terrace there is plenty of shade to relax in the intensely hot sun and even a jacuzzi / plunge pool hidden in the corner which we took full advantage of.

Riad Karmela,martin s wrote a review Aug 2017,50,"Excellent Riad, 1st class location",This Riad is outstanding. Very traditional & spacious very colourful & quiet within the Medina. An oasis of tranquil sanity very close to the madness of the souks. The only access is via a network of small alleyways and yes it is hard to find! Thank God for Google Maps. I recommend that you request the Riad-arranged taxi to arrive & leave. It will be slightly more expensive but most taxi's ( especially airport taxi's ) will not know where the Riad is & as a result will leave you with farther to walk in the heat. Bad idea.    Bouchra and Joel were extremely helpful and are very happy to accept and reply to emails requests direct post booking. In fact all of the staff from Managers to the serving girls are friendly & helpful above and beyond the call of duty. When my otherwise excellent souk-bought pig skin satchel zips all fell apart Joel sent it to be repaired & on it's return refused all payment.    Breakfast and dinner can ( and should ) be taken on the rooftop terrace. The little pool also on the terrace is great. The a/c in all of the rooms works well and is heaven-sent. Alas this Riad is not too wheelchair accessible. There is no lift and although some rooms are on the ground floor there are also many steps to traverse to get to them.    The rooms all have a safe ( don't think this was mentioned in the Riad info ) but no tea-making facilities. Our rooms were on the 1st floor and were nice & quiet. However be aware that sound does seem to travel in the Riad music playing at a reasonable volume in one room can easily be heard two rooms down. All rooms have a hair drier.    Just a word about Tuc-Tucs. Try them! Reception can book them for you. 50 Dirhams ( £4.09 ) 2 up or 70 Dirhams ( £5.70 ) 4 up. Standard price for anywhere within ( and some without ) the Medina. It's a fantastic way to travel!

The staff are really accommodating and couldn't do enough for you.. the gem at the riad is not highlighted enough..jacuzzi ... it's tucked away and you wouldn't even know it's there and with the a long day out it's so nice to relax in. Checkin needs to change asi particular didn't enjoy sitting in the lobby for 20mins filling in checkin forms with information they could ask for pre arrival it's not what you want to do after a long journey. I didn't particularly like them adding tax to a train station transfer to the riad which was already expensive at €7 so around 77dh when a taxi cost 20dh but you live and learn plus when we booked we were told the city tax for our stay would be a total of €4 and it ended up being double that at €8 plus tax😡any way back too the good points breakfast on the terrace was excellent.. overall the riad is fantastic.

I would just like to thank Joel the staff of the restaurant (we only can remember one of the names Walid) the chefs (best ones of the whole Morocco?) and specially Bushra (hope it spells like this) for providing us with advice when needed.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"La Mata, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RG420
Riad Karmela,Carla M wrote a review Aug 2017,50,The perfect riad,Karmela Riad is all we expected to make our stay in Marrakech perfect. The staff is very friendly and close which makes you feel like home. The room we slept in was very cozy elegant and the temperature was on pint we didn't even need the air conditioner when we wanted to sleep (this should be surprising due to the high temperatures in Marrakech). Breakfasts are complete and the food is very tasty also de service is very nice. Honestly there is nothing to point out as negative from Karmela Riad. It made our stay in Marrakech wonderful. When we come back to Marrakech we will sure be back at this riad.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlaM5342
Riad Karmela,Nikkie wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Very friendly personel,The Riad Karmela is a real oasis in the busy medina of Marrakesh. The staff is very friendly and you'll get a nice introduction so you won't get lost. The food is also very good.  The only thing we missed were a few things at breakfast that's the only thing we can mention if we have to mention something about this hotel.  Tip: use the jacuzzi on top of the roof to cool down after a hot day!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/472nikkied
Riad Karmela,Verônica F wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Elegant oasis in the middle of the medina,We stayed in Fatima room. The room is very elegant simple and cozy we felt at home. The Riad itself is a mini labyrinth of good decoration we took some time exploring the corridors stairs and all lounges of the terrace. The terrace.... We loved having breakfast and dinner at the terrace. Take your bathing suit there is a small cozy pool to enjoy at the end of the day to unwind from the craziness of the Medina and enjoy the sunset.  The hotel is located in the middle of the Medina and the staff members will make sure you are well prepared to explore the outside of the Riad with your first information kit. We were received by Bouchra and soon after met Joel. Both were very attentive and ready for any information.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veronicafuturo

Riad Karmela,Joel R wrote a review Jul 2017,50,R Joel Rosen,I would love to share are excellent experience with Riad Karmela. First off the Riad was beautiful. It was in the heart of the Medina. Our family suite was comfortable spacious and delightful as well. The staff were excellent very genuine accommodating and helpful. We were unsure of staying in a Riad vs a traditional hotel but after this amazing experience I couldn't imagine staying any other way. Having a currency exchange on site was super convenient as were the ability to book excursions on site. Thank you very much to the owner and all the staff for an excellent stay. Lastly the breakfast on the roof top Terrace was a daily pleasure. Highly recommend.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5374PFjoelr
Riad Karmela,nigels670 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Highly Recommended,My wife and I stayed here 9th-13th July as a 50th birthday celebration . The Riad is absolutely beautiful  we were picked up from the airport and greeted by the Manager who served mint tea & sweet treats whilst showing us a map of the local area & giving good advice/tips. Every detail was exceptional from cleanliness service & food. All the staff were fabulous! Stay here you won't be disappointed!

Riad Karmela,EHAMum wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Beautiful Riad - highly recommended,We stayed at this Riad 9-13th July 2017. We arranged airport transfers which I would highly recommend. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had our room upgraded due to husbands Birthday - they even surprised him with a Birthday cake at dinner. Our room was spacious and spotless clean. The air-con was definitely welcomed when coming in from the 42 degrees outside.  Breakfast was continental along with local delicacy. We ate at the Riad every evening. We just found that we'd had enough of the crazy medina and the food was so good it was a no brainer! You can definitely eat cheaper elsewhere but we thought €20 each for 3 courses was good value. We exchanged gbp to Dirhams at the Riad & received a good rate - this made life so much easier with Moroccan currency being a closed one as we only changed what we needed.  We felt safer organising everything via staff at Riad.  We also went to a cookery class again organised via Riad - this was a fab day!  The roof terrace is a great place to relax with a beer/glass of wine.  Overall we would recommend this place to anyone including families. Our stay was memorable for all the right reasons & we will return one day.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Middlesbrough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EHAMum
Riad Karmela,sisterraysaid wrote a review Jul 2017,50,An absolute gem,We spent 24 hours in this beautiful Riad and it more than met our expectations. Finding it was relatively easy as the taxi got as far as a close by square. An old man guided us to the door. Gave him 10 dirham for his trouble.  The welcome is warm and involves tasty pastries and tea. The room has bags of character a powerful shower water and a safe in which to leave all valuables before venturing out in to the mele of the souks and the square.  The breakfast is excellent with fresh fruit and good coffee as well as the other Moroccan goodies. The jam was lovely.  We took advantage of the plunge pool and enjoyed the total tranquility of the setting.  The Riad organised the taxi back to the bus station and it was clear that they had our best interests at heart.  We will return for a longer visit to Marrakech now we have this sanctuary to look forward to.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sisterraysaid

The hotel staff explained the major attractions and and medina map very well making our navigation in medina easy. They are also happy to make taxi arrangement and answer your trip question if needed. The hotel is very nicely decorated in a true Moroccan style.

This place is beautiful and traditionally decorated with lots of alcoves to sit and relax away from the other guests. The room was huge and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was just ok but the juice and coffee were good. We didn't try dinner here or the massage as it looked a little expensive. That said this place gave us everything we wanted in a great location and at a very reasonable price.

My partner and I stayed here in June 2016 for his 30th Birthday surprise. We stayed at this Riad for 3 nights and I couldn't have asked for anywhere better. It is right in the middle of the hustle and bustle but once you enter the Riad it is like a different world so peaceful and quiet. We were greeted by Joel who is so friendly and welcoming all staff are prepared to meet your needs and will go out of their way for you. We were given some lovely Moroccan pastries and hot tea whilst checking in and eventually taken into our room that we had been upgraded to. It was absolutely gorgeous we had our private terrace upstairs and little courtyard just outside the room. We had dinner twice here and couldn't fault a thing! I requested a birthday cake for one of the nights and they even sang happy birthday with us. On the morning of the birthday they also decorated one of the breakfast tables with a little note and flowers scattered which was a lovely gesture.

Riad Karmela,elizabethotoole wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Excellent location and impeccable staff,An absolutely stunning riad with impeccable staff. I stayed here with my friend for three nights and had an amazing time. Upon arrival we were welcomed with mint tea and mini pastries a chat about the surrounding area and we were even upgraded to the Meriem suite free of charge - result! The room was a good size with a large bathroom and always spotless. It is also partnered with its 'sister' riad opposite called Riad Karmela Princesse which is less traditional and more 'chic' but equally as beautiful. Staff at both riads went above and beyond. Thank you to Ahmed and both Mohameds who were all charming respectful and polite. We felt like princesses for our entire stay.    The riad is tranquil and peaceful - perfect for when you've had a hectic day navigating the souks and need a break from the hustle and bustle. The decor of the hotel is traditional and it has multiple courtyards a roof terrace and spa facilities where you can get a hammam/massage and various other treatments including hair treatments etc. I thoroughly recommend them all! The riad is only 10 minutes away from jemaa el fna square (the main square) and is a relatively straight forward walk so much so that we both felt comfortable walking back from here at night either together or alone (both of us are 23yr old females).

There are many shaded areas to escape from the midday sun & a plunge pool to cool off in. Breakfast was served on the roof & there was a good selection. We had lunch here too & it was tasty.

When we first arrived they met us in the door showed us to a really nice and calming lounge and gave us moroccan tea. This was really nice after a long travel especially since almost all of us had stomach-troubles. Really they even helped us with that. We also got upgraded to another suite in Princesse Karmela. Beautiful! During our stay two other friends of us came and without no problem they fixed so they could stay with us and without paying extra. Our friends had stayed in a hostel and loved their new bed. Hehe.    furthermore the food was good there were good aircondition in the rooms and the wifi-connection was great.

Upon arrival we received a very warm welcome and were given lots of hints and tips of what to do and not to do which was very useful. They also have a spa which again was very good and reasonable prices.  The terrace on roof top is also excellent to relax and enjoy the sunshine.  I actually felt sad leaving as it just felt like being at home as built good rapport with the staff there.

The owners were extremely helpful and welcoming and were happy to help with any requests we had.

Riad Karmela,sunandseaUk wrote a review Apr 2017,40,A lovely Riad in an ideal location to feel a part of Marrakech,- Near to photography museum old university and a lantern souk/wholesaler - all very much worth visiting.  - Photography museum roof terrace cafe - intimate and excellent  - turn right after Riad for those mentioned above and the first souks you come to are as good as any others so buy your gifts there build a rapport locally and you will be greeted in a friendly manner each time you pass and offered discounts and gifts on return visits.  - have a mint tea at cafe du France - main square - it was the best one I had - glass stuffed with fresh mint.  - get advice from the Riad on prices for caleche etc - they saved us a fortune but you have to be firm and stick to your guns with the horse carriage drivers about price.  - you can walk back from the Hardin majorelle but it will take you 45 mins to an hour. We got horse one way and walked back.  - you must visit manouna hotel but dress nicely and expect to pay £18 or so for your g&t.

Riad Karmela,Jo-Ann D wrote a review Apr 2017,40,The Real Moroccan Experience,If you are looking for the real Moroccan experience you should book your stay at Riad Karmela! It is located in the old city- Medina and near the souks. It can be pretty hectic when you are strolling around and shopping but once you enter the Riad it is like an Oasis inside the Medina. The staff is great always attentive and friendly. Once you arrive they welcome your group with instructions of how to move around the souks they give you a map with useful tips and delicious Moroccan tea! They gave us recommendations of places to eat and did the reservations for us. They also schedule all the taxis and transfers. The spa offers great services (The spa is a must!) and the breakfast always fresh with delicious coffee fruit crepes and pastries.

Riad Karmela,Suusje2017 wrote a review Mar 2017,50,A real 'Garden of Eden' in the middle of the Medina,The Riad Karmela is a beautiful riad located in the hectic old part of Marrakech in the centre of the Medina close to the souks. Each time entering Riad Karmela felt like arriving in a quite lovely safe haven. The Riad forms a big contrast to the crowded souks and small streets you'll pass during your stay in the old town. Everyone at the Riad is there to make your stay as wonderful as possible. The staff is really friendly helpfull and we really loved the smiles we got from them. Besides the rooftop terrace is a great asset. We had drinks and snacks there every day.

Riad Karmela,Emily P wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Stay here - you'll never want to leave,My only complaint is that we didn't have more time in Marrakech and more time to relax at this riad - it's truly so wonderful and a little piece of heaven nestled into the craziness. The main area of the riad is so tranquil - there is a fountain and there are turtles that just roam around! And the terrace is also spectacular - a maze of lounge chairs cabanas and flowers. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming - helping with excursions and transfers from the train station and the airport. The location is great - easy access to all the sites and great restaurants.    I would recommend double checking any important reservations (like departure transfers) we had to ask a few times before our taxi to the airport was officially confirmed.

Riad Karmela,ArgyBargee wrote a review Mar 2017,50,Tranquil Riad,Brought my partner here for her 50th birthday and could not have been more pleased with my choice.    As we booked direct with the riad our transfer by taxi was included in the price of the accommodation and they delivered us straight to the door. If you're making your own way from the airport it would be tricky to find first time.    On arrival we were served traditional Moroccan pastries and mint tea while we were given information on Marrakech - what was good to see and do maps and the do's and don'ts for a safe stay - invaluable advice.    After the hustle and bustle of this crazy city Riad Karmela offers a safe and tranquil oasis in which to really unwind and relax.    There is a fairly limited menu served throughout the day for snacking or light meals and the option of booking a set menu evening meal of traditional Moroccan food which was excellent. All food and drinks were excellent value for money.    Our junior suite (Kaiss) with its own balcony was clean and comfortable with a real wow factor. I'd chosen it from the website and was slightly nervous that it couldn't be guaranteed until we arrived but was absolutely thrilled we were able to get it.    A buffet breakfast was served in the courtyard each morning with a variety of small birds and tortoises for company but this only added to the charm of our experience.    With temperatures in the low 30s we were grateful for the cold water in the jacuzzi type pool on the roof. There are sunloungers and chillout zones on the rooftop with plenty of places to get out of the direct sun.    With around a 10-minute walk to the main square and a dedicated security guard at the entrance to the riad's alleyway we felt happy and safe with the location.    Being a same sex couple we were slightly anxious but were made to feel incredibly welcome by everyone at Riad Karmela.    To summarise a fantastic riad with very pleasant and helpful staff. I'd have no hesitation in recommending Riad Karmela to anyone looking to stay in the Medina area.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cork, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArgyBargee

Riad Karmela,katieqd wrote a review Mar 2017,50,excellant location and very helpful staff,This location was great for walking to all the sights. The orientation at check-in was extremely helpful as we have never been to Morocco. We enjoyed mint tea and sweets upon check-in as well as in the evenings as we watched the sunset from the rooftop lounge. It was key to be arrange a pickup from the airport and a ride back. There are not 'streets' so I am quite confident we NEVER would have found it had we not had someone bring us straight to the door. The cab driver stops at a cab stand a distance from the Riad they load your luggage on a push cart and walk you the rest of the way to the front door. We took advantage of the hamas with service that was wonderful. Very relaxing and well needed after the long flight. We did get severely lost one night on our way to dinner and show. We thought we knew our way around by then as it really is not that complicated however we were hopelessly turned around. Luckily our phones worked and we navigated our way to the restaurant. Unfortunately we missed the dancer and later learned that the riad will ask someone to escort you/show the way for no fee to ensure you don't get lost. Our room was incredible we had two bedrooms my son stayed in the queen bed room and my daughter and I stayed in the twin bed room. Lots of space. We had our own private rooftop table and lounge area; and could venture to the open space that is available to all guests. We highly recommend dinner; chicken tagine was awesome with all the accompanying side dishes. The breakfast is included and was a generous spread of local bakery items and foods as well as the standard yogurt and fruit. The front desk was very helpful in making arrangements for us for everything from dinner and shows to camel ride and private tour guide.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kohler, Wisconsin",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katieqd

Riad Karmela,MikeLBristol_UK wrote a review Feb 2017,50,An oasis of calm in Marrakesh,We stayed at Riad Karmel for one night prior to our tour of Southern Morocco and then a further three nights at the end of the tour to have a look around Marrakesh. It is essential to book a transfer to the Riad from the airport if you do not want to get lost! This worked very smoothly and it only took about 20 minutes. It is quite an experience walking through the narrow alleyways of Marakesh but luggage is carried in a handcart and it is only a short walk. We were met by the owner Joel and provided with tea and cakes in wonderful couryard. He gave us a detailed briefing on how to get around Marrakesh safely either on foot or using a taxi. If you follow the advice you should be fine. We had booked a standard room for the one night and then a superior room for the three nightsand we were given a free upgrade to a suite on the second visit. I think it is worth paying just a bit more for a superior room. Both rooms were very clean and had all the faclities you would expect. When we returned to Riad Karmela we were greeted as friends by Siad the Manager who was happy to remind us about the things we had forgotten!The breakfast is excellent with lovely fresh fruit including strawberries and raspberries. There is a good selection of pastries and fresh eggs are available. We had two dinners at the Riad and both were first class. All the staff are so friendly and go the the 'extra mile' to ensure you have an enjoyable and relaxing stay. This is a wonderful Riad and gives superb value for the amount you pay. If we return to Marrakesh we will certainly stay at Riad Kamela. A second Riad but still part of Karmela I think has recently opened with the entrance just across the alleyway. We had a quick look at the ground floor with Joel and it looks exquisite with a more contemporary look then the original Riad.

Riad Karmela,murphyc88 wrote a review Feb 2017,50,"Wonderful Riad, charm personified",I have rated this 5 stars but do just have to say this isn't a luxury hotel with all the amenities that you would have if you were in one. If you want that then this isn't for you.    However what this does have is charm personified. Prior to arriving very quick at responding to emails with questions requests and organizing a taxi to pick us up from the airport. I highly recommend this as otherwise you wont be able to find the Riad the first time as a taxi can't take you all the way.    As soon as we arrived inside sat in this beautifully adorned courtyard with orange trees with some tea and sweet Moroccan pastries. Siad the trusted manager took us through details and essential information on the location getting around and places to see - in all the places round the world I have been lucky to stay in this was certainly the most informative start and most helpful. In terms of location you are a 15 minute walk to the main square but we loved walking through the souks and seeing all the colours smells and sights.    The room was as beautifully decorated as the rest of the Riad was and the rooftop had lots of areas to lounge and read.    Breakfast was a real treat - continental selection but with the added bonus of being able to order fried/boiled eggs as well as Moroccan pancakes. We had dinner one night which like most of Marrakesh was delicious and full of flavour. The food in Marrakesh is amazing however do eat at least one dinner at the Riad.    A huge thank you goes to Siad and Joel who have done an amazing job with this place and if we are ever back in Marrakesh then we will definitely be staying here again.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/murphyc88
Riad Karmela,Ben W wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Perfect Riad - Suite with Rooftop,This was our first time in Marrakech we spent two nights here. We decided to spring for the King Suite with the Private Rooftop (Abdou Suite) and we were not disappointed. The ground floor of the Riad is beautiful with comfortable sitting areas and great staff. The owner (Joel) is always around and is gracious and helpful. They opened a sister property directly across the street that we looked around (Riad Princess Karmela) that was awesome as well.    The breakfast setup was great with a fresh pot of coffee brought to the table.    Upon checking in the Mint Tea and the plate of cookies were great and the 10-minute summary from the main front desk guy was perfect. The personalized map with the Riad name was a great touch as well. It's a 10 minute walk to the main square but they can call you a (cheap) cab to a relatively nearby square that can take you anywhere.    The room was big and the spiral staircase to the comfortable private rootdeck was awesome. The bathroom smelled a little mildewy but otherwise no complaints.

The first time you go it's advisable to contact and ask the reception to book you a taxi from wherever you're arriving. The driver will get you to within 150 yards and a porter will transport your luggage. Once inside you'll meet the friendly and helpful staff be given a welcoming mint tea and a well explained introduction to the medina and what to do and not do.

We loved our stay there the riad itself is quiet beautifully decorated in the Moroccan style and consists of rooms around three patios filled with orange trees and a fountain and a succession of small very comfortable sitting areas. We reserved the Kaiss suite a large room with capacity for three people plus bathroom and WC and a lovely terrace/balcony overlooking the main patio which in December is covered. The staff are all very helpful and efficient and not only gave us a very interesting and helpful introductory talk about what to do (and what not to do in Marrakech!) but constantly helped us with booking taxis reserving a session at the spa booking a cookery lesson and even contacting an osteopath on New Year's Eve! The food was absolutely delicious we dined every evening at the hotel and were never disappointed quite the opposite. If you want to get away from boring 4 and 5 star hotels go to the Riad karmela it has all modern amenities but is in the middle of the old part of the town near the souks the vegetable market and the Marrakech Museum and just a 10 minute walk from the big square El Jemma.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janiceburlurut

The inside decor is luscious inviting and extremely tastefully done to make you feel like you are in the middle of a Moroccan oasis. There are two open fireplaces that we would cozy up to in the evenings to have dinner and chill.    Food: ethnic and mouth watering. Every single meal we had there was delish. Never went hungry and good value. It was very hard to eat else where as we always knew that the set menu at the riad was an excellent choice.    Service: Amazing!!! from morning to night - there are always staff on hand and if you needed anything at all from meal service to room service to laundry or even directions within the city - very helpful.    Loved: the fact that the riad was tucked away down an alley off the beaten track. Made us feel like we were right where the local action was happening.

Riad Karmela,ScanLondon wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Impeccable,I went for my birthday weekend in December. The Riad is impeccable. We got upgraded to a suite on the first floor which was really nice. All the staff is very friendly and welcoming. We booked the airport transfer through them as most of the reviews said it is impossible to find. Actually with google map is not that difficult. It is exactly where it is pointed and you have signs on the street indicating the entrance. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScanLondon
Riad Karmela,Dee M wrote a review Dec 2016,40,Lovely Riad in Marrakech near everything!,First time in Morocco and stayed at the Riad Karmela end of November 2016. It is a lovely place to stay if you want to be near the real Marrakech. Close to the Medina restaurants/coffee shops and markets. Stayed for 3 nights here with my daughter and our host Bushka was very nice and helpful giving us good advice and tips on where to eat and visit. We stayed in the room on the ground floor which we initially we found a bit noisy late at night and first thing in the morning. We were offered a possible move but decided to stay put as we really liked our actual room. I would recommend this lovely Riad in Marrakesh and would definitely return..,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JusDM

Riad Karmela,Paulvanw wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Hidden gem,My girlfriend and I stayed in riad Karmela two nights in October. We had an absolute great stay. The place is difficult to find (if you come from the airport it's easiest to arrange a taxi via the riad) but once you are there you will be surprised by the place. The rooms are great and each has an own unique local touch. The roof terrace is huge and beautiful and it is where breakfast is served. The staff is very helpful and really took the time to explain everything you want to know about the city. I definitely recommend the place and will surely come back (likely in spring!),Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Amsterdam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulvanw

Riad Karmela,113siobhanb wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Difficult transfer,"Riad Karmela is an economical choice and well located in the medina for access to all the sights. Being where it is in the medina does have its problems though as taxis cannot drop you off at the riad you have to walk the last 5 or 10 minutes which is fine if they send someone to show you the way you would never find it on your own.  On leaving we had booked and pre paid our transfer to the airport we checked the day before with the reception staff and were assured there would be someone to take us to the taxi next morning. We had to leave at 8 o clock next morning and make our way without the arranged escort no one except kitchen staff were there to offer any explanation when we got to the arranged pick up point no taxi no one who could speak English so eventually we ended up having to pay again and twice as much for a taxi to the airport but after an anxious wait felt we had no other option.  Apart from that the staff were friendly and helpful on arrival the riad is attractive the room we had spacious.  The prices on the menu do not show ""local taxes"" so be prepared for your end of stay bill to be a lot more than you were expecting.

The breakfast service on the roof terrace was a wonderful way to wake up. The coffee was delicious and breakfast was always fresh.    We had amazing food in Marrakech but dinners there were by far the best. Our favorite was the beef and artichoke heart tagine. It tasted like home cooking.    The quiet atmosphere was a welcome change from the bustling streets of Marrakech. It was truly a retreat for us.

Riad Karmela,LuvtoTravel_979 wrote a review May 2016,20,Big Disappointment,My friend and I stayed in Marrakech for a little over a week. Since we were doing a desert tour in the middle of the trip we booked two riads. Riad Karmela was the second riad that we booked for couple nights right before we left Marrakech.    To make a long story short I had high expectations about the riad based on the reviews I read but it turned out to be a big disappointment. The bathroom floor were sticky and the standard room was very awkwardly configured. There was hardly any room to hang our clothes and the narrow hallway from where the beds were to the bathroom made it hard for two people to walk by.    Also the night shift front desk person was not helpful whatsoever. We checked in late since our desert tour ended late. When we checked in there was nothing welcoming about his attitude towards us. He told us that he usually shows us around and explain how to get out of the riad to the main street but since it was so late he would do it later. The next morning there was a different person at the front desk and when we asked her how to get to Jemmaa el fna she explained verbally which wasn't all that clear.    For our departure we had arranged a transportation from the riad to the airport through them. Our flight was at 7 am so we had to leave the riad by 4:30 am. Again the same night-shift front desk person was rude and annoyed at our question about where to meet the cab driver.    Overall I would not recommend this riad to my friends or family. I am surprised at the overly high reviews I see here.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Boston, MA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvtoTravel_979

The hotel is right in the middle of the market which is very busy apart from the motor bikes and the bikes going up and down the area appeared to be safe and people around the market seems friendly.

Riad Karmela,JulzyI wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Lovely winter trip,We visited Marrakech over Feb/March this year for some winter sun. We received a warm welcome from the evening staff and a delicious 3 course meal on arrival. The riad is a wonderfully tranquil space in the heart of the busy medina.    Our room was authentically decorated and very comfortably I've would've given 5* if the rooftop plunge pool had been filled... I know 27 in February isn't overly warm at all for Moroccans but this is hot for us Irish!! Due to the layout of the Riad noise travels easily early mornings and late evening but I guess this goes with the nature of the place. It was clean and comfy.

I kept in communication with the hotel during the day to let them know the change to our arrival time and they asked if we wanted an evening meal so we agreed as we would be too tired to go out looking for food. The meal was 25€ and well worth it.  The room was dark and cool with windows and door looking out into the court yard I'm guessing this is very welcome in the heat of the day. There was a wall heater/air conditioning unit to warm us up at night. The room was authentically and brightly decorated with comfortable beds although I think the bedding could have been better quality. Bottled water was provided each day along with toiletries. The staff spoke excellent English especially Wahid (?) who was such a help on my last night when I was trying to do online check in with easy jet on my phone - but thanks also to Joel and Bushra for their generous hospitality.  Would I return to Marrakech - yes would I return to Riad Karmela - definitely for a short break for maybe shopping. And I would recommend this Riad for a short stay in the centre of the Medina.  However having experienced the craziness that is Central Marrakech I think next time if staying longer I would stay at a resort hotel with amenities only coming into the Medina to visit and shop and I definitely won't be visiting the Souks again. All the literature out ther doesn't prepare you for the onslaught of continual bartering and haggling of having to be a gymnastic linguist just to get away from them. Their age old methods put me off even looking let alone asking the price. They are aggressive and relentless and beware of young men who are extremely friendly then offer to show you the way before asking for money despite this practice of 'guides' being banned.  We stumbled upon Nomad a lovely clean minimalist restaurant of European styling serving a very reasonably priced modern Morroccan menu on the edge of the Place de Espices. Highly recommended for non fussy but tasty cuisine.  We arrived 1st March 2016 for 3 nights. Temperature warm - hot by day cool - warm by evening. The Riad is quite cold by evening so bring something warm to wrap up in.  Book your transfers with the Riad in advance for 15€ each way (for the taxi not per person).  Lastly thank you to all the wonderful staff at Riad Karmela including the taxi driver who loved a chat and was very interesting.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/509mandyb

Riad Karmela,Andrew W wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"Beautiful, friendly and excellent in every way",Stayed three nights in Feb2016 I one of the suites. A gorgeous room with balcony looking over the main courtyard in which were orange trees a small fountain and the sofas where we received mint tea and pastries on arrival. Bouchra gave a very useful intro to the Riad and the city and set us on the right path for the souks. The two tortoises were a big hit with our friends kids. They had an apartment for 5 and were equally happy.    We ate in on our first night. A lovely three course meal good Moroccan wine and roses on the table. Breakfast was a buffet with good mix of French and local choices.    And finally we paid our bill in dirham euro and sterling to help us use up currencies. That was really helpful thank you!,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Horfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewwB501RP
Riad Karmela,bhoyceltic2013 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Three excellent nights in Riad Karmela.,After returning from Marrakech only a few days ago I thought that it would only be right to submit my first ever review. On arrival at the airport we were met by the driver I had booked by email directly with the hotel. The fee was 15 euro each way and is payable when checking out of the riad. I would recommend this service as it takes you as close to the accommodation as you can get by car. On checking in which took less than a minute my wife and I were led to the courtyard where we were served our first ever mint tea and Moroccan pastries free of charge. While enjoying our refreshments we were given some useful information regarding the property directions and what to expect on exiting the riad. Our double room (Samira) was on the ground floor and was a pleasant surprise in fact when when we return next month I would be happy to be placed there. The breakfast consists of various fresh fruits yogurts cold meats cheese freshly made pancakes and bread. There are also local pastries and the usual tea and coffee. Be careful when entering the courtyard as there are two resident tortoise. Meals are served in the evenings though you have to order these in the morning. You can also order a bottle of wine or beer. There is also a large rooftop area which is very comfortable. If you have a late flight you can leave your bags at the reception to be looked after.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhoyceltic2013
Riad Karmela,LMB_JB wrote a review Jan 2016,50,We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!,From great correspondence prior to the trip right up until the airport transfer on our trip home - the staff at Riad Karmela could not do enough to make our trip as wonderful as possible. Staff were friendly and went above and beyond to make us feel special. The riad itself was beautiful an incredibly calming and relaxed environment and I could have quite happily stayed there forever! Would definitely recommend staying here the staff are willing to assist you in anyway they can it is located very close to the central square and as soon as you enter the riad the hustle and bustle of the outside world is completely forgotten. The decor was a stunning mix of the traditional and more contemporary and everything was beautifully presented.

They're quiet secure and comfy. The Rhiad has a large roof terrace and plenty of sunbathing space. The best room has its own terraces at a great height giving you views over the Medina and towards the Atlas Mountains. The staff are what make this Rhiad special. Nothing is too much for them . It's in a good location and very hidden away. It's an oasis in a very mad and vibrant area! Breakfast is good and there's plenty.

Riad Karmela,WendySFO wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Lovely riad near the spice plaza,My friend and I stayed here for two nights before an organized tour of Morocco. We had a large room with one king and one twin bed. We elected to dine at the riad on the first night and we really enjoyed the food (and wine...they have wine!). The riad is located down a tiny alley and we never would have found it on our own but our taxi driver showed us the way. In fact they have some small wooden signs posted at nearby corners pointing the way to Karmela. This riad is near the Place Des Epices and just a bit further from Jamaa el Fna. Very walkable to everything you want to do and see in the Medina. Watch for local boys offering directions--they will ask you for money if you take them up on it. Just orient yourself to the spice plaza and bring your map with you!,Date of stay: November 2015,,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendySFO

Arriving there can be a little unnerving especially if you have not stayed in Ariadne in the Medina before. But once through the door you are presented with the most exquisite view of a large gardened area with beautifully upholstered seating dotted all around.  And will definitely return.  Then once you have settled into your beautifully adorned and very large bedroom and begin to explore the three raids which have been converted into one your senses become overwhelmed. Just when you think there in no more to see you come across another hidden area decked out with soft cushioned seating secluded by luscious plants.

Riad Karmela,danialfaizsal wrote a review Dec 2015,50,"Luxurious, value for money, with great location and staff.",Me and my wife originally booked a reservation at Petit Karmela a sister riad just opposite but upon check-in at Riad Karmela was told they had a free room and received a free upgrade:) From the beginning to the end of our stay me and my wife were treated to luxurious stay at the riad and the staff are so professional adn friendly too. I had booked for dinner on the first day as we were on our way back from Merzouga after our desert trip so I predicted that we would arrive late. Upon arrival the staff took care of our luggage and immediately asked if we wanted tea or to shower which of course we opted for the tea after a long drive. Thereafter the staff was very attentive and waited until we had comfortably settled in drunk our tea and cookies before asking at the right time whether we wanted dinner. Dinner was a 3 course affair featuring local cuisine and the highlight was definitely the tajine chicken which was so delicious that we ended up booking dinner 2 nights in a row at the riad. Dinners at the riad though are cooked based on what the in house chef is able to get at the market daily. We stayed in Al Mansour room which was so spacious and had an area just to lounge around. The riad is also located near Djemaa al Fana about 10 minutes walk away. While difficult to find at first once you get to the riad it is a sanctuary in the hustle and bustle of Marrakech.

Riad Karmela,Kay K wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Quiet and lovely staff,Arriving on our first night we were picked up by a taxi driver and met by a member of staff Mustafa (lovely member of staff) who took us to the riad . We walked through these small streets then finally reached the riad. The big wooden doors had a smaller wooden door within it which opened into serenity calmness and the place looked lovely with an orange tree a water feature and during the day a tortoise! It was suprisingly very quiet compared to the noisy streets. We were then met by Siad who gave us a warm welcome and even upgraded our room! We had an evening meal which introduced us to the Moroccan cuisine. Once we knew the location getting to and from the riad was fine and its only a 10 minute walk to the medina and few minutes into the souks and resturants. Siad was always pleasant and professional and was very helpful in arranging a taxi to the airport when we asked at the last minute (apologies Siad!). Any issues we had the staff made an effort go solve it.The roof terrace covers the enter riad and has so many spaces to chill. We used the spa facilities within the riad-this was relaxing and convinient to go and relax in our room straight after.

Riad Karmela,BreeHassanein wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Tranquil Riad in busy Marrakech,We've just returned from a 7 night stay at Riad Karmela and I couldn't recommend it more highly.    I was with my 2 year old son and parents and I can't thank the staff enough for being so accommodating. They were not only friendly and welcoming but we're very kind in allowing me to get milk and prepare food for him as I when I needed to. Anyone who travels with a toddler would know how much you appreciate staff who are accommodating with their needs (and noise!).    The riad was in a perfect location where you could explore the souks and colourful streets come back for a rest and then head off again for more shopping and eating.    We had two standard double rooms which was very spacious traditional comfortable and had everything you needed including ample bottles of water.    Breakfast was fantastic and we ate dinner there several nights which was also excellent. We ate out one night at a restaurant that was highly recommended for their Moroccan food but the tagine at the riad was much better (and cheaper). Their Moroccan salads were to die for and very reasonable.    They do some nice touches such as serving Moroccan pastries with tea and coffee and nuts and olives when you have a drink at night. It might not seem like much but these little touches add up to make for a memorable experience where you feel welcomed and looked after.    We absolutely loved our stay here and I couldn't recommend this road more highly....loved it!,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreeHassanein
Riad Karmela,Jamie C wrote a review Dec 2015,40,In the heart of Marrakech,This is a very authentic style Riad located right in the heart of the medina. Unless you are familiar with the area highly recommend having the hotel pick you up at the airport or having very detailed directions to give to your cab driver. We came in by cab from Agadir and our driver had no idea where the Riad was which caused some stress. It is extremely difficult to find. That being said once we arrived we were very happy with the interior of the riad it is decorated beautifully and we were welcomed warmly with some lovely mint tea. We were upgraded to a suite that was a good size and had everything we needed. It was quite loud at night due to the music outside on the streets and be prepared to hear the call to prayer in the early mornings. It is located very close to the busy souk and the main square so if you are looking to immerse yourself in the hustle and bustle of the city this is a great place to stay. Our hotel staff were very courteous - we got lost trying to find our dinner restaurant one night and they arranged for a staff to walk us there himself and come pick us up. (It really is quite confusing to find your way around). We really appreciated their willingness to help us out. Overall we enjoyed the riad experience and appreciated the hospitality.    As a side note if you have never been to Marrakech and do not speak the languages (Arabic French or Berber) consider hiring a guide for your first day. It is a very busy city with no signs so it can be tricky to get around if you are unfamiliar with the area.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edmonton, Alberta, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamieC445
Riad Karmela,Richard A wrote a review Dec 2015,50,4 days in Marrakesh,Raid Karmela is located in the back streets of a bustling part of the city. Our drive there took us into a completely different world of carts drawn my donkeys street merchants and mopeds whistling past us in extraordinarily narrow cobbled streets. The noise smell and heat left us wondering what to expect from Riad Karmela - we were not disappointed. Karmella is located behind ancient dark wooden doors down an alley way accessed by a narrow street adjacent to a small road alive with all forms of Moroccon life. Prior to entering Karmella we were met by an elderly man pulling his two wheeled cart. This cart soon occupied our luggage and off het set towards our Riad. Despite his years we did well to keep pace with the elderly gentleman who weaved his way through the smokey streets and practically disappeared before placing our luggage at reception.    We were welcomed by the owner who is a charming man. He led us into the main quadrangle of the Riad which is its open rooftop mosaic surroundings dotted with orange trees in full fruit. The centre of the Riad has a prominent water feature that somehow cools and cleanses the air. Our host provided us with excellent guidance and information on how to navigate the souks day trips and fine dining.    Our evening meal at Riad Karmela was an excellent blend of traditional Morroco and classi French cuisine. We were positioned with attentive waiters beside an open fire which was needed as the evening were cool. I must also mention that the terrace is a lovely haven above the city where you can sense the calmness of the city as the call to prayer begins at dusk.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419richarda

The staff could not have been more helpful and as we had a late arrival ( after 8 pm ) we were happy to have dinner in the Riad and leave exploring until the morning .  They offer airport transfers (at a small cost ) which is wonderful as their driver escorted us through the alleys after the car could go no further due to the narrowness of the alleys.

It was amazing. The stunning original ornate features are breath taking. Set right inside at the heart of the medina yet tranquil and calm a truly hidden gem. Inside were lots of different areas and cosy corners for relaxing eating a snack or a meal and many were open to the sky. Plants like Jasmine birds and even 2 tortoises shared the space. Perfect location if you want to be in the hearty of Marrakesh life.    Each room was unique and ours was beautiful with 3 stone steps down to a large bathroom with lovely thick fluffy towels and robes. A hair dryer was also provided. The shower was more like a stand pipe as the head seemed a bit blocked but it didn't matter. The bed was comfortable and the pillows soft and cosy. There were many many nooks and crannies and hidden stair cases leading up to a huge roof top terrace with lots of little areas to eat breakfast sun bathe and view the city. Pretty flowers and shrubs were everywhere and it was so peaceful.    Breakfast was lovely buffet style and plenty of choice fruit yoghurt pastries bread cheeses smoked salmon meats delicious freshly squeezed juice and coffee too. A very reasonably priced snack menu available all day and of excellent quality. An evening three course meal was available pre bookable and that was excellent. especially the many starters and dessert. Every effort was made to entertain to the best standard thick white table cloths flowers and even a log fire burning. All water and mint tea was provided at all times free of charge too.    The most significant and outstanding feature of this Riad was the staff. Such friendly welcoming polite hard working and amazing people. Nothing was too much trouble and everything they did made us feel truly valued and cared about. I cannot stress enough how helpful everyone we had contact with was. I had a massage and my friend reflexology and this too was a lovely experience very well done in a beautifully relaxing setting.  This is no run of the mill tourist hotel it is a traditional style and all the better for it. A number of single visitors were here at the time we stayed and I know they loved it too.    Price.

Riad Karmela,Karen L wrote a review Oct 2015,50,A Beautiful Riad with Amazing Staff,I recently took my mum for a 3 day trip to Marrakech to celebrate her 70th birthday and we stayed at the Riad Karmela which was just beautiful. This is my 4th time to Marrakech and the Riad was by far the nicest place I've stayed in.    I had organised for us to eat dinner and have a birthday cake on the first night of our stay but as we arrived late but due to 8 fights arriving at once at the airport we were quite delayed and so ended up only having snacks of salad and sandwiches (which were more than enough and delicious). The next day the staff were extremely apologetic not to be able to offer us dinner and so upgraded us to the junior suite to compensate for the lack of meal. It was completely unexpected and unnecessary but this is typical of the staff at the Riad who go out of their way to make you feel welcome and relaxed. The following evening we had a delicious meal complete with gorgeous birthday cake for my mum and petals and candles on the table to make it even more special.    We loved our room which was massive compared to other rooms I've stayed in in Morocco and was extremely quiet. The whole Riad is a haven of tranquility and with the different inner courtyards and many roof terraces you really are spoilt for choice as to where you can sit and relax. The design of the Riad and the attention to the interior details was gorgeous and I would happily live there forever!

Whilst arranging the trip I had numerous questions to be answered without fail my e mails were responded to within hours. Joel and staff arranged transfers to and from the airport gave us advice about trips shopping resturants.and a very late dinner when we arrived at 9.30 at night. Although pre warned about the 'narrow streets' after leaving the taxi and walking to the Riad it still took some of the group by surprise we very quickly had this nervousness dispelled.

Riad Karmela,Michael Price wrote a review Oct 2015,40,If Peace & Quiet's What You Need,The title says it all..peace and quiet. This place is a space of relaxation from the manic space of the square and only 1 minute away. Staff are amazing and attentive. Nothing was too much.    Welcoming was great - room was nice and breakfast was sufficient if not limited. We enjoyed our stay but it is very quiet. Its so peaceful that we craved a bit of noise but for a couple of days it was very nice.    The riad does have limited relaxing space (as do many raids I suppose) but as nice and calm as it was after a day - we wanted some noise.    This does not detract away from the fact that staff were excellent and whatever we wanted we could have....including wine glasses when we bought a bottle. They even sorted breakfast when we checked-out early.    Rooms were comfortable and location is great for the square.

From how friendly the staff is the moment with arrived and were picked up at the airport to recommending places to see and making sure we are not lost in the crazy Medina. Riad Karmela felt like home to us for three nights. There is no wifi in your room but who needs it when the courtyard is so relaxing to sit in. The rooms are impeccably clean breakfast selection was great. Only suggestions that we have are that the dinner we had the first night were really expensive (25 euros per person) which is >10 times what you can pay for just down the street. And lastly if you were to want to hire a guide for the medina make sure the hotel hires an official guide for you.

The Riad is tucked away in the Medina near the fruit market and about 10 minutes walk from the main square. The roof terrace is lovely and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. There is a load of space downstairs with three beautiful courtyards to relax in....try not to tread on the tortoise though!    The staff are very friendly and incredibly helpful in keeping you from getting lost in the myriad of alleyways of the souks. They also booked a tour out to the Atlas Mountains for us which was really fantastic authentic and great value.    All in all a little gem and worth a visit.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Camberley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650daves

Riad Karmela,Newbs13 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Fantastic place with lovely staff!!!!,This hotel was a wonderful hidden treasure in the centre of Marrakech. 10min walk to the main square. Plenty of space to chill in the cool on those very hot days! Cute little tortoise too! Small plunge pool to cool off in. Gorgeous terrace perfect for sunbathing. Lovely roof terrace for dinner we had 2 evening meals there which were both gorgeous. The breakfast is included we thought it would be very basic but it had more than enough to chose from each day. We were upgraded to a wonderful room which was kept nice and cool with the aircon on.  The staff couldn't do enough for you and made you feel very welcome.  We stayed in another Riad too which was more expensive but this one was far better!!

Riad Karmela,JANEB007 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,A haven of tranquility amongst the huddle & bustle of life in the Medina,This was my second visit to Riad Karmela returning with my husband as I loved it so much when I went with some girl friends.  Joel & his staff can't do enough to help from our arrival to departure.    We stayed in the Aziz suite which was really spacious with luxurious fixtures coordinated to the the green walls & bedspread along with a lovely comfy bed  We both enjoyed the food breakfast was continental but with a great choice of fresh fruit cereals pastries & cold meats cheese. The evening meal was good to great value with three courses of local dishes all meals were served on the roof terrace which has a great ambience especially at night when all the beautiful lanterns are lit.    I had a hanmam scrub followed by a massage which I would definitely recommend a totally indulgent experience.    Marrakesh is an amazing place to visit but very full on coming back to the peace & tranquility of the Riad Karmela at the end of the day made it all the better we looked forward to getting up on the roof with a G& T or beer in hand while cooling of in the jacuzzi bliss    We will be back highly recommended,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JANEB007

Celebrated my 50th birthday and was upgraded to the best room in the hotel with a 4 poster bed and inner balcony. Have to say all the rooms looked very nice though whichever you get. The roof top was great and breakfast ample. So peaceful and relaxing after walking around the Souks. You wonder where you are going but once inside it is lovely. We got the hotel to arrange to pick us up from the airport. Would struggle fining otherwise first time. Find your way round using the hotel map provided.

Lovely roof terraces and ground floor seating areas. Food was good had to wait a while sometimes though. Good walking distance from souks and the square and taxi transfers to and from the airport the staff will also book you a taxi to other places such as the gardens. The taxi drop is 2/3 minutes away from the riad so don't be scared of following the driver out of the car down some small roads its normal as the cars can't fit. Very helpful staff.

Riad Karmela,N L wrote a review Jun 2015,50,A lovely and authentic haven in the heart of the Medina,The walk of to this hotel is completely deceiving. My husband was almost having a panic attack as we disembarked from our transfer at Place Ben Salah and continued our journey on foot through the rustic streets of the Medina. We then went down a little dark alley way with scaffolding girding the walls up. It was an absolute relief to go through the doors and walk into a beautiful Morrocan courtyard.    The rooms and individual and authentic in decor. The owner Joel is an absolute delight. The staff are so very helpful. They are willing to go the extra mile.    I was in Marrakech for my birthday with family and friends. We all stayed in Riad Karmela with the spill over in Petit Karmela next door and what a fantastic stay it was.    The only draw back is the breakfast. I wish there was a bit more of variety.

This Riad was a wonderful experience in itself. To arrive at that beautiful wooden door step down into the Riad and then have it open up to such beautiful courtyards was just stunning. The staff were kind helpful and professional at all times. We had our meals there for the most part and  wow delicious! Service was great. The room itself overlooked a serene courtyard (as did all rooms in this multi-area Riad and the peacefulness and serenity of the place was unparalleled. The roof top during warm weather was used for meals and entertainment. You could go up and look across the Old Medina all the way to the Atlas Mountains. I have spoken of this Riad so much and now my friend is there. She is beyond pleased. This is a wonderful place to stay in Marrakesh.

We had a terrible transfer (due to the fact that we were very silly and didn't arrange this with the hotel directly) however we very quickly forgot this once we arrived at the Riad.    We were greeted very warmly. We were staying half board and enjoyed wonderful breakfasts and a great range of morrocan meals for dinner on the terrace. What I was most impressed by however is that I mentioned to one member of staff (I believe it was Saeed) that I had a wheat allergy and this was disseminated to the whole team and allowances were made for me at each meal time.

It's a beautifully decorated Riad clean and calm. Perfect after a busy day exploring.    The staff are amazing and helpful. We had an incident with a shopkeeper by the tannery where we paid 1200 for 2 leather pouffe's. When we told Joel the manager thinking we got a good deal he immediately offered to send over one of the local boys back with us to get a full or part refund as we had been heavily overcharged.    We went back to the shop with Mohammed and we got 600 Dhms back!!    Also bought some spices through the lady chef who went to the market and bought them for us!!    On our last day as we were leaving at 5pm we were given another room to use until we checked out which was a great help!

Riad Karmela,Suzywishitwassunny wrote a review May 2015,50,4 perfect days in Marrakech.,"What a perfect place to stay. We were there at the beginning of May when it was 38 degrees in the shade and can honestly say Riad Karmela was an oasis of calm and tranquility. There was air con in the rooms and we all used our balnkets on the first night as we were chilly. In hindsight would have been better to just turn the air con off! The staff were friendly and helpful the Riad was clean quiet and a maze of unexplored areas I'm sure I missed some. There is a jacuzzi on the roof two tortoises who live on the ground floor and the nicest tomato and avocado salad I have ever eaten is on the snack menu. The trips recommend by Joel and his team were perfect taking us to the best shops up in the Atlas Mountains and the spa hotel we went to for the day was perfect. The Riad is perfectly placed to explore Marrakech and the advice we received on the first day was to ""get lost and then you'll know your way around"". This worked a treat as we always managed to find our way back the helpful Riad Karmela signs high up on some strategic city walls helped too! Nothing was too much trouble from booking restaurants for us meeting us in the square at 1am after our delayed flight and serving us with Mint Tea and snacks once we arrived at the Riad. One evening we got lost trying to find a restaurant and having returned to the Riad they laughed and someone led us there. It took less than 5 mins! The best area for wifi is in the ground floor next to the plunge pool sitting under the orange trees but sometimes we got lucky sitting on the roof terrace and could post pics online instantly to annoy everyone back home!    I stayed in an apartment with 3 others and was pleased at how spacious clean and airy it was. We even had our own private roof terrace. I was surprised that the Riad gave out free bottled water as I was quite prepared to pay. One lovely touch was the free postcard and stamp that they gave me and posted too. Again I was quite prepared to pay.",Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzywishitwassunny
Riad Karmela,piyushi88 wrote a review May 2015,50,Like a Lovely Home in the Midst of the Medina!,Riad Karmela is nestled in the middle of the Medina a short walk away from Jema-el-Fna the souks and a few other tourist spots. Yet it is tucked away inside a narrow alley quiet serene and beautiful. The staff are friendly and helpful. Said at the reception helped us with a map gave us clear instructions so that we don't get lost arranged day tours for us and even guided us to good cafes and shops. It truly felt like living with friends.    Breakfast spread on all the days was good. The rooms were spacious and luxurious yet done up with a local flavour. The patio within the Riad is lovely and a great place to relax in after a hectic day outside. It is replete with a fountain and some wandering turtles!    Some other benefits: we could exchange our money for Moroccan Dirhams within the Riad. While you could find a better rate in the market but the rate the Riad offers is pretty good too. We left our luggage with the Riad when we went for an overnight trip to the Atlas. We were upgraded to a suite on check-in and were happy about that.    All in all we had a great stay. The place is perfectly located the staff is helpful and the Riad is absolutely lovely within.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Abidjan, Ivory Coast",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piyushi88

Riad Karmela,mamatraveller wrote a review May 2015,50,A calm retreat in the hectic Medina,Having just returned from Riad Karmela I thought it only fair that I write my review while the memory is still fresh.    We travelled as a group of 10 women ranging in age from 35 to 61 to celebrate my 40th birthday and boy did we choose well...    We booked flights transfers and accommodation through Travel Republic and found that everything ran reasonable smoothly; Royal Air Maroc was an experience in itself but that's another story!!    Our flight was delayed so we didn't arrive at the Riad until 1am however there was someone waiting for us in the nearest square to guide us through the maze of alley ways to our calling beds. We were offered mint tea and shown to our rooms where we promptly crashed in comfy clean spacious rooms. We stayed in three rooms: the apartment (very spacious for four people it even has its own terrace!) and two superior suites that slept three comfortably. The bathrooms were traditional but clean and the decor was fantastic believe me we're a fussy bunch and couldn't fault the cleanliness! Water is provide free of charge just ask at reception if you run out.    Throughout our stay the staff were very helpful organising a trip to the Atlas Mountains a day at a local country club and making dinner bookings on our behalf even taking us to a local restaurant that seemed impossible to find (Nomad Cafe - worth a visit!). Just a quick note on communication: be sure to clarify any arrangements such as taxis or reservations etc. to avoid confusion due to the language barrier.    We spent one evening at the Riad and enjoyed the dinner. Be sure to make dietary requirements very clear if you book to eat as our veggie was offered fish which didn't go down well even though she had informed them the previous day.  The food is simple and they tend to cook one dish an evening so it could be a gamble for some less 'adventurous' diners! We ate monk fish tagine which was delish!    The wifi at the Riad is patchy we located the best signal in the communal area on the lower level next to the water feature. Be sure not to step on the tortoises whilst wandering around on your phone as they hide in the main courtyard.    The spa is an experience too! We enjoyed our free black soap scrub three women of a certain age being scrubbed down by two very friendly Moroccan's....thoroughly recommended!!    The terrace is beautiful with many levels and even a plunge pool if you can find it! The views towards the Atlas Mountains over the bustling rooftops are truly spectacular.    Even at busier times of day the raid remains quiet. Saturday night was the only time that we could hear any noise we assumed there must have been a party near by however it didn't bother us one bit.  The Muezzin calling to prayer throughout our stay added atmosphere we soon got used to him!    In short Riad Karmela is a fantastic place to base yourself during a visit to the Medina. It is just a few minutes walk from the souks Ben Youssef Madrasa and the other main attractions. The accommodation was clean and comfortable and the staff were excellent. Many members of our group would love to return as soon as possible to soak up more of the fabulous culture of Marrakech.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamatraveller

Riad Karmela,challengerone wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Lived up to our expectations,We were a family of three adults visiting Marrakech in early March 2015. I have to point out from the outset that we stayed a few seconds away at at the Petit Karmela under the same ownership as the Riad Karmela and allows access to all of their facilities. can comment on the followings about the Riad Karmela:    The Service    The staff are very pleasant knowledgeable and very helpful. They work hard and are efficient.  Even before booking  Manager Joel assisted us.We had booked with an untrustworthy Holiday company. He contacted this company on our behalf and we decided to book directly with the Riad. This was a good decision.    Due to airline error one of our suitcases did not leave England resulting in one family member not having clothing for two days. The Riad assisted us with enquiries with the airport and arranged a taxi for us to collect our belongings - free of charge.    The Riad  It was agreed by all my family members that this was the most relaxing place that we have ever stayed in.There is an air of calm: The natural light filling beautiful courtyards the water feature and roof terraces provide mean that guests have so many different spaces to spend their time.Even after one week you discover hidden areas within the riad.    You can arrange excursions through the Riad we booked for Essaouira and loved it.    Breakfast    Very simple but nice: cold meats bread etc.    Dinner    We had the pleasure of dining here for five out of seven nights.The meals are three courses but need to be booked the night before. we loved all of our meals: Chicken Tagine Lamb Tagine Monk fish Tagine and two beef Tagines.  The thing to note is that all of these meals were very different and cooked to perfection. Anyone staying here should try some (or all of the meals).    Location    The Souks are a few minutes away and are a fun place to visit. Yes the roads can be a little confusing  but all you need to do is have plot some landmarks in your head - and you wont have problems. The location is really ideal for walks.    All in all we loved Marrakesh the naturalness of the people the pace and had to reminded that although the people are poor they are likeable.Marrakesh makes for a more interesting place than a trip to a beach.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"london, england",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/challengerone

Breakfast was just right bread cheese meats pastries and fruit with freshly squeezed orange juice and a hot option each morning which was always different and interesting.

Riad Karmela,PetalGalwayIreland wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Perfect place from which to explore Marrakech,Before travelling to Marrakech I trawled through the reviews of Riads available on Tripadvisor  focusing on many which friends had recommended .Karmela was not among those recommended but after reading all the positive reviews and seeing the photos of this lovely traditional riad I decided to take a chance and book myself and my two adult daughters in for our stay of four nights. Rather than repeat the accolades which many have uttered about this little haven  suffice to say that we were not disappointed! Joel Bouchra and every member of staff could not have been more welcoming. We availed of the evening meal on arrival the hammam ( great!)  massage  excursion to the Atlas mountains ( highly recommended) airport pick up and drop off and other than the weather which they could not control our break was in perfect hands ! I mentioned to Joel on the 3rd morn that our shower head would not stay in place and on our return from our waterfalls trip it had been actually refitted . Very impressive service!  After our arrival late in the evening I must admit that I considered just staying put for the four days in the comfortable oasis that is this Riad but I took a deep breath the next morn and joined my daughters in their exploration of the Medina and souks . Of course we got lost but I cant imagine anyone not getting lost on their first day in this mad  exciting place. After the second day there we felt comfortable just wandering around watching everything and taking in the many nuances attached to the Moroccan custom of 'haggling'. By the last day there i considered myself an old hand at it.  Would I stay at the Riad Karmela again ? Absolutely! Next time i would like to be there when the weather is a bit more clement and we can avail of the lovely rooftop terrace with its delightful comfortable spaces and dining areas.  Warning: it is right next door to a mosque so if you dont like to be woken up early by the call to prayer then bring the earplugs . We thought that was a bonus! I look forward to my return trip to The Riad Karmela and it's lovely staff.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,Galway Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PetalGalwayIreland
Riad Karmela,Katie P wrote a review Mar 2015,50,A lovely mother and daughter break,My mum and I spent a wonderful five days at Riad Karmela at the end of February and would most definitely recommend a stay here.    Rooms: The first room we stayed in was a little noisy and had a horrible odour of stale smoke (despite not being able to smoke in rooms) but we only had this room for the first night after which we were upgraded to a lovely suite. It was luxurious quaint comfortable and traditional – everything you’d hope for in terms of a room in Marrakech. We were set back away from the central seating area so it was nice and quiet.    Spa: We made full use of the Riad’s spa facilities and enjoyed two massages and a scrub. It’s very reasonably priced and the service is fantastic.    Food: The Riad offers a three-course option which we had twice. We both thoroughly enjoyed this. The snacks menu is a little bland but the omelettes are delicious… anyway there’s plenty of amazing food on offer in Marrakech so make sure you go out and experience it. The breakfast buffet is spot on too; plenty of fresh croissants and cereal. Plus the orange juice is outstanding!    Service: The absolute stand out member of staff was Syed the Assistant Manager. He was so obliging from day one went out of his way to ensure we were happy and all-in-all offered absolutely outstanding service. Having worked there for six years he certainly is the heart and soul of the Riad and will make sure you have a great time.    Location: The Riad is nestled in the Medina meaning you can walk just about anywhere. It must be said it’s difficult to find your way around at first and expect to get lost a few times trying to find the Riad… Make sure you book a car to pick you up from the airport which you can do directly through the Riad. The staff are always on hand to offer directions too.  Rooftop: When the hustle and bustle of Marrakech’s busy lanes gets too much make sure you get yourself up to the rooftop for some great views and a spot of sunshine. It’s surprisingly peaceful up there.    All in all my Mum and I had a wonderful break at Riad Karmela. It offered us the perfect amount of luxury and tradition and we’ll certainly consider returning.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62katiep
Riad Karmela,Matt O wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Perfect long weekend in Marrakesh,Bouchra and Joel were really helpful from initial booking arranging airport pick up and pre-booking an excursion to the Atlas Mountains. They know everything there is to know and do their best to make sure you have everything you need for your stay.  The riad is beautiful hidden away in the Souks down an initially scary looking alley. Once you get your bearings which Bouchra explained over a mint tea on arrival it is easy to find again and is situated in a great spot close to everything in the Medina.  We had four full days and three nights there including a Hamman massage on our final day. The place the owners and the staff are great.

Riad Karmela,Lucia B wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Fabulous Medina Hideaway!,Such a pretty sight as you come from the alley and walk though the door the communal areas are wonderfully decorated with lots comfortable spaces to sit around having tea & relaxing. Room was also spacious we stayed in a suite which had an extra bed for our 8 year old son plus a small sofa! The many terrace & outdoor areas are lovely... we did make some use of these but would have probably used them more in high summer.Yes you hear the birds from the courtyard in the morning and also the prayer call but you are in the Medina its expected! An in fact it is very quite considering the noise in the souks and main square. The staff are great and very helpful not only Joel & Bouchra but also the ladies at breakfast... and young man who drove us to and from the airport... There was an issue with the wifi as expected in Marrakech but it was quickly sorted by the next Morning! Souks are literally 2/3minutes walk and we were walking with a child! Main square is about 10 minutes! Airport transfer was definitely good as we didn't have to worry about finding the place first time... but once there with Joel's indications we never got lost trying to get back.

Riad Karmela,Jayne B wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Tranquility!,We stayed here a year ago now & I still feel compelled to write a review. The Riad Karmela is a beautiful rambling haven in the rambling hectic Medina - tucked away & yet straight into the heart of the vegetable souk & other shopping areas. Our traditional room was delightful very comfy bed & ornate tiled bathroom with lovely details. Staff are all extremely helpful & welcoming making our stay such a relaxing time where nothing was too much trouble. The rooftop garden was bliss to while away time after breakfast & the cool dip pool was great on our last day. The whole place is very clean & I would tell anyone to stay here.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,nottingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaffaJayne
Riad Karmela,AstridMagnolia wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Hidden gem in the heart of the medina,Fantastic little Riad in the heart of the medina. You will get lost trying to find it and probably finding your way back. The key is to take note of landmarks on your route and use them as a guide. Saying that the staff were incredibly friendly and remarkably helpful they will help you find your way around Marrakech and organise trips and tours for you.  The riad feels like a world removed from the hustle and bustle of the souks which are most active in the evening when Jemaa El Fna comes to life. The rooftop is divine and offers views over the rooftops of the medina and there is even a plunge pool for cooling off in the heat of the day and the food was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend staying in one night to sample the hotels cuisine.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AstridMagnolia
Riad Karmela,Luca Cerini wrote a review Feb 2015,40,High quality all-round,Plenty of other reviews are available I won't say too much; the hall the room every single detail of the hotel is a display of good taste and high standards. We saw some plates running through the main hall which looked delicious contributing to the perception of high quality although we didn't dine here and can't really speak for the restaurant.    4 stars because: 1) the breakfast was buffet with limited choice of Moroccan specialties both mornings same menu which is a little bit of a shame also considering the expectations generated by the rest of the offer. 2) the first night some guys have been talking loud in the hall closest to our room (there's two halls); while not being a fault of the hotel but rather lack of consideration by some guests it all went on too long and I would have expected somebody from the lobby to intervene at a certain point...

Riad Karmela,ItalianAroundTheWorld wrote a review Feb 2015,50,"Beautiful place ,friendly staff, great location",Riad Karmela is tucked away in this tiny alleyway it's not easy to find but totally worth staying there ! since the Medina is a maze I would recommend to organize a pick up with the hotel (15 euros each way for a max of 3 people) we got picked up brought to the hotel and if you arrive at night/late evening I would recommend to have dinner there it's reasonable and delicious! During the check in we got a map and lots of tips to move around as mentioned the Medina is a maze! But you will get the hang of it! - rooms are spacious with ac but there are no tv's in the room and you wake up to the call of prayer at 6 am but that happens in every Muslim country but because this place is almost like an enclosed garden u will also hear the chirping of the lovely birds! It's easy to get to all the sights about10 minutes walks each way ! The only thing that might be annoying is the WiFi mind you if you are addicted like me sometimes it just didn't work! But really the rest was amazing including traditional and eurpean breakfast!

Riad Karmela,Henry890 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,oasis of calm,3 nights n Riad Karmela was nothing short of a total pleasure. After a rocky start in finding the Riad (completely my own fault! tip: ensure you book a airport pickup!!) everything just got better and better. the staff are friendly and always cheerful and rooms are comfortable with all that is needed for a cosy stay. the roof terrace provides a great spot to enjoy a sundowner and also acts as a lovely little sun trap. The location is just perfect with a simple 5 min walk from the main square and the chaos that the medina has to offer. however once through the beautiful old doors of the Riad you could be on a different planet as the peace that greets you makes you immediately forget of the hectic medina.  will certainly recommend to anyone going to Marrakech fabulous experience. thank you,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Henry890
Riad Karmela,Cheese18 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,A beautiful oasis!,Riad Karmela really is an oasis of calm in the heart of Marrakech. We were lucky enough to be upgraded on arrival to a junior suite the room was beautifully and tastefully decorated. Our room overlooked the main courtyard where breakfast and the optional evening meal was served. Breakfast was plentiful with fresh orange juice a good choice of breads and pastries cereals and a variety of cheeses and cold meats. In the evening the courtyard was lit by numerous candles which turned it into a truly magical place. The Riad is brilliantly located and a fantastic base to explore the labyrinth and passageways of the medina.

Riad Karmela,Sara I wrote a review Feb 2015,50,Excellent stay in Marrakech Medina,Our family of five stayed at Riad Karmela for two nights at the end of January 2015. We started our stay with transport from the airport arranged by the riad and I would highly recommend that. We were driven straight to the medina and once we could drive no further we had help with our luggage to get straight to the riad. Once there we were welcomed with hot mint tea snacks and an overview of not just the riad but the whole city in general (including detailed mapping of sites and restaurants). Our stayed in one of the apartments and there was plenty of room with room to sleep for up to six people (one double bed and 4 singles when we were there). Everything was very clean and well-maintained. The breakfast each morning was excellent with selections of pastries fruit cereal yogurt tea fresh orange juice and more. The only concerns that we had with the property was that the water temperature in the shower could fluctuate and that the wifi did not reach our room (we could get it in the lobby) both of which is simply a result of the age and design of a riad and something I imagine would be found in most any riad in the city.    The Riad Karmela staff will arrange for excursions to other parts of Morocco as well. Our family took a trip up to the Atlas Mountains which was wonderful. We had transportation from the medina up to the mountains where we hiked through a Berber village and then had a traditional lunch overlooking the mountains - it was wonderful!    Although we loved it Riad Karmela - or truly any riad in the medina - may or may not be what you would like for a family trip. Riads are much like a home with all guests coming and going (and eating breakfast) in a small central lobby. This means there is not room for children to run around or be too loud. This wasn't a problem for our family because we did not spend much time during the day in the riad and my children are a bit older (9 9 and 6). We really enjoyed the location of the riad in the middle of the medina but others with children should fully understand that the medina can be loud and busy and it can be sensory overload for kids (and their parents trying to keep their children out of the way of motor bikes). But the Riad Karmela was for us a fantastic oasis in the city allowing us a place to come back to and rest before returning to the frey.    We loved our stay at Riad Karmela and would definitely stay there again!,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Franklin, Tennessee",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarai784
Riad Karmela,Katief128 wrote a review Feb 2015,50,A little spot of Paradise,We stayed in the Riad Karmela for 4 nights returning yesterday and had a lovely stay.  Positives:  - Great location: 10 minutes walk from the main square 5 minutes max from the souks near the musee de Marrakech la maison de Photographie as well as many other things)  - Hidden Gem: Down a small alley where you would never imagine a hotel to be through a little iron door and into the Riad which is bright spacious peaceful and beautifully decorated.  - Very easy arrival process: If you email ahead of your stay the Riad will pick you up from the airport and transport you to the Riad (very handy as it is a very confusing journey!) once you arrive you are treated to Moroccan mint tea and pastries and the staff are great at explaining the city where you should go eat drink see etc... and answered a lot of our questions very helpfully we also got an upgrade which is always an added bonus!  - Friendly staff: Always willing to help they are more than willing to change currency to dirhams help book restaurants and excursions and we found their restaurant recommendations fantastic.  - Lovely breakfast: the granola is a triumph as is the freshly squeezed orange juice.    If we're being really fussy - our room had a little bit of damp about it if we'd been out the whole day but this dissipated quickly with a little air. Lovely large room and bed. Naturally given that the rooms rely on natural light from the courtyard they are quite dark but beautifully decorated and I'm being very picky.    Overall we would highly recommend this Riad for a lovely and luxurious place to stay in Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katief128

We were so impressed with the riad it was breathtakingly beautiful and peaceful coming in off the busy streets. The tiling architecture furniture is really very well done and we were staying in a lovely room with en suite bathroom. We were greeted on arrival with mint tea and sweet pastries a friendly face a map and plenty of very useful information about the city. We had a busy day getting lost in the city [easy to do!] and it was fantastic to spend a relaxing evening in the riad having an incredible meal and a massage. There are cosy fires and blankets for the winter with board games and cards too. We also had a scrub and hair treatment at the riad - all treatments were fantastic and very generous with timings cannot reccomend a lovely lady called Hannan enough! The staff were all overwhelmingly friendly and offered lots of useful information about places to eat / things to do. Would love to go back and can't reccomend this place enough thank you.

Joel and Bouchra have really created a place that can cater to small teams in a way that is quite different from the more traditional business settings. We had exclusive use of Petit Karmela and that space worked excellently for our brainstorming and workshops the only small issue being the internet connection that was slightly unreliable at times (an issue with all hotels in the Medina/Marrakech). The food and assistance we got was first class and we'd certainly come back also for a private holiday.

Breakfasts were delicious - a nice mixture of local and continental food.  We had supper the first night we were there - great food in the lovely central eating area.  Staff were very helpful and accommodating. They organised a driver to fetch and take us to the airport - only a little more expensive than taking a taxi with none of the haggling involved! They also recommended some very good restaurants and organised a day trip to the Atlas mountains for us which was well worth it.

Riad Karmela,mallowpuff_nz wrote a review Dec 2014,40,"Great helpful staff, reasonably priced.",My husband and I stayed at Riad Karmela for 4 nights. The Riad is in a good location right in the heart of the Medina with a 10 minute walk to/from the the main square. It was surprisingly peaceful despite being within the Medina.    The room was fairly spacious with a large bathroom. Everything was clean and tidy. We really appreciated the heater and extra blankets as it got quite cold in the evenings. The only minor problem we encountered was the hot water - it look a very long time to heat up and it still wasn't as hot as I liked it to be. Our room overlooked the courtyard where breakfast was served. Breakfast was nice plenty of choice. I especially enjoyed the freshly squeezed mandarin juice and selection of local breads to try.    The staff were very helpful. Joel sat with us explaining the location of the Riad on the maps different routes to take places to catch a taxi etc. Joel also arranged a 1 day excursion to a Berber village in the mountains for us. If you need to exchange EUR or GBP it can be done at the front desk with very reasonable rates. Also they allow you store your luggage after check out.    We asked for detailed directions to the Riad from the square before we arrived and we were able to find the Riad ourselves without any assistance. We initially missed the small street signs directing us to the Riad so if you are arriving at night it's better to arrange for someone from the Riad to meet you and take you there.    We enjoyed our stay and would recommend others to stay.,Date of stay: December 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mallowpuff_nz

It is beautifully decorated and our room had a lovely balcony overlooking the courtyard that had orange trees growing in it. The whole experience was wonderful and really made our honeymoon romantic.

Evening meal was great and would recommend even at the price which is expensive for Marrakesh at 25euro each. this is booked separately.  Breakfast really let the owners down and the first day we were really surprised how poor quality it was and of such very limited choice for a buffet breakfast. I would say this is the only area that seriously needs improving as it lets down the overall quality of the establishment.The free wifi is virtually unusable unless you are in the bottom courtyard.  That said we will definitely be going back It would be nice to have robes in all of the rooms and the bathroom is not replenished with toiletries and we were there for eight days. these are little issues that i am sure will be addressed and will not spoil your stay. Lovely fresh food is literally a few steps away. i would have reviewed as excellent overall if not for the few issues I mentioned especially the breakfast which is very poor unless you just want cereal.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wirral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorraineg881
Riad Karmela,jean w wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Magical place to stay.,Marrakech is simply a dream. As soon as you near the medieval sandstone walls of the medina you know you're in another world. Taxi organised by the hotel is a must. We were met in the middle of a maze of alleys by the hotel staff who couldn't have been more helpful. Soon you are through the ancient doors into a little paradise. Our ground floor room with its patterned doors and massive bolt straight from Game of Thrones led out to our own sitting room under the stars. Lovely bushes of scented jasmine in giant pots guarded the entrance and perfumed the air attracting charming bumble bees that danced around them. Then the crowning jewel the breathtaking roof terraces with pomegranate bushes and a super little plunge pool. The owner was great and very knowledgeable about the Medina and surrounds. The staff all lovely and last but not least the sweet little tortoises eating lettuce leaves in their home in one of the lovely sitting rooms with the sound of water playing from a fountain into a beautiful blue pool beneath it. We visited in July 2014 but I'm sure it's still the same. If you like Game of Thrones go to Marrakech it's the real thing but with modern plumbing! what more can I say. Have a mint tea for me on the terrace and forget the modern world for a moment.

Riad Karmela,Paul L wrote a review Nov 2014,40,"Comfortable, friendly 'home' in the middle of the Medina","A riad is not a hotel - overall a bit more basic e.g no TV no phone in room - but the Riad Karmela was very comfortable clean and staff very friendly. The owner's provision of map with clear route-finding back to the Riad and introduction to getting around and things to do and to avoid was excellent.    Breakfast was very good (note: it is not a British hotel so don't expect full cooked English!) with reasonable and interesting choice changing slightly from day to day (e.g. a different egg dish and some variation in breads) and for us gave exactly what suited. We had dinner the first night which was good though pricey for Marrakech.    Communal areas include various rooftop terraces courtyards and some indoor provision so seclusion or company are possible sun or shade and wifi in most communal areas (not in bedrooms).    Riad Karmela is very centrally located within the Medina and well placed for exploring the souks and shops and only 5 min or so walk from ""the big square"" which is what all the would be impromptu guides call Jemaa el Fna.    A couple of tips:  1) i-phone app ""Marrakech map and walks"" was an excellent offline GPS map tool which many times assisted reorientation in the otherwise quite confusing layout of the Medina and as it could hold the Riad location it aided us navigating back - invaluable.  2) Be aware that the would-be guides that try to show you the way to things you don't necessarily want to see or take you to ""the big square"" in trying to encourage us in the direction they wanted to send us (and tag along to afterwards claim they were guiding us) frequently said the other direction was closed or went nowhere - which was never true and sometimes led to other very interesting areas!",Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Douglas, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/188PaulL
Riad Karmela,p00chie wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Great Riad,My second stay at the Riad Karmela.  Everything was great the taxi transfer arranged through the Riad was smooth and the driver was waiting for us and took us to the Riad for check-in.  We ate at the Riad one night and had snacks throughout our stay all excellent.  The staff are friendly helpful and really do give you a warm welcome which stays for the length of your stay.  We enjoyed all of Marrakech the people and the places and the food.  the local are itself is friendly and has some great little shops and restaurants. Webought slippers from a local shop where we could see them being made- we ate at Namia a local restaurant about fifty yards from the Riad. 120 dirhams for a very tasty three course meal freshly cooked when ordered.  The photography museum a bit further along was really worth a visit and the view and mint tea from the terrace at the top fab.  We will definitely book Riad Karmela again.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,cornwall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p00chie
Riad Karmela,Kirsten L wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Peaceful haven,We had a wonderful stay at Riad Karmela it really is an oasis of calm. Wonderful rooms and so many little rooms courtyards and terraces to sit in and while away the hours.  The evening meals are superb as is the service we were delighted with our meal. The starter was 5 bowls of different vegetables beans and lentils all deliciously flavoured and served with Morrocan bread. Then a steaming tagine of chicken and olive tagine (more bread of wanted) followed by a scrummy flourless chocolate cake ice cream fresh orange and cinnamon cooked apple. To end the meal there was typical mint tea and little almond petit fours.  Sadly the breakfast wasn't of the same standard. It is a typical morrocan breakfast which in itself is lovely freshly squeezed orange juice bread pastries jams fruit and homemade pancakes but it is very hit and miss. On the first day there was an omlette smoked salmon ham and some freshly made griddled bread but the next day there was none of this and nothing to replace it. Then on the third day we went for breakfast and chose our breakfast from a limited choice then when we came back for more tea (you have to go and get this yourself coffee is on the table) there were two different types of cheese raspberries and some different pastries. It really shouldn't depend on what time you go for breakfast as to what you get. Also the staff are not very personable at all in the mornings despite sometimes they are the amazing staff that served you in the evening!  The hamman is superb a great experience. Also they let us keep our room until we checked out at 2.30.  The Riad is central for the souks square and museums and the taxi service they offer is excellent.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Fleet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625kirstenl

Riad Karmela,kgr27 wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Oasis of calm,Riad karmela is a beautiful perfect place to stay within the hustle and bustle of the medina.The owner and all staff were keen to make sure everything was as it should be . The rooms and suites are all individual and different and Rachid room was perfectly fine for us and not unduly noisy- as guests are encouraged to be respectful and quiet in courtyards The roof terraces are amazing and the views across the city to the mountains at sunset are breathtaking. The evening meals were different Moroccan dishes every night and breakfast was a good choice. We recommend getting private transfer to and from riad to airport as it would be difficult to find on own. Only problem we found was debit cards not accepted only credit cards but what we didn't have in euros or dirhams we could pay once home via bank transfer.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kgr27
Riad Karmela,Adventurer US A wrote a review Oct 2014,50,stay here--trust me,We cannot say enough good about this Riad. Ask for Bouchra; she will treat you like royalty. If you are staying in Marrakesh this place is perfect because they pamper you which is welcome even if that's not what you usually want. My point is that this hotel is an oasis in an intense (but fun) medina. The treatment you get here and the atmosphere is a perfect complement to the frenetic dusty in-your-face vibe of the city. Analogy: I have done marathons and even though I feel a great sense of accomplishment for having put my body through 26 miles of pain the hot shower I take after the race is absolutely heavenly.

We got such a warm welcome and we felt all the time very comfortable. We got a very big clean and lovely styled suite on the first floor. It is a very quite und green oasis in the middle of the very busy medina. The food is typical marrocian und very good. The staff has everytime helpful tips and organize nearly everything you need. I orgnaized a driver and a guide for a trip in the atlas mountains and we had a wonderful trip. There are a lot of small patios to relax and a very nice rooftop to relax at daytime or in the evening for dinner or just a glas of wine near the fire when its getting colder.

Riad Karmela,Laura H wrote a review Oct 2014,50,A Maze Ing!! Could Not Ask for More!!,I stayed at this Riad in September with 2 female friends. When we arrived much later than expected We had such a lovely welcome. The staff's most important priority was to make us comfortable and fed. Even though it was really quite late. Check in was sorted out the next day.  We were instantly so amazed by how lovely the staff were how beautiful the riad was and the whole wonder of the Marrakech experience we were actually quite emotional when we sat down to dinner in the beautiful rooftop terrace.  The waiters made us feel very welcome and gave us a lovely Moroccan rendition of Happy Birthday for my friend :-)  The food is fantastic!  There is so much I could say but overall the Riad was so much more than we expected. There is so much space to unwind and it never felt busy with other travellers even though it was quite full. There are many rooms terraces sun loungers and a jacuzzi dip pool to relax and unwind in. (The jacuzzi is cold mind not hot....but this was welcome after sitting on the rooftop terrace in the Moroccan sunshine).  The reception staff housekeepers waiters cooks were the most friendly I have encountered.  We generally found the local workers to be such lovely helpful cheery people.  The hotel staff could not have done more to make our stay pleasureable.  We found the location great. Just far enough away from the Jemma Al Fnar Market to let us experience the local streets which is all part of the experience.  Although we were a small group of girls this Riad would be a Very romantic place to stay if travelling as a couple.  Wi-Fi available in the communal areas and the Riad owner was happy to help me out with that technical stuff without me even asking :-)  Stay at Riad Karmel and you wont be disappointed!!

Riad Karmela,Clairzee wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Outstanding accommodation. Beautiful with impeccable service.,Wow. What a place. So beautiful charming decorative and peaceful. The staff here go out of their way to make your stay memorable and comfortable. I have never known such service such attention to detail and such a wonderful atmosphere. Other guests were really friendly too (French and English). I had a 40th birthday and was proposed to here. I had the time of my life. Our suite was stunning. I want to return. We went on a trip to the mountains and the Riad organised a guide/driver for us who was fantastic (we had an unforgettable time). The Riad also made restaurant reservations for us and arranged for us to have a guide to escort us. Marrakech is an amazing place to visit and Riad Karmela is an absolute gem of a place.

Riad Karmela,Silvia B wrote a review Oct 2014,50,A tastefully decorated haven of peace,I stayed with my two teenage boys at the beginning and the end of our Morocco trip and got to use four different rooms. The Riad has a history and is gradually extended and growing so every room is different also of different quality (bath-rooms). They are all beautifully decorated with a lot of taste (not overdone we've been to a few very kitschy places during our trip). It is very calm (sometimes other guests can be loud...). As the Riad is composed of several buildings there are several patio's and possibilities to retire in various corners of the buildings and to brows through one of the many books about Morocco or Moroccan Art that are put at the guests' disposal.  Breakfast is taken on the roof (weather permitting) and a bit chaotic but a good choice of food varies depending on the day the hour. Coffee was good!  The staff were all very nice and very accommodating. In general very uncomplicated and patient with all the different problems and requests.  I would absolutely recommend it and stay there again.

This Riad is beautiful from top to bottom it is immaculately clean with lovely courtyards and terraces. We kept coming across extra parts of the Riad that we didn't realise existed. The plunge jacuzzi on the roof was a great way to unwind and cool off with sun loungers next to it to sunbathe. The staff were exceptional from the welcome we received from the lovely gentleman on reception when we arrived to the service from the 2 male waiters (disappointed we didn't get their names) they couldn't have done enough to accommodate our every need during our stay. We arrived late one evening after being out at Jemma El Fna Market (11.15pm) and asked for a bottle of wine on the terraces and this was no problem at all. All of the staff made us feel so welcome and comfortable and it was nice to meet the owner too who was very chilled and helpful. I really can't praise this Riad enough it made our trip to Marrakech very special. If you are looking for a lovely base with traditional Moroccan features helpful staff and lots of quiet areas to unwind after being out on the crazy streets of Marrakech then this is the Riad for you. We didn't get the chance to say goodbye to the male waiter who was also doing a Masters Degree please could the staff say thank you and goodbye to him for us (Louise Laura and Jo) I don't think I have met such a happy helpful person.

Riad Karmela,Karen S wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Calm in a storm,Just like other reviewers we found this Riad to be an oasis amongst the madness that is Marrakesh's Medina. Step outside the doors and you hussle your way through the souks along with cyclists motorbikes and donkeys. But inside you could be miles away a lovely cool courtyard where all you hear is running water.  The Riad is beautiful with so many little nooks and crannies you could always find your own space to sit and read. Having said that I usually homed in straight for the comfy sunbeds on the roof top close to the Jacuzzi which was heaven to cool down in.  Joel and his staff are possibly the friendliest team I have ever come across on my travels nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them.  To top it all off Joel was quite happy for us to take our 'extras' bill away and pay it in sterling when we got home possibly because it was fairly small but even so - where would you ever get service like that???

We researched on-line hotels and came across the Riad Karmela. It fit what we were looking for a traditional Moroccan Riad in the heart of Marrakech. It was a tranquil setting tastefully decorated and great service. From the moment you are collected at the airport to arriving and being provided with personal service on what to do in Marrakech (complete with local tips and restaurant recommendations) it was a delight. The roof top terrace was our own personal oasis away from the busy streets of Marrakech. The beds were a little hard for my liking but that didn't stop us getting a good nights sleep after a busy day touring. Our room was spacious and had all the amenities we required. Riad Karmela even organize personalized tours for those wishing to venture out. We had the pleasure of doing a tour with some of the guests to the Atlas Mountains and it was by far the highlight of our holiday as we were able to dine in a local home in the mountains something we will never forget and felt privileged to do.

This riad is stunning beautiful courtyards a large roof terrace that looked magical lit by countless traditional lanterns and our room had a real authentic feel about it. All the staff were extremly friendly and helpful Joel gave accurate advice and tips about getting around the Medina and negotiating taxis. My only regret is that we chose not to enjoy the haman at karmela but instead opted to go to a local turkish bath this place had zero luxury and my daughter still hasn't forgiven me!

Riad Karmela,GV88uk wrote a review Sep 2014,40,An Oasis in the midst of a different era living.,Comments:    A hotel situated in the old part of Marrakesh can be described as an Oasis. The contrast between the outside and inside is like chalk and cheese!  The Hotel is very well decorated and has a very friendly personal inviting atmosphere. Staff very friendly and helpful. Language is not a problem.  The meals are freshly produced using seasonal ingredients. Priced in Euros and appears more expensive than the Restaurants around town but at least hygienically produced. The chef will accept special requests!  Meals are served in the terrace open and fresh very enjoyable surrounding. Breakfasts are generously served with at least one warm dish.  Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel and generally good. If required a guests can use the 2 PC set up with a printer both old and underused but available for free.  The Hamam [ soak and scrub ] rooms are a must and well run.  The central courtyards are inviting and encouraging to lounge around and meet the other guests we had a fab time playing board games after a long hard day in the sun.    Top Tips:    Be prepared for the sights sound and smells of an old town from the Middle Ages that is overcrowded but fully functional and self sufficient. Share the narrow alleys [ a giant maze ] with donkey carts bicycles and smelly motorbikes and locals selling everything under the sun that is hand made etc. Life at it's absolute basic,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GV88uk

Riad Karmela,Suilven wrote a review Sep 2014,40,A home from home in Marrakech,Arriving at Riad Karmela is perhaps a bit of a culture shock. The taxi driver drops you at a small square from where a man with a handcart takes you the couple of hundred metres to the Riad. All around you are mopeds donkey carts noise and dust. But once inside the Riad Karmela you find yourself in a peaceful oasis. There are two internal courtyards from which the bedrooms lead directly off. There is a small plunge pool and orange trees in one plus a couple of resident tortoises; both courtyards have plenty of comfortable seating and there are also covered areas in the unlikely event of rain.    The welcome from the host was warm and he gave us a wealth of information and tips to help us adapt to the city. Our room was off the second courtyard and was very nicely furnished with a huge bed and lots of cushions. The shower and toilet area was relatively basic but perfectly functional and very clean. The wifi mostly worked well though it was a little slow at times. We were glad of the air-conditioning unit after a hot day in the city.    Breakfast is taken on the roof terrace and there's a good selection of breads cheese cold meat preserves cereals and juices plus usually an omelette. It was a very pleasant place to start the day and in fact you can make use of the sun loungers or the tented areas all day if you wish. We also had dinner there one night and that was excellent though it's a no-choice menu which is simply served to you.    The Riad is two minutes from the souk less than ten minutes' walk from the Jemma El Fna and is also very close to a number of other sites of interest. You do have to get used to the sights and smells of the alleyways and the food market but it never felt anything other than very safe at any time of day or in the evening. You do have to ignore the young men who will offer to lead you the long way (or even the wrong way) to the sights and then charge you for their services. We noticed that as we quite quickly got our bearings and (probably) looked more confident we had less and less of that kind of hassle.    Recommended if you want to get into the spirit of Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suilven
Riad Karmela,james b wrote a review Sep 2014,40,Stayed too long in marrakesh,The riad is in the centre of the Medina about 10 minutes walk from the main square through a maze of lanes and alleyways. When we got dropped off on the first night a man put our suitcases into a cart and took us a ten minute walk through the Medina to door down a laneway which opened into riad karmela  The place is beautiful and was a paradise from the chaos outside. Couldn't help thinking this was a big mistake and would have to get the plastic out and book a hotel somewhere else. The following day we ventured out and got lost a few times boys in the Medina make their money showing people about which we were glad to pay until we got our bearings with the help of GPS on my phone. All a bit scary at first. We stayed at the riad for two weeks the place itself was great  Moroccan charm  the staff were great very helpful giving advise booking day trips restaurants and taxis. All in all it was more of an experience than a holiday. Three days in the Medina would be enough spend the rest of your holiday on the coast  a 2.30 hour trip in a minibus.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6297SRjamesb
Riad Karmela,kimpiquet wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Like they were family,I've never ever in more than 10 years of traveling have been received by a staff like I was at the Riad Karmela. It felt like been welcomed at a family home. And I truly mean it.  Even before we set foot there they were fantastic. We book our stay through booking.com about 3 months before going. About a week after booking I sent them an e-mail just to confirm it and they replied promptly to all my questions regarding getting in and out of Marrakech payment and send me a tip file that were very useful.    Throughout the following months they helped us find a tour operator to our trip in Zagora (even helped us haggle the price) and when the CTM (bus operator) site refused to take our credit card to buy tickets from Marrakech to Fes and from Fes to Chefchaouen they willingly stepped in and bought the tickets for us. They also arranged the airport pick-ups and everything.  And then there was our stay. They received us with mint tea explain the ins and outs the city and gave us an amazing room on the second floor.    We stayed there three nights. And enjoyed every minute. Breakfast was really good the jacuzzi on the rooftop was a nice addition to our late afternoons and the Hamman session was indeed relaxing. Plus it was an added bonus that they had beer in their menu for it was impossible to find it anywhere else in the city.    We checked out for our trip of the desert at 6 am two hours before they served breakfast and what a surprised they had set aside a simpler version of breakfast for us just so we wouldn't leave hungry. And when we come back 2 days later just to pick up our bags they offered us a room free of charge just so we could shower and relax a bit before going to the bus station. We were both sick at this point and that was indeed a wonderful gesture.    I'd like to thank Bouchra for always replying to our e-mails and willingly solving all our problems before arrival Joel for the great hosting experience and all the nice gestures Kamal for all the driving and car conversations and all the rest of the staff for always being there when we needed a could beer some M'semmen or when the air conditioner remote didn't work.

For girls traveling alone marrakesh is sadly not a friendly placd which came as disappointed as my expectations were high. The opinions of street vendors and locals being friendly are completely untrue. People (male) kept harassing us. Not to mention everyone trying to rip us off money for everything.

Riad Karmela,Dannie Thomson-Maude wrote a review Aug 2014,50,Absolutely fantastic place - A must visit!!!!,My Partner & I are both avid users of Trip Advisor we will use others experiences and feedback for booking holidays trips or reviewing places to eat etc. If I am honest I have never returned the favour by posting a review myself.    However I recently travelled to Marrakech (for the second time) but unlike our first trip (a week away in a Hotel) we wanted to experience all Morroco/Marrakech had to offer. It was on other people 'recommendations' that we stumbled across Riad Karmela... I feel compeled to right a review (although to be honest I don't think my words will do it justice - you would need to go and experience it for yourself).    We booked our holiday through an independent company who supplied us with an e-mail address for the owner Joel We mailed back and forth a number of times before we arrived. Joel was very keen on ensuring that he & his staff had our requirements met before we arrived.    From the moment we landed we experienced great service we pre-booked a taxi through the Riad from feedback on here in regards to other taxis having problems (I'd advise you do the same)Kamal is the Riad's on-site driver. Our flight was delayed by two hours we were panicking wondering if our transfer would be there so it was a relief to see Kamal waiting with a smile to greet us.    Upon arriving at the Riad we are given mint tea and some fresh baked goods. We were seated in the terrace area whilst our bags were taken to our room. Said (the evening manager) then gave us a really informative introduction to Marrakech the Medina and how things work - this instantly put us at ease (again very smiley - it must be something in the mint tea)    All of the staff at Riad Karmela are friendly and welcoming but especially Mustafa (we nicknamed him Smiler) this guy showed a genuine interest in us how our holiday was going and was very attentive - nothing was too much trouble for him from booking restaurants on our behalf to showing us round etc. The biggest compliment I can give Joel and his team (Bouchra/ Said/Mustafa) is we felt instantly at home and part of a little family.    Joel (The owner) is absolutely fantastic - a real character. I have read a small number of reviews that suggest he can come across abrupt I assure you this isn't in his nature he is extremely kind and I can only put others feedback down to a language/translation issue... Joel is French but is well spoken in English. Joel is always present at the riad you'll often see him working away but he also finds time to sit and talk to guests which in my opinion adds a personal touch.     For my partner and I who have travelled to various places this was our favourite. The Riad is presented well with each room offering a different theme. The Riad is actually 3 smaller Riads opened up into one but Joel has done this so each smaller Riad retains it's personallity and privacy...    ** top tip** you must explore the Riad especially the top terraces as this offer 'little hideaways' snug areas so not all is as it seems from first glance we fround little areas as our days went on - a favourite place of our was on the deckchairs right by the jacuzzi.     Riad Karmela offer a buffet type breakfast which caters for all; cereal (a choice of three) toast fresh fruit omlettes breads fresh juice tea & coffee. Snacks are available throughout the day; a choice of sandwiches salads etc     A big plus is the Riad serves alcohol (priced well) which is a real bonus considering this isn't redibly avaliable elsewhere and you usually find yourself drinking a coke light with your evening meal outside the Riad.    We booked a number of trips through the Riad - all of which were great fun reasonably priced and travel was in an air conditioned taxi (which is appreciated when it's 40°c)    Hamam & massages - definitely a must - the hamam is amazing and leaves your skin feeling lovely and soft. For the massages you have two types; a relaxation or a stress releaving (slightly harder)    Overall if you are looking for a place rich in culture with a cross mix of backgrounds and lots of things to do Marrakech is for you and Riad Karmela is definitely the place to stay offering a tranquil safe haven from the madness of the souxs/medina.    Further top tips **when out in the Medina ignore the locals offering assistance (at first this may prove difficult to do as your natural reaction is to say hello back) they will charge for there help - Joel and his team do advise you of this on arrival and are always on hand to help    **Taxis - they will try charge you the earth...agree a price before you get in and don't budge... sometimes it's easier to organise a taxi through the Riad    **if you are buying anything look around first - loads of shops selling similar items but the prices vary dramatically... the seller will always go in with a ridiculous figure... half it and half it again...if not walk away you have the upperhand... plenty more shops you'll find they come after you and agree with your price    **ignore the reviews on the Riad that have been marked down because of holiday makers not liking Marrakech - extremely unfair and unjust as this is people's livelihoods and whether or not someone liked the country they chose to visit shouldn't be reflected in their review of the Riad    Overall a fantastic experience we are already planning our return to Marrakech and will be staying at Riad Karmela.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/361danniem

Riad Karmela,Lesa03 wrote a review Jul 2014,50,3rd time and no need for luck!,Just got back from my 3rd stay at Riad Karmela and I must admit I was a tad apprehensive that it wouldn’t be as wonderful as my previous two experiences. I needn’t have worried though it was just as fantastic. I travelled with 3 friends none of whom had been to Marrakesh before. We had to wait a little while to get our rooms as there had been a bit of mix up but we were absolutely fine sunning ourselves on the beautiful roof terrace. We ate in the Riad on our first night and the food was every bit as good as I remembered especially the dessert! Breakfast was lovely especially the rocket fuel coffee. The staff couldn’t have been more helpful from arranging taxis guides booking restaurants and lugging trays of drinks up to the roof terrace for us. I would highly recommend a day at the Beldi Country Club. The rooms are all very different and wonderfully Moroccan. Check out was not the usual stressful nightmare as we were allowed to keep our rooms until we left which meant we could shower and pack just before we left to travel home. It is little things like this that make the Riad such a lovely place to stay and differentiates them from the big chain hotels. I am hoping I will be back for my 4th stay very soon.

Riad Karmela,hambles04 wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Tranquil oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Marrakech,As a group of females who have just returned from a 3 night break we cannot recommend this beautiful Riad enough. We were made to feel welcome from the moment we walked through the door with mint tea offered alongside local tips and knowledge. We stayed in an apartment which was nicely decorated in the traditional style inc a hair dryer and basic toiletries. We spent much time on the wonderful room terrace and in the jacuzzi which was a welcome relief to sit in the cooling bubbly water after a long day in the Souks. Dinner was also a treat with a set menu which included a lovely tagine and both the local white and rose wine were enjoyable in the sunshine. As a group of young women we were also offered a guide to walk us to local restaurants of an evening which they had phoned ahead to book us a table at.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hambles04
Riad Karmela,Erica F wrote a review Jul 2014,40,A wonderful Marrakech experience,The Riad Karmela is an oasis in the centre of Marrakech a welcome retreat in a bustling city. They will arrange for you to be met at the airport and driven into Marrakech be aware that as you get within the walled elements the roads are cobbled and narrow so you won’t get a door to door service and will need to walk a couple of hundred yards accompanied by the driver/guide (a few minutes) through the alleys to reach the Riad don’t be put off the approach its well worth it!    The staff at the Riad cannot do enough for you from booking trips talking you through options around the city highlighting points on the map they provide to booking restaurants giving you a guide/escort to restaurants or booking taxis as and when required. Our experience was that on the day you exit provided you are departing by lunchtime/early afternoon they are happy to let you keep your room making packing showering and changing before travelling home as pleasant as possible. That said you may experience delays accessing your room on arrival but this shouldn’t be seen as a negative. Keep your swim gear or cooler cloths at the top of your case or your hand luggage and enjoy a walk around the city or as we did retire to the beautiful sun terrace and enjoy a snooze read or dip in the plunge pool while you wait!    I’ve travelled in Africa before but never North Africa so wasn’t sure what to expect this was clean loved and welcoming.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sandhurst, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/336ericaf
Riad Karmela,PeteNuttall wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Excellent riad and superb staff,"A very beautiful riad in a great location in the medina. Interiors are sumptuous and very tasteful. Staff were excellent. Breakfast was very good especially the coffee! Menu for snacks and evening meals was limited (most resturants here have a fairly limited menu) buhe labarint the food was very good.    If you haven't been to Marrakech before listen to the advice from the owners. We found it to be a safe place but took sometime to get used to the labarynthine alleyways the ""helpful"" people giving directions and the hasslers in the souks.    My top tips:    Don't bother with the Tanneries!  Don't buy anything on your first day  Take a notepad and pen; get cab drivers to write down the price before you set off note down prices of stuff and check them out on eBay when you get back to the riad before going back to buy  Smile and joke with the hasslers but don't stop and get involved in a conversation/ have tea with them etc.  Do check out the little shops and stalls outside the souks they are less hassly and often better quality  Have a laugh with the guys in the Jemaa el Fna food stalls their patter is amazing  Ask and agree a price before taking anyones photo",Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeteNuttall

Riad Karmela,jclcseattle wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Enjoyed Riad Karmela,Decided on Riad Karmela mainly because of the reviews--also price was greatas was the location--after we booked we received a really informative e-mail from them and took them up on most of their suggestions such as airport transfer--as it turns out I would consider that essential unless you have been to Marrakech many times--well the ride was about an hour late--so we arrived at the Riad around 9:00am and had arranged to purchase breakfast because we were arriving that early and knew the room probably wouldn't be ready for us--well breakfast every morning on the roof top was a perfect way to start any day !! I loved the sfeng with my fresh fruit and my coffee--we received a quick orientation with a pretty good map and went to our room--It was a great room--Meriyum--large showergood lightingfantastic water pressuregood hair dryer and a great air conditioner !! We ordered dinner there our first night and it was reallyreally good--5 bowls of different cooked vegetables and tangine chicken--very nice--great service too !  Marrakech is really chaos but inside the walls of Karmela there is total peace and quiet all the courtyard areas are perfect just ask for tea and relax with a book anytime--they have 2 turtles in the main courtyard to watch and watch out for ! All the outside areas are perfectly decorated and so was our room ! Very nice!! We also had a hammam there and had them hire us a guide for one day which helped us get our bearings so we could then wonder on our own--the staff was very nice especially the ladies at breakfast-- and yes they don't always cover the food--I'm just not sure why ? We had an issue with our toilet which they tried to fix everyday but somehow couldn't quite do--we were there 4 days our last day we went to the Sofitel Hotel for a long lunch by the pool before our flight back to Spain--,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Scottsdale, Arizona",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jclcseattle
Riad Karmela,lindab62 wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Lovely Riad,Just returned from three nights in the Riad Karmela. What a lovely place. We arrived round 8pm and sat in the courtyard this was a lovely area beautifully decorated and had dinner which was a very nice three course meal very tasty and lots of it. We we're upgraded to a suite which was again a very beautifully decorated room and bathroom. Breakfast was buffet style it was adequate but I would like to have seen the food covered up. The riad is very clean throughout. The staff are friendly and helpful. The Riad is in a busy area but once inside you just relax. We loved it!  It's a short walk from the main square and once you get your bearings it's quite easy to get back to.  It very easy to get lost in the Medina when the locals can see that your lost they offer help but it's always for a fee and usually bypass a relatives shop just don't listen to people when they say that the road you want to go down is closed because it won't be!!!! They just try to send you back in the direction of their businesses.  We had a taxi organised by the Riad to and from the airport. The pick up from the airport went very smoothly but returning not quite so. I emailed Joel the owner of the Riad and told him what happened which I won't go into but he has since spoken to the firm in question and reassured me that it won't happen again to future guests.  Overall the stay and experience of Marrakech is something everyone should try.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Croft, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindab62
Riad Karmela,El Pedro wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Outstanding,This was my surprise 40th birthday present and I couldn't be happier. First of all the riad was beautiful  considering the location it was very quiet and a lovely escape from the chaotic streets outside. The riad staff collected us from the airport they looked after us for our entire trip and the return to the airport.  We arrived late at night and had the traditional meal on the roof tops  it was a great way to start the holiday and we highly recommend Moroccan rose wine - very highly rated in the guidebooks and we have to agree.  The riad is wonderfully decorated and the doors to the rooms were ornate and wonderful to look at !  On the first night we were in a room on the ground floor which backed onto the alleyway this was very noisy and at 1am we still couldn't get to sleep. We mentioned this to the staff and the following day we had been upgraded free of charge to a superior room you cannot complain about service like that.  On the third day we did the Atlas Mountains trip with other guests and we both highly recommend it to anyone - it ticked all our boxes and was worth every penny.  As I didn't know where I was going I had into packed flip flops these were no good for the trek so the staff went out and bought a pair of walking shoes and socks for me again that quality of service stays with you.  The breakfast on the roof terrace was perfect.  Overall I cannot recommend this place enough and if you are thinking of going to Marrakech then book here you won't be disappointed. You do pay more for transfers food etc then if you arranged it locally but considering the service you receive you can't fault it.  The staff are brilliant and attentive and the riad is clean and beautiful  the service all round was spot on we will be returning.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/El-Pedro74

The rooms are so well decorated and the courtyards too. The breakfast is nice and simple with quite a bit of choice rather enjoyable. Dinner at the Riad is lovely! All the food is delicious best I had while in Marrakech. The staff are so friendly and make you feel very comfortable you can ask them for anything (within reason) and they are happy to provide for you.

We were three girls from London visiting Marrakech for the 1st time and Riad Karmela made our visit one to remember.We organised a few trips with the riad including camel riding quad biking and a breath-taking visit to the Atlas mountains. Everything organised by the riad went smoothly and we have amazing memories. The riad itself was gorgeous with beautiful morroccan interior which was colourful and clean- even though it is situiated right in the medina the nights are so peaceful and quiet. Breakfast was yummy with a selection of bread eggs fruits juices and many more delicious foods. Really cannot fault this beautiful riad everything about it was perfect. Just want to say a massive thank you to the Riad for making our trip so memorable and thank you to Sayeed for helping us out with payment issues and organising such incredible trips for us thank you Jamal for our late night chats about faith and all the shisha and finally thank you Mustafa for all the fun memories (pacha was the best! thank you for taking us there!!!).

Riad Karmela,DebsSuffolk_England wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Stunning!,"My first trip to Marrakesh. I was not prepared for the sights sounds and smells but very quickly got used to it. The Riad was fantastically beautiful. All terraces were decorated with typical Moroccan furniture and fabrics. Rooftop terraces were planted with sweet smelling shrubs and everywhere was well maintained. You would never know the Riad was in the location it is as there are so many narrow alleyways. A real jewel but make sure you arrange a taxi with the Riad because you would never find the it without a guide. The alleyways to the Souks took some getting used to. There were crowded smelly and very noisy. Every sense is awakened in Marrakesh but definitely a humbling experience one which I plan to repeat with other members of my family as soon as I can. We went on a day trip to the Atlas Mountains and had a meal with a Berber family in their own home. A small tip take sturdy walking boots or comfortable trainers because the climb up the mountain to see the waterfalls is quite hard but well worth the effort. The spice markets are worth going to behind the main souks. Always haggle the Moroccans expect it.

Riad Karmela,Karen B wrote a review May 2014,50,An Oasis,Absolutely loved this Riad! Four of us stayed in an apartment (Haroune) which was very comfy and roomy without being too big. In hindsight I think we would have gone for two bedrooms because of four of us sharing one bathroom. Fab location - you wouldn't even know the Riad was there even though it is just off the busy cobbled streets of Marrakech. Only a few mins walk to the Soukhs. The Riad organised day trips/taxis/guides for us which was extremely comforting. Breakfast was lovely served on the terrace and the dinner we had on arrival (late flight) was of really good standard. Wine and beer can be had at any time of the day.

Riad Karmela,Rachel wrote a review May 2014,50,"Gorgeous Riad, great location",We stayed here for a 4 night break on the basis of other excellent reviews on tripadvisor. It was absolutely lovely. Our room Aicha was gorgeous with a wow factor moroccan style bathroom. There were loads of beautiful secluded spaces around the riad to sit and read or chill or sunbathe whether in courtyards of orange trees on cushioned seating areas on sunbeds on the beautiful rooftops in the jacuzzi or in the dappled shade of a pergola. Breakfast on the roof terrace was lovely and it was only here that you noticed that the place was actually quite full as during the day there always seemed to be a secluded spot all of your own. The airport transfer worked well and i recommend it as it would be tricky to find on your own. On arrival we were given mint tea and pastries and the owner gave us a map with routes marked on she talked us through the local customs such as haggling and most importnantly explained the best way to get back to the hotel! The riad is in a great location in the heart of the action but felt like an oasis of tranquility. There is always a bit of culture shock when you first go out for a wander but we both commented on how safe Marrakesh felt even when walking back late at night always plenty of people about going about their business no hassle. Some really nice touches to acknowledge from the Riad as well: complementary bottled water in the rooms daily sunhats dotted around the roof terrace when we went on a trekking trip they lent me suitable shoes and my personal favourite a PROPER 2000 watt hairdryer in the room! I have stayed in much more expensive places and not had this attention to detail. The riad is beautifully decorated in traditional chic moroccan style lanterns cushions mosaic tiled archways and water features. Friendly unpretentious stylish comfortable excellent value for money.

Riad Karmela,Julie K wrote a review May 2014,50,Tranquil retreat in the heart of Marrakech,This hotel is is located in the heart of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. As other trip advisors have commented you cannot get to this hotel by transport due to the size of the streets. We were collected at the airport and taken to the small taxi drop off point where we were met and taken to the Riad. Initially you wonder where on earth you are being taken to but once you weave down the streets adorned with local sellers you eventually arrive at the door of the Riad to be greeted by Joel. He sat us all down in the welcoming open area near reception adorned with orange trees and a couple of tortoise! Joel explained the area of Marrakech with a map to help and what he could arrange for us whether this be a guide who would take us to the local streets souks mosque or a trip to the Atlas Mountains. His knowledge was invaluable and would set us up for our visit. This inauguration was complimented by a serving of the local mint tea and savouries. We were on a half board basis and can I say that the evening meals were absolutely wonderful. It was a set menu but in a way I am glad as I wouldn't have known what to choose on a Moroccan menu. Everything we were served from lamb beef chicken fish were all amazing and the waiter was so attentive and couldn't do enough for us. This also included catering for a member of our party who was unable to eat red meat and they were only too pleased to provide an alternative. These meals were served on the roof of the Riad where you also take breakfast. I have read comments on the amount of flies around the food which was prevalent in the morning only and maybe they could have covered bread with napkins to deter the flies but at the end of the day this is a hot country and you do get flies it goes with the territory.  The room I had with my friends was an apartment and initially I was disappointed with the room maybe because it wasn't as modern as I would have expected. However when I began to read about the age of the property what it was used for and then how the owner had then tried to maintain the rooms to the original specifications I was converted. The longer my trip went on the more I fell in love with this place to the extent that I would say this wasn't actually an hotel it was like staying in a friends house. Everyone was treated as individuals and nothing was too much for any of the staff. Whether this be that you requested afternoon tea on the roof top terrace (which would have involved walking up numerous stairs) or to arrange trips nothing was too much trouble. The staff are a credit to the Riad. We even booked messages which are also in a separate part of the Riad and have to say they were amazing !! This Riad is so in the centre of the action it is untrue. But as soon as you walk through the doors it is tranquil quiet calming and welcoming.

Riad Karmela,Hivedoc wrote a review May 2014,30,Potential for a great Stay,I spent two days at Riad Karmela with my wife and two sons. I have to say that my first night was one of the worst nights I have ever spent in a hotel but I do believe it was an anomaly.    The Riad itself is really lovely. The common spaces are peaceful and tranquil which is a great relief from loud chaotic Marrakech. Like everywhere in old Marrakech it is very hard to find but once you learn the lay of the land one realizes that the location is really quite great. Every place you would want to go in Marrakech is within a 5-20 minute walk and the staff at Riad Karmela are very helpful in giving instructions. Breakfasts on the rooftop are very good and the rooftop space with flowers and little seating coves is a nice place to read or sun.    Rooms are all quite different. My first night was in a room on the roof with a canvas tent-like ceiling. There was a DJ and party down the street playing until 5 am and cats wrestling on the roof. I am a very good sleeper but could not sleep a wink. We had two rooms the other was completely quite as were to common areas. We switched out of the rooftop room the second night and were able to sleep soundly. The rooms aren't fancy but feel cozy and clean.    Had I been in any other room on my first night I would have had a four star experience. If I return to Marrakech I would consider Riad Karmela but would pre-arrange a more quiet room first.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kensington, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hivedoc

Riad Karmela,PalmiA wrote a review May 2014,30,Nice but not the exceptional rating giving,The Riad is lovely beautifully decorated and clean. The staff are friendly and helpful.  The downside is the location and the food. Although is very convenient to walk to the Souks and main square the area is pretty hectic with narrow roads crowded with people bicycles and motorbikes. It can be intimidating. The breakfast is served on the roof terrace which is lovely however the amount of flies sitting on the food is a real put off and the food does not always look or taste fresh. The evening dinners are ok homely made which is nice but certainly not worth EUR25.00. It is convenient if you are tired and don't want to go out for dinner.  I booked a transfer with Ryanair from the airport to the Riad and return. When I contacted the Riad I was told it would be better to use their transfer because Ryanair transfer would not take me to door of the hotel. I end up paying twice for the transfer and the Raynair service was there waiting for me when I arrived and went to the Riad to pick me up by which time I had already paid the Riad for transfer costing me an extra EUR30.

We were then welcomed by the owner who told us a bit about the place and what they offer and he then showed us to our room which was beautiful and spacious.    The breakfast was nice and varied and was extremely fresh and we also booked a massage and hammam and scrub (Total was about 50€) through reception which was a great way to end the trip and was well worth the expense. If there was only one negative thing I would say it is to do with the Mosque located just a few metres away which would probably wake lighter sleepers like myself. Understandably they are loacted all over Marrakech but this was the only place that I stayed in here that I was woken up by it or could hear it as clearly. In saying that though the place is most certainly worth staying in for the service and general tranquility alone.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/80StuartC
Riad Karmela,SarahandDC wrote a review Apr 2014,50,"Gorgeous Raid, central but tucked away from hustle & bustle.",We stayed here in January 2014 when my husband booked it as a surprise trip for my 40th! It's a gorgeous raid which has been converted from someone's home into a sumptuous hotel. Decor is very traditional & to a high standard. Rooms are large clean & comfortable. Staff are friendly & helpful & will recommend local places of interest & restaurants with great local cuisine. They also gave us great advice on local etiquette & what to pay for taxis & goods in local shops etc so as not to be ripped off. We visited 3 museum's ( Ben Youssef/museum of Marrakech & museum of photography)just round corner from the raid which was worth while to see not only exquisite architecture but also views of the city from their roof tops. We recommend booking food with the raid for first night if arriving late in the day ( 25euros pp for 3 courses but well worth it) we did & it was fab food giving us taste of Moroccan food & saving us trying to negotiate the Moroccan streets in the dark on our first night! The hamman treatment offered in the hotel is amazing & a must for your stay & so reasonable at 15 euros! Don't miss going to the medina square during the day to visit the souks & shop/haggle til you drop & at night for whole new Moroccan experience! But be careful in the square day or night of taking any photos as the locals( snake charmers water carriers acrobats etc) are quite forceful of then asking you to pay them! The restaurants around the square are & offer great food we visited chez chegrouni & cafe France the later only 11 euros for bread 2 main dishes 2 drinks & a dessert!! & had the best tajine of our stay. We also did the Atlas Mountain trip & booked this direct from the Raid which we also recommend as we had 2 local guides who both went out of their way to give us a truly unforgettable experience. I can't wait to go again & would definitely stay in this Raid we have already recommended it to 2 lots of friends who have booked for this May & November. Enjoy.

Riad Karmela,Barry S wrote a review Apr 2014,40,comfortable and great location,Booked a 3 night stay with my wife for a short break to hopefully catch some sun and stroll round the souks. we were picked up at the airport by someone from the Riad and the transfer probably took about 20minutes followed by a 5 minute walk from where the car had to be left. By the time we checked into the romm and had a debrief/orientation we felt we would be best off eating at the hotel rather than exploring but in hindsight this was maybe a mistake as we later discovered there were many places only a ten minute walk away.    At that point we didnt know if there were safety issues at night etc. Let me reassure you that it is perfectly fine to be walking around at any time and there is no intimidatory atmosphere etc so feel free to explore.    Breakfast is served on a great roof terrace. Its simple nothing cooked but really nice. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and plentiful and they have english breakfast tea so no need to bring your teabags !    The souks are so close (as are various museums) that it is practical to have a wander round and then pop back to your romm easily before venturing back out if you so wish. The aforementioned roof terrace has sun beds and comfy chairs making it a pleasant venue throughout the day. There is also a shower lhidden away in one corner which is great to ccol down if you overheat.    There are many reasonably priced restaurants nearby and we visited cafe arabe and Le Foundouk and were very pleased with our choices. The riad staff will book for you which was definitely needed for the evenings.    Riad` Karmela has a hammam and i booked a body scrub with some trepidation but hey when in marrakech .... I would recommend this and I also had a great massage afterwards. Both together were only 45euros. Its a must.    The staff could not have been more helpful and there was a great camaraderie with all staff and guests. After we had checked out a cleaner tracked us down as we had left a credit card in the safe (which we were certain we had cleared) so as a demonstartion and recommendation of honesty and integrity that is about as good as it gets.    One slightly odd thing was that our ground floor room (in common with other ground floor rooms) have lovely decorative doors but they didnt close properly and relied on a curtain being drawn in front of them. Whilst this keeps line of sight closed it doesnt stop sound and if you have courtyard seating immediately outside your room (as we did) then iy can lead to a noisy evening. Just as we could hear every word spoken by others they could hear us too.  Bit strange but we got used to it. Requesting a first floor room would solve the problem.    If you are looking to avoid the chain hotel experience and have a more authentic stay with a great welcome and nice surroundings in a central location then stay at Riad Karmela and I am sure you will not be disappointed.    I would definitely return and recommend to friends.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarryS119
Riad Karmela,396WendyS wrote a review Apr 2014,40,"Lovely Riad, great location, excellent service",We stayed at Riad Karmela for a four day break the Riad and its location is excellent just a two minute walk from the souk and less than ten minutes from the main square. Down a winding alley through almost unnoticeable doors you find the very pretty Riad Karmela and smaller ‘Petit Karmela’ which is directly opposite. We took the entire smaller riad for our group and had six rooms leading to a beautiful central living space/covered courtyard which was ideal for us all to gather together and relax. Breakfast was taken in the main Riad in another gorgeous courtyard setting amongst orange trees and a fountain.    Joel the owner and Bouchra were extremely efficient and helpful throughout the booking process assisting with plans prior to arrival. During our stay the whole team were friendly and accommodating – they organised taxis transport for our day trip gave honest advice and happily assisted us to organise a drinks party one evening on the beautiful roof terrace. When we asked for directions to a tailor for a small mend on a dress one morning they arranged this immediately returning the garment to us a few hours later with compliments!    Overall a great find and affordable too – their excellent service made things very easy for us and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/396WendyS
Riad Karmela,Sarah D wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Helpful staff in a central but tranquil Riad.,Our group of 7 ladies stayed with Riad Karmela last week (April 2014) and enjoyed it very much. We actually stayed at Riad El Nour 5 metres down the same alley as Karmela and for our stay had it to ourselves - the rooms are set around a central enclosed courtyard which was very peaceful.    The staff team were very helpful before we arrived and during our whole stay they could not do enough to help. From helping us book excursions to boiling water for tea in the evenings arranging taxis and escorts back on foot when we wanted to be accompanied to and from evening locations. The party visited Karmela for a special occasion and the guys on reception helped us set up drinks and balloons on the roof terrace - they even blew up the balloons before we got there! With a view of the city and mountains beyond the setting was fantastic.    The rooms are very pretty although some of the beds vary in comfort for the price point we were very impressed. The Riad itself is fantastically central (a little tricky to find but marked with frequent signs on street walls) with just a 10 minute walk into the heart of the souks.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/974sarahd
Riad Karmela,LexiPro wrote a review Apr 2014,50,"Great location, great staff, value for money",We booked Riad El Nour for seven ladies travelling to Marrakech for a break in the sunshine.    Right from the start the communication was excellent unlike many other Riads that we emailed.  Joel runs a tight ship all of the staff were very helpful and could not do enough for us; anything from arranging trips to the Atlas mountains and bringing us irons and various other items  .  I would highly recommend booking any taxi's though the Riad the price would have already been agreed and the cars safe to travel in. The taxi that we booked from the airport was a blessing as we would never have found the Riad. It was so nice to come back to a relaxed environment away from the hustle and bustle of the City.  Riad El Nour is the smaller of the Riad's which we had all to ourselves which was amazing.  My only feedback would be to have more and better quality towels in the bedrooms.  Rooms are basic but comfortable and the level of customer service makes up for the lack of things like really nice towels etc. I must thank Siad who did so much for us and Bounchra for arranging everything so efficiently on our visit.    We will be back again!,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LexiPro
Riad Karmela,Gabrielle C wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Quiet oasis in central location,A group of ladies keen to sample the sights smells and sounds of the souk. And then retire to a welcome quiet space. The view of the snow capped mountains over the rose coloured town from the Riad Karmela rooftop terrace as the sun went down was simply breathtaking. The staff were very helpful and able to arrange taxis out to nearby spa country clubs and smarter cocktail bars and restaurants in the evening. We had a great time!!

Riad Karmela,elevonic wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Confusion and Serenity,I will start this review by stating that if we have originally booked the Riad Karmela and stayed in the room we were finally given then this review would quite probably have been for 5 stars. However this wasn’t the case.    Our original booking was for the Riad El Nour a smaller Riad but part of the same group as the Karmela. One week before we were due to arrive we received an email stating that the Riad El Nour wasn’t available and were we prepared to stay at another Riad the Riad Zineb. We were offered a free airport return and a bottle of wine for our inconvenience. We looked at the details for the Riad Zineb and it looked fine so we accepted the offer.    Upon arrival at Marrakech airport we were met by the driver a bit later than expected but no big deal and driven to the Karmela. This is an adventure in itself negotiating tiny streets dodging the mopeds people donkeys and carts etc. As recommended elsewhere I would also advise this option is taken as the car cannot drive right up to the Karmela leaving a walk of a couple of minutes if you were making your own arrangements it would be extremely difficult to find although there are plenty of locals who would show you the way for a fee.    We were greeted at the Karmela by Bouchra (I believe) and given mint teas and pastries whilst having the local area explained to us a useful map was also given to us with places marked for later reference. At this point we were told that our room at the Riad Zineb wasn’t ready this later changed to there was nobody at the Zineb to finally being told that a mistake had been made and we weren’t booked into the Zineb until the following night so we would have to stay at the Karmela for one night although if we chose to continue our stay at the Karmela we would be upgraded to a junior suite.    The room we were given was situated on the roof terrace quite a nice room with a tented appearance although the bathroom could do with brightening up as it was quite gloomy with plaster coloured walls. It did get quite chilly in there overnight as it’s quite exposed on the roof the air con could be used to give heat and I think there were extra blankets in the room too.  After an expedition into the local area we returned for some relaxation on the roof terrace which is a nice peaceful area and fortunately the sun was out too.    We had pre-arranged for our first night evening meal to be at the Riad which I must say was delicious although at 25 euros per person it’s quite expensive going by what we paid at various restaurants in the following days. But as the quality and service were very good we enjoyed it.  The next morning we went down to breakfast which is served buffet style. There was plenty of choice cereals fruit yoghurt cheese ham etc. Orange juice tea coffee etc etc. Fresh bread and pastries were also available. Breakfast was fine in our opinion.    After breakfast we enquired at the front desk as to when we would be moving rooms as previously discussed as we hadn’t been given any further information. We then found out that we would be moving to the Riad Zineb as there were no rooms available at the Karmela anymore! We weren’t happy about this as it meant packing everything up again and moving. We were offered a free hamman (which we never took advantage of) and given the choice of staying at the Riad Zineb or returning to the Karmela and having breakfast at the Zineb or Karmela. This break was meant to be relaxing!    Upon arrival at the Riad Zineb we found the owners to be cleaning the tiled floors and preparing it for us as it had been closed for a week. The Zineb is another nice Riad much smaller than the Karmela. We were given a room on the ground floor beside the patio plus front door and room keys. We then found out we were the only guests staying at the Riad Zineb.    We had decided to have breakfast the following morning at the Riad Karmela as we didn’t want to put the owners of the Riad Zineb to any trouble just doing breakfast for us two.    We spoke with Joel and agreed to return to the Karmela for our last two nights stay as we weren’t keen on staying at an empty Riad although the total peace and quiet may appeal to some to us it was too quiet.  The room we were then given at the Karmela was the junior suite Kaiss which overlooks the main patio with its own balcony. This was a lovely suite and would recommend it.    I must add that during all changes of Riads our baggage was transported by the Riad staff with no fuss.    For those not familiar with Marrakech as we weren’t it may come as a bit of a surprise as to the location of the Karmela and the route taken to access it. If people are expecting a touristy area then they’re in for a shock it really is in the heart of the local community. We are well travelled but were still surprised at the maze of narrow streets and alleyways in the vicinity. The constant call of “it’s closed that way” by the locals hoping to show you another way for money loses its novelty very quickly too (p.s. the streets aren’t closed.) It took us a few goes to feel comfortable about finding our way to and from the Karmela even with a map.    So overall the Riad Karmela is a lovely Riad the Riad Zineb is also a lovely Riad both with cool courtyards and nice roof terraces. It would have been nice to stay in one or the other for the duration of our stay.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elevonic

Riad Karmela,lafouz wrote a review Mar 2014,30,Getting the big head,"I really liked this place very much I stayed maybe 3 times there first with MIL that are 80 and 86 y o and it was really nice because they accommodated them very well as they couldn't use the stairs we were not in the main Riad we had the next door Riad but I remember we had noisy neighbors drinking and talking loud late in the night then there was a noisy weddingin the neighborhood until early morning!  Besides all I liked it very much that I started recommending it to all my friends However the last time I stayed there in October 2013 I didn't like it anymore they were less friendly and got the big head ""la grosse tete"" plus the hassle of parking I got tired of it as our rental car got purposely scratched on a prepaid parking lot close to the RIad We had a luggage carrier that we paid and the hotel told us that he told them we didn't pay him and the hotel had to pay him and I told Bouchra I will not pay again as I already paid him when we got to the parking he was there and I asked him why he lied and got paid twice he was denying that he got paid again by the hotel and he was ready to go back with me to confront the hotel but I didn't want to return.......so all this got me reluctant to stay again in Riads in the medina! but overall it's a beautiful Riad and they give you good directions and it is convenient if you don't have a car!

Riad Karmela,Decodendolly wrote a review Mar 2014,50,Wonderful Riad,Riad Karmela is just fantastic a real get away from all the hustle bustle of Marrakech. It's so peaceful and relaxing and really feels like your own exotic holiday home. I've stayed in a lot of great hotels but this was by far my favourite. The service is great they really can't do enough for you. Food was yummy and the fresh squeezed orange juice for breakfast was amazing! It's also great value for money. As others have said use the hotel airport taxi service it's essential and literally takes you door to door via a little walk we would not have found it otherwise.

Riad Karmela,captainbeecher wrote a review Feb 2014,50,A perfect base to take in marrakech,We took advantage of the airport transfer which is probably a must as the Riad would be hard to find first time. Our arrival had us a little daunted as we thought we would never be able to navigate the narrow alleys of the Medina as the driver walked us the final 250 metres or so from where the car is parked to the Riad itself. once inside we were greeted by Joel and a cup of mint tea with confections. He provided us with a map and tips on taxis bartering in the souk best routes through the Medina to the Jamma el Fna and info on excursions and guided tours through the Souks. The welcome could not have been more attentive or friendly. In truth we are the kind of folk who like to go out there and be explorers so we used the offline Trip Advisor app as our guide through the Souks and Medina on day one.    The rooms are all named rather than numbered and we were taken to 'Hasna' one of the smaller rooms [still very spacious with a good sized bathroom] in the Riad and without any direct access to the roof but that wasn't really of any issue to us. It sits in the courtyard adjacent to the dining courtyard so perhaps not as quiet as the rear courtyard in the late evening but we liked it.    Take the time to explore the Riad as I didn't until I had an hour or so kill before the taxi came to take us to the airport. I wasn't aware of the size of the Riad beyond the breakfast serving room and because people had checked out and the rooms were being cleaned I got the chance to look in some of the bigger suites. Every room is different and has it's individual advantages.    We had dinner on the first night which was excellent and highly recommended while breakfast was standard fare orange juice was so fresh tea cereal fresh and dried fruit yoghurt etc.    Do take a Hammam and massage while you're there. My wife who has MS has often had various physio and sports massages which have all been rubbish. She has never has as good a massage as the one provided by Hannah. 90 minutes of total relaxation.    As a person who enjoys a beer or three when on holiday it was nice to get a couple of cans of Flag and a glass of wine for the other half from reception on the tab whenever we returned from a day exploring. While the Souk and Medina are fantastic it really is great to get into the calm and relaxation of the Riad.    All in all I can't fault it. Sitting in one of the courtyards in the late afternoon with a drink under the orange trees and open sky is a really relaxing experience. [we didn't go to the roof terrace as Marrakech is at it's coldest in February even though the weather when we were there was still great sunny and high teens Celsius]    Just finally a special mention for two members of staff who probably go relatively unmentioned in reviews. We didn't know their names but my wife christened them George and Mildred...The Riad's two Tortoises who are a constant amusement to the guests as they meander around the front courtyard. Oh and the chamber maid who happily sings away when she is servicing the rooms while the guests are out.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lisburn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captainbeecher

Riad Karmela,Zéna B wrote a review Feb 2014,40,Excellent Value For Money,I travelled to Marrakech with three friends last week (end of January 2014). Booked the Riad Karmela and flights through lastminute.com following research on TA and as always TA reviews proved to be very accurate!    The Riad Karmela is situated in the middle of the old town - ten minutes walk from the souks and the main square; an oasis amongst the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. Never would you think that such a big residence resides through a hole in the wall!    We were upgraded to the Oum Khaltoum suite which was more than sufficient for 4 of us; it boasts its own private terrace (which we didn't get to use due to weather issues!) but it really is beautiful.    Bouchra and Joel are excellent hosts very polite informative and helpful. Kamal is also a fantastic driver always there when expected.    I gave this hotel 4 stars because I feel as though the breakfast could have been better (very basic - eggs take too long to come out hard bread not a fan of the pastries - but amazing fresh orange juice!) and despite having booked our transfer upon landing in Marrakech (20euros - but worth it as the riad is in such an obscure place on first sight) AND confirming twice with Riad staff from London our driver was not there we had to phone Bouchra several times to locate him.    I would highly recommend the Riad Karmela for a peaceful break amongst everything - whether it be with family friends partner or as an independent traveller.

Riad Karmela,Dandkkinslow wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Peaceful oasis in busy marrakesh,We stayed here for four nights. The hotel taxi collected us from the airport. The streets are too narrow by the riad so the taxi took as as far as he could. Then a porter from the hotel met us and carried our bags to the riad. We never would have found it ourselves!    The manager sat with us gave us a great intro to the city and showed us a map with directions and recommended restaurants. Told us about the free wifi whoch was fast too! And we were welcomed with mint tea and pastries..lovely. We were shown our room which was very unique with windows overlooking the courtyard. There was a suite available so we upgraded to that which was very nice too.    The roof terrace is lovely to relax after a busy day out in the souks. Only downside was that we had some noisy guests and because of the riad layout with rooms overlooking the courtyard you can hear conversations late into the night. But only minor.    We found the staff at the riad very very helpful. The recommended restaurants such as la fondouk (lovely restaurant) and cafe arabe and place des spices which we went to for lunch. Staff also told us how much we should pay for taxis to and from certain places which was really helpful as its very easy to get over charged. Staff also gave us the tel number of their taxi who knew where the riad is which helped! We had dinner at the riad and both times food was lovely and atomsphere was relaxing. Staff also booked us a tour to the atlas mountains which we'd definately recommend.    Overall marrakesh is very unique and we have not been anywhere like it before. The atomsphere is very lively. As soon as you walk out of the riad you are in small walkways with shops either side. Mopeds bikes and donkey carts going back and fourth. We found it daunting at first and we did get lost in all the small streets but you do get used to it. It was very nice to esape to the riad for a sense of calm and peace away from the souks. Riad karmela was definitly a highlight of our trip and would recommend it to anyone.,Date of stay: January 2014,,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dandkkinslow

We arrived late on a Tuesday night but were met by a charming driver who escorted us from the airport into the Riad and took our bags. We were then met by the Riad staff who gave us mint tea and Moroccan pastries and provided us with maps and invaluable tips for navigating around the medina. After a 3 course dinner (with tortoises for company!) we settled down for a very comfortable nights sleep. We stayed for four nights in total and throughout this time felt well looked after. The staff were good fun polite and attentive without being intrusive. We also had a hamman and massage in the Riad and thought the staff were very professional and highly skilled. The Riad is in an ideal location being ten minutes walk from the main square Djemma-el-fna and we were able to reach everywhere that we wanted to go on foot without the need for taxis. The Riad is relaxing and peaceful at any time of day and provides a welcome retreat from the chaos of the souks.

Riad Karmela,Travelling-Vincent wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Charm, hospitality, top quality food and awesome design too","Riad Karmela was our last destination before flying back home. We stayed three night and if possible we would have loved to postpone our flight to enjoy the place a bit more.    I can recommend you the place for every account: elegant clean and spacious rooms awesome Moroccan design a wonderful finely decorated internal court friendly and professional staff a great sauna and ham man facility top quality food for breakfast and dinner impeccable service.    The location is typically Medina style: you have to get familiar with the maze of narrow streets and back alleys in order to avoid getting lost. But the staff is friendly and ready to help you in order to locate yourself on the map and even to accompany you around the first time if you're so afraid to discover the ""maze"" alone. I highly recommend to take your time and discover the medina and the souk by yourself. You might get lost once and take twice the same street. But this is the only way to learn and discover the heart of Marrakesh. And Riad Karmela is a great starting point for it.    If you are a bigger family or a little group and want to share an awesome suite book ""Umm Al Kaltoum"" suite. It's really worth its price.

Riad Karmela,ElPeHa wrote a review Jan 2014,50,We just love the Riad Karmela,When we are in Morocco Marrakech Riad Karmela we feel gorgeous... that´s the reason of our periodic return to the Riad Karmela.  we´ve been her now many times and we will return for sure - inshallah.  between a heartily welcome and a cordial bye bye are some of our finest days of the year.    why try another riad. there´s no reason for.  the rooms are very nice and comfortable the staff is helpful in any way it´s an oasis of tranquility in this agil busy town.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Stuttgart,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElPeHa
Riad Karmela,Ol'Bill wrote a review Jan 2014,50,A lovely calm and tradition Riad.,Firstly if you're thinking of going to Marrakech don't hesitate. Yes it's dirty and yes people drive like maniacs and yes you may see the odd drowned cat in a bin but it's such a bustling place with the most incredible atmosphere. I've never been anywhere else in the world where there is so much stimulation for the senses.    But it is daunting and very busy. The Riad Karmela was the perfect oasis of calm. As other reviewers have said it is hard to find but if you arrange a trasnfer you'll be walked straight to the door and it's not hard finding your way after the first couple of times.    We were greeted with traditional pastries mint tea a map of the city (not brilliant but probably the best you can get for a city with such an intricate layout). The Riad is absolutely stunning especially the roof terrace which we had all to ourselves when we went. For those who are very particular about cleanliness it may fall short but it was perfectly adequate. Our room was very comfortable and beautifully decorated.    We had one meal in the Riad and the food was excellent. They fully catered for me as a vegetarian and we were not charged extra for the wine which is locally produced and is surprisingly good. We also took an excursion to the mountain which was very well organised great value for money and an amazing experience.    If I go back to Marrakech I will stay there for sure.,Date of stay: March 2013,,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curmudgel
Riad Karmela,Jacqueline D wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Fabulous Riad, Great Location",Riad Karmela really is a haven when you step through their gates out of the hustle & bustle of arriving into Marrakech!  Our family spent the first 2 nights here & couldn't have been happier.  The staff - ESP Joel were extremely helpful & caring. Nothing was ever a problem. The rooms were clean & adequate. We had dinner there the first night & was grateful after a tough day traveling not to be thinking about trying to find our way to eat somewhere else. Plus the food was excellent the beers cold & service expedient. Breakfast was also terrific & a great selection.  Location to the main square & Souks very handy.  We certainly recommend this Riad to fellow travelers for value for money.,Date of stay: January 2014,,"Chatswood, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacqMD3838

Whether it was the great breakfast on the rooftop overlooking the city the incredible staff that went above and beyond to accommodate us the great pools in the tranquil courtyards or the beautifully renovated rooms this place was an absolute gem! In the middle of summer the mayhem of the souks can become a bit full on so retreating to this Riad to relax during the hottest part of the day was a great relief.

Riad Karmela,PipnEllie wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Christmas in Marrakech,We stayed at Riad Karmela for 4 nights over Christmas and had a wonderful time. The staff are all lovely and always ready to help. We had the Zorah suite which has two separate rooms with a comfortable single daybed in one room with the ensuite off and a double bed in the main bedroom. I was dubious about how good the plumbing etc would be in this old building but it was fine with a great shower. We booked for the special Christmas Eve dinner which was a brilliant evening with local musicians and dancers and a fantastic banquet. The food is excellent including the very good continental style breakfast buffet.  I definitely recommend you arrange your airport transfer via the hotel. It is not possible to get any vehicle close up to the hotel but their drivers know where to go and will ring the hotel to send someone to escort you and bring your luggage up the narrow alleyways and tunnel entrance - and once you stoop down to go through the tiny entrance door you find a hidden paradise of beautiful courtyards topped by the amazing roof terraces.  This place is not suitable for anyone with mobility issues or for people who want to stay up late being noisy- the hotel staff are keen to maintain the atmosphere of tranquility from 10pm to 10am.  The location is great - right in the middle of the Medina an easy stroll through the souks to the main square. But there isn't much in the immediate vicinity if you just wanted to pop out for a snack or a drink in the evening and as two females we would feel a bit uncomfortable walking back late at night.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PipnEllie

Riad Karmela,kamodedra wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Riad Herougui - sister hotel,After the hotel we had booked weeks ago let us down we had to quickly find a replacement. a blessing in disguise as the sister hotel to Riad Karmela - Riad Hergoughi was sublime! Arrival into Marrakech was a bit of an unorganised affair after it took over two hours for a driver to take us to the Riad but once we did arrive Siad made us feel at home.    Riad Heroughi is across an alley way from the Karmela but we were able to use the facilities at Karmela at any time. This included wifi in the courtyard and breakfast. Wifi at the Herougui would have been good. The young man looking after we at our Riad was very attentive and helpful.    Really great location. Away from the chaos but close enough to walk everywhere.    We felt like we had the entire Riad to ourselves so it felt extra special!    The breakfast was okay just a bit repetitive. We stayed for 4 days.    Overall I recommend this Riad! We were in the Indian inspired room - and we had a look at couple of the other 'suites'...I think ours was the best!,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamodedra
Riad Karmela,Geraldine D wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Sanctuary in the Market,This was not a 5 star experience but is full of character and the best way to experience Marrakech! So full of atmosphere and the owner was always helpful and honest about the surroundings.. we couldn't have survived without him! The hotel evening food was very good quality particularly the fish but they were not so well set up for breakfast and lunch.    We went as two young females on a city break; we were slightly out of our depth in Marrakech and were completely intimidated by our surroundings! We found the haggling quite aggressive and were shocked at the high prices.    We did go out one night to the newer part of Marrakech with large commercial hotels; we were much more relaxed in this area but there isn't an ounce of culture. We joined a larger group of women and it became a completely different experience - I would suggest visiting with a group of friends as we could not relax outside of the hotel. I would recommend this hotel but probably wouldn't return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G-in-Hertfordshire
Riad Karmela,Cider_with_rosie wrote a review Dec 2013,50,An Oasis of Karmela,I have no doubt that our week's stay in Karmela rosied our view of all of Morocco. From the free upgrade and mint tea which welcomed us to the polite friendly and helpful staff that made each moment of our stay enjoyable a special note of thanks to Siad & Kamal.    I could wax lyrical all day about the attention to detail in all the beautiful bedrooms rooftops and communal areas or tell you about the finest orange juice and the strongest coffee in the the world with breakfast but then you wouldn't have the best surprise of your life when you visit and who am I to take that away from you...    While the Riad is in a great location within the Medina do not pass up the offer of a €15 transfer from the airport or €7 from the Supratour Bus Station as like any other Riad in Marrakech you will NOT find it on your own.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cider_with_rosie

Riad Karmela,Nick W wrote a review Dec 2013,50,A very enjoyable week in the middle of the city,Our first visit to Morocco and we wanted to stay in a traditional road in the centre of the city. The riad arranged the pick up from the airport (necessary due to the otherwise very difficult task of locating the road when you first arrive). The drive itself was an experience of its own through alleys and streets barely wide enough for the car let alone the people walking and trading in them. Our welcome was comprehensive and friendly and our room comfortable. If you choose to eat there then the meals are excellent. We also enjoyed a traditional Hammam scrub and massage there again with very friendly staff. Overall a very enjoyable stay and a place we would happily recommend to others.

Riad Karmela,Caroline T wrote a review Nov 2013,50,A lovely place to stay,We stayed here for 3 nights. Having read others' reviews I emailed the hotel - just the day before travelling - to ask for their taxi to meet us at the airport. They replied instantly: good service we thought. The pick-up did not work perfectly as the taxi-driver was not there to meet us: fortunately I was able to email them from my phone. Again the hotel responded instantly and all was well. I very much doubt if we would ever have found the hotel without their driver's services as it is very well concealed. But when he arrived and for the rest of our stay the driver was immensely helpful as was everyone at the Riad. On entering it we were settled down offered excellent mint tea and given a full and efficient briefing on Marrakech what to see and where to find it by Joel our host. We relied heavily on his advice during our stay and all his restaurant recommendations turned out well; though even with the benefit of his useful maps in 3 days we never learnt to navigate infallibly through the souks.    Like the Tardis the Riad Karmela is much bigger inside than looks possible from the outside. It is as everyone says really beautiful and peaceful with 3 interior courtyards a wonderful roof terrace with many many places to sit and relax and delightful decor. Our spacious room was charming and everything worked once we realised that certain lights had to be turned on for power points to function. We loved the main courtyard with its central pool and tables for breakfast and dinner and tortoises roaming around (need to watch where you're putting your feet!) The breakfasts and the one dinner we ate in the hotel were nice without being exceptional. At breakfast there is always a very good egg dish but you have to watch out for its appearance if you want to eat it while it's hot.    A delightful hotel that I would recommend and go back to.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineTSurrey
Riad Karmela,ms_Susanna wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Wonderfully peaceful oasis amidst the chaos of the city,We visited Marrakech for the first time in October 2013 and absolutely loved it with all it's extremes. We stayed 4 nights in Riad Karmela and have been recommending this lovely riad to everyone since our return back home.    We found our room beautifully decorated clean safe (with lock on door and a safe) and more importantly it truly is a calm oasis from all the hustle and bustle from the city with beautiful courtyards with comfortable sofa tortoises fountains and trees. The roof terrace is also huge and peaceful place to relax with a glass of wine and due to its size you never feel you're on top of any of the other guests.    The staff we were wonderful; we felt very well taken care of and help was always available in matters big or small. Before arriving we had e-mailed to arrange airport transfer meal at the riad due to our late arrival and twin beds. I got quick response and confirmation for all requests and all matters were taken care of on our arrival.    During our stay the staff also provided us with great induction to the city. We got great induction our first morning with instructions and a map how to find our way back to the riad as well as great tips on how to manage the hassle on the streets of the Medina and how much to expect to pay for things like local taxis. All very useful things for two females travelling together.    When you stay make sure you arrange to eat at the riad in the evening as one of the best meals we had in Marrakech was actually made by the Riad Karmela chef. We can also highly recommend the trips they arrange. We went on the day trip to Imlil on the mountains and had an amazing time - this was a genuinely authentic experience with a local guide enjoying the amazing scenery of the Atlas mountains and all this was crowned by lunch at the Berber village - it was incredible.    We can't wait to visit Marrakech again and will most certainly be staying at this Riad!,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ms_Susanna
Riad Karmela,Foodie_SO wrote a review Oct 2013,50,"Great location, hidden oasis",I stayed in the 5 person apartment for 4 nights with my family and fiancé. We really enjoyed our time here. We arranged the airport transfer through the Riad after reading the reviews here which was a very good idea. The taxi cannot go straight to the entrance as the Riad is off a small alleyway so it drops you as close as possible and a man greets you with a cart for your bags and takes you to the front door. If you have not been to Marrakech before it can be a bit daunting as there are lots of small shops and locals lining the streets it's hot dusty and noisy.    Once you step into the Riad it is like a whole different world! There is a beautiful central courtyard where you are invited to sit down given mint tea and biscuits whilst you are checked in. Joel the owner was very nice and talked us through a map of the city. He was very helpful with recommending local restaurants and making reservations if we needed.    The room itself was lovely and clean. It had plenty of character with lots of Moroccan trinkets on the shelves rugs on the floor and a pretty private terrace outside. You could also access the terrace where breakfast is served from here which is convenient.    Breakfast is continental - a variety of local pastries jams cheese cereal fresh orange juice yoghurt and fruit. There is also an omelette that is flavoured differently each day e.g. Cheese tomato onion. I thought there was enough not to get bored for the few days we stayed although there have been varying opinions of this. Unfortunately the ladies serving the breakfast are not the most charismatic of people and sometimes I felt like I was bothering them if something had run out and I was asking if there was more. This is not how it should be.    The terrace upstairs is lovely - lots of hidden areas for you to relax and unwind. It is so quiet despite being in the middle of so many buildings. One evening we were too tired to go out so we sat on the sofas shared a few cheese sandwiches from the bar menu (only other food choice is a tuna sandwich!) had some drinks and it was wonderful. The Riad also offers dinner (3 courses for 25 euros) but you have to tell them in advance. We did not eat there as we wanted to try other places.    Fantastic location - 10 minute walk to the main square Jemma El Fna. Took a day to get our bearings but then felt we knew where we were going!

Riad Karmela,JoeLawson1987 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Definitely stay here!,I can't exaggerate what an amazing little gem the Riad Karmela is. From the peaceful lobby where tortoises trot pass you paying you no attention at all to the rooftop top terrace where you can relax with a beer this is the perfect remedy to a day in the Medina. The staff are attentive the rooms stylishly decorated and beds extremely comfortable. However it's greatest quality? How quiet it is! It manages to make you feel that you could be anywhere and in Marrakech at the same time. This is a definite must for first-timers and regulars to Morocco. Finally just to say- let the Riad organise your taxis- not only from the airport but also for trips to the Atlas mountains- the drivers are safe friendly and good value.

Riad Karmela,Henry wrote a review Sep 2013,50,very spacious with excellent service,A big thank you to Riad Karmela  Firstly tho I WOULD SUGGEST GETTING THEM TO ORGANISE A PICK UP FROM THE AIRPORT as its really not that easy to find first off. Once you know where it is its fine tho. Positioned right at the top of the souks so great location to the attractions up there like maison photographic etc.  The Riad was beautiful and huge! it had a lovely roof terrace with lots of different areas to sit at so not always under peoples feet. There is even a hot tub hidden up there see if you can find it as we took a while :)  we were upgraded to the lovely suite Al Monsour which was a very generous size and had a bathroom i would like to replicate back in the UK.

Riad Karmela,Richard T wrote a review Aug 2013,50,An amazing oasis amongst the madness!!,Let me start by saying I am not what you would call an experienced traveller so maybe a Riad in the heart of Morocco old town was not a good start. What I can say is thank god that the reviews I had read did not lie.    Joel & Bouchra are brilliant hosts. Nothing is too much hassle. The food was fantastic the rooms were lovely.    there are so many little nooks and crannies to this riad I think half a day should be set aside jsut to explore this! The roof terrace is a beautiful place to while away the afternoons too.    If you are looking for the full Morocco experience then this Riad is perfect right in the heart of the Medina. The medina itself is as expected mental! Very busy a real travelers experience.

We were very glad of the guide to take us to the Riad as we would never have found it ourselves!! Stepping into the Riad was almost surreal as it was so peaceful beautiful and tranquil! We stayed in the Hassam room which was spacious comfy and clean. Initial I was a bit unsure as it opened up onto one of the ground floor patios but it was quiet and felt very private. The riad was beautiful and well maintained; the patios cool and relaxing so lovely with trees comfy seating and tortoises! The terraces split into different areas for relaxing sunbathing and eating.

Riad Karmela,mt_mosquito wrote a review Jul 2013,50,"Great people, location, beer. Highly recommended.",We decided to go to morocco for something different. My wife and I are experienced travelers and have been all over. This Riad was an exciting treat. It was in very good condition within walking distance to everything in he Medena and the staff made it that much more amazing. We stayed on the El Nour side of the Riad. It felt like our own private Riad. There is only a few rooms in that Riad keeping it quiet and seemingly to our selves. There is a pool on the terrace with plenty of seating and sunning areas. There are many lounge areas in the center court yard as well. They do serve alcohol at this Riad including a must have BEER. They also have wine and other spirits. All these can be charged to your room and paid at time of checkout (credit card or dirhams). They do serve a full course supper at the Riad but we took the quick want to the market every evening. There is only maid service on the El Nour side so all the amenities of Riad Karmela are at your disposal and you must go across a narrow alley to access the reception and drinks/food. There is a continental breakfast served from 8-10 on the Karmela side. You are welcome to hang-out on the Karmela side if you want to interact with people or just a change in scenery. We very much enjoyed having access to both a quiet more private side and having a few beers in the evening on the Karmela side.  The staff at Riad El Nour/Karmela were second to none. Very friendly and helpful with info about the city. They give you an into to the city when you arrive along with a map directions to important landmarks and mint tea.

Riad Karmela,BASILVER wrote a review Jul 2013,50,FAULTLESS,The summer weather had abandoned England. Morocco revelled in dry sun. British Airways had a SALE. A few days later and we were on our way! A taxi organised by the riad met us. We were welcomed by refreshing mint tea and a choice of rooms. We choose to stay in Karmela a room on the first floor which had a 6' wide firm double bed. Breakfast and dinner were served on the roof surrounded by high walls draped with bougainville in different hues. Oleanders (or you may prefer to call these fragrant flowers Nerines) in their large pots were watered early every morning by the nice gardener. In the space we choose for sun worship and reading there was a small pomegrant tree just by my head. We discovered that it was best to get to breakfast early; and that we could have boiled eggs to order instead of the omelette on offer. The fresh orange juice was outstanding. There were fresh fruits yoghurts lots of homemade jam (including fig) and honey pastries and the interesting Moroccan bread. The tea was Twinings Breakfast. What more could you want? In the extensive brochure in each bedroom there was mention of the Moroccan dinner served to order every evening priced at €20. In my opinion this is very undersold by the riad. At the suggestion of the owner whom I had contacted before arrival we had booked dinner on the first night. Unfortunately he forgot to tell the lady cook. It would not be unfair to say the first evening's dinner was not her best. The two that followed were outstanding. The cook remembers what you had the previous time and makes sure your next dinner is completely different. It is like having your own celebrity cook without the hassle! The Moroccan wines are reasonable priced at €12-14 a bottle. Bottled water is replenished in the room every day. Mint tea served with sweet (alas!) pastries is complimentary. The riad is spotlessly clean. The staff are outstanding in their willingness to help. We would stay again any time.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ramsgate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BASILVER
Riad Karmela,Chamsi D wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Best hotel in Marakesh,This is the best hotel in Marakesh. We arrived late at night and had no reservation. We tried to called many hotels some were full or did not have AC. We talk to the concierge and he pick us up because we were kind of lost in the Medina. The room we had was Rachid and we really enjoyed our stay over there. It is super clean well decorated and well managed. It is also a few minutes from jama el fna.

Riad Karmela,NicSyd2011 wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Tranquil escape from the craziness of Marrakech,We stayed at Riad Karmela for 3 nights in the Junior Suite Hassan. We had organised a transfer from the airport to the riad and th driver was friendly and helpful.    Driving the the streets of Marrakech and into the Medina was beautiful. As it was Ramadan there were a lot of people out on the streets eating and spending time with family.    As this was our first time in Marrakech arriving to the Medina was a little daunting as it was very busy. Stepping into the riad you are instantly calm and relaxed. As it was quite late in the evening we were offered a cold drink or mint tea and shown to our room.    Our room the Junior Suite Hassan was quite spacious and very cool (refreshing given it reached over 40 degrees Celsius during the day!). The decor was very traditional and beautiful. The bathroom was spacious and had a double sink. My only complaint would be is that there was no shower screen/curtain so water went everywhere when having a shower.    There was a fair selection of food for breakfast each morning with mainly Western food. We didn't have lunch there although did have dinner on the roof top terrace which was beautiful - a traditional Moroccan feast!    The riad is very close to the main square of Marrakech but can be a little tricky to find we did get lost a few times mainly out of frustration from the heat! The riad provide you with a great map but can be difficult to follow when it's 42 degrees!    Overall we had a great experience at the riad and all the staff were very polite and helpful and the service was always good.    Keep an eye out for the 2 pet tortoises in the central courtyard they are a treat! The courtyard became a great place to chill out by the pond and escape the heat and craziness of Marrakech.,Date of stay: July 2013,,"Sydney, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicSyd2011
Riad Karmela,Skelager wrote a review Jul 2013,50,You will love Riad Karmela!,This is a fantastic Riad placed in the middle of the Medina in Marrakesh and its a short but exiting walk away from Djema (La Place ). The hotel will pick you up from the airport and guide you to the hotel. You will feel so welcomed in this beautiful calm place and they will help you with everything.  Our luggage didn't arrive and the help we got from said and Joel was exceptional. They took us to the souk and helped us buy som clothes etc. called the airport for two days and finally took us to pick it up when it arrived.  The settings of the Riad is fantastic rooms and suites are beautifully decorated and there are so many cosy places to enjoy and relax in. On rooftop you can enjoy the sun eat breakfast and there's a little jacuzzi. ( my kids enjoyed that!)  I can not recommend this place enough. You will absolutely love it!

Riad Karmela,druid007 wrote a review Jul 2013,40,down the alley & turn right,This was our first trip to Marrakech. Used A2B for transfer to & from the air port . if i was going again would contact hotel direct & ask them to arrange a taxi if there two of you travelling the cost is the same it will save you time not having to do number of drop off on route.  The walk from the drop of point to the Raid was an amazing start to the trip ; you need to be guided to the hotel (they will also come get you for the return leg back to the airport).  The hotel was a quiet oasis in the middle of much madness. friendly staff room where clean & even had a complementary Hammam included in the price.  Had one evening meal was OK but expensive compared to the Moroccan cafes etc plenty of choices within a 10 minute walk  go toward Place Jammaa EL Fna via the spice market .  they could try and fix the spa  but wasn't a major issue far to much to do.  Went on one of the excursions to the Atals mountains  was good value & when it came to lunch we had the best Tajine on the entire holiday .. note this includes 2 hour + walking  starting at 1650 m  so air was getting a bit thin we both in our 50's and did struggle on one or two of the more challenging selection  but was well worth the effort  Hotel was a great base for a short visit to Marrakech,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swansea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/druid007
Riad Karmela,Ronandclaire wrote a review Jul 2013,50,A friendly Oasis,I have been to Marrakech a couple of times before and stayed in riads that were considerably more expensive than Riad Karmela.  We were delighted with our experience at Riad Karmela.  It is right in the centre of all madness that makes Marrakech so unique. so really easy to get everywhere and yet It really is a calm oasis to retreat to when you need a break.  The rooms and courtyards are well decorated and there is a lovely roof terrace to soak up some sun.  Joel and his team are so welcoming nothing was too much trouble they even provided my niece with a pair of trainers when she discovered she had forgotten to pack hers!  We used the riad to organise day trips for us to Essouira and to the Atlas mountains. Both trips were fantastic and represented good value for money. Mohammed our driver on both trips was charming and a really good safe pair of hands on the wheel which was most appreciated! Our trip to the Atlas mountains was particularly special as we had a guide to lead our hike which included lunch in his home in a small berber village with delicious food and a view of the mountains to die for !  The dinners we had at the riad were also delicious and so relaxing sitting on the roof terrace away from all the frenetic activity outside!  All in all I would definately recommend Riad Karmela and would like to thank Joel and his team for helping to make our trip so memorable.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronandclaire
Riad Karmela,HayleyHR wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A Peaceful Retreat,This was our first trip to Marrakech. We were led by our taxi driver through the alley ways of the medina towards Riad Karmela which is tucked away behind a small ornate wooden door. It is worth mentioning at this point that I am not sure we would have found the Riad on our own - highly recommend getting a transfer from the airport! The first thing to strike us as we entered the Riad was the sense of calm and tranquilty it really is a cool oasis set in the heart of the medina. We were welcomed by Bouchra who brought us mint tea and a plate of traditional Moroccon sweet treats before talking us through a map of the medina to help us to get our bearings. Riad Karmela is perfectly located a short walk from Jemaa el-Fnaa (the main square) and the souks. Our room was cool comfortable and nicely furnished. There are lots of places throughout the Riad to sit and chill out but if you want to lay out in the sunshine the best place to go is the roof terrace which has sun loungers and little areas tucked away to provide privacy. There is also a plunge pool up there which was needed after sitting in the 110 degree heat for an hour! We would highly recommend this lovely place and I am sure we will be back at some point in the future.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stowmarket, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HayleyHR
Riad Karmela,SMH23386 wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A true Oasis!,A wonderful Riad tucked away from the craziness that is amazing Marrakech. Our journey to find it on the first night was a true adventure but the best 'immersion' into Marrakech that we could have asked for - in all of it's hectic noisy glory. However once we entered the Riad it was like entering another very calm world. We stayed for 5 nights and was really lovely - the perfect place to come back to after busy Marrakech days.  The staff are all very friendly - highly recommend getting the 'welcome chat' with map local knowledge etc. And the location (once you get your bearings) is great - very close to the square and the souqs etc.  Our room was on one of the internal courtyards but perfectly quiet and very pretty and spotlessly clean.  We loved the breakfasts on the terrace too along with mint tea in the afternoon. Evenings spent on the roof terrace drinking wine were very special too.  Overall just a lovely place to stay.

After booking our trip we received a few emails from the Riad owner who was very helpful and organised for a driver to pick us up from the airport (would highly recommend). Once we arrived Kamal (one of the staff) sat us down to explain the area and how to get around while we casually sipped mint tea. Each morning we had our breakfast on the rooftop terrace which was a perfect way to start the day.

Riad Karmela,chris_ottokar wrote a review Jun 2013,30,Lovely riad but a good stay depends on the room you're in.,"My first impression of this place was disappointment as having reconfirmed our airport transfers a few days prior to our arrival we were left hanging around in the Arrivals Hall waiting for an hour. Eventually after a couple of phone calls it became clear to us that the hotel forgot we were coming and ended up sending a taxi to get us.  Our first night (of a 4-night stay) was then spent in an underwhelming room (Hasna) that smelt slightly musty and airless - it was depressing as this didn't feel like the ""superior"" room we had booked. The shower water-bar became so hot that my partner burnt himself accidentally touching it.  After complaining we were moved the following day to a Junior Suite (Al Mansour) which was wonderful! This changed the whole atmosphere of our stay and it was all incredible from then onwards. The courtyard is so beautiful and relaxing and tranquil you could enjoy just holing up here without wanting to go out at all.  Breakfast is included but is quite basic and almost ""continental"" - okay but nothing special.  Overall a lovely hotel but some rooms are better than others.",Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris_ottokar
Riad Karmela,finleo wrote a review Jun 2013,40,a second visit with a few minor upsets,This was my second time at Karmela following a holiday in 2011. I was very excited to come back and experience the Riad once more this time with my partner as I had a fantastic time and agree full with the below reviewers in terms of the atmosphere design and friendliness. It really is a jewel especially given the immediate area is not the nicest in Marrakech.    Sadly we didn't get off to the best start as it seemed we had been forgotten at the airport and had to phone twice (from a UK mobile-not cheap!) to be collected. The owner apologized saying there had been some confusion. We eventually were an hour after landing. Despite booking a superior room we were given Hasna which was a bit stuffy and quite small (bizarrely designed with the bathroom the same size as the bedroom!). When I inquired about this I was promised an upgrade the following day as they were full at the time. All's well that ends well... almost.  On the morning of check out I was showering and hadn't realized how hot the shower unit can become and as a result suffered quite a nasty burn to my upper arm that led to an hour on ice before being able to leave. Not good.    We did get upgraded to Al Mansour a gorgeous room and in fact the one I stayed at in 2011 and had a lovely stay in the end but I can't help thinking that the really great reviews lead to some complacency.

Riad Karmela,JohnBurrows wrote a review Jun 2013,50,A beautiful oasis in the bustling city of Marrakesh,We have just returned form a 4 night stay at Riad Karmela in Marrakesh. I cannot praise highly enough the welcome given by all the staff and the high standard of accomodation. A top tip is to arrange transport from the airport to the Riad we used A2B who were very efficient. Once we had arrived it was a pleasant change not to have to fill in forms at the reception instead the owner himself sat with us as we sipped mint tea and explained the locale and best areas to visit. Each day we took breakfast on the rooftop terrace which has a commanding view over the Marrakesh Medina itself and even extends to the Haut Atlas mountains. The Riad staff arranged for us to spend a day treking including a delicious meal in a private home in the mountains.  The experience of Riad Karmela exceeded all of my expectations and is an absolute jewel in the vibrant and exciting city of Marrakesh.

Riad Karmela,Beeton wrote a review Jun 2013,40,Wonderful Welcome,We stayed at Riad Karmela for four days in May. The welcome was faultless and the large tastefully decorated rooms and amenities excellent. The riad is an oasis of calm well located for access to the main medina (7 mins) and to the museum. Dinner on our second night was delicious served in the lovely courtyard surroundings. Breakfast on the roof terrace (or downstairs courtyard if damp) was very good. The riad is a bit off the beaten track so would recommend that you take advantage of the airport transfer...saves a lot of hassles. Only real downside is for those keen to remain connected they will be disappointed - the Wi-fi was patchy at best.

It´s very close to Jemaa el Fna and everything you want they can organise for you. We had a magical and delicious dinner with a delicious threecourse meal moroccan musicians and artists on the gorgeous roof terrace that was nothing less than perfect. Very reasonably priced as well.

Riad Karmela,Super_Scientist wrote a review May 2013,50,"A beautiful, peaceful riad in a wonderful location",My stay at Riad Karmela was absolutely wonderful what a serene and beautiful haven away from the bustling city outside! The location was perfect less than 10min to walk to Djemaa el-Fna and hardly any walk at all into the souqs – you really felt as if you were right in the middle of it all! During our check in we were given a map with 2 recommended routes to Djemaa el-Fna that we used and found very helpful. Everyone says in Marrakech you will get lost and not be able to find your way around but we didn’t once get lost or have trouble finding the riad!    On the first night we arrived a little later in the evening and had the 3 course meal offered in the riad which was delicious and a lovely way to start our holiday. Our room was lovely we had junior suite Zorah which was perfect for 3 friends. The only minor issue and this is VERY minor is that the lock on the inside of the bathroom door didn’t work (wasn’t a problem for us at all it pulled closed). Speaking of locks for anyone who has read past reviews or is concerned about locks on rooms: there was a bolt on both the inside and outside of our suite and there was a padlock for the outside for when we went out. There was also a safe in the room that we used and we had no problems at all. The suite was clean and very well decorated we all loved it. We had views over one of the 3 courtyards in the riad luckily it didn’t seem to be used at all so it was lovely and quiet all trip. There are also many roof terraces that are definitely worth spending some time at. Breakfast was served up there in the sunshine and some of the spaces had sun loungers which were ideal for a few hours’ relaxation before going out to dinner. There is a small terrace which just about sat 3 people up some slightly hidden stairs that gives the most spectacular views over the city!    All of the people working at the riad were friendly and helpful. They helped us organise an excursion to the Atlas mountains we cannot recommend it highly enough! We chose their Imlil trip: the driver was very friendly and let us stop to take photos (the views were amazing); the guide was great and led us on a 1.5 hour walk into the mountains that included a stop at a waterfall; we had a berber lunch in the guide’s house with some of the tastiest food we had all trip! We also arranged a hammam and scrub at the riad which was a fantastic way to relax.    An added bonus came on the last day: one of the girls in our party became very sick and after a night of barely any sleep we were allowed to keep our room past the checkout time of midday until 4pm when our airport taxi was due. Bouchra and Joel also gave us some rehydration and anti-sickness medicine which was very kind of them and my friend was able to use this extra time to rest. We can’t thank them enough for all their help at this time we are very grateful.    Overall Riad Karmela was the perfect place for us to spend 4 nights in Marrakech we absolutely loved the place and cannot recommend it highly enough!

We would sometimes order a glass of wine late in the afternoon and it was served with delicious olives nuts and other things to nibble on. Orientation on arrival was great together with a clear and accurate map and their lovely driver even took a group of us for a day trip to Essouira! Perfect! We even had wonderful foot massages from the in house masseurs at the end of a big day of walking! We had a slight misunderstanding while we were there about the cost of something but this could have happened anywhere and did not detract from the overall stay.

Tucked away in a tiny tunnelled street in the Medina you would never know it was there. Take the offered transport from the hotel or you will never find it! After going through a tiny door it opens out into the most amazing space. It is three Riads together and has about 15 rooms. The courtyards are delighful tastefully furnished and well attended. The feeling of tranquility is just perfect after the hectic hustle and bustle of the Medina. The only down side for us was that we had problems with the hot water and the bed was a bit hard but to be honest it would not put me off in any shape or form. We would love to come back! Try the Hamam it was great. The staff were really helpful. Joel the owner definitely knows the places to go and the Riad organise all the transport which makes life very easy.

Riad Karmela,Alice W wrote a review Apr 2013,50,Fantastic place to stay - definitely recommended!,I came to stay at Riad Karmela for three nights with my mother and we both LOVED it! The Riad is an absolute gem - it has everything you need the staff are incredibly helpful and is generally a blissful place to relax.    We stayed in a twin room immediately off the main courtyard which we initially thought would be a little noisy and too open - however it turned out to be neither of these at all. The room has been very thoughtfully designed with various curtains blinds and shutters that you can use to adjust the level of privacy and lighting you prefer. Everything was clean and beautifully furnished with lots of nice little touches - the daily bottle of water and bowl of dates was appreciated! The water in the bathroom was gloriously hot and the shower was fantastic.    The outdoor areas were similarly wonderful. The design of the Riad allows for lots of cosy seating areas so that you could happily curl up with a book in peace (along with a pot of mint tea and some pastries of course!). The whole design is perfect and everything has been considered - there are even books board games and old photo albums to look at if you run out of things to do. It was a bit too windy to sit up on the terrace but it looked beautiful - I shall have to come back when the weather is warmer!    Breakfast was good especially the freshly-squeezed orange juice. We also has dinner in the Riad one evening which I would definitely recommend. The food was authentic and totally delicious - our favourite meal of the trip.

Riad Karmela,FUDGE_BROWNIE85 wrote a review Apr 2013,50,A Riad full of character!,The Riad Karmela is a fantastic hotel full of character. We stayed as a group of young 6 girls and loved our time there (End of March 2013). We sorted transfers with the hotel before we left England and we had Kamal pick us up. This is recommended as taxi's can't get to the hotel as it is located within the heart of the old town. The hotel is in a great location 10 mins walk from the main square and markets (suks) hidden within the alley ways of Marrakech.    On our arrival we were served peppermint tea with Moroccan sweets and our luggage was taken to our rooms for us. Then we were given fantastic information about what to do/not to do in Marrakech e.g. not let local boys guide you to places and how much discount to get for items at the markets. The hotel made suggestions for us on using a spa going to a Water Park (A MUST!) and places to eat. We even had restaurant door man walk us to and fro late at night back to the Riad.    The hotel were very good at arranging our taxis to places and our pick ups as well. It made our holiday stress free. Any thing used by the hotel was paid at the end of our stay we didn't need to pay upfront for using their own taxis.    Rooms were clean. Fresh towels were provided and beds made each day. Cleaners are friendly too! We had two rooms which were opposite each other. Rooms had a hairdryer too. Between both rooms we had a little court yard with sofas. This was lovely when we wanted to relax after a busy day out. Rooms have a safe and rooms are locked with a padlock. Room has air con but we weren't able to get hot air when it became chilly at night.    Breakfast was continental....fresh orange juice toast english tea coffees cornflakes jams and hot food such as omelettes and pancakes served. It was lovely to see the two pet tortoises out for breakfast too.    The hotel has a lovely roof top terrace with gorgeous sun loungers and sofas. It was lovely to chill out after a walk in the square or to soak up the heat. The hotel very kindly also gave us extra peppermint tea as we loved it so much - complimentary.    As a group of 6 we wanted to enjoy the nightlife in the new town so the hotel organised for us to go with Kamal. He took us to the best clubs and shisha bars in Marrakech. Great choices of clubs!    At the Riad we could also change our money at a good rate.    Great hotel would return again in the future.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FUDGE_BROWNIE85

Riad Karmela,Franco Z wrote a review Mar 2013,40,"simple with style, lovely staff, very good price, good restaurant, interesting position in the heart of the old town",This riad is at the end of an amazing small street - even smaller dead end alley - even smaller kind of covered alley (almost a corridor o my god where are we going?) experience. Amazing and intriguing (and as far as I could say safe).  Situated in the heart of the old town the first day you'll probably get lost trying to come back from the main square. This is probably the only inconvenience you'll experience because once understood where to turn (in fact it's easy) you will appreciate the location of this hotel. Some hundred meters from the main square just on the other side of the souk.  The contrast is strong between the area around the hotel very messy and decadent (but very interesting for a few days) and the interior of the riad where the only sound is the gurgling of the fountain while you are taking a tea in one of the courts (the main one with the orange trees was my preferred). No real luxury but the right decoration. You really feel the atmosphere of a wealthy merchant's house at the feet of the Atlas (snow capped) at the edge of the desert. The staff was very very kind. The restaurant is good. Do not miss the green tea (3-4 a day was the average any excuse was good) with the little local sweets (delicious not too sweet and very tasty the best I could find in town). The hammam of the hotel seems good (I didn't try it) for sure the massages are great (and cheap).  We used this hotel in January for 3-4 days and It was a perfect accommodation to see the town and run the half-marathon. Great place for a great town (particularly in January escaping the winter) just consider that the taxi has to stop 50-100 meters from the hotel (book the transfer from the airport with the hotel it is cheap and reliable) if this is not a problem for you I would really recommend this riad!,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"The Hague, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancoZ895

We made a great choice as we arrived in Marrakech and it was very busy and a little scary at first........We were taken to our Riad and instantly you were in a tranquil beautiful setting which instantly relaxed. The team that worked at the Riad including Joel were very helpful at advising us good places to visit and tips on what to do and not do while in Marrakech.........We loved sitting up on the roof terrace in the afternoons sipping G&T's after a hectic morning exploring the markets etc......We also had a fantastic traditonal Hammam and massage one afternoon which I would highly recommend.

He arranged the airport transfer and on our arrival and throughout our stay he was patient thoughtful and a great help to us. He assisted us with our plans for each day booking great restaurants tour guides transport horse & carriage trips Hammans and Massages etc etc. He went out of his way to make it a wonderful stay. (There were 10 of us so that's a lot of people to satisfy...which he did ...with ease!)  We stayed in the Petite Karmela which was just perfect for our group with our own little courtyard to sit chat sip wine or mint tea and discuss the day's adventures amongst friends! The airport transfer (arranged by Joel) was efficient and the driver (Mohammed) very knowledgeable and friendly. The food and wine at the Riad was great (Also lovely touch of a birthday cake for desert!).  We had fun exploring and did not struggle too much with finding our way around....Joel explains this very well and the map is sufficient. I believe the location is just right and could not fault it.

Riad Karmela,Jill J wrote a review Feb 2013,50,Wigan Ladies On Tour,We arrived in the warm sunshine at Marrakech Airport. We were collected by the transport provided by the Riad Karmela. After a short journey to the Riad we offloaded our luggage onto a cart and were escorted to the Riad through the bustling streets. There were many sights to see on our journey but these only added to the cultural experience of Marrakech.    When we arrived at the Riad were we given a warm welcome - along with mint tea! Joel took time to explain how we could get the best out of our stay and was able to recommend some excellent restaurants. We had our first meal in the Riad itself. The dining room area was very tranquil in keeping with the rest of the accomodation. The interior was beautiful with lots of different things to look at- including the tortoises! All of the staff were very welcoming and we really enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice at breakfast time. The Riad was very clean.    When going out on to the streets it does take a little time to adjust to the hustle and bustle but once you become used to it you realise that it s part of the culture that makes Marrakech.    We would definitely stay at the Riad Karmela should we return to Marrakech.

Riad Karmela,Kazzo11 wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Glad we found this lovely friendly Riad,We are three girls who go away each year for a long weekend break somewhere interesting and nowhere quite compares to Marrakech! We were lucky to find and book the Riad Karmela and would definitely stay there again. Joel the owner and his staff were very friendly and helpful. The Riad has a lovely courtyard/dining area with a fountain and 2 little tortoises wandering around and colourful bids fluttering amongst the orange trees. The breakfasts were great and the evening meals absolutely delicious. The wine was among the best we had ever tasted. There are lots of little nooks and crannies with comfy sofas where you can sit and have a glass of wine or just to sit and chat or read. The rooftop terrace was spacious with different seated sections where you can relax and it had great views to the Atlas mountains. All rooms are different sizes and designs. The Riad is tucked away in a little maze of alleys but once you get a map it is very easy to find your way around to the Medina and other local places of interest. Taxis can be ordered to pick you up just around the corner if you want to go further afield. Nothing was too much trouble and the restaurants we were recommended to try out were amazing. I would definitely recommend the Karmela to anyone who wants good service and a peaceful location to stay which is close to the Medina. The only downside for me was that someone picked up my favourite black jacket that I had left on a chair maybe not knowing who to return it to - so if that person is reading this I would be so grateful if you could return it to me I truly would and I will happily pay the costs.

Riad Karmela,felicityjg1 wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Gorgeous peaceful haven in the midst of the Medina,"Riad Karmela is initially quite difficult to find. However the taxi that we had ordered via the Riad was waiting at the airport and it was a short drive and a short walk from where the car was parked. The courtyards of the hotel are beautiful. The main one filled with orange trees. It must be absolutely amazing in the summer - in January despite the gas heaters the room was a bit cold - but an extra layer of clothes was all it needed. We saw 2 bedrooms as in our first the heating wasn't working and we were moved. Our second room had windows onto the main courtyard. The rooms were both lovely and there was masses of hot water in the shower. The beds we found a little hard but this did not stop our sleeping soundly.    Trips and outings can be arranged directly from the hotel and everything charged to the bill. Our trip to the Atlas mountains cost only €15 each and was a whole day out! The owner of the hotel is a wonderful person to ask about how to ""manage"" Marrakech. All the staff were exceptionally friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble. There is a delightful roof terrace - again in summer this would be a lovely place to spend some time. But even in Winter there were awnings to protect you from the slightly cold breeze. The Breakfast is more than adequate. Fresh fruit - the best freshly squeezed orange juice I have ever tasted really fresh French Bread cheese yoghurts and an egg dish. This is taken in the first courtyard.    On our last night we decided to eat in the hotel. You book in the morning and you eat what the chef has prepared! Our meal was a delightful mix of Moroccan salads followed by a chicken tagine and then a lovely dessert. This ended with some delicious mint tea (normally served very sweet - but we asked for it to be made without sugar!) and some ""petit four"" we took these to sit by a wonderful log fire.    This is a delightful place to stay in the middle of Marrakech and proved to be very convenient for everything we wanted to see and do.

Riad Karmela,MatureCouple_C wrote a review Jan 2013,30,Nice hotel but location is a problem,The hotel is very nice rooms are large the staff was helpful and breakfast was very good. However travelers should be aware that this hotel's location may be a problem. It is in a maze of unmarked alleyways 500 meters from the furthest point that any car can drive and that point is only reachable by driving a long distance through other narrow alleys. In fact most taxis would not even attempt to drive there and when we did find one at high price he could not get that near. The hotel is a 15 minute walk from the main Place Djemaa el-Fna through many souks. The first day or 2 it is difficult to find one's way through these alleys. As soon as one stops to look at a map or get one's bearings one is accosted by a local offering to lead you to your hotel always for a fee and usually with a stop at his relative's shop. Note also that there are very few restaurants near the hotel and that it is not in the best part of the Medina although the city is safe. For anyone not looking for such adventures I would advise staying either close to the main Place or in the new city.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatureCouple_C

Riad Karmela,jp4hm wrote a review Jan 2013,30,Very beautiful Riad but one or two niggles.,The location of this Riad is difficult to find and on a gruelling hot day you can find yourself frustrated before you've even set foot through the door. Once you duck down through the tiny door walk past reception and into the courtyard those feelings melt away as you are greeted by an oasis of calm. The dipping pool colourful decor two cute tortoises and the mint tea that is served to you make you forget in an instant about the ordeal you've just had getting to the Riad.    Check in was swift and the suite was just as impressive as the rest of the Riad (especially with the upgrade). The air conditioning was on full and greatly appreciated and we were left alone (with no room key) to explore. The only gripe about the room was the shower. There were two temperatures scalding and freezing and there appeared no way to stop it cycling through the two of them.    On arrival we were given a map of Marrakech and given some verbal directions on how to make our way to the medina and Jemaa el Fna. It seemed straight forward enough until making the journey. With all of the tiny alleyways it was very easy to take a wrong turn. The 10-15 minute walk once you get your bearings is exhausting in the sun and you find yourself sticky and irritated. Ignore all the locals telling you the way to 'the square' they all appeared to be lying.    The service given by the male waiters was first class always very polite helpful and attentive. The females not so much they seemed to act as if you were in there way all the time.    Breakfast was disappointingly poor a few stale bread products very unappetising looking fruit and fly covered preserves were on display. The butter milk and yogurts were not kept cool properly and this was the case on all three mornings we were there. The two female staff members seemed uninterested on anything other than each other and there mobiles and came across as being impolite. We found ourselves just having tea and coffee and skipping the food. Breakfast was probably the worst feature of the Riad and I cannot understand why it is not better. We understand that the soaring temperatures and climate make it difficult to keep food fresh but breakfast is the one time of day you need to eat and we felt more effort should have been made.    We booked an evening meal twice in the Riad and both times it was absolutely superb. Would recommend anyone staying to try it at least once. The attention to detail was absolutely fantastic which is most likely why the breakfast seemed so very poor in comparison.    To summarise we enjoyed our stay here it was very beautiful. If the few negative points above were to be rectified then the stay at this Riad would have received a higher rating from us. All the points raised could be easily addressed by the owners.,Date of stay: June 2012,,Coventry,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jp4hm

Riad Karmela,sjhHove wrote a review Jan 2013,40,A very good traditional riad in the heart of the old town,Situated in the middle of the old town the Riad Karmela is quiet and peaceful after the hussle and bussle of the medina. The building is set round a series of open courtyards with comfortable sofas and chairs orange trees a fountain and lots of greenery as well as a couple of tortoise and a few birds. The courtyards are covered over in winter (November to May) with transparent sheeting to keep the rain off and the heat in. We stayed over New Year and there were open fires and heaters at night around the public rooms. Upstairs there is a lovely roof terrace to relax in the sun. Our bedroom (Samira) was pleasantly decorated with a large rug on the floor a comfortable but firm divan bed and pillows and a small safe. The air conditioning system provides extra heat at night. The bathroom was not heated but the water is really hot and there is a good hairdryer. Shampoo soap and shower gel are provided. You may want to bring a shower cap as the overhead shower rose is fixed. The bedrooms all open out onto the courtyards with wrought iron screens over the windows as well as shutters and curtains. There are padlocks on all the doors. Breakfasts are excellent with delicious coffee fresh orange juice breads spreads and a different omelette each day. We had one dinner in which was delicious and good value. There is also a hamman in the Riad which we didn't try but fellow guests said was very good. Joel is a good host clearly explaining how to navigate your way through the souks and giving advice on restaurants and cafes to try. The staff are very friendly and helpful and speak a mix of French or English.

When we arrived we were given lovely mint tea in front of the fire while we did the checkin formalities. We stayed in the Fatima room which has a very firm double bed and a single at the end of the long room a small hallway with wardrobes and a small safe and the bathroom with a big brass shower head over the big shower (no bath which is fine for us) basin and toilet. Because the riads are built for the heat the bedrooms are a little cool in the winter months - there is a reverse cycle airconditioner that can heat the room but the bathroom is a bit chilly - ask for a fluffy bathrobe if you didn't bring one and don't forget slippers. There is no direct access to the outside from your room as most of the rooms open out onto the covered courtyards. While we were there a special dinner was put on for all the guests on Christmas Eve - traditional dancing and music as well as a very nice dinner and drinks. We went for a massage and then a few days later went for a hammam and then a massage - I'd suggest the hammam and then massage as it really works a lot better. I managed to get a dose of bronchitis while we were there and the manager arranged for a doctor to come that evening as I was feeling pretty bad and had to fly the next day. Overall excellent service and I'd recommend staying in this lovely riad.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelbourneDoug
Riad Karmela,Christophe216 wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Riad Karmela,It was an amazing trip in Marrakech. The Riad Karmela is a very peacefull and beautiful place just in the full center of the Medina. If you want to be completly involved in the city and share le real life of the people living there it's a very good choice. 5 minunte walk from the Djeema famous place. We staid there 6 days the first days were scary for us due to the people asking us all the time money for this or for that. But after 24h you should feel more better and you will enjoy. Don't accept any help from somebody or you will have to pay something. They seem to be helpfull but they want just your money ;) (it's like that and you have to know...). Riad Karmela is a very good choice. Enjoy !,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Marseillan, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christophe216

Riad Karmela,Jen_H0ngK0ng wrote a review Dec 2012,40,The best part of Marrakech,Honestly I wont recommend anyone to stay in the 'old town' during your visit. I think Marrakech is a dangerous place to go by your own unless you have a group of 5+. It might be OK.  Fortunately I found this peaceful raid online my hubby and I like this Riad a lot. It is the only comfortable and safe place in this 'maze' (old town).  In the first night we stayed in a small old room which isn't comfortable at all. The room was cold and smelly. So we requested for a change of room. The manager was very helpful he checked the vacancy and immediate swapped the room for us. We were so impressed.  The riad offered lovely continental breakfast I really enjoy the fresh orange juice everyday. The places outside the riad is a chaos so my hubby and I preferred to come back earlier and enjoyed our drinks and snack here. The atmosphere in the raid is romantic and with detailed Moroccan decorations. We love it!!  I would recommend Riad Karmela to all of you if you really want to stay in the old town.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jen_H0ngK0ng

Riad Karmela,mav75 wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Excellent service..beautiful riad!!!,Disclaimer: I was not in Riad karmela but in its sister riad which is just opposite.However the breakfast check in check out is in riad karmela.  I was here with my dad for 2 days but we liked it so much we extended our stay by another day. First about the riad we were upgraded to a better room (though i forget the name) and the room was very beautiful and authetically decorated. The tranquility and authentic decor in riad (karmala and its sister riad) couldn't be in more contrast with its surroundings. Joel gives an excellent info session when you check in to explain the surroundings and how to get about. I think this is of utmost importance.  While we did have some minor problems like clogged bathroom patchy wireless or low water pressure ..wherever possible our issues were dealth with swiftly and immediately and the service was no less than a 5 star. (ofcourse it helps if you keep in mind that you cant expect marrkech to have same infrastructure as a western city and so theres nothing the riad can do about certain things) We left early mornings before the start of their breakfast and they always gave us breakfast spread early in morning or a packet on last day for our journey onward. We really appreciated that.  the only negative about the room which I can think of is the room seemed to be dimly lit. Bascially we had a bed area and a sitting area and there was no light in the sitting area and the bed area light wasnt enough for the size of the room.    We also did a tour of essouira with the riad. The vehicle was very comfortable..very safe driver and the price seemed to be correct so highly recommend any excursions with the riad.    I think it is pertinent to mention a word about its location. First of all dont even bother trying to get their on your own. Seriously!! book their cab. Second dont be afriad of the surroundings..the riad is really very good once you go inside. While many wont be used to such surroundings it is very safe except for boys wanting money to show you directions so just ignore them. Third you do need a good sense of orientation to move around..if you are here for longer time you should be fine in a day or two once you are familiar with the area. The main square is about 10 - 12 mins walk from the riad but you pass thru various souks so its not a boring walk.    Tip: The riad had the best exchange rate for Euros/GBP to dirhams during our whole trip in Morocco!! so exchange the bare minimum at airport and the rest in riad. Also you can pay them in Euros/GBP.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mav75
Riad Karmela,ladynix wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Excellent place to stay...,Everything about the Riad Karmela is ideal. It is in an excellent location good decent rooms gorgeous roof terrace (make sure you go up for sunset the views are wonderful) beautiful inside and nice pleasant staff. I found Joel's introduction regarding finding your way around the medina essential and an excellent idea. We booked a driver to pick us up from the airport not something I would usually do because I enjoy the challenge of finding places - if I hadn't though I don't think I would have ever found it so it is advisable! My partner and I booked a massage which was excellent and very relaxing after a long day of bartering in the souks! Don't stay at this Riad if you want 5 star luxury hotel standard Hilton-style accommodation - this is not what staying in the Medina is about. If you want to stay in a generic hotel that looks like every hotel in the world then book the Ibis in the new town. If you want a genuine authentic trip to Marrakech then stay at Riad Karmela.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladynix
Riad Karmela,Alex C wrote a review Dec 2012,50,The Marrakesh experience,The contrast between the busy Medina and the quiet oasis that is Riad karmela is the point of staying here. We have just spent our first ever visit here and the professional attitude of the staff is exemplary. We had an excellent dinner on our first night which turned out to be the best food we had on our trip.

Riad Karmela,alanna s wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Sanctuary,Myself and my Mum stayed for 3 nights at the start of December. Beautiful Riad with real character in every room and a wonderful roof garden. Real oasis away from the noise and buzz of the city. Highly recommend eating at Karmela- we had 2 dinners there which were 3 courses of fantastic Moroccan cuisine; the vegetable pastilla and lamb tagine were particularly excellent. The wine is local and also very good. The staff were fantastic and always keen to help. We also had a massage at the Riad which was great value and very relaxing. Once you work out the route (which isn’t difficult- but do pay attention to the map and don’t listen to the locals directing you) it is less than ten minutes to the main square. Fantastic stay for anyone looking to be in the heart of Marrakesh and I hope to go back in the summer.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alannas_11

Riad Karmela,WestLondonNic wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Beautiful Riad!,"We stayed in Marrakech in ""winter"" (although as a Brit this was close to our Summer!). I would recommend going in November as the weather is pleasant (around 24-26 degrees at our stay) and not too hot to cover up.    The Riad was gorgeous- I felt completely relaxed there. Upon arrival the owner Joel sat down with my sister and I and gave us a very informative chat and map mapping out local sites of interest and which roads to stick to and avoid. The Riad is in a great location for those who are adventurous enough to venture in the souks and Place Jemaa el Fna do not stay here if you are looking for a resort holiday- there are resorts further out in Marrakech with busses into the old town if you want that. The Riad will give you a sense of what the real Marrakesh is about as it is so close to the souks and Place Jemaa el Fna.    You can book many trips from the Riad and join up with other residents to make the trip cheaper. The Atlas Trip was great we felt very welcome by eating in with a Berber family and the views were beautiful. The owners are very knowledgeable about the city and are very friendly towards everyone.    We didn’t eat dinner at the Riad as there are so many local restaurants but we heard good reviews from others staying there. The breakfast was good and in such a beautiful setting under orange trees in the courtyard.    The staff in the Riad were also brilliant- they always had time to sit with you to give you their recommended places of interest.    I would really recommend this Riad for its location great value for money and the staff.",Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestLondonNic
Riad Karmela,ThirzaChris wrote a review Dec 2012,20,Do not recommend,"I recently visited Marrakech staying at Riad Karmela - I was disappointed all round! Visiting Marrakech in winter isn't advisable as there isn't much to do much better to go during the summer when you can divide your time between the city & the pool.  We were excited to stay at Riad Karmela after reading such fabulous reviews but were very disappoint with the reality. It is a tired place with paint peeling off the wall in our unclean room very poor plumbing & disinterested staff. Our welcome was nothing like some of the others described in earlier reviews & when we asked questions/advice we got one word answers. The breakfast is incredibly basic & the ladies who serve it are really quite rude - we felt on a few occasions that we were putting them out but asking them (eventually) for our pot of coffee which hadn't materialised on our table but had on others. We had dinner in the riad one evening which was okay but nothing special especially considering the price (€25 when you can eat an equally good meal in the Medina for €6).  We decided to take a trip to the Atlas Mountains & chose the excision to the water falls. We were told during the arrival chat that this was for people less keen on walking a short walk to the water falls & back to the village for lunch. BEWARE - it is a hike climbing up wet rocks up the side of a mountain with sheer drops & a local guy to help you! It was terrifying! I nearly fell at one point & when I asked our guide if there are accidents he replied ""often"". The only advice we had from the riad was not to wear flip flops... You need trainers if not proper gear!  When we left it was a happy moment though we were not so happy to see the bags we left with reception after check out for the morning placed right by the open main door! I also advise you to check you bill as we were overcharged (though it was sorted out when we flagged it).  Other things to point out - a big positive is mint tea is free & there is currently building work going on during the day.",Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThirzaChris
Riad Karmela,tobyjake wrote a review Nov 2012,10,Don't stay here!!,If ever you get the chance to visit Marrakech our advice is don't go. What a dump. Before we booked our trip we were advised to stay inside the Medina because that's where everything happens and we were going to love it . So we booked into the Riad Karmela. Big mistake.The Medina is filthy (take some old shoes because they will get ruined). Everyone is spitting all over the place and the food debris from the stalls is disgusting. We see that British Airways are advertising shopping trips to Marrakech - To buy what exactly? The Medina is full of shops selling absolutely useless tat. Things that you will take home and six months down the line you will be throwing them out. You will get better quality stuff at car boot sales. Look the stuff up on Ebay - it's the very same stuff but cheaper for a start and you won't have to go through the hassle of haggling with Moroccans! Or carrying it home.  Now for the Riad Karmela. Reading previous reviews we must have been staying at a completely different Riad! The Riad website looks very nice indeed - but will bear little resemblance to reality.  It's grubby tired and run on a shoe-string. The photograph of the breakfast table being lovingly prepared just does not happen. In reality there is a breakfast buffet on the terrace. Basically one small omelette ( heave worthy! ) to share with your fellow diners yoghurts orange juice and tea/coffee. That's it - apart from some pastries which were stale and hard and took an age to chew. Surprising - especially as this place is French owned and run. Also it is no exaggeration when we say that we could not get near the pots of jam for the flies and wasps which were completely swarming over and covering the pots. We gave up on the breakfast and just managed with coffee.  Dinner in the evening? Well unless you like tagine - forget it. The source of the food is the Medina and just walking through the Medina looking at the the various butchers/vegetable/fruit sellers etc and their complete disregard for refrigeration and food hygeine will put you off all food served within the Medina. From the second day of our holiday we took a taxi out to the Four Seasons and ate there. It's a pity we never stayed there. It would have been cheap in comparison as at least you got what you paid for ( and it was actually edible )  Midway through our holiday whilst we were out for the day the chamber maids came in to clean our room. One maid turned the tap on in the bathroom and was not able to get any water due the the many water outages which normally occurs here. She forgot to turn the tap off. When we arrived back at the room we found water pouring out from under our door. Our room was an inch deep in water. When the water was turned back on the tap in our bathroom started to flow the sink overflowed into the bathroom and that in turn flowed into our bedroom. It is by sheer luck that nothing of ours was on the floor at the time ( well if the floors were clean that would have been the case! ). The maids came up immediately to clear up but no one appeared to be bothered about it. The maids just laughed about it. It would have been nice for Joel (The manager) to apologise and ask if everything was OK and if anything of ours got damaged but he did not - we never saw him.  The roof terrace was acceptable in a dull light but again was VERY tired and grubby. The furniture was years old and weathered to hell. The so called jaccuzi/plunge pool was just horrific. We decided it wouldn't look out of place in a horror movie since it looked just like you would imagine 'human soup' to look like...although it did give us a laugh when we saw 'fresh' residents slip into it in the dull light of dusk without having a good look at the 'fluid' contained within. Just imagine a bath which 20 big sweaty men have just scrubbed up in - yes you know what I'm talking about. Also on a side note I would defo' not let children near it as the many concrete steps and different level surounding it are a real danger if a child slipped god knows what injuries it would sustain.  We found Joel to be the most unfriendly and surly hotel manager we have ever encountered.  In conclusion we found this place to be VERY very over rated and over priced for what you get. I would not recommend any one to visit this place.  On a plus side the Hamman is lovely - the staff were obviously ex 'Four Seasons' staff as they could actually smile.  If you are planning a trip to this city do yourself a favour - use another Riad or better still book into one of the big hotels outside the Medina and walk into the centre. One trip into the Medina is probably enough for most people anyway.  Also on the plus side since we now have first hand experience of the place - we'll be able to save other people the disappointment.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sidmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobyjake

Riad Karmela,Ruswel P wrote a review Nov 2012,50,An amazing place to stay in Marrakech,Hi    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RIAD KARMELA.    My wife and I stayed in Riad Karmela in Marrakech Morocco for five nights. At first I did an internet search in London and was amazed by how lovely this place looked but on arriving and seeing the real place I was even more surprised: Riad Karmela is a jewel an stunning place right in the heart of all of Marrakech's action the old part of town: the famous Medina. Riad Karmela is decorated in true and original Moroccan style so it has a very old and wonderful feel to it and yet with all the modern comfort you need to chill out. Wonderful suites beautifully decorated and with high ceilings quite spacious actually and with hot water all day long. And then lovely private open spaces where you can sit down and have a drink and relax including the super terrace with all its beautiful decor and private areas: because the terrace has like different separate bits where you can be totally private. And that is not all. Then you have the friendly staff always approachable and very helpful with any need or request you may have.  I don't want to mention names but I will have to mention three: Mr Said and Mrs Bouchra and of course the amazing and lovely Mr Joel: the nice and smart man behind Riad Karmela's success always available always there to make your stay more pleasant.    Riad Karmela can also organise trips for you on request including trips to the dessert with camel rides as well trips to the Atlas Mountains and Issauoira: a lovely seaside town where  you can have delicious fresh fish dishes and relax.    I hope my comment is helpful and I am sure if you decide to stay at Riad Karmela  you will enjoy as much as my wife Flavia and I did.    All our best wishes!

Riad Karmela,ScotlandJoe wrote a review Nov 2012,30,Ok stay,Just back from 4 night stay here. Nice riad with friendly manager.  Breakfast was included and there was a good range on offer though would be nice to get your own omelette as opposed to having to wait for 1 plate to appear for everyone to share!    Eating at riad  They offer a set dinner for 25e each but you need to book in the morning - we had this first night but the starter and main course was bland and tasteless but the dessert was lovely. Wine fairly priced for a restaurant at 16e but you can buy the same wine in supermarket for 3.5e if you just need a bottle to drink in room etc.  There was no facilities (or we were not aware) for any lunch or snacks from this riad which was annoying as there was not much choice nearby so they would probably do a good trade if they offered this as the riad was busy.    Area  The riad seemed to be in a quiet area of the north medina but was total nightmare going out as the stand holders hassled you (stand holders take note - total harassment = no sales) youths approached you all the time telling you were going the wrong way that street was closed etc etc - just lying to get money out of you - total pain!  Streets were grubby and cats and donkeys looked thin and downtrodden.  Never felt safe going out at night as lots of dodgy people hanging around and hassling you.    Food  Pretty awful! We were advised not to eat at stands in square by riad owner but passed one night and the stands were busy smelled divine and 80% of eaters looked European so cannot be that bad!    Shopping  The souks offer an amazing range of goods of excellent quality and we would truly have liked to look at leisure at all goods but constant hassle wore you down. We did manage to buy quite a few things and the craftsmanship of handmade goods was beautiful.    On our last day I had some minor (worth next to nothing) toiletries taken from a small bag from my room - even though we arranged with the manager to check out late from our room at 2 pm when I came back to room at around 11am the older maid was hanging around trying to get into the room - I let her in and she collected her bucket from our room after asking when we were leaving - she seemed pretty unfriendly. After this and when packing I noticed the small but essential toiletries missing - I don't know why these would be taken as they were worthless but very annoying and we hated the thought of these people rummaging through our stuff.    Would we stay here again?  No - a shame as the riad was nice but we disliked the area roundabouts and all the hassle.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burghead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScotlandJoe

Riad Karmela,jamerguk wrote a review Nov 2012,40,"Great location, beautiful Riad - top end of price range",I stayed for 2 nights with a friend for a visit to trek in the Atlas Mountains. Overall we thought the Riad was an excellent place to stay though it is at the higher end of the price range for Riads (read on to find out why). Below are some key points to help you.    Pros:  * Really friendly staff - wonderful welcome from Joel and all staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay  * Pick up service from the airport for approx 7 euros per person - hassle free arrival  * Great location - walking distance of the souk main square and other treats like Place des Epices where you can sit and snack watching the world go by  * Interior design is superb - clean comfortable lovely place to hang out  * Breakfast is excellent - good range of options fresh and good quality  * Quality of rooms is good - showers are fantastic (especially after a 2 day trek without proper washing!!)  * At night it's quiet and peaceful - quite amazing given how vibrant the souk is.  * You can organise tours and services like massages direct from the Riad - great if you want convenience.    Cons:  * It's at the high end of the price range for Riads due the quality so if you're budget travelling this is not the best option (expect to pay 100 Euros or more for a room)  * We were disappointed by the evening meal - 25 euros per person for soup basic tagine (chicken + potato) + dessert - we felt it was over-priced even though the restaurant area is lovely  * Wine was expensive (16 euros for a bottle) but given this is a Muslim country where alcohol is not widely available that's inevitable.  * Near a mosque so the morning azan can wake you up - however it's very hard to find anywhere central that isn't near a mosque something you need to accept when visiting a Muslim country so that's not a criticism of the Riad (and at night time the sound is wonderful as you relax on the rooftop terrace watching the sun set).    Would I stay here again? Yes. Why - I value friendly helpful people and really enjoyed my stay. Whilst I think the rooms are a little bit pricey I can't fault the quality of service and how relaxed and welcome everyone made me feel and knowing you'll get a peaceful night's sleep is important.

Having never been to Marrakech before we were surprised by how chaotic it was in the streets and admit to having been a bit concerned when we were led down a scruffy looking narrow street to Riad Karmela. However having gone through the door into the Riad was something akin to Alice in Wonderland - we couldn't believe it when we stepped inside as it could not have been more different to the world outside! It was total peace tranquility and calm which was a welcome relief to say the least! The rooms were beautiful and Bouchra spent time talking to us about gettng around where to eat/where not to eat and just generally giving us very useful advice.  The breakfasts were lovely and we ate at the Riad 3 times all of which were very good. I had a full body massage which was the best massage I think I've ever had just fantastic!

Riad Karmela,Brigitte C wrote a review Oct 2012,40,16 days at a recommendable Riad!,My mother (78) and I stayed in this very authentical Marrocan Riad for 16 days. We loved the place for its marvelous space the architecture and interior and the very nice staff. Our room was great the bathroom splendid and in the Riad (existing of 3 Riads together) are about 30 places to sit on the roofterrace downstairs in the houses and outside in the lovely patio's. It's a place you can get lost the first day although there are only 19 rooms! There were always very quiet spots to spend some time together with my mother when we came 'home' from a visit in chaotic but lovely Marrakesh. When we arrived a taxi from the Riad took us to a square in the neighborhood of the Riad. The last part we had to walk because you can't drive the narrow streats. And that makes it very special you are in the centre of the medina with its crowded and narrow streets. Many places you want to visit are in the neaghborhood. Even my mother could walk to the Place Jemaa el-Fna the Medrassa Ben Youssef the Marrakesh museum the Palaces the Souk the Kasbah the Maison de la Photographie et cetera.

Riad Karmela,Vonsie wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Authentic Riad Experience,We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a tour of the coast. Our driver called them and made arrangements to find the place a porter then took our bags the remaining few hundred metres. We were warmly welcomed and immediately transported into an oasis of calm.    We had booked a suite; initially the room we were given was in our opinion a nice room but not a suite. We relayed this to the hotel and they immediately moved us to a suite and committed to giving us the suite we really wanted the following morning. That suite was beautiful and what we had been expecting.    Staff were exceptionally friendly from moving bags to drying some clothes for me to always having tea on hand. The big advantage of here that we could see was that it is somewhat bigger than most riads. We were only two people and liked the idea of staying in a place with more than only 3/4 other rooms.    Breakfast was a selection of breads pastries omelettes tea/coffee yoghurt. The rooftop terrace was the highlight of the place amazing views of the city lots of little balconies and sitting areas. Great place to relax with a drink in the evening. We didn't eat there as preferred to go out.    It is difficult to find but if you remember the vegetable market as a landmark you can't go wrong. We didn't get lost once.    The one thing I didn't like about Karmela was the door situation. I appreciate there is an element of feeling at home etc but I would have a strong preference to lock my room. Not only that but the sliding locks on both sides of the doors meant on one occasion I got locked out of our room and had to wait 10 mins until my friend got out of the shower and heard me. Another time I got locked INTO the room for 30 mins when my friend inadvertently closed the door on the outside. Regular loud banging on the door summoned reception eventually to let me out! Kind of irritating though.    I would stay here again and have already recommend it to a friend but if booking again I would simply book a room not a suite they are half the price and we saw some lovely rooms which would be better value overall.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonsie
Riad Karmela,Charlie L wrote a review Oct 2012,40,5 nights,Nice room good introductory lesson to the city; excellent location with 2 different routes to the square. Getting lost is part of the fun. We felt very safe everywhere and persistent hawkers can be made to look elsewhere if you engage in a humorous chat with them; which is so much more pleasant than my experiences in Kenya and Egypt.  The in-house meal we had was disappointing compared with our meals outside at El Bhaja and in the square.

Riad Karmela,peterj2010 wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Real Marrakech,It's hard to add more advice to what has been said already. Firstly though I would try to manage expectations. The Riad is like staying in someone's home. Some things are a bit tired and ragged and the location is an interesting area in many ways being so close to everything that goes on. But Marrakech is an eye-opening place that I wouldn't recommend to everyone. If its for you you will absolutely love this place. We ate 3 times in a week at the Riad and we were happy with the meals and the wine they served. Eating on the roof on a balmy evening being one of the highlights of our visit. I have left reviews on some of the other places we visited.,Date of stay: October 2012,,"Bolney, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterj2010
Riad Karmela,carlylikesholidays wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Calm amongst the chaos!,I stayed here last week for a girls getaway. We were a little apprehensive about our trip to Marrakesh being first timers but came away having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.    We'd read about the hassle lone women might receive and the chaos of the markets but didn't feel it was in anyway as bad as it had been described. Yes we got some comments but we're in our 30's now and rather enjoyed a little attention! We certainly didn't feel offended anyway. The streets are absolutely mad with cars and bikes and people like you've never seen but after about 30 minutes of being amongst it you barely notice! Everyone is so patient and no one complains if you step right out in front of them. Honestly they've reaction times like Usain Bolt!    We booked the taxi service provided by the Riad from the airport - I would highly recommend this as I'm not sure we would have found it otherwise as it's down a road that a car wouldn't easily pass. The riad itself is really well sign posted so you might feel you'll get lost once outside but if we managed to find our way back anyone can!    The owner kindly sat down with us before we checked in and showed us things to look out for to help us find our way recommended restaurants and booked us into a restaurant I'd had recommended to me. There wasn't anything that was too much trouble.    The cleanliness of our rooms and communal areas were top rate. The rooms were aircondtioned and very comfortable.    On one of the nights of our stay we ate at the Riad - the food was authentic and most of all delicious! The Riad itself is a little oasis with seating all over the place to hunker down in and enjoy a drink and a chat.    Special mention has to go to Kamal - one of the workers in the Riad. He looked after us and took us out to popular night spots. I'd recommend if you're going far from the Riad at night you have one of the folks from the riad escort you.    Lastly on our final morning we had a really early start to get to the airport and therefore were due to leave before breakfast had started but when we appeared downstairs to check out we found a table laid for us for breakfast and ate heartily before we left.    All in all a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I would recommend Riad Karmela to anyone.

Riad Karmela,gwel19tek wrote a review Oct 2012,40,A Pleasant Experience,The Riad Karmela is everything the photos show. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the bed surprised by being absolutely perfect. Joel was the perfect host and very helpful in introducing his city. We were slightly disappointed with the evening meal - the Main and Dessert were good - we found the Starter 'Fishcake' extremely if not overly 'fishy'.  Being in the depths of the Medina means you have to walk through the Souks each day before you can start to get anywhere. We think 3/4 days of this is enough to sample the ambience of the Medina without getting bored with the initial walk.  We would certainly return. The breakfast staff could try to look a little happier.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwel19tek
Riad Karmela,WMarion wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Paradise,It's was my third visit to Riad Karmela and this time I'd taken friends with me. We all loved it and had a fantastic time at the Riad; they plan to visit again. It really is a special place and feels like a home away from home - from the amazingly decorated rooms and terraces delicious meals awesome service and very friendly and helpful staff! They are all so accomodating! It's great too to have the convenience of having day trips outside Marrakech and within the city set up for you right at the riad as well as having pick up and drop offs at the airport. Marrakech can really be chaotic and having Riad Karmela to go home to completely balances the experience.

Great service, friendly staff and perfect location.",This was my first time in Marrakech and the travel in was a little daunting. The city is so manic! But as soon as I entered this tranquil riad and met the friendly staff I knew I was in good hands and would enjoy my stay.    I was not disappointed. My friends and I were really looked after and as we were an all female group we found that the staff went the little extra to advise us and make us feel safe.

Riad Karmela,Tinelli wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Beautiful Riad with a very relaxing ambience,From the moment that we stepped through the doors of the Riad Karmela the ambience immediately makes you feel as though you have stepped in to a haven of peace and tranquility. It is beautifully decorated and clean and is extremely laid back to the point where you do feel like you are in your own home. The staff are so helpful and did not fail once to deliver on promises or to turn up at a time that they promised for taxis/transfers even at a last minute request. We weren't charged for a room safe and Joel gave us sound advice on arrival with useful directions about how/where to walk and where not to eat. Not once were we pushed into buying anything from the Riad or felt like we were being sold to. Drinks were very reasonably priced and although the evening meal was a little pricey we still felt happy to pay because the service and the setting were so stunning.  the Riad was also ideally located for the Souks and the Djemaa el Fna and was close to a few of the 'main tourist attractions'.  I would definately recommend this Riad for it's beauty it's size and the wonderful tranquil atmosphere.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Reading,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinelli
Riad Karmela,Kristina_R_1212 wrote a review Oct 2012,40,Wonderful Weekend at Riad Karmela/Riad El Nour,My friends and I enjoyed three nights in the Riad El Nour. We were the only two rooms occupied as it was not high tourist season. It was like having a beautiful home all to ourselves. The only drawbacks were slow hot water and very firm beds. We loved our breakfasts at Riad Karmela and the dinner we had the first night at Karmela was very tasty with generous portions. The Riad and their staff are all excellent and our every wish was accommodated. We used the city guide they arranged Aziz and he was wonderful. I would highly recommend booking a city tour right at the beginning of your stay so you get an overview of the city and see some sights without being hopelessly lost. We booked a day trip to the Atlas Mountains and had a fabulous experience there. The Riad is perfectly located in the Medina for easy access to the souks Djemma El-Fnaa restaurants and several mosques. It is remarkable to leave the busy loud small streets and walk into such an oasis. The lovely Riad and it's amazing staff made this an unforgettable short trip.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Seville, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kristina_R_1212
Riad Karmela,true f wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Wonderful but be very Careful about....!,"Well I would like to give them Excellent rating because of the beautiful traditional decoration friendly  homely environment flexible check in & out I felt its like my Grand Father's house. it was so relaxing that i spent few hours just inside instead of moving around outside. If the weather is good it would be great gossiping at night with dear ones under the moon light in the middle of Riad or on roof top. The owner himself live there. few staff including the driver knows English as well.  Come to few facts now: Keep in mind that it takes around 10 minutes to walk from the Main square through the very busy crowded narrow lanes where you should also be careful for pick pocket & some people might try to misguide you saying Square is not in this way etc. At night it might be tiring to walk from the Square to Riad after dinner in good restaurant in town etc.especially if you are alone or two. The taxi can not go to Riad.. a small taxi might go at best 3min walking distance but that will take long time through many roads so probably no taxi would like to come. Rather walking would save time & money.  The main reason I can not give them Excellent is my Camera was stolen from my Room. So i lost all my photos .. its heart breaking :( & they never agree that their staff did that. well its understandable they don agree for reputation. FYI usually there is no lock & key in the rooms in Riad.. so its open always.. a small safe is there however. Even though there is clear suspicion about the lady cleaner who cleaned the room after i left for short time & another man who showed me how to operate the ""Safe"".. he has a key for the safe to open without password ... but they did not take any action. I went to police & tourist police but you understand police of a developing country... they even did not give me document of my report...However today the owner sent me an email saying sorry & told me that they have bought lock & key & will offer the guests (if they want the lock).. but that is not going to get my camera & photos back ya..I even told them ask your staff to find my camera back & i will give Tip . I do not know what they think.. would not it be better for their reputation if they would pressure the staff & get my camera back & should not they rather get rid of dishonest staff so that they do not face this situation later!!    Well.. probably i will not go back.. rather i will prefer something more near to square & if i decide to stay in Riad.. i will take my own lock & key !!. .",Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled solo,Evere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/truef_12

Riad Karmela,Helen Q wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"Relaxing, luxurious oasis in a bustling city",I've done a lot of travelling and usually spend as little time at hotels as possible as I like to stay out exploring as much as I can. Riad Karmela is one of the only places I've ever stayed where I was more than delighted to spend time just relaxing either in one of the beautiful courtyards or roof terraces. The decor and attention to detail is just beautiful as is the lighting in the evenings. It has a wonderfully calm and relaxing atmosphere. The evening meal there was one of the best we had whilst in Marrakech. Plus all bottled water is free! Both plunge pools are jaccuzzis which are heavenly in high temperatures.    Email them with your arrival details and they'll arrange a taxi to meet you at the airport. This will be cheaper and MUCH easier than trying to get there yourself. Don't be an independant traveller hero - you'll regret it. They also provided us with a much better map of the city than the Lonely Planet guide did. The map of their location on Google is wrong!    I never visit the same place twice as I like to try out as much as possible but I would happily stay here again. Check out their website as they have other riads as part of their group. We originally booked into Riad El Nour literally just across the alleyway from them but were upgraded to Karmela as there were no other bookings there in low season (Ramadam = very hot weather 45c upwards!) El Nour has free access to all amenities at Karmela.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Buckingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenQ180

Riad Karmela,A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Great experience at Riad Karmela,I would like to thanks Riad Karmela the so nice stay they provided us. The situation of the Riad is excellent close to everything important. We were a group of 27 people (12 children of all ages) and the entire group loved the Riad beautifully decorated with lovely courtyards children & adults enjoyed a lot the small pools on the terraces. They organized two dinners on the terrace for us the food was very good and the service was very professional and friendly. We asked to prepared special food for children and no problem for them. The good thing of the Riad directors is that any question or problem you have they will do the impossible to solve it. Some of us tried the massages and loved it. I will recommend the transfer from the airport organized by the Riad find places within the medina at the beginning of the stay can be a bit stressful .

Riad Karmela,ChickenCoup1 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Tranquil Haven amongst the Hustle & Bustle!!,Riad Karmela really is an escape from all the madness of the Medina in Marrakech! We had 5 nights during an extremely HOT week of Ramadan at the end of July. (52c)!! We stayed in the Kaisse Suite which gave the 3 of us ample space and was very clean and comfortable. The most welcome air conditioning ensured we also had undisturbed sleep! We ate at Karmela 4 out of 5 nights and the traditional Morrocan fare was full of flavour and colour. The local wine was good too! Karmela has a small Hamman which we tried out and was lots of fun ... our 16 year old son has never been so clean!! Nothing was too much trouble for our hosts Joel and Bouchra who went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also would like to mention Said who always had a smile and was able to answer all our questions! Karmela is ideally positioned In the heart of the old Medina in striking distance of all the places of interest. All our transfers were arranged by Karmela even our bus tickets to Agadir for the remainder of our holiday. We have no hesitation in recommending Riad Karmela. We loved it!

Riad Karmela,Hinoe66 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Oasis of peace amidst mahem,The Medina in Marrakech is crazy and it was impossible to find the Riad Karmela but they very graciously sent a taxi to our location outside the walls and we simply had to follow the taxi in to where we were directed to nearby parking. An independent porter then took our bags and guided us through the maze of the Medina to the Riad Karmela.    Walking through a small door we entered a beautiful oasis of peace and beauty! We couldn't believe this gorgeous refuge was right within a stone's throw of the hustle and bustle.    Our lovely host for the evening Sayeed (Sorry not sure how he spells his name) was spectacular with introducing us to the Riad and of the sights within the Medina.    The food was absolutely delicious and his introduction of Moroccan wines was entirely welcomed. We were surprised of the quality and faithfully drank Moroccan wines throughout the remainder of our time in Morocco.

Riad Karmela,David M wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Sad to leave....,The 'riad' experience is like no other and especially not like a regular hotel.Suffice to say that it's like staying in the house of a wealthy friend where all the comforts of home are available at any time. The benefit of staying at the RIAD KARMELA are just about too many to mention.This coupled with the 'ghost like' staff who manage to carry out their tasks almost without intrusion makes the KARMELA a most peaceful and calming oasis for guests. Our visit coincided with Ramadan but even this major cultural event failed to have any effect on the level of service which was excellent. In our opinion the value for money cannot be overstated! All trips drinks and things such as hammams were added to the bill and we were pleasantly surprised when settling the final bill. Cash payment ensured a discount which further enhanced the smiles as we said our farewells.

Riad Karmela,JazzCT88 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Missing it already!,I stayed at the Riad Karmela with my partner in room Hasna early August 2012 and we absolutely loved our stay there. I would highly recommend arranging a taxi to the Riad through the owners - we arranged our transfer through our holiday company and got totally lost trying to find the Riad so ended up paying a young teenager to take us there. He was really helpful but did suggest that we might like to pay his friend too when we reached the Riad! On arrival we were settled in by Said who is an absolute asset to the riad. He is incredibly helpful and friendly and we enjoyed a bit of banter with him during our stay. We had dinner at the Riad on our first night as we arrived at about 7:30pm - you must try this at least once during your stay the food is out of this world! It is a little prciey compared to the price of a meal in the medina but well worth the money.    As we arrived in the evening we waited until the next morning to have our introductory chat with Bouchra. She spent time with us carefully going over the route from the Riad to Djemaa el Fna and advising us on how much to pay for taxis to Jardin Majorelle etc. I would recommend using the route through the veg market to the square as we got totally lost on the other route and ended up on the main road by Bahia palace! Once you have walked the market route a few times it is easy to locate the Riad.    Despite being well hidden the Riad really is in the perfect location you want to be close to Djemaa el-Fna as this is the cheapest place to grab lunch find a nice dinner reach the souqs hail a taxi etc from. Any further out and you will end up paying lots in taxi fares and getting fed up of having to haggle for the fares each time too! The new town is nice but not the real deal.    Our room was lovely - (Hasna) and we appreciated being supplied with bottled mineral water each day. Towels were replaced frequently and when our bathroom developed a sewagey-type smell this was dealt with quickly and efficiently.    The only negative point of our stay was the attitude of the breakfast staff who were incredibly standoffish and totally unhelpful. We only learnt where to find things through chatting to and watching other guests. This was a real shame considering how brilliant every other aspect of the Riad was.    A final note is to watch out for the tortoises! There are a pair living in the fountain courtyard who can be found sleeping under an orange tree or behind one of the doors really cute and entertaining.

Riad Karmela,Tayoidowu wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Oasis,My wife and i decided to take a short break to Marrakech. we decided to book into the old city rather to be closer to the Markets.  From the description online we chose Riad Karmela.  This was a FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE....  our favourite holiday by far. i am literally haviing to stop my wife trying to book to go back every week as she enjoyed it so much  The hotel staff are very friendly and so chilled out its like they are in a coma. Nothing is too much for them to do.  They know the area and recommend the best places to eat and visit depending on your budget. we took their advice and we never regretted it.  out rooms were just so cool.  you dont have a lock on your door...a little bit weird but after you have been in the Riad for a couple of hours you understand why everyone staying is a guest of the owner you wouldnt go into their room so no one will trouble you either. it was so liberating from the neuroticism of western holiday where you have to have the room key safe combination code for front door etc.  the facilities are great. the roof terrace ..OMG i just want to go back now now now  The food is very good and once again the staff are so hospitable. My wife and i were so relaxed we actually forgot the time and were running 1 hour behind everything however we asked for breakfast and viola they served us  no issue no compliant - brilliant!!    please visit marrakech and stay here it is in the noiser part of the old city but once you step into the riad you will instantly fall in love and just feel the tension slip form you r shoulders.. just brilliant,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tayoidowu

Riad Karmela,Addy786 wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Riad karmela,A wonderful riad in the heart of the madina. Deceptively spacious place with friendly helpful staff. Rooms were furnished in the local tradition but with ensuites and air conditioned. They overlooked an open-aired courtyard with seating where birds really sang. Using the map provided at reception it was easy to get around. Be warned though without a map you are sure to get lost. Upon arrival in Maarakech arrange with the riad to be met at the airport at a cost of 15 euros for your own peace of mind. Summer time is really hot so be warned. Also note the rooms do not have locks. Whilst nothing happened during my stay staff will provide a padlock to lock your room should you need this. There is also a safe in the room. No pool to swim in but there are a couple of water areas to cool off in from the intense heat.

After 5 hours (!!) from Essaouira to Marrakech we were really tired and it was a relief when we were offered to drink a mint tea and some cookies.  Btw it is really hard to find a riad :) I will give you one clue - look for signs on top of buildings in medina ;)    The riad is very cozy it is a secret place for those who are searching for a place to hide. Nobody will ever find you here.  After crowded and noisy streets it is a great place to relax refresh yourself.    Rooms are terrific!!! Really they are so spacious so clean and they all different and i think that it is very cute that all of them have different names.    It is situated really around 8 minutes from Jemaa el fna and not far from medresa and souks.    Breakfasts - just ok :) didn`t mention anything special. Except that restaurant on the roof is very beautiful.  One tip - it is really hot in marrakech on july.

Riad Karmela,pam_redboots wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"i don't think we're in kansas any more, toto!",as a place to stay this is up there in my lifetime top five. it takes a while to shake off the 'land of oz' or 'through the looking-glass' feeling that nothing is quite as it appears. this quirkiness is mainly what appeals to me.    we arrived very late at night. we were about 6 hours late having been diverted to casablanca. we had been unable to contact the riad so had to find our own way there: a bit of a challenge to two weary peeps who'd been travelling since 5 a.m. as simon let us in i could see a beautifully laid dinner table set up in the courtyard. my heart sank as i realised i had pre-booked dinner for our first night. now all i wanted was a huge gin and my bed. simon was quick to re-assure. it was no problem to either have dinner or to put it off to the next night. and there was no need to check-in now we could do it in the morning. in fact so relaxed was the atmosphere all parties forgot the checking-in until 3 days later...    we were shown to our room which turned out to be the al mansour suite on the first floor of the main riad. this hotel is three 'riads' in one each having a courtyard area and all linked by indoor sitting areas. in summer all the connecting doors are open and you can wander from one to the other and even 'indoors' seems like outdoors. open-plan yet with little private hidey-holes. quite charming. our room had a huge bed a single/day bed round the corner from and not in sight of the matrimonal bed a low table and four pouffes two wardrobes three small chests of drawers with little cupboards a fire-place and numerous shelves. the shower room was tadelakt as was the floor throughout. there were shutters and glass in the windows. [many riads have shutters only no glass which gives rise to a noise/privacy problem]. most importantly the whole room was beautifully painted in my favourite colour!    there is an in-room safe. there is no t.v. no phone and no tea-making facility. this is a 'home-stay' arrangement not an hotel. facilities in the riad include a jacuzzi on the roof terrace [i found the chemicals used in it a little harsh: our silver rings turned black. they were soon fixed with a bit of toothpaste but i avoided that pool after that.] two large tented resting areas on the roof with comfy sofas and day beds roof-top breakfast and dining and plenty of sunbeds for the very brave. [it was 45 degrees celcius] a small plunge pool in the courtyard which i loved using a computer room with three computers [azerty keyboards not qwerty so be prepared] a small t.v. room and plenty of sofa-groups both outdoors and in. a pair of tortoises inhabit the main courtyard and occasionally the large bedroom on that floor. i don't think they are really allowed in the bedroom but at least one of them can manage the step. they bite toes. and one is sneaky - while you are watching the other he rushes up from under your chair and bites your heels....    every area was cleaned daily though you must expect since the public rooms are all open-air to some extent that dust and bird/tortoise mishaps do occur. the staff are usually quick to remedy things though. our room was kept spotless and the books magazines and ornaments placed there were all dusted daily. the bed linen was of a lovely quality soft and white as snow as were the towels. the towels were missing on arrival but that was put right when i asked and never happened again. the shower gel shampoo and soap were of good quality and replaced when needed. there was a lovely welcome covered-dish of dates in the room on arrival and a large bottle of water was provided free of charge every day. the air-con worked well but despite the heat we often did not need it because of the way the house is built.    there is no fridge or mini-bar. ice is available. there are ample sockets but you need an adapter with two pins and a receptor for the earth-pin which protrudes from the socket. if yours does not fit they have a few. there is a hair dryer. there are walking sticks and sun hats to borrow.    breakfast is on the rooftop from 8 to 10 a.m. we found that although coffee and cereal was ready the fresh french bread did not arrive until around 8.40 a.m. a bit late if you have a trip planned. each day there were: three cereals. five 'jams'. butter. gouda and 'vache qui ri'. plain yoghurt. cake. dried fruits. fresh fruits. a large omelette cut into small portions. french bread. local bread. pastries or dough bun things. and occasionally freshly cooked moroccan pancakes or hotcakes.    dinner must be ordered in the morning at the latest. although the menu is fixed it is fixed for you not the house. so when you book they check which dishes you have had and do something different. so if several rooms are dining they may each get a different meal. we dined three times and ate three different starters and mains and two desserts. wine is mostly moroccan of very good quality [in my opinion] and is priced from 14 - 18 euros a bottle with a french champagne at 42 euros. beer and spirits i thought expensive.    the medina of marrakech is largely alcohol-free. officially alcohol is forbidden because the medina is a holy place. exceptions are made these days - most european-run riads serve alcohol as do a few cafes and restaurants. personally i was not happy with the idea of drinking outside the riad. and it is the only place where i saw no tourists 'the worse for drink'. we quickly got into the routine of going out for supper then coming 'home' for a bottle of wine before bed. you can be as private as you like but there is often someone to chat to should you wish. my greatest joy was to sit on the roof at 10.15 pm and here the call to pray from all the different mosques.    we booked the hammam for our wedding anniversary. the operators come from outside the riad. we booked hammam gommage and massage which we were able to have together. the man's massuer is male. gentlemen keep their trunks on - ladies their bikini pants but no top. the gommage is performed by the female staff. the massage is managed discretely with communication between the staff so ladies are not over-exposed. i was very happy with the system although i am more used to having two female staff. the massage was relaxing - both of us would have preferred a little more pressure but we were not asked. the gommage was excellent. and water was poured gently not 'thrown' from 'buckets'.    we found the staff simon kamal latifa khadeja jamilla [sorry i've missed a few] to be very pleasant and polite and willing to help. i was amazed - often they needed six languages before breakfast! ok sometimes things were lost in translation but we always got smiles and good mornings at the very least. both joel and bouchra went out of their way to help us when things went a bit wrong and were very approachable. i have read reviews which said otherwise but we liked joel's style. friendly but not intrusive. willing to help but not pushy.    i do have issues with the way bills are calculated. i did not raise it at the time the amounts were small. but prices were quoted in euros. i had arranged with joel to pay in sterling. but the euro amount was converted to dirham and then to sterling using tourist rates. i calculated that this cost me around £6 compared to converting direct from euros to sterling using tourist rates. something to bear in mind if you are booking direct and paying for accommodation because i was only paying for 'extras' having booked through british airways.    i rate this riad as a 'five' after applying my own algorithm. i could spend all day adding up pros and cons but the result is this. it felt like home. good enough for me.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,norfolk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pam_redboots
Riad Karmela,ArleteMartins wrote a review Jul 2012,50,The perfect place to stay...,if you are looking for an authentic place to stay with friendly staff always ready to help... look no further...  It has an amazing sun terrace with a splash pool (enough to cool down)... but if you want to go and have a proper swim the staff will direct you to affordable pools. The chill out areas (a few of them) are full of character... the room where I stayed with a friend was spacious and the bed very comfortable. I absolutely loved the shower area...

Riad Karmela,naturesconsultant wrote a review Jul 2012,40,An experience we won`t forget,We were very pleased with Riad Karmela our room was spacious and clean and the staff were very helpful. There are so many nice places to sit and relax you could sit in a different place everyday. We stayed a week and found that you get a bit fed up with walking around the medina and the local areas so would definatley recommend taking advantage of the trips available. I have to warn you that our first impressions of the surrounding area were not good but I suppose that it all part of experiencing another culture. After a couple of days we found our feet and realised that there was nothing to worry about. If your fed up with the normal beach holidays and fancy a holiday you wont forget and a bit of shopping this is the place to go. Overall the Riad was well run and we were well looked after.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Carshalton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naturesconsultant

Riad Karmela,Marie S wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Amazing experience for unusual Christmas vacation !,"We were looking forward exchanging our traditional December vacation for a new experience.  Our choice went to Marrakech and Karmela Riad.  Everything was OK. Our transfer from the airport had been pre-organized and our driver Kamal took us friendly to the hotel.  After a short walk through Medina hubbub we entered a heaven of peace  Karmela is ideally located to get easily to ""the Place"" (barely 10 mn walk) and most sites.  We enjoyed helpful welcoming by Joel and his staff.  Great atmosphere very nice food and cosy spa... we enjoyed everything.  Excellent quality-price ratio.

Riad Karmela,Ryan T wrote a review Jul 2012,40,Relaxing and beautiful,We arrived in the morning straight from the airport. The owner gave us a very warm welcome and showed us some great places to eat but was very aloof after that. The staff were mixed most were fantastic but a couple of staff such as the ones around breakfast were borderline rude.    The rooms was beautiful and the air conditioning was brilliant. The surroundings couple with the resident tortoise were fantastic and the hammam we booked was an extremely relaxing experience and well recommended.    The Riad can be quite hard to find there are signs at 3 points for directions but we still had problems. However if you want to be right in the medina then this a brilliant place to stay. The reception was not 24 hours which was also disappointing as we had to wait in the morning unnecessarily to clear up and move on.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryantW1612NW

Riad Karmela,Yinca wrote a review Jul 2012,40,SVG,We were looking for accomodation in a Riad to get away from the usual hotel vacation. Riad Karmela was the answer. Bouchra's assistance from the moment I booked our room was amazing. I made numerous changes to our reservations which were taken care of without a hitch. She organised 2 tours for us one of the city and the other to Essouaria. Both guides were professional and knowledgeable. The transfer from the airport to the hotel went smoothly and we were well received. Upon our arrival at the Riad Joel checked us in and provided us with information on the Riad visiting the city and overall advice.  The staff at Riad Karmela were welcoming friendly helpful.  We dined at the Riad twice (amazing food). the location was perfect as we were close to most sites.

I looked up there was a young morel an 26 ysr old or so with a big machete knife in his hand I g turned the light on and tsrtled the man I shouted and jumped up straight away screamed that there us a thief startled the guy my young daughter was also inn the room she screamed I chased the man out of my room through the courtyard and through another courtyard shooting top of my voice for help ...my daughter was sceraing Dad stop I stopped as e had a machete he could have done anything he eventually ran out of a back door .    The man looked drugged .. I was shaken there was no one form the hotel any where one young was asleep near the kitchen I went woke hihim up .. He called the the owner  Nxt MRI ing eve one had heard from screams    Joel the owner said I should not tell any one as jot would be bad for business  I asked him to report to police he said they would nit do anything    I waited next day and now few months have passed no letter received no follow up    I am very disappointed that the manager did nit follow up and tell me what he has done  As much the riad was. Beautiful bt I was disappointed by the management stance on security and did nit seem ti care or make amends .    So especially for ladies travelling alone I would advise make sure your rooms are locked    Also I noised that there were young kids 12-18 ae urn the riad soliciting for sex    A great holiday ruined by the worst experience    I have travelled trough out the world and this was the first time such thing has happened to me    Thank god nothing worse happened it could have been much worse    I would never go back there again mr akhtar from London,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PareXcellence2014
Riad Karmela,Dav_S wrote a review Jun 2012,40,"Closer to ""Good"" than ""Amazing""","Nice riad very well decorated and located close to the action but not too close.    Had to call the riad when we arrived at the airport as our pre-arranged transfer was no where to be seen after waiting 15 minutes... rather than standing with a sign of some sort at Arrivals the riad's driver was sat 30 meters away chatting to his buddies. Little bit more professionalism needed there but not the end of the world so we let that one slide.    Only had dinner at the riad on one occasion and no complaints. Breakfast we also only had once and even then we were a little late so the limited selection may've been down to our lateness - so it wouldn't be fair of me to criticise.    Our room was nice - light colour scheme well decorated clean and the free wifi was an added bonus.    The owners - Bouchra seemed very nice always smiling and quite bubbly. The gentleman (he never actually introduced himself but from reading other reviews on here I'm assuming his name was Joel). During our five day stay he only ever said ""hello"" except on one occasion when we approached him for directions to a restaurant. In my opinion he definitely should've been more talkative and friendly as he is not only running a business reliant on good customer service but is also a host and therefore should not be so distant from his guests.

We loved the riad the decor is amazing and the main courtyard is stunning. The continental breakfast was great with a good choice of fruit and bread and delicious orange juice. We ate at the riad twice and both times were very happy especially with the fish tagine yum! The Riad is quite easy to find after walking about the medina for a while. I also had a massage which was amazing and I definately recommend. I would say bring a copy of proof of payment as we had a little trouble at the end as they couldnt find our payment-as it is recommended to pay in full before you go to avoid the 5% commission on credit cards. I had done this but it took a while for them to find it and therefore would recommend taking a print out of the payment.

To cut a long story short it is a total waste of money the evening meal was not even worth the 25 euros the rooms were not presented to good standards and they were shown in the photographs and the riad staff are also rude and extremely two faced talking about other guests behind their backs.Joel himself is an extremely aggressive and arrogant man we have parted with our money so expect the service and hospitality to go in hand. We wish we selected another riad and should have read the bad comments for this riad as that would have given us an insight and we would have chosen to stay elsewhere instead of wasting our money at this disgusting and disgraceful place.    It is definetly not a place for a family nor for elderly people no guest should be made to feel threatened or stay in their rooms the whole time because of the attitude of the staff and Manager Joel.

Riad Karmela,Graham S wrote a review Apr 2012,50,"It's a Moroccan Tardis. Never been anywhere like it, fantastic",The Riad is 8 minutes from the square. It is 10 yards off of a major walkway. It is down an alley that you wouldn't be advised to walk down because it is clearly for locals only. And then there is a door in the wall. And then you walk into the most peaceful relaxing space. It is stunning. The highlights: Joel is an incredible host and Bouchra an incredible hostess. Nothing is too much trouble. The evening meal was sensational (three times!). Not cheap but worth every penny. The rooms have real charm. We had one on the roof which was great but the call to prayer was certainly heard. Our kids had one on the ground floor and they never heard a thing. The courtyards inside were incredible the roof was an amazing area for total relaxation. The staff couldn't have been friendlier. Kamal picked us up from the airport and took us back he was great (you must get them to pick you up as you will never find it on your own). The girls had a massage which they said was great. The internet was free at their 2 computers. If you go to Marrakesh stay in this Riad!,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/383grahams

Marrakech is a great city morocco a marvellous country - and the riad karmela is the place to rest to settle down to relax after the run through the souks and elsewhere.  The rooms are typically furnished comfortable and you can feel like at home joel bouchra and her charming team always are kind gentle and helpful - anytime any situation. they fullfill your wishes.  this is my 3rd review about this riad so i only could repeat me (if i would not stop here).  try the riad karmela i am sure you will agree.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Stuttgart,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElPeHa
Riad Karmela,Einon_E_Mouse wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Peaceful oasis,A very pleasant riad in a quieter part of the medina - and this is a good thing. Don't worry about getting lost - the vegetable market is close by and a good landmark for finding your way back.    The superior room was very nice - spacious clean and nicely decorated.    We had a lovely dinner at the riad on one night and made use of the hammam (which was very good and very reasonably priced).    Didn't have much chance to use the roof terrace due to poor weather but there seemed to be lots of quiet areas that were well equipped with sun beds chairs etc.    Overall very good value for money.,Date of stay: April 2012,,"Wales, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Einon_E_Mouse

Riad Karmela,Lucy S wrote a review Mar 2012,40,A haven of piece in the hussle of the medina,Despite initally being a little concerned on the approach to this Riad - it actually turned out to be ideally placed. The medina is a strange place and takes some getting used to with all its little twists and turns and narrow dusty alleyways but this Riad was really beautiful. Walking distance to everything in the Medina but out of the busiest areas so it's nice and quiet.    The staff were all lovely and very friendly. Upon arrival we were given mint tea a map and a short talk on some highlights of the area. Particularly handy was the directions we recieved and hints and tips on where and more importantly where not to go a certain times.    The building is so pretty several inner courtyards (look out for the two tortoises who amble around the main courtyard) with comfy chairs and sofas and a lovely large roof terrace that provides plenty of separate little areas affording privacy. A great sun trap in the afternoon.    The room was comfortable and beautifully decorated all individual. The bathroom was great with a fantastic shower always had hot water. Breakfast was fine plenty of fresh fruit breads and various other options and the coffee was good. For the evening their house red wine was also very nice - helpful considering it's pretty difficult to get one in the restaurants unless you are willing to spend quite a lot. Definately plenty of lovely places to sit and enjoy a glass after dinner out.    All in all this Riad was excellent and very good value for money.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucyS612
Riad Karmela,TonyDW wrote a review Mar 2012,50,A perfect choice,It has all been said before! The location 50 meters from the Souk is so convenient but make sure you arrrange a taxi collection from the airport. The ambience is delightful it has local character and most was most relaxing; lovely courtyards and roof seating. The staff were 5star charming. We had 2 meals both very good but not cheap. Breakfasts were excellent and the Riad's size meant they could be flexible but as in other Riads you are dependant on other guests respecting your needs ie not being noisy at breakfast! We would love to return for another stay.    The only slight disapointmant was our day out. As there were just 2 of us the Riad passed our tour to the Ourika Valley to Sahara Expeditions who consolidated lots of travelers into a 14 seater coach. It took 1hr 10mins to get us all together and from then on we were in a rush. Arriving back late they droped us off on the opposite side of the souk!,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Spain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyDW

There were lots of places to chill out and the ambience was relaxed quiet and very Moroccan. Food was fine and the hammam/massage was superb. Getting an airport transfer is essential if you want to have any chance of finding the riad. Joel and staff were very helpful with maps restaurants recommendations etc. My only caveat is that you need to feel confident navigating through the medina at night if you're going to make the most of the place.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908nicola3
Riad Karmela,Claire S wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Oasis of calm in the medina,We had a wonderful four night stay in Riad Karmela last week. The staff were friendly funny and helpful with a perfect balance of formal hospitality and informal friendly banter. The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout and around every turn is a new place to sit another sun terrace or a private corner. Breakfast was carried up to the roof each day for us to enjoy in the sunshine surrounded by beautiful flowers and birds enjoying the rooftops. The food was great - highly recommend to book for an evening meal (one days notice required) and the Argan oil massage was highly enjoyable! We took a day trip up the Ourika Valley to the Atlas mountains organised by the Riad which I would recommend as a very interesting day out with a friendly driver.  The only (very minor) problem with our whole stay was as we were in the Yacout Terrace Suite on the rooftop we were woken every morning at 5am by the very loud call to morning prayer...so pack some earplugs!,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claires622
Riad Karmela,Paul N wrote a review Mar 2012,50,"An amazing Riad, just minutes from the souks and main square",The welcome on arrival at Riad Karmela must rate as one of the best we've received at any hotel irrespective of rating. Genuinely informative about the Raid and how to get about Marrakech and where to go and what to see.    The Riad has a charming and relaxing atmosphere providing an opportunity to relax sun bathe or just enjoy a mint tea in between seeing the sights of this wonderful city.    We would strongly recommend taking the hotels transfer option. The driver walks you into the Riad removing any worry in the rabbit warren of the medina. Once you've found it the Riad is well located to walk to all of the main sights and is easy to find again.    Can't praise this Riad enough both marrakech and our accommodation exceeded our high expectations and we will definitely be back sometime soon.,Date of stay: March 2012,,"Guardamar del Segura, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/289pauln

Riad Karmela,gowerguy wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Romantic Riad,Though we experienced that horrible ‘stranded’ feeling as we were not met by our pre-arranged transfer a quick call to the Riad and the problem was apologetically resolved. The wrong passengers had been collected.    It’s hard to imagine such a beautiful peaceful location lay behind the maze of chaotic alleyways that make up the Medina. Opening the large entrance door revealed a splendid Riad and one that deserves its recognition as a great place to stay in Marrakech.    There are two main courtyards surrounded on all sides by hidden guest rooms. Scatterings of furniture and soft cushions provided some lovely areas to relax and enjoy the sound of the fountain or bird song. Here you can be as private as you wish. Certainly a great place to stay for romantics.    I am not sure that we discovered all the twisting stairwells that led to the huge roof terrace which like building below is full of private spaces from which to enjoy some peace and quiet.    Its location is perfect from which to explore the seemingly endless roads and alleyways that make up the Medina and main souk. It’s not too difficult to establish your bearings after a few walks to and from this Riad just note some familiar landmarks close-by and you will be fine. It’s a perfectly safe area.    All the staff here rightly earn high praise. Everyone could not have been more helpful and pleasant throughout our stay. Do listen to the useful tips that they provide when you check in and don’t miss using the hamman-amazing!    Meals inside the Riad breakfast and dinner are especially good and not to be missed at least once.    The Manager was quick to rectify any problems that arose during our stay primarily electrical faults. If returning though we would choose another room; one in the second courtyard furthest from the reception thus avoiding noise from diners in the evening and cigarette smoke entering your room. Staff arriving in the morning did wake us up most days too. The room was requested by us as we wanted a bath which it had. On hindsight we should have requested a bath plug too!    Our departure was also not without a minor hitch as we had been significantly over-charged though immediately corrected when pointed out.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Malvern, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gowerguy

Riad Karmela,peshovuchev wrote a review Feb 2012,40,The place to stay in Marrakech,The location of the riad is one of the best if you want to experience the atmosphere of the old city - Medina. It is a ten minute walk to the main square of Marrakech where you really do not want to be too close making the distance perfect. The riad has friendly staff which will help you with most of your questions satisfying most needs. It has a nice terrace looking over the city and if you are lucky enough and the air is clear you might see the amazing Atlas mountains. The breakfast was good offering various of tasty things to eat and fresh juice. A good idea is to request a room not on the ground floor as they are noisy and is not very nice early in the morning if you survive the mosque wake up. I strongly recommend this riad if you are very keen to visit Marrakech otherwise just avoid Morocco.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ixelles, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peshovuchev

Riad Karmela,DianneCreston_BC wrote a review Feb 2012,50,an oasis,In March of 2011 I traveled with our 2 teen aged boys for a week in Marrakech. Make sure you make arrangements to have Kamal pick you up as it would be impossible to navigate the route to the riad on your own. Once Kamal parked the car it was a 2 or 3 minute walk with suitcases in tow to the front door of the riad as the streets and passageways are too narrow for the car to maneuver any further. As we walked to the riad we were immediately overwhelmed by the sites sounds and smells and I wondered for a brief moment what we had gotten ourselves into. However as we walked through the magnificent doorway and over the threshold into the riad we were met with amazing hospitality and tranquility. The riad tastefully furnished and clean offered free WIFI and a computer for our convenience. Certainly an added bonus for our 15 and 17 year old sons who remained connected to Canada throughout their stay. We were served mint tea while our hostess reviewed the riad and the city. Our room on the second floor was perfect for the 3 of us. After settling in we got walking instructions to the Djemaa el Fna square and found our way easily. The riad is centrally located and is only a five minute walk to the square.  Waking up early to the call to prayer every morning was amazing yet the riad is so private you cannot hear the city come alive.  Breakfast especially the coffee and the orange juice each and every morning was superb. I highly recommend reserving a table for dinner as the food and ambiance were amazing. The tagine was the best in the city. The staff especially Joel and Bouchra were so accommodating and friendly and no request was too much. The roof top terrace was a welcomed retreat and we spent a couple of hours each day basking in the sun.  I have no hesitation in recommending Riad Karmela and would most certainly stay here again. The boys and I frequently reminisce about our trip to Marrakech and Riad Karmela with definite fondness and appreciation of a truly amazing opportunity.

Riad Karmela,Suze009 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Super place!,I have just come home from a stay at this place and in short: I'd go back in a jiffy at any opportunity!    The Riad consists of a few courtyards rooms (some have private rooftop balconys) the guest rooms a hammam and massage room (tried and would recommend it especially if you've never tried one before and unsure of the how-to-do).    This place feels like home away from home. It's quiet and relaxed clean and friendly. At first you need to get your bearings – around the city and the place – but once you do its no trouble finding your way around. On arrival you're sat down in the central courtyard where you'll also be taking your breakfast and eventual dinner and then given your map and directions. It's close to the central square Djemaa el Fna as well as several sights and a decent modern Marroccan restaurant.    This place is really friendly helpful staff and good value for money. The staff – Said and Simon – are on hand all the time to make sure you get answers to your question directions tables booked tours arranged and then they still have time to make a little conversation. They speak english so no worries if your scool french is a little rusty. Also the place is small enough for them to remember all guests – who they are and which room they stay in.    The food is really good we ate there 2 nights out of 4 and apart from a fairly pricy (by Marrakshi standard) restaurant it was the best food we had during our stay in Marrakech.    All in all if I have my little way this place will finish 2012 with a full 5 dots on the Tripadvisor score!    Only little piece of advise: If like us you arrive fairly late and plan to dine there the first night remember to book your table no later than the morning you arrive – they can be called or mailed either directly or through your agent. Also it's really a must to have your transfer booked from the airport ahead for this or any other place inside the medina as it's a complete maze and most streets are not signposted!,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Copenhagen, Denmark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suze009
Riad Karmela,Maria D wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Wonderful safe haven in the hussle and bustle of Marrakech,I went to Marrakech (first time in Morocco) with a group of girlfriends for my sister's 40th birthday. We were picked up at the airport by the friendly Kamal and brought back to our Riad.    We were briefed by the owner on the do's and don'ts in Marrakech (which was very helpful and appreciated) and shown to our stunning rooms. It was a little cold at night but there were blankets (and heating) if needed.    We spent the first afternoon soaking up rays on the sun drenched roof terrace sipping local win and chatting (as girls do). It was so relaxing. We had dinner (delicious tagines which could have had a bit more meat for such a big group) in the restaurant that night and we weren't under any pressure to go to bed - the staff would stay as long as we wanted!    Our tour guide was organised via the hotel (Aziz - excellent) and we did a tour with a guide up the Atlas mountains (with Simon) which was great as we got to eat a REAL tagine from the locals - buy local pottery etc. Again this was organised via the hotel.    The staff were wonderful and couldn't do more to help. I would ONLY stay here on my next trip to Marrakech and almost don't want to write such a great report in case it gets too popular and I can never get a room :)    The decor was so lovely and it really felt like a home from home in the way that you could just lounge around in the various little rooms inner court yards.

Riad Karmela,Cara_OB wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Riad Karmela/El Nour was excellent!,I travelled with 8 of my friends for a long weekend in Marrakech to celebrate a joint 30th birthday.    Firstly i would recommend booking a transfer through the riad to pick you up at the airport. If you don't know the Medina very well then you will never find this place on your own.    We stayed in the El Nour Riad which is part of Riad Karmela (literally just across the way) and we had it to ourselves. The riad is gorgeous! So clean and spacious. Every room has their own bathroom. You have a beautiful communal area downstairs and the roof terrace. We had breakfast every day at Riad Karmela which is really yummy - buffet style and very French (delicious bread).    Joel Bouchra and all the staff are really friendly. On arrival you're greeted with mint tea and pastries. Joel took us through a map of the Medina which was really useful and provided some very helpful information. They're more than happy to help with suggestions of places to visit/eat/things to do.    Personally i love the small touches. We were supplied with free bottled water in our rooms everyday. There internet and wifi is free. The staff come in to light the lanterns in the riad every evening. And one night was particularly chilly so without even asking Joel brought over heaters for us.    In terms of proximity we found that the Riad was in the perfect location. We had a 5 min walk to the square and we were in walking distance to everywhere we wanted to visit in the Medina e.g. souks spice market saadian tombs Bahia Palace.

The French owners and Moroccan staff made sure we felt welcome and that we were able to tackle the world outside (actually not as foreboding as it seemed on first impressions)  We were here mid-winter in January meaning breakfast and dinner (both delicious!) were served in the courtyard at tables set amongst trees laden with oranges next to a beautiful fountain (rather than in the gardens on the rooftop terrace as in the warmer months)  Consistent excellence here apparently. It was everything we could have hoped for on reading the numerous recommendations recent and older. Charm efficiency friendliness.

We were actually in Petit Karmela which is adjacent to the main Riad. All I can say is look no further for an affordable & beautiful Riad in Marrakesh. This is truly a wonderful establishment and because of Joel Bouchra & Kamel's kindness (& other staff members who's names I don't remember) we had a fantastic and memorable holiday. No request is too big or too small at Riad Karmela the team will suggest and book excellent restaurants tour guides day trips etc at very reasonable prices. As suggested in many of the below reviews I would definitely recommend that you book airport transfers with the Riad as it would be difficult to find on your own and apparently the local taxi drivers rarely drop you off in the correct place.    The location is excellent & only a 5 minute walk into Marche des Epice (the spice market) & the Souks. Joel will give you all the directions you will need on day one on how to get around by foot - so pay attention he certainly knows his stuff!!    The hotel has a small spa and a few of my friends used the hammam and had massages & they really enjoyed it. For a true 5 star experience/afternoon of indulgence make sure you book Les Bains Des Marrakesh: http://www.lesbainsdemarrakech.com/spa-en.html. It is an absolutely sensational spa with the best massage I have ever had & the most delicious Moroccan biscuits! I would go back to Marrakesh for a weekend just to visit here again & Riad Karmela of course!    My absolutely favorite restaurant of the holiday was Palais Jad Mahal: http://www.bestrestaurantsmaroc.com/en/restaurant-maroc/palais-jad-mahal.html. Really amazing food if you want a break from eating tagines & fantastic ambiance live music belly dancers & there's a club downstairs. A little bit pricey but worth every penny! Steer clear of the tourist trap Chez Ali it was a total waste of money for us! The Al-Fassia restaurant is also excellent for Moroccan food: http://www.bestrestaurantsmaroc.com/en/restaurant-maroc/al-fassia-gueliz.html. The portions are ABSOLUTELY HUGE though so go hungry or share one between two!    The Riad has a beautiful roof terrace with lots of little niches if you want privacy. Even in November we were able to use the terrace for a few days of our stay and we had a wonderful aperitif on the main terrace on one of the nights. This was for my birthday and the staff made it look beautiful with candles everywhere a beautiful table cloth gorgeous Moroccan tapas grilled sardines etc. I was also offered a free bottle of wine and a beautiful bunch of flowers in my room.    Honestly look no further for a truly amazing Marrakesh experience you will be treated like royalty at Riad Karmela. You won't want to leave & I can't wait to go back!

Riad Karmela,ac1118 wrote a review Jan 2012,50,"""Wonderful time""",We stayed here Dec.24-26 2011.  We asked transportation service from airport to the hotel.  The hotel cannot be reached directly by car. It takes about 5 minutes from closest car spot to this Riad.    This Riad is located in the center of Souk.  It takes for 5-7 minutes walk to El Fna.    Staffs were very friendly.  They had 3 Courtyards. Everywhere was stylishly decorated with Moroccan taste.  Beautiful courtyards were very comfortable and we felt like our own house.  They had 2 computers and 1 printer which we could use at any time. Useful to print maps and on-line check in.    Breakfast was Buffet style from 8:00.  It was rich in variety.  Many kinds of bread cheese ham omelet  Dry or fresh fruits Yogurt Cereal Coffee Tea Fresh squeezed orange juice etc.  When we had to leave this Riad at early morning due to departure for desert tour they kindly prepared breakfast for us before the departure.    We could see good sign “←Riad　Karmela”　at some key corners on the way from the Souk.  These sign were very helpful. We never lost our way back to Riad during our stay.    We had a memorable visit in Marrakech! Thank you !,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,Duesseldrf Germany,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ac1118
Riad Karmela,coco c wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Le bon plan,Nous revenons du Riad Karmela nous y avons passé 5 jours avec des prestations de qualité !    le plus c'est que ce Riad se trouve à 5 minutes à pieds de la place Jemma El Fna et surtout que pour s'y rendre il faut passer dans de toutes petites ruelles avec des marchands de part et d'autre. il ne faut pas avoir peur car là bas aucune agressivité de la part des habitants juste beaucoup de gentillesse et surtout d'envie de vous vendre un produit :-) mais ça on le sais tous et ça fais parti du charme de ces ruelles.    Pour bien se balader il faut bien écouter les conseils de Joël le patron du Ria qui sont bien meilleur que les guides à touristes qui du coup deviennent inutiles.

Riad Karmela,GBstravels wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Great escape,This Riad was a fantastic place to escape from the busy maze of the medina. There were many great small spaces to sit and relax with a drink including a very nice terrace area. The staff were generally very helpful in organising tours and transport. My wife and I did feel extremely uncomfortable walking back to this Riad after dark however. On both of the recommended walking routes back from the main square on two different occasions we were harrassed and intimidated by a number of groups - this was not unusual of large parts of our trip to Morocco though! Given this we decided to enjoy the medina by day and the ambience of the Riad at night. The riad had a number of directional signs around the medina to confirm how to get back which was very helpful as with all medinas in Morocco it is very very easy to get horribly lost. The dinner was good quality - we felt more comfortable doing this than finding food at night. Recommend this Riad for its ambience if you are comfortable with some difficulty getting to and from this location.,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GBstravels
Riad Karmela,Oxfordian wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Lovely Riad in the middle of the Medina,I travel quite often usually preferring to stay in known brand hotels so this was a break from the familiar so to speak as I wanted to experience something traditional.  I was not dissapointed at all! This Riad is a beautiful charming Oasis slap bang in the middle of all the hustle and bussle of Marrakech and yet so peacefully quiet once you are inside that it's difficult to comprehend the contrast.  It is less than 10 minutes walk from the crazy Jama Al Fena square.  Once you're in Place Ben Salah coming from the square the Riad is discreetly sign posted on corners of buildings which I found very helpful.  I travelled from Agadir to Marrakech by coach. Within minutes of making my booking Bouchra was emailing me and patiently replying to my questions on how to get there once I disembarked at the coach station.  I called from Place Ben Salah and within a few minutes some one from the Riad came to guide me and take my luggage.  I was welcomed by Bouchra with a warm mint tea and traditional sweets. She then sat down with me and explained the main attractions places to eat techniques in haggling for the right price and what I should expect to pay from the quoted price-this advice was invaluable! During my stay all the staff were extremely friendly very pleasant and helpful.  The Riad itself is very beautifully and thoughtfully decorated.  It has pretty much everything from a log fire to various common rooms and court yards.  Wifi is free through out the hotel and you can use their PC to check mail etc. The rooms are nice and cozy and again tastefully done up.  I only had one slight reservation which was that there's no outside lock to lock the door when you go out. Although there is a a small safe for money and valuables.  Having said that it was my first experience in a Riad and considering the building was built in the 1880s  perhaps that's how it's meant to be.  All in all a great place to stay wonderful people and I'd most definitely stay here if I came back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2011,,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MI-OXF
Riad Karmela,NJ26 wrote a review Dec 2011,40,A wonderful oasis,As soon as you walk through the front door Riad Karmela makes you feel relaxed in the middle of a crazy city! We had a very friendly and helpful welcome where the member of staff told us about how to get to different places in the Medina so we wouldn't get lost. In the main courtyard there are birds and tortoises (which you have to be careful not to tread on!)  There are lots of different smaller courtyards set back from the main one with the rooms surrounding each one. Our room was quite basic but clean and comfortable - great bathroom.  The free breakfast was good - we didn't try the dinner the hotel offers but it's 25 Euro per person.  One disadvantage could be that there are no outside locks on the rooms - you have to place your trust in the other guests! But the main door to the Riad itself is always locked.  The Riad also offers a Hammam and massages but you can get these cheaper at other Hammams around the city.  I would definitely stay here again!,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJ26

Riad Karmela,pinks5 wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Wonderful Riad - no regrets!,My husband and I booked a spontaneous trip to Marrakech for 5 nights. Upon recommendation from family and not forgetting to mention the bargain rate we found we booked Riad Karmela. As mentioned by other guests who have stayed here the riad is a wonderful place to stay. Joel (the owner) is very accommodating he doesn't push you to book excursions his staff are extremely kind and friendly.  We stayed in one of the smaller rooms and even that was big to our standards; with a very spacious bathroom (shower) a dressing area and then the bedroom part of the room.  Breakfast was served in the courtyard and the choices were a mix of continental fresh fruit fresh orange juice and a different choice of traditional Moroccan breads everyday. Hot milk cocoa powder twinnings black tea and coffee were available. I really enjoyed the coffee!  Each room has a hairdryer a safe and a bolt lock on the door. It is very safe staying in the riad... we treated it like our home and not a hotel.  The roof terrace was a lovely area to sit just before sunset you can see the roof tops of all the houses and mosques.  We didn't book an excursion through Joel as there were not enough guests going on the same trip as us on the days we had chosen. Joel was honest to tell us that it would cost more if we went alone. Hence we decided on finding a tour operator in the medina.  There are many 'living rooms' around the courtyard some have a fireplace (which was lovely) one has a TV and there was an area where you can find playing cards books and some board games!  From the Riad the Souks are a 10min walk away Jaamal El Fna square is a 15min walk. We even walked into the new town which took about 45min at a casual pace.  The area is safe in the evenings Joel showed us which route to walk if we were walking back to the riad quite late at night. We enjoyed walking around and just watching the locals go about their everyday lives. The kids playing on the streets are harmless if you look a bit lost they will approach you to help however if you know where you are going then just say 'thankyou/merci/shukran' and walk away. If you really need help then prepare to share some dihrams for their help.  There is a great shop that sells leather bags and traditional morroccan pouffes. I have added a review of them... just click onto the other contributions I have made on TA to find it.  Finally my husband had a massage on our last day as our taxi to the airport was not due until 6pm and the massage was at 4pm; Joel kindly let us keep our room until our departure. The massage cost the same as most of the tourist hammans.. having a massage in the riad was ideal as all you have to do after is walk up the stairs to your room and relax!  Thank you Joel for our lovely stay!,Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinks5
Riad Karmela,JCHALKO wrote a review Nov 2011,50,3 nights in Marrakesh - EXCELLENT RIAD - November 2011,We met the Riad Karmela driver at the airport and were driven through the Medina and down some long narrow streets which were very busy and yes the driving in Marrakesh is hectic no rules on the road. It is a fair distance from the airport and no you will not find this Riad on your own so the best advice is to book a taxi with Riad Karmela to save time getting lost.  We arrived at Riad Karmela on the 22nd of November in the evening and were greeted with many friendly staff who speak VERY good English... We then met Joel (the owner) who told us to leave our bags and come and take a seat. We sat down in one of the lovely lounges just off the main dining area and one of the staff member brought us some lovely Mint tea- We would really recommend people to try this as it is very nice (we even brough some back with us). Joel then pulled out a map and a card with our room name on it- We stayed in room Laila. He then went through places to visit directions and places to eat and not to eat. All of the places he reccommended were safe to eat at. We would reccommend to eat at Restaurant La Foundouk which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel (near the museam) and the food was lovely but fairly pricey and be warned you do need to book a table and it is a formal restaurant. This is more for your evening meal. For lunch time we ate at Cafe De Epices which was nice as we could sit on the roof and enjoy the sun and it is very cheap. Anyway back to Riad Karmela after being shown all these places we were taken to our room where our bags were waiting and I was impressed the room was LOVELY ! Very spacious in our room was a spacious wardrobe which also contained a safe (which we did use as I do not reccommend taking valubles outside the hotel as kids hands tend to find their way into your pockets so be careful) our bathroom was again very spacious toilet was seperate from the shower and the shower was huge there is also a small hairdryer in each bathroom ! Everything was very clean ! Each room also has bottled mineral water in.  As we arrived later than expected we decided to have dinner in the hotel which was served at 8pm and the food was FANTASTIC ! The best food we had in Marrakesh. You are seated at a table where a starter main and desert are brought to you (25 euros per person but worth it) and every night they bring you something different. Do not hesitate to tell them if you do not like something as they will bring you something different for example neither me nor my partner like sea food and one evening the starter was Seafood Pasty and they immidiatly brought us Moroccan Soup which was fanstatic we also had Moroccan salad one evening which was also lovely. Main dishes are manily tagine (a very popular moroccan dish) and deserts were moroccan panckes with strawberries and cream and tiramisu. Every night they will bring you something different though so you will never eat the same dish.  We went to the main sqaure on our first evening which is very lovely and full of tourists however do not eat in the main tents in the square as we were warned many people are sick afterwards. Lots of people with monkeys and snakes trying to take pictures with you but be careful as they charge... and will be very angry if you do not give them enough!  Breakfast in Riad Karmela is very nice a selections of breads cheeses jams yoghurt cereals and hot drinks. We had all meals served in the main area of the hotel as it was a bit too chilly to eat on the roof but we would reccommend to sit up there during the day when it is warmer... and keep an eye out for the Riads two turtles who do wonder around.  There is wifi in the hotel (free) and you can also purchase beauty treatements we did have the hammam massage (20 euros per person) which was lovely and I also had a facial (20 euros per person) which I would reccommend to anyone it was lovely and my skin has never felt so soft ! You can purchase a few gifts in the Riad too which are again a reasonable price.    We did visit many places for example Yves Saint Laurent Gardens (40 dirhams per person) but it was beautiful the new town (where there is typical European shops and Macdonalds) The Main Square which I would reccoment to go in the evening as it comes alive.    All in all our visit which was for 3 nights was well worth it ! Riad Karmela is beautiful and you feel at home ! Everything is very reasonably priced too and staff are on hand to help 24/7.  We will be returning in the summer !

Riad Karmela,bubbletravelers wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Excellent place to stay for everyone,We were taking a short honeymoon break and as a male couple not always so easy to find places in some parts of the world. When we arrive at Riad Karmela the welcome was second to none. They sat us down with Morroccan tea and showed us on a map where we were and places to go to. So informative and saved a lot of time too. One thing to beware (which they told us) is dont take any info form locals outside they will expect you to pay them even for getting told where something is. Sometimes they will even trick you in to going some where take you along winding streets and then you end up in a shop so they can try and sell you things. SO be careful in Marrakech.    Back to the Riad it was a beautiful place to stay so tranquil and the room was very spacious and with free bottled water. The breakfast each day was plentiful and with a variety of continental things to eat.    If staying you must try out the hamman scrub and massage a lovely cleansing of the skin and then a nice oil massage to make you really relax.

It's calm and peaceful with rooms built around beautiful courtyards and the Hammam and treatments are wonderful. It's well hidden so you must arrange pick up at the airport by the Riad minibus/taxi hassle free reasonable price. Have dinner at the Riad on the rooftop terrace where breakfast is also served it's the best food in town. Try some of the restaurants recommended by the Riad staff and a guide will take you and bring you home again. And it does feel like home - wonderful.

Marrakech is a noisy busy city - very full-on but SO interesting to wander around. Once you get your bearings (takes maybe an hour or so..) you realise this Riad is in a very central spot. Maybe 10 mins walk to the main square through the souks. Breakfast on the roof-top terrace was good and the dinner we had there one night was also good. They recommended a nice restaurant (bookings required) and we enjoyed our meal there also. The staff were friendly providing mint tea when we arrived ""home"" exhausted after sight-seeing. Another plus was that we were given an up-grade to a suite that was available during our stay and we didn't even ask!

Then our baggage handler said ""Turn left and duck"" and we did so finding ourselves at last in a seemingly magical place an oasis of quiet and beauty in the midst of the noisy medina. Riad Karmela is quite large but arranged so as to seem intimate and homelike. Rooms are centered around three lovely courtyards and there are many quiet little nooks and crannies for sitting and relaxing and perhaps sipping mint tea or coffee while ""coming down"" from your adventure in the souks just outside the riad's walls. The bedrooms as all the other spaces in Riad Karmela are adorned with paintings sculpture and enough objets d'art to fill a respectable museum Joel and Bouchra have created a place of beauty here and we can't imagine why anyone would choose any other hotel or riad for a stay in Marrakech. Our bed was comfortable our bathroom was clean and functioned well and the breakfast each morning served on the rooftop was delicious and filling.    The rooftop is worth a recommendation all on its own. It too is a magical place with lots of private sitting areas wonderful views lovely plants and flowers and a small plunge pool for a quick cooldown. We enjoyed two dinners up there prepared by the riad's lady chef and wonderful meals they were--a lemon chicken tangine one night and a lamb tangine on the other night. The side dishes were just as delicious and unique. All in all the best food we found in Marrakech (or indeed anywhere else on our trip which included France and Spain.

Riad Karmela,paulboop wrote a review Oct 2011,40,“We enjoyed this well – organized Riad”,“We enjoyed this well – organized Riad”    The 28 rooms are situated around three separate courtyards which keeps everything pleasantly quiet .    The rates include an excellent and varied buffet breakfast.    We have a very negative comment but quite unfairly it has nothing to do with the quality of the Riad ! It concerns the medina itself.    The most attractive aspect of cities like Fes Meknes MarrakechTarroudant etc. is wandering through the alleys and souks of these medieval medinas. Getting lost is one of the most common features but the shopkeepers are so friendly that you get directions to your destination easily and anyway getting “lost” is brief and a lot of fun.    The only medina we didn’t enjoy was the Marrakech medina because of the quantity of  teen - age  kamikaze motorcycle riders speeding through these narrow alleyways with no concern whatsoever for pedestrians their safety or comfort. Having to look over your shoulder every 30 seconds to avoid being struck and injured extinguishes all the fun of wandering around.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,Bangkok,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulboop

Riad Karmela,Vicbic wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Fantastic time!,I have been very slack about writing this review - we actually stayed there in November 2010.  Myself and my partner stayed there with my parents for 4 or 5 days (I forget which!) after an Expedia walking trip.    To get to the Riad they sent a car to collect us and the car took us to a little square where our luggage was transferred to a barrow... we thought this rather strange until we saw how narrow the alleys were to get there! There is no way we would have found the place on its own so I would say it is absolutely essential to accept their offer to meet you otherwise you could be lost in the souks for ever more...    When we first arrived Joel (the owner) sat us down and went through a folder with lots of things we could do in the area and gave us a map which was very useful and helped us get acclimatised.    We booked the Apartment Oumkaltoum for the 4 of us but the people before us decided to extend their stay. Joel the owner asked us whether we would like to go straight into that room or have two separate rooms for a couple of nights at no extra cost and then move into the Apartment once they had left - we chose to have two separate rooms first!    My partner and I stayed in Junior Suite Hassan which was lovely and very ornate and my parents stayed in Junior Suite Kaiss - both rooms were lovely - ours opened onto a terrace area and theirs had a patio overlooking a different terrace. They both felt very luxurious and we had excellent nights' sleep.    The Apartment was fantastic - it had two good sized rooms (although one is quite a bit nicer than the other) a nice bathroom and steps to a private terrace which was really nice.  However even with these lovely rooms we spent a lot of time in the communal areas - the roof terraces or the patios inside or the lounges all of which were very relaxing and our every whim was attended to in terms of refreshments!    We also ate dinner there two of the nights we stayed which was really nice - there wasn't a choice of meals but the chef serves a Moroccan meal of 3 or 4 courses which is delicious! It is in a really nice setting and very atmospheric but bring a jumper in the evenings!    Myself and my partner took advantage if the hammam which was great - nice and private and lovely and relaxing!    Riad Karmela is excellently situated for exploring the souks and getting to the main square so makes an excellent base.    We absolutely loved our stay there and all agreed that if we go back to Marrakech we would stay here again.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Faversham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vicbic

Riad Karmela,r0lf54 wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Stylish riad in a quiet location,European managed riad in an exotic surrounding. The riad is almost hidden in a quiet alley not easy to find. Better ask to be picked up at the airport.  I saw a couple of rooms all nicely decorated with Moroccon handicraft. I loved the carpets in the lobby and dining room. Friendly staff and perfect breakfast. Walking distance from the riad to Djemaa El Fna (the main square) is 10-15 minutes most interesting minutes through narrow alleys.  One day I booked a day trip to the mountains We were 6-7 people with a driver and a guide. The guide took us up in the mountains for a walk and we also had a good tasting lunch in his parents house. All well planned and not expensive. Highly recommended.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/r0lf54

Riad Karmela,tara wrote a review Sep 2011,30,Great but not the best,This hotel was a little haven amongst the craziness of Marrakech. Walking through the grand wooden doors down a small alley way leads you a very well needed a protected riad. The court yards are beautifully tiled colourfully foliaged with trees and plants which bring in the outer wildlife in. So you can sit and relax with your mint tea whilst listening to the birds sing the trickle of water from the fountains and the occasional sound from the bustling city.    Rooms are luxurious showers large with strong water. Soap provided bottled water and a great aircon system. Magazines have been neatly left behind by past clients which are a nice extra touch. Safes and all the things you would expect from a good hotel.    Cleaners come every day and are very efficient.  Food in hotel is good and has wine a great daily menu at two prices high and low. Lovely mint tea available when wanted at a low price. You will never believe how refreshing a hot sugar drink can be in such heat.    Low points:  NO locks on doors.  Taxis cant really get near riad. Hotel has a driver who walks you up the streets to the nearest car if your lucky.  After returning from one night away in desert. Owner of hotel said he thought our room had been moved that he didn´t know if our room was still our room?? We said we had all our stuff there and were hoping no one had touched it.  Owner said that it was completely normal to move people rooms but we were not pleased at all.  Thankfully after some computer work and the help of another member of staff we found out our room was the same. I find this completely unacceptable to move someones stuff with out their knowledge and after that worry i was stressed out for the rest of the day.    Breakfast pre ordered is a waste of time. If i had a solution for you i would tell you. First morning we ordered our breakfast early and they forgot. When the coach driver came to pick us up they set a piece of bread in front of us and black coffee.  2nd day we ordered breakfast early they didn´t produce it. They held us until breakfast was starting up stairs and they made no rush out of letting us have anything so we urged them grabbed and ran after sitting one hour. Just accept if you have early departure you may not be able to risk the time waiting for breakfast. You can arrange time but they will wait until you show your face and say something.    The hotel is sort of a one man show. The man reception guy is great. He juggles every thing from being the waiter to showing you your room tourist information and front desk carrying cases etc.  There are others in the hotel but he is the main man. So some times you wont find any one about but that´s ok because its a relaxing place.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ibiza, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luxurytravelibiza

Riad Karmela,Robbie S wrote a review Sep 2011,30,nice little place but no security or privacy,I stayed at the Riad Karmela for one night with my partner. We booked it based on the fantastic reviews on tripadvisor so expectations were very high.  Things didnt start well. you have to contact the hotel when in marrakech and they tell u to go to a location where they will send a member of staff to try and find you he will then lead you into the maze of souks and alleys to the Riad. Which be warned can be quite daunting at first and as the staff explain to you it is very easy to get lost.  Upon arrival at the actual Riad things better the place is calm and peaceful lots of detail has gone into making it look like paradise. There is a very nice terrace area on which we enjoyed dinner. excellent service by the waiter who presented us with a 3 course menu which changes each day.  We decided to take massage's my partner did the hammam and back and I went only with back was 20euro for 30mins each but ended up being more like 15mins. you just start to feel it working and it stops.. Hot water was an issue for us we had to leave the taps on for minutes before there was any hot water and there were no products and one towel.  The rooms are all very similar and no locks except from on the inside so a lots of peoples rooms were unlocked and on more than one occasion we mistakenly walked into someones room or had someone walk into ours. the room doors of course become an issue with possessions etc. there are supposed to be safes in the rooms but we didn't have one so we had to look for hiding places for laptops etc. i understand that a lot of people may like the openess of no locks but sadly it was a downer for myself.  it was a good experience and a memorable place but not sure I would stay again.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbieS238

We stayed in the Kaiss suite complete with private balcony with views of the patio and felt like we were in a palace. The roof views at sunset from the jacuzzi were spectacular and the staff were extremely helpful and polite.

Make sure you agree a price for everything - example felt under pressure to pay much more than agreed for a henna tattoo on my hand which after one day is unrecognisable they kept saying it would last for one month hence the inflated price I would say the women are worse than the men.  We only ate in the Riad and recommended places by them did not eat in the square but we did enjoy the fresh orange juice stalls.

The welcoming was fantastic with a little taste of Morrocan sweets mint tea and great information about the place and area. With suggestions for places to see and restaurants to eat.  Despite my own mistake in our reservation and arriving one day earlier than the Riad expected there was no fuss and they fixed everything perfectly in no time.  Unfortunately it was too hot to spend time at the roof terrace during daytime but breakfast and dinner there was perfect. Instead we had the courtyards wich had a good temperature and with a lot of nice atmosphere.

Riad Karmela,NafAish wrote a review Aug 2011,50,"Riad Karmela, a diamond in the rough!",We can honestly say that this was the best hotel experience we have had from the friendly staff to the picturesque riad itself!  After an airport pick up and a warm welcome of mint tea and moroccan pastries we were given an introduction to Marrakech by Joel and a tour of the riad by Bouchra before being shown to our bedrooms where we were left to soak up the new culture and relax.  We were upgraded into the Kenza room and the Haroune suite both of which were absolutely lovely. The rooms were cleaned daily and we loved the ethnic décor.  A continental breakfast and delicious moroccan dinner were both served out on the main terrace amidst the warm moroccan sun and a gentle breeze.  Admittedly we did get lost several times on our way back to the riad but this was an adventure in itself. We suggest paying attention to the surrounding area so that you can get your bearings - and if worse comes to worst ask for directions from shopkeepers.  We made full use of the excellent service provided and booked 2 excursions with the riad one to the Atlas mountains and the other a camel riding trip in Les Palmeraies and to finish off the trip had a hammam and facial in the riad's spa. All of which we would highly recommend!  So once again - thanks for a fantastic stay - Riad Karmela really made our holiday (so much so that our brothers and father said they would have been happy to spend all their time there)!!! :),Date of stay: July 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NafAish
Riad Karmela,Geoff M wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Blissful! Wow,We found the riad's website and chose it for it's boutique feel as it was our 10 year anniversary and wanted something a little special...we were not disappointed!  The photos are exactly what the place is like but what doesn't come across (which is what hits you first) is the serenity of the place.  It instantly puts you at ease and the madness outside seems like a different world.  Cooling down with feet in the plunge pool of one of the courtyards is just sheer bliss.  The room (I think we chose the best) was just perfect and had its own balcony overlooking a courtyard scattered with beautiful plants and citrus trees.  The owner Joel was a fantastic host extremely helpful and the staff very attentive and friendly.  The dinner menu is fixed and traditional Moroccan although it wasn't to my taste (sorry I don't like olives!) This was a very minor point and only something to bear in mind if you book a stay (and also don't like olives).  Overall we had a very relaxing delightful stay with many an afternoon just spent in the jacuzzi. The in-house Hammam scrub and massage was very well done and an essential experience.

This acknowledged I must also say that I was coming from two Riads one in Meknes the other in Fez both managed by local people: moroccans are masters when it comes to be hosts while at Karmela I found a certain degree of stiffness and detachment perhaps a stylized homage to the typically french pursuit of algid elegance.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Naples, Italy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giugurta
Riad Karmela,Psychoalma wrote a review Jul 2011,50,Beautiful and Tranquil Riad in the Heart of the Medina,My partner and I stayed here for five days at the end of July 2011. I chose Riad Karmela because of its excellent reviews and because I had read that it was accepting of same-sex couples.    We had a wonderful experience. We were upgraded to a suite on arrival and served mint tea with Moroccan pastries. We were given some recommendations for sights restaurants and finding our way.    The whole riad is exquisitely furnished in the Moroccan manner and the individual rooms all seemed beautiful. We stayed in Suite Meryam and were extremely happy. There was only one thing that we didn't like which was that we were not given a room key during our stay. There was a safe in the room and an internal sliding bolt on the door. It just meant that we had to be very conscious of locking away all valuables whenever we left the room. Coming from a big city leaving our door unlocked on leaving the riad seemed uncomfortable.    While we were there we had a hammam and massage. These were great.    The medina is very difficult to navigate and the riad hard to find for the first time. I would advise everyone to organise a transfer through the riad. They encourage this too.    All of the recommendations for sights and restaurants were excellent. I would recommend Cafe des Epice for lunch (or the other terraced cafe on the other side of the Place des Epice). There is a lovely and great value little restaurant close to the riad where they serve a three course traditional Moroccon dinner for about ten euro; I think its name was Restaurant Naima. I am vegetarian and found eating in Morocco easy. Try Dino's in the new town for the best ice-cream (Boulevard Mohamed VI).    Riad Karmela was a lovely and perfect choice for us. We enjoyed every second.

Riad Karmela,Igol2011 wrote a review Jul 2011,50,A lovely honeymoon,To be honest theres not a lot more to say that hasnt already been said our stay at the Riad was lovely in every respect; ok the Brit in me would have liked a kettle in the room and a mini fridge but ice was available from reception.    Our room was spacious and clean with a thankfully effective a/c system and our hosts couldnt do enough for us the Riad common areas are just as nice as the pics suggest and it is certainly a contrast stepping through the door of the Riad from the narrow souk street.    Breakfasts are included in the price and there is plenty to help yourself to and a fair selection obviously its a former French colony and a Muslim country so contiental breakfasts are the order of the day the craving for a bacon sarnie had to wait til we got home.

The moroccan wines were worth trying too|  Finally a big thankyou to Joel and his team for all their tireless efforts which made our stay so memorable. We would thoroughly recommend this riad to anyone considering a stay in the middle of the Medina.

Riad Karmela,fionaf_11 wrote a review Jul 2011,50,Perfect place to stay,We stayed in Riad Karmela in June 2011. We had a fantastic time in Marrakech and the Riad was the perfect place to unwind after the madness of the medina! We went on a trip organised by the Riad - a trip to the Atlas Mountains - this was great value for money and a wonderful experience. We walked to a waterfall and then around a couple of villages before having lunch with a local berber family. In addition to booking a Riad organised trip we were also keen to do a moroccan cooking class. Even although the Riad didn't have this in their brochure Joel was really helpful and found us two different courses to choose between and booked the course for us. Joel and his staff are very attentive and the calm surroundings of the Riad is the perfect place to relax. Nothing could have improved this trip!

Joel went through everything with us and gave us loads of tips our room was wonderful two single beds and ensuite with two windows overlooking the courtyard. The Riad was magical at night time we enjoyed our wine and our sitting out under the stars and the moon chatting with everyone that we met The Riads are attached and you can wander from one to the other each with its own charm. We had dinner there three of the nights its mostly Tagines which is kinda like a stew which is very tasty thats the local food and the desserts are beautiful so is the wine and all the staff are really friendly Breakfast was fine too bread and cheese and fruit and yougurts and juice and coffee or tea we had to wear our sunglasses at breakfast time!! The Riad is quite close to the markets and the square I have trouble walking and I made it there and back. its a different world and the riad was a wonderful place to come home to each day.

Riad Karmela,kazpip wrote a review Jul 2011,50,Fabulous! We will go back next year,We arrived at 7.30pm (using Karmela's taxi service from the airport). The taxi driver was a little difficult to find as he sat by 'arrivals' rather than stand with a 'sign' like the other operators...but it only took us a couple of minutes to find him carrying a 'Karmela Riad' sign. The journey is only about 15 mins from the airport and when we arrived at the Riad we were greeted warmly by Joel and had a beautiful meal on the terrace. Excellent service and although we only ate here on one evening we had a superb three course meal. Harira soup (vegetable soup) followed by monkfish tagine followed by ice cream and chocolate cake. The ambience in Karmela is wonderful. Morroccan decor pretty lanterns relaxing open air courtyards. Also plenty of covered space to relax in the shade. The only reason that I have not scored the spa and room service is that we did not use them. There isn't a swimming pool but a 4 seater jacuzzi type pool which was a delight to use in the extreme heat of the day. Joel gave us excellent instructions on how to get around the souks and central medina and we never got lost once. We had no trouble sleeping the bedroom had air conditioning and was clean and tidy.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Bristol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazpip

Riad Karmela,Vincentontour wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Oasis in Marrakech Medina,Much of what I wanted to say has already been said. The Riad Karmela is a wonderful Riad in a perfect location for all the sites of Marrakech; it’s also a very relaxing place to stay with many hidden comfy corners and sunny terraces to escape to. The roof terraces are perfect for relaxing in the sun and beach type towels are provided. The mosaic tiled Jacuzzi is great for a cooling dip. There is one terrace that you can even see the Koutoubia Tower from and at night when it’s lit and they are calling to Prayer from all the mosques around the Riad it is a very special experience.    But what makes this riad stand out is the level of service. From the relaxing introduction chat where they serve you tea and pastries to those extra touches: for example it was my 40th birthday and they upgraded us to the lovely Kaiss Suite which has its own balcony a four poster bed and traditional fixtures and fittings. They also decorated the room with rose petal happy birthday signs and a chilled bottle of white wine! A really lovely touch.    As other reviews have said the dinner served at the riad was very good I preferred the food to the Le Foundouk which was also very good. Do let them arrange to collect you from the airport because you will never find it otherwise. Remember that Riads aren’t Hotels it’s more like a boutique bed and breakfast Don’t expect TV’s in the room or 24 hour room service just look forward to a chilled out retreat from the full on experience of Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nailsworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vincentontour
Riad Karmela,Nicky C wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Tranquility in the heart of the medina,We stayed at Riad Karmela for 2 nights in June 2011 and wished we could have stayed longer. After a day seeing the sights in Marakesh and exploring the medina it was wonderful to come back to this Riad. It was quiet and relaxing with an everyready flow of mint tea. The Riad itself is delightful each room in individually designed and there are plenty of spots where you can sit back and just enjoy being there. The staff were courteous and very helpful. We would recommend you sample one of their dinners; it was delicious and one of the best meals we had during our time in Morocco.

Riad Karmela,jobob84 wrote a review Jun 2011,40,Overall a great place to stay,Firstly i would recommend getting the airport transfer to Riad Karmela from the airport especially if you are arriving at night or have never experienced the complex streets of the Medina or you will probably find yourself lost in its mazes of little streets. It costs 15 Eur for two people and the driver is a very nice and friendly.    On arrival you are made to feel welcome and relaxed as you are shown to a lovely seating area just inside the Riad and served complimentary mint tea and traditional pastries. We were then given a comprehensive talk whilst being shown a map of the medina places to go things to avoid etc. So overall a very warm and helpful introduction.    Luckily we were upgraded to a suite perhaps because the Riad was not particularly busy. This was called 'Suite Assis' which was a beautiful spacious room on the top floor so we did not experience much noise. I would recommend this suite to any one thinking of staying here.    The terrace on the roof was absolutely lovely lots of different levels and areas to relax in for those who want to catch the sun on a lounger or those that want to stay in the shade. The plunge pool also provided welcome relief from the 45 degree heat we experienced during out stay.    Breakfast was quite basic the usual cereal bread cheese yogurt and occasionally a few variables like pancakes and omelette nothing made to order though so this was left sitting around in the sun. This was perfectly adequate but a bit more choice would have been nice. Also the staff working in the morning could have been a bit friendlier instead of hovering around the general breakfast area looking a bit miserable.    The dinner also served on the roof terrace however was one of the best meals that we ate whilst in Marrakech. You ordered the night before or in the morning and ate at around 8pm. The environment was relaxful and quiet apart from the occasional pesky wasp. The service was very good and we were made to feel very welcome. We were served a traditional soup followed by the most amazing monkfish tagine this was followed by tiramisu and mint tea and pastries. All in all very enjoyable generous portions fresh food and great value for 20 Eur. I would definately book for an evening meal here at least one evening if you stay here.    My only criticism would be that my partner and i wanted to go on an Atlas Mountain trip during our stay and we were told that the Riad could arrange this. However as there were only two of us this would have been 90 Eur for the two of us so we were advised to wait and see if any other guests were interested in going making up the numbers to make the trip cheaper all round. However it got to the night before our last stay and we were still being told by the reception to come back later and ask. In the end we went into the Medina and arrange a trip with another company as we felt that our Riad were not being as helpful as they could have been and we didn't want to miss out on going.    Despite this little niggle with the Riad this is a beautiful place to stay good location clean and friendly and i would thoroughly recommend staying here.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jobob84

Riad Karmela,Sun-Always-Shines wrote a review Jun 2011,40,"Peaceful Riad Environment, Well Located with Friendly Service","The drive from airport to the Riad Karmela organised by the Riad management introduced me and my partner to the free-for-all of traffic in Marrakech. The roads got narrower as the driver threaded his way through cars scooters bicycles pedestrians and donkey carts to park a short walk from the Riad in the Medina close-by the souks and on the other side of the souks Jamal el Fna square.    The busy traffic and noise in the narrow streets was a dramatic contrast to the peace and relative coolness of the courtyards of the Riad Karmela whose restoration seemed to retain authentic charm. The hotel employees were friendly and the service attentive as well as prompt. On arrival unforgetable mint tea was served and a good briefing provided. Our accommodation included bedroom lounge and bathroom which stayed quite cool but also had split air conditioning units. Temperatures were up to 40 degrees centigrade by day but we had no trouble sleeping. A little more attention by staff to breakfast served on the sunroof would have been appreciated.    The Riad was ideally located in the old area of city but we had no difficulty getting into the new area of the city and out to areas such as the Palmeraie. Returning at the end of each day to the oasis of calm in the traditional main courtyard of the Riad was contrasted by the availability of WiFi connection in the courtyard which proved quite adequate. ""Working from Home"" took on a whole new meaning! And intimate evening dinners served in the courtyard were enchantingly romantic and relaxing although there were many alternative lunch and dinner locations nearby. As vegetarians we experienced no problems.    So much sun on the sun-beds on the sunroof as well as the jacuzzi pool to cool off. We thoroughly enjoyed the environment location and service provided by the Riad Karmela.",Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,English Abroad,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sun-Always-Shines
Riad Karmela,dutchsally wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Worth paying extra,We stayed 4 nights at the Riad Karmela. It was a bit above budget but we're glad we paid that bit extra - the Riad provided us with exactly what we were looking for: a suite with air-co with 4 beds (a double and 2 singles) for us and our 2 children aged 10 and 6 including breakfast in a central location. It is close to the souks and only 10 minutes walk from the main square and with Joel's clear instructions we didn't get lost once! Very good service and friendly staff excellent breakfast on rooftop terrace. On arrival (airport pick up by the Riad is a must - airport taxi drivers are notorious for ripping off tourists) we were given mint tea and sweetmeats an excellent start to our stay. We were attracted by the idea of a rooftop pool but it was so small we only used it to dip our feet in. Also shame that the music for dinner guests stays on so late but perhaps our suite was too close to the speakers! Make sure to keep your voices down if you're up early or getting back late sound does carry in a Riad. My favourite aspect of the Riad (apart from the cool quiet atmosphere) was the choice of various different courtyards and terraces both downstairs and on the roof either in the sun or in the shade to sit down and have a drink and read a book (or check your email - free WiFi!). Our kids loved exploring all the little stairways and connecting rooms though its perhaps not the best place if your kids are small.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Zwolle, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dutchsally
Riad Karmela,George-Ruth Papay wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Quiet beautiful riad in the center of the medina,Beautiful riad! We especially liked all the many nooks and terraces for relaxing in.We were welcomed with a drink of our choosing ( wine for me). Definitely would recommend letting the riad book your transportation to the riad. Travelling thru the old medina is a culturally shocking so it is reassuring to be with a driver that is familiar & authorized to take you to the riad. We were a group of 4 seniors so we really appreciated the quiet after 10pm policy. We loved the breakfast on the top upstairs terrace & the dipping pool that was on the top too.

Riad Karmela,jessiewarn wrote a review Jun 2011,50,"Can't wait to come back, four days was not enough...",Followed the recommendation to book a taxi to the riad from the airport and SO glad we did - we would never have found it on our first and probably not even on our second day if we'd had to walk unaided there really are virtually no street signs anywhere. Well worth 4 euros each to be met at the nearest square and then helped to the riad with our luggage.    Joel and Bouchra were great hosts Bouchra immediately brought us mint tea and pastries while she talked us through the basics of life in Marrakech showing us how to get to and from the riad and the main attractions advising us where to eat/not eat what to do/not do including some tips on bargaining in the souks - a very helpful introduction as none of us had visited Marrakech or stayed in the Medina before.    Perfect location - so close to the souks (3 minutes) and not far from the main square (10 minutes if you don't let yourself get distracted on the way!). We were in one of the better areas for accessing the northern souks which seemed to have better products better prices and nicer people than many of the areas closer to the main square. Yet the riad is on such a tiny street that the hustle and bustle of the souks and the constant buzz of mopeds doesn't quite reach it. A peaceful courtyard with plunge pool and two resident tortoises plus a fantastic roof terrace for a spot of sunbathing (not that we had time!) or a spell in the jacuzzi or dinner in the evening.    The cooks provide a great selection for breakfast - recommend the onion omelette and honey crepes - and dinner at 20 euros was well worth it we had a lovely three course meal including chicken tagine with preserved lemons - YUM! One of our group wasn't so keen on Moroccan spices so a more classic meal with plain vegetables was also provided they couldn't do enough to help.    Joel didn't mind directing us to every location we requested was able to recommend some excellent places for dinner - try Le Foundouk it's slightly higher end (about 400Dh for a two course feast we couldn't finish with drinks) but great and La Tangia's belly dancers are fun but don't detract from the excellent tagines and desserts (nearer 300Dh with drinks). Not only did he make all our dinner reservations but also delayed them when we got distracted or lost in the souks what a star. Bouchra and Joel also organised a camel ride for us in the Palmeraie which included taxis to and from the riad - it was great fun we dressed up in robes and headgear and spent a fun and educational hour and a half learning about camels and life in Marrakech from an unusual viewpoint. The camels were well kept and well behaved and owned by various families in the village so we could feel quite positive about all aspects of the experience.    Five of us stayed in one of the apartments and it was perfect for us: clean nicely decorated with local wares air con if you like that bottled water supplied each day and a safe which is kinda handy as none of the room or apartment doors have locks. We were uneasy about the lack of locks for the first day until it became apparent that there was always a member of staff by the entry door and from the evening you had to knock to be let in. Felt totally safe and it was actually quite nice not to have to worry about who had the keys!    When time came to leave our only regret was not having spent more time just chilling in the riad - it really is lovely....the pictures online are genuine and do it justice and we thought the prices were pretty reasonable for the location and the excellent service. Would definitely stay in the same place if I went back to Marrakech!,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessiewarn
Riad Karmela,thalita007 wrote a review Jun 2011,50,Authentic Beautiful Boutique Hotel,Service is good well-managed. You can tell the Riad is managed by a French manager so the standards of cleanliness organization service are very high. The Riad is beautifully renovated and very quiet. Moroccan and authentic. The location is in the old medina so 7 minutes from Djama el Fanaa. Be aware that old medina is inhabited by local resident Moroccans so you will get an authentic flavour in tiny centuries old streets: fresh bread and manufacturing of accessories daily and in front of your nose. As if you're walking 150 years back in time so wonderful experience. However ladies should not walk alone always with a friend to avoid harrassment.

Riad Karmela,barryjf wrote a review Jun 2011,50,A hidden gem and an oasis of tranquility,"On the drive to the riad you may think - ""Where the hell am I going?"" - but once you step inside away from the madness you realize that the place is a complete haven and an oasis of tranquility... and you may actually forget where you are!  The souks are just around the corner and the famous Djemaa el Fna is less than 10 minutes walk (once you have navigated your way around).  All of the local staff are very sweet and extremely helpful as are Moroccans in general. I would have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone.    Tips:  - ask the staff to pick you up from the airport or train station. You will NEVER find this place alone. Taxis cannot make it all the way to the riad and you need to walk for a couple of minutes. If you ask someone to guide you they will probably expect some money in return.  - eat in the riad at least once. The roof terrace is beautiful and the food is excellent. We ate there twice on a three night stay!  - bring euros in cash to pay the bill. 5% extra is charged if you pay by credit card (this is standard in Morocco).  - spa facilities are good.

Welcoming and friendly staff. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it 100%.    Not easy to find if you haven't been before so I would recommend getting the them to arrange an airport pickup for you so that you get a taxi driver who knows where it is. Many Taxi drivers will drop you at the wrong end of the souks. When we arrived the riad had people waiting to meet us at the taxi drop off point who then walked with us.

Riad Karmela,vis42 wrote a review May 2011,40,Good place to stay,Our stay at the Karmela was a good one but not great. The riad is very pretty and in a great location. The owner was nice and welcoming. The roof top area is incredible but we only got a short glimpse as it rained our entire stay.    If I had to be critical at all it would be around the sound. Since riads are set up in a square the rooms let in a lot of noise from the main areas and even if another guest accidentally closes their door too loud.    We would recommend others stay here as we felt safe and secure and the location is great for exploring the souks.    Oh also don't trust the Internet maps of anything in Marrakech as it's wrong. Even trip advisors opinion of where the raid Karmela is is not accurate. Just know that its about 10 minutes from the souks and main square area and is a good place to stay.,Date of stay: March 2011,,"Bellevue, WA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vis42
Riad Karmela,adeandkim wrote a review May 2011,50,"An oasis of calm and tranquility, steps away from the hustle and bustle.",We travelled as a party of 4 adults and actually stayed in the Riad El Nour which is basically an annexe to the Karmela and 3 steps across an alley way. Our first impression sticks with us most as we were picked up from trhe airport by a member of the Riad's staff and drove through the manically busy alley ways and streets barely wide enough for a small car competing with donkey carts pedestrians mopeds and other vehicles We parked 200 meters from the Riad and were led through a couple of streets to the door which is down a quiet alleyway. As soon as the door was opened we stepped into an oasis of calm and luxury.    Although we were staying in the El Nour all our services were provided from the main Riad and that's where we had breakfast and the couple of evening meals we had at the Riad. We also had the use of all the facilities at both Riads including beautiful roof terraces and plunge pools. The staff were fantastic happy to bring drinks across to our roof terrace.    We couldn't fault the facilities cleanliness friendliness and attention to detail.    In terms of location the Riad is about a 10 minute stroll to Jamaa el Fnaa Square and that was an ideal distance for us it was central but still enjoyed a respite from the frantic atmosphere of the Souks and the Square.    We had evening dinner in the Riad a couple of times and again couldn't fault the cuisine and service. However we would recommend sampling some of the restaurants in town including Cafe Terrace des Epices and especially Restaurant Marrakech just on the square. We went there on our last evening and enjoyed traditional musicx and dancing provided by 3 musicians and the restaurant staff. Although slightly daunting from the street with a narrow dark stairway leading to an upstairs restaurant this was probably the best place we found to eat out. Excellent food and licensed!    One warning in general though is that whenever we arranged to do anything such as a trip to the Atlas mountains or (nothing to do with the Riad) a jaunt round the city in a horse-drawn carriage there were always extras such as payment for a guide.    We also ate in the Restaurant Argana on the lunctime and evening before it was bombed and our hearts and sympathies go out to the people who weren't as lucky as us. Whilst this clearly placed a cloud over the time we were there the people of Marrakech rallied to stay upbeat and to beat the scum who would perpetrate such an atrocity. We did not feel any more threatened after the bombing than we would in any European city and would not let it stop us from going back again.,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,NW England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adeandkim

The welcome you receive on arrival with tea and pastries served in a superb courtyard with tortoises wandering around really makes you feel you have made the right choice. The streets outside in the medina are full of life lots of noise and activity which is great but it is nice to be able to enter such a haven of peace to recover and get ready for your next trip outside to see the fantastic sights which are close by. The souks are on the doorstep and the museum of marrakesh the medersa the tanneries and lots of other interesting places are just a walk away.Our room was superb very spacious and nicely decorated with a comfortable bed and a great shower. The breakfast are great lots of choice and eaten in the courtyard. We had a meal in the evening and that was excellent as was the local wine (not expensive)The service was excellent and the staff in general were very helpful. The roof terrace has good views and lots of space to sunbathe or chill out with a cold beer. It is not hard to find this riad - get a petit taxi to the Ben Youseff mosque and pick up a guide in the square who will take you and your bags to the riad(although if coming from the airport get a hotel transfer) There were trips to the mountains etc organised and seemed reasonably priced compared to those offered in other riads. All in all a great place to stay maybe too comfortable and peaceful as it could be easy to just relax there instead of seeing Marrakesh!,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cockermouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewan27
Riad Karmela,ChepstowSusan wrote a review Apr 2011,40,Charming well run Riad,This is a charming and very well managed Riad which offers a safe and peaceful haven amongst the confusion and fast pace of the Medina in Marrackech. Very tastefully decorated and adorned with plants and ample leisurely seating where you can enjoy the peaceful setting.    Joel provides excellent suggestions of where to eat and how to make the most of your time in Marrakech in a very friendly but unobstrusive manner. Likewise his staff are attentive without being overbearing.

Riad Karmela,Dream1809 wrote a review Apr 2011,50,they will go the extra mile for you,we originally booked Riad El Nour but were transferred to Riad Karmela after the first night cos Joel- the owner- thought the room wasnt too big so we were upgraded! They provided taxi service from and to the airport and even arranged taxi service to one of the high class restaurants that they reserved for us (of course one has to pay for it but if one speaks little french it is very convenient). We booked a dinner at the riad which was really delicious. The service is excellent! We also booked a trip out into the Atlas mountains which is highly recommended by us since it shows a COMPLETELY different side of Morocco. The landscape is amazing Joel even arranged sneakers for me since I didnt bring any. The medina itself is crowded busy and easy to get lost but they will give you an introduction with a map once you arrive so it isnt as bad as one may think when arriving. Yet again it is sooo different and one has to get used to the different smells and everything but once back in the Riad everything is relaxing and very peaceful. I recommend the pastries they serve with the mint tea. They are delicious we even took some home. Joel will be pleased to give you information where to buy them and how to get good deals. The rooms are all decorated differently with lovely Moroccan individual details clean and even though check out was at 11am we were able to stay in our room until it was time to leave to the airport. You can book massages and Hammams and they also have free WIFI. All in all perfect place to stay.

I would not stay anywhere else in Marrakech after discovering this riad. The location is perfect for exploring the heart and soul of old Marrakech.  Everything is set up for you to relax and enjoy all the various lounge areas of the riad.  We enjoyed a lovely home made meal on our first night. The staff were always very helpful and friendly.

Riad Karmela,Colefax wrote a review Apr 2011,50,"Tranquil and chilled out haven in the medina, well looked after by lovely staff",RIad Karmela is a wonderfully chilled out traditional Riad in the old centre of Marrakech.  It's somewhat disconcerting going through the (what it's fair to call) dirty narrow streets on foot with motorbikes whizzing past you to go through what we named the 'Hobbit door'  to the sound of trickling water in a beautifully traditionally decorated Riad...Orange trees around a traditional mosaic tiled fountain tortoises 'tearing' around the marble floors storks flying overhead the open courtyard.......Wonderful food served by cheerful relaxed staff. They were very helpful with any request for a recommendation and travel arrangements you felt very taken care of which felt reassuring as it's a labyrinth outside and easy to feel lost!,Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled solo,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Colefax

Riad Karmela,rufus47 wrote a review Apr 2011,40,Stay Here!,"My wife and I returned to ""Sunny Aberdeen"" on Saturday after 1 week in the Riad Karmela.  This beautiful Riad is right in the middle of the medina so DO take advantage of the pick-up service. You will never find it otherwise even the petit taxis struggle to find this place.    After driving through alleyways barely wide enough for the vehicle to pass through the driver told us ""this is as far as we can take the car we must complete the journey on foot"".  A further 100-150 yds on foot down ever narrower alleys and wondering what we had let ourselves in for we arrived at a large wooden door in the alley wall. We entered through a smaller door set into the bigger door and into a different world of calm cool serenity.    We were immediately welcomed by the owner Joel who provided us with refreshing mint tea tips and advice and a very handy map with recommended sights. We were then taken on a short orientation tour of the riad and then to the lovely Room Fatima which like all the rooms is individually furnished in Moroccan style.    We were slightly worried that because the rooms are all arranged around a central courtyard there might be some noise from guests returning to their rooms at night. But this was never a problem.    Not exactly being in the first flush of youth my wife and I were usually back in our room by 10.30-11pm most nights ( with the exception of the night we agreed to guide two Liverpudlian girls who were unsure of the way back to the Karmela and were duly led astray.......you know who you are) and our sleep was only disturbed by lovely birdsong in the mornings.    On leaving the riad you are immediately plunged into the hustle and bustle of the medina and it's accompanying exotic sights and sounds but we never felt in the slightest way threatened. But beware! You WILL get lost the first time you try to make your way back to your accommodation for the first time!! But when you do arrive back there is a very picturesque roof terrace complete with splash pool/jacuzzi and views over the rooftops of Marrakech to the High Atlas mountains beyond and you can relax with a glass or two of the house rose.    Joel has mastered the art of always being on hand for advice and at the same time remaining unobtrusive. We would recommend this little gem to anyone contemplating a trip to Marrakech.    My wife and I have traveled extensively and I must say we can level no criticism towards Riad Karmela without being extremely picky.

Riad Karmela,Jayne200 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Perfect,If you're reading this you are probably bogged down with the large amount of choice of accomodation in Marrakech my friend and I are so glad that we chose to stay in a Riad as opposed to a hotel and in the Medina instead of the new area and even more glad that we chose Riad Karmela. We were made to feel really welcome by Joel and his team and travelling as two ladies on their own we felt safe and looked after. Nothing was too much trouble and Joel made recomendations and arrangements on our behalf which turned out to be invaluable. This was the best trip ever and we can't wait to return to Riad Karmela!

Riad Karmela,Edin2011 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Great service in a beautifully tranquil setting,We stayed three nights at the Riad Karmela and would very much recommend it to others.    The rooms were nice the courtyard is lovely (full of plants and flowers) the terrace is fantastic on a sunny day and the breakfast is good too. It really is a haven of tranquility amidst the madness of the red city.    On arrival at the riad at 8pm we were greated with mint tea and Moroccan sweets and very helpfully shown our bearings on a map and given directions on how to get about etc. This was very useful.    Finding our way to the Djeema el Fna (or 'Big Square' as everyone calls it) the next day seemed daunting at first but was fine after we'd done it once. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk there from Karmela. Getting back to the riad after a day of exploring Marrakech is great as it is so relaxing and quiet. There are even a couple of tortoises wandering about in the courtyard.    We also used the on-site Hammam and had a scrub (€15 each) which was a fun experience and much less daunting than going to the public hammam.    I'd recommend allowing the riad to arrange a taxi to meet you at the airport as it is a bit tricky to find on your own. This cost €15 but was money well spent as far as we were concerned.    We were travelling on to Essaouira after our stay here (we stayed in Riad Baladin) and one of the owners at Karmela even sent a driver to buy bus tickets for us when he realised we hadn't pre-booked our tickets which was great.    We were very happy staying here and would recommend it to others.,Date of stay: March 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edin2011

Riad Karmela,RLoper wrote a review Mar 2011,40,"A haven in a busy, hectic city",Riad Karmela is a haven in a busy hectic and sometimes overwhelming city. You leave the bustling city streets through a small door and step into a spa like environment. The courtyard is beautiful and a great place to relax with a book friends or tea. There is a waterfall in the courtyard along with live orange trees and turtles (so fun to watch). The roof top area has several different levels and semi-private seating areas to relax and enjoy the view of the city rooftops and stars. The riad feels very secure inside (with main door opening only from the inside by the front desk people (knock or door bell). They have a traditional Hammam and a masseuse (one male and one female). The front desk staff was helpful and friendly. They arranged a walking guided tour of the city for our group (five couples traveling together). They also recommended places to eat and were helpful with directions. Additionally they arranged a taxi to the airport for our group and served (included) breakfast early before our flight. The rooms were spacious and relaxing. The only reason I didn't rate sleep quality higher is that our room's glassless windows over looked the courtyard and one night there were people downstairs visiting a bit more loudly than I would have liked while trying to sleep that same night we were woken up very early by the very enthusiastic birds enjoying the orange trees (tweeting and so on). However the birds were enjoyable and not so loud that we couldn't roll over an go back to sleep. One night when the rain caused us to come in early our group was able to enjoy tea drinks snacks and while playing a game provided by the hotel in one of the sitting areas (we played Uno). Inside the Riad you don't hear hardly a sound from the busy city... a true escape to relax in!,Date of stay: March 2011,,"Seattle, Washington",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLoper

The riad was perfectly situated at the back of the souks and the restoration they have done seems impeccable. The room Kaiss was a little dream in itself (although it took a bit of getting used to the sounds echoing upstairs). The Atlas excursion was very good (although we would like to climb a bit higher next time). Dinners were very good - compliments to the cook for the Beuf Tangier - which was superb (as was the Monkfish)! We have already decided to come back next year in March sometime.

Joel made us very welcome and the staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our three day stay. We stayed in the adjoining sister Riad adjacent to the Karmela and it was just as nice. Room was very clean and fresh. As we arrived Joel took us aside and gave us a quick intro to Marrakech and how to get to the main squares and what to watch out for.  Dinner was served on our first night on arrival and we had a great monkfish tagine with a bottle of nice white wine. Service was great once again.  Very peaceful night only disturbed by the first call to prayer early morning! Breakfast was served in our Riad and was very nice cereals baguettes and fresh orange juice and coffee. Great start!  We'd never been here before and you don't realise how grateful you are to have such a peaceful hotel amongst all the craziness of the streets outside. After 2 hours braving the markets we returned and relaxed with some more wine with only the fountain in the foyer making any noise. Very relaxing. Same thing happened every day too!  The rooftop in the hotel is well worth visiting if you'd prefer to sunbath or read in the sunshine and you'll be amazed at how big this place is. Its very deceiving.

The hotel was a revelation a haven of quiet in amongst the madness of the streets. The Riad is a 10 minute walk from both the Jemma Al Fanna and the Souks. Beautifully laid out with quiet court yards and sofas. Our room was not the most luxurious but it ticked most of the boxes. The few issues we had with the hotel were that the room was quiet cold I do realise we visited in their winter but the air conditioning unit which was the only source of heat was not very effective and noisy to boot. Also the hot water was intermittent it wasn't working the morning we left which means we had a full days travel with out showering. The breakfast was ok a mixture of bread and jams cereal or yogurt we would of liked a bit more of a selection. We would stay here again but not without looking around first.

It's only a little detail but it can make all the difference! )  And to finish a final note: the New Year's Eve celebrations at the Riad were funny and tasty: local musicians and dancers entertained us till late in the night while we tasted a nice gourmet dinner full of delicacies.",Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camela53
Riad Karmela,Kazb18 wrote a review Dec 2010,50,A truly lovely and memorable stay,"Bouchra Joel and their team were the most attentive hosts from the moment when we made our first e-mail enquiry to the point of our arrival. We could not have been made to feel more welcome. We were greeted at the airport by our pre-booked taxi to arrive in the centre of Marrakech - to the magical sights sounds and smells of everyday life. We were led down a very narrow alleyway to what we can only descibe as ""a little haven"" away from the hustle and bustle. The decor ambience and service was flawless nothing was too much trouble. We stayed in the room Aicha - this was gorgeous. The roof terrace was a lovely place to relax and sip mint tea whilst hearing the call to prayer. The meals were delicious even down to the extra detail of rose petals being sprinkled on the tables.

Riad Karmela,Audrey068 wrote a review Dec 2010,40,An oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Marrakech,I took my husband for his 40th Birthday and we had a wonderful time. The Riad Karmela is a perfect retreat. The staff are very attentive and extremely friendly and helpful. The Riad itself is very pretty with it's orange trees growing in the courtyard. Despite our trip being in December we still enjoyed a couple of drinks on the roof terrace in the evenings.    The Riad offers evening meals which I would highly recommend for atleast one of your dinners. They also recommended a couple of restaurants nearby - both of which were also very good.    The staff were more than happy to arrange restaurants excursions and offer advice - we could not fault their willingness to help us settle in and navigate ourselves around.

Riad Karmela,CONAIRAA wrote a review Dec 2010,40,Beautiful place to stay but hard to find,After reading all the TripAdvisor reviews we thought this hotel would be great once we found it. And we were right.    Riad Karmela is a beautiful place--the rooms are large (we stayed in one of the triples) and there are touches of luxury everywhere from the beautiful bed coverings to the thick absorbent towels. The public seating areas are as beautiful and welcoming as one could ask for. Even better you can sit and enjoy them without having to purchase any food or beverages. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful from the minute we arrived until we checked out. And the Medina with all its shops and markets are right at your doorstep. Finding the Riad Karmela however is quite a task.    Despite the detailed directions that the hotel staff provided us we were unable to locate the recommended parking garage and ended up driving all the way to the airport and taking a taxi back to the hotel. However the hotel is not fully reachable by taxi and after several failed attempts to get us to the right meeting location we were finally met by someone from the hotel who helped us drag our luggage through the cobblestone streets and down the narrow and winding alleys to the hotel. Once we finally went through the hotel entrance door we felt we'd arrived in paradise.    A couple other not-quite-perfect things--there was no suitcase stand in the room no courtesy hooks in the bathroom (the towels are stored under the sink which was quite a distance from the shower) no phone or tv in the room no locks on the doors (there is a small room safe) and there were a couple of minor maintenance issues in the bathroom. The breakfast is adequate and we did have dinner there which was only so-so especially for the price. The guest rooms all look down onto the public areas and if these areas are being used the noise (conversations laughter etc.) travels directly up into the rooms. On one of our nights there there was so much noise that we were unable to get to sleep.    If I return to Marrakech I would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: December 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Charlotte, North Carolina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CONAIRAA

The rooms were very comfortable clean and attractively decorated. The food was delicious with generous portions. The best part about the stay was Joel and the incredible staff. A lot of effort went into personalizing the stay with special touches ffor example a bottle of wine and flowers on my birthday Joel also offered great advice on how to navigate the city what to pay at the souks and for cabs.

The host Joel and all his staff were wonderfully friendly helpful and charming - 24/7. They gave us lots of really useful advice on our arrival - including tips to find our way around and not get hassled by the ""unofficial guides"".  Joel recommended and reserved a superb restaurant just a short walk away for our special birthday celebration. We also had dinner twice at the Riad itself - simple but fresh and delicious - and there was no problem with the fact that I'd forgotten to mention that I'm a vegetarian.  The room was beautifully decorated very spacious and immaculately clean. The roof terrace and courtyards are pretty and provide plenty of space to relax with a book and a drink.  The open nature of the architecture (common to all Riads I gather) meant that one night we were slightly disturbed by some fellow guests but otherwise the Riad Karmela was a wonderfully peaceful counterpoint to the crazy town outside.

You are able to experience the hustle and bustle of a city full of history and character within a stones throw from the Riad.

Really relaxing roof terrace with plunge pool perfect after a hot day in all the main town madness. Service is excellent and you are very well looked after. We arrived at about 7pm and we were sat striaght down and given green tea and Moroccon sweets and the manager talked to us about how to get about and places to see and marked them all on the map. The transer they organised for us was waiting at the airport when we arrived and was a quick 20mins to the accommodation. Its very safe here and only 10 mins walk from the main square with all the markets.    Breakfast was self service and consisted of coffee/tea bread cheers yoghurt dried fruits carious jams and honeys so it's sets you up for the day.

He took us on an eventful drive to the hotel which is in a prime location in the heart of Old Town/Souks. Upon arrival at the Riad Joel sat down with us and a glass of wine and took great care to explain the do's and don't and how to navigate from place to place. He also offered a full range of activities for us. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful coordinating dinner reservations daytime activities etc. The hotel itself is WONDERFUL...beautifully appointed with traditional Moroccan architecture and elements that have been updated and modernized. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apt which also had our own roof top lounge area that directly connected to the hotel roof top which is where complimentary breakfast was served daily.... I could really go on forever but I honestly can say our trip to Marrakech was magical and 90% of it was due to our awesome stay at Riad Karmela...Highly recommend!,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Aspen, Colorado",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesignerTravel28

Riad Karmela,Shippers wrote a review Nov 2010,50,A hidden jewel or a welcoming oasis? Actually both,"So so glad we booked this riad for our stay in Marrakech - we thought it was exquisite. Once we had got our bearings - despite being located off a passageway off a tiny side road this didn't take long - we thought it just perfect: in the medina (not sure why you would want to stay elsewhere if you want the authentic heart of Marrakech) and thus so very close to the hustle and bustle of street life but at the same time so calm relaxing and peaceful once the front door had closed behind you.    Joel and his cheerful unflappable staff couldn't have been more welcoming none more so than when we found to our shock on leaving for our early morning flight back home that it had been cancelled (yes this was Day 1 of the infamous ""Icelandic Ash Cloud""). They immediately gave us our old room back a second breakfast at no cost and a free lift to the airport (twice) as we sought to try and get back home as best we could...but that's another story...    The room we had was both elegant and spacious the hotel peaceful light and airy the roof terrace I could have spent many days relaxing on and...even given the fact we ate in a number of top quality restaurants during our 10 day stay in Morocco we rated the welcoming meal we had on the night of our arrival the best we'd had in the country. How many hotels could you give that accolade too?    A final tip - do have the hammam and massage. It's not that cheap but I don't think I've ever felt so relaxed afterwards - probably just as well as it subsequenly took us a week to get home.

I would definately recommend this place to everyone. The owner Joel and his team/staff offered the very best service. Everything is wonderful about this place it does not get any better. We were well taken care off and nothing was too much for Joel and his team. We booked 1 suite and an apartment the suite was very large and quite comfortable and the apartment was huge more than enough space for 3 people. The service was 5 star for sure. Our only regret was not staying there longer they trulywork at making you feel at home. We all five of us would definately stay at Riad Karmela on our next trip to Marrakesh.    Riad Karmela is right in the Medina and is perfectly located. Joel took the time to meet with us to explain how to get around and the hotel even arranged for us to get a guide when we requested one.

Riad Karmela,Thelambs wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Truely lovely,Spent 3 nights at the Riad Karmela at the beggining of October we were two couples travelling to Marrakech for the first time.    After a very interesting trip in a Grande Taxi from the airport we walked the final 5 mins through the hustle and bustle of the Medina to the Riad Karmela and what a welcome arrival. Once through the little door we were greated by a beautiful courtyard with water feature and orange trees. One of the friendly and funny waiters bought us some mint tea and cakes and then Joel came and checked us in. I thought we were in for the hard sell on trips but nope just pointed them out in the book and said to let him know if we needed more details or wanted to book. This welcome reflected perfectly the rest of our stay. The staff are friendly always happy to help and good fun (they thought it was quite funny that of 4 Brits only 1 was drinking alcohol!).    We had dinner in the Riad the first night the food was great the only problem we had was it was fish Tagine and I don't like fish. The rest of the group really enjoyed it and I just filled up on more soup and dessert!    Breakfast is perfect fresh baguettes home made jams youghurt and fresh friut amazing coffee (according to my husband) and English Breakfast teabags Yippee!    The only negative we had was that our friends were allocated the tented room on the top terrace although I think some would have liked this they didn't like it so next morning the spoke to Joel and by the time we came back at 3pm they had moved to a room of the courtyard no problem at all. Our room was really nice very clean and had soooooo much character as did our friends second room.

I then went to look around and found the riad decorated so beautifully so relaxing and a great place to come back to after a crazy day in the medina. BUT very unfortunately our room was so dirty  that we slept in our sleep sacks. I went to brush my teeth and the glasses in the bathroom still had toothpaste on them and the tooth brush holder consisting of 3 round pottery holders together had more toothpaste residue in them than i used in the 3 weeks away. AND there were some plastic things in the bottom  that would be hard to overlook.. using the shower the head was broken off. I went down stairs and showed Joel and told him about the head which was fixed 2 days later.  the alcove by the bed had an interesting candle holder. When i went to show it to my husband the dust on it was so thick i had to wash my hands. Checking the stacks of magazines next to it ugh that area hadn't been dusted in months. The closets were gross with dust and papers. The bars on the windows and the things hanging on the wall were in dire need of a clean. I am not a neat freak and travel alot knowing that sometimes things get over looked. This was over the pail. AND the whiteish rug in the room has seen better days filled with stains...and gross. No matress pad so thought that we'd better just sleep in the sacks that we bring because you never know what happens in another country. This is very sad for this Riad as the common areas were immaculate. The staff is very nice and helpful.  When i asked Joel about the taxi that would be coming the next day at 4:30 am he totally wasn't interested and said that he knew nothing about it and he didn't arrange taxis. I went to the internet and retrieved the email from the company that booked us and all of a sudden it was all ""taken care of.""this doesn't fly when you are traveling and everything so far has gone like clockwork.  the early departure was easy and nice and they provided us with a nice breakfast very early.

The taxi drops you off a couple of blocks away. Best to have someone from the riad meet your taxi! Step through the low door of the establishment and you find yourself in a light pleasant and quiet environment featuring courtyards rooftop terraces and various seating spaces all pleasantly furnished. All staff were friendly and helpful. The mint tea and Moroccan pastries served in the afternoon were the best we had while in Morocco. Breakfasts and the Moroccan salad we had one night were very good. This riad is within easy walking distance of a number of attractions in the Medina but it is easy to get lost in the myriad of narrow winding passageways. We had a delicious dinner at La Terrasse des Epices a few blocks away. It would have been impossible to find after dark; the riad arranged for a guide to take us there and back. Our bedroom appeared clean although furnishings were a little worn. Bedbugs might be a problem. We didn't see any; however my husband woke up after our second night with about two dozen bug bites on his back arms and legs. No lock on our bedroom door.

As promised our transfer was waiting for us at the airport despite this. A short ride into the Medina delivered us close to Riad Karmela. The driver escorted us through what felt like a maze of alleys and Moroccan youths before we arrived at Riad Kamela's wonderful front door.    It was what everyone had told us to expect from Marrakech stepping into a little oasis away from the madness outside. We were offered a welcome drink and allowed to gather our thoughts before the staff informed us not to worry about the paper work it could all be done in the morning. Attentive helpful staff were a feature of the stay and not more could have been done for us.    The room was clean and quintessentially Moroccan with working Air Con and a clean and functional on suite.    The roof terrace is a wonderful spot for a sundowner listening to the call to pray and basking in the peace and quiet of the Riad.    Breakfast was functional and served on the roof terrace and on an early departure day was prepared outside the normal time.    Taxis were arranged and the costs included on your bill this was appreciated on arrival as you miss the in your face hassle after a long journey at the airport.    We did not try the hamman or dinner at the riad but would not hesitate to do so if we had had more time at the Riad Karmela.

Riad Karmela,Sue_RossScotland wrote a review Sep 2010,40,Perfect place of tranquility,We stayed her for 2 nights in July and couldn't have chosen better. We were met at the airport and taken to the Riad we would never have found it ourselves otherwise and is highly recommended. The rooms were well furnished and clean. We overlooked the courtyard and thought it may be a problem with noise but it was so peaceful. You leave the chaos noise and hype of Marrakesh go throught the Riads doors and feel like you've found a piece of heaven. It was quiet peaceful and very relaxing.  The staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for you as did the owner.  The breakfasts were good especially the OJ - to die for !  We ate there one evening on the roof terrace and couldn't fault the food.  One thing you may have to be aware of though there are no locks on the doors but ours did have a bolt on the outside and I accidentally locked my husband in - twice !  If we went back to marrakesh and looking for a Riad would definitely go back,Date of stay: July 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sue_RossScotland
Riad Karmela,Iain_UK1 wrote a review Sep 2010,50,"Fantastic City, Amazing Accommodation!!",Myself and two friends visited Marrakech in August and booked a 5 night stay at the karmela. Its location at first might seem a bit daunting but rest assured you get the full Marrakech experience!    If you're after somewhere close to the Jemma el Fna the souks Museum of Marrakech etc then this is the place for you. Dont be put off by the bustling streets either once you arive in the gorgeous courtyard of the Riad all you'll hear is water trickling from the water feature and birds singing and nothing else. I kid you not!    We experienced an extremely friendly welcome and a complimentary drink which was welcome relief in the heat of the day! Having actually booked 2 seperate rooms in the sister riad (Riad el Nour) we were offered the choice of upgrading to a 2 bedroom apartment (air-conditioned) with a fair sized bathroom and our own private terrace for the same price as the 2 rooms in the el Nour. Naturally we accepted! The roof terrace is great for breakfast under the sun umbrellas as well as for sun lounging during the day although be warned it gets extremely hot during summer! If you're not much of a sunbather there is a jacuzzi or alternatively a large shaded berber-like tent which is ideal for chilling with a drink and a book.    The staff here are extremely friendly and helpful they'll pick you up and take you back to the airport they'll book you excursions taxis to restaurants as well as recommending Le Fondouk a restaurant in the Medina where you'll have a gorgeous meal on the terrace watching the sun set on this amazing city. Furthermore heed their advice about the food stalls in the Jemma el Fna they are notorious for illnesses we steered clear of them and instead chose other cafe's overlooking the square.    We couldnt fault the service anywhere we went in Marrakech everything was value for money even the expensive 'clubs' in the ville nouvelle which are well worth a visit especially the Le Comptoir restaurant if you fancy great food and an even better belly dancing show. However you will need a reservation at most of the 'clubs' for food but if you ask at the reception they'll be more than happy to book one for you as well as a taxi to and from the ville nouvelle.    All in all we would definitely reccommend you to stay at the Karmela it has fantastic staff fantastic rooms is in a great location and everything you could possibly want on a relaxing holiday to the Red City.    Oh yeah dont forget to haggle in the souks the shop owners love it and its great fun. You can get some real bargains!

Riad Karmela,notmichaelwinner wrote a review Sep 2010,50,Riad all bout it,Picked up at airport by staff and this is a must as you would have great difficulty locating it in the Medina although once there and given directions by Joel it was surprisingly easy to get about the city. The Riad is entered from a very narrow passageway after a short walk through streets pulsating with people bicycles motor bikes. Stoop to go through the small door and you enter a different world. Cool courtyards open to the sky a welcoming complimentary drink and an unhurried introduction to the city what to see and how to get there from the cool dude that is Joel one of the co proprietors. Our luggage was taken to our room during our induction and what a delight the room was. Nice authentic Morroccan furnishings effective air conditioning and our en suite was effectively a wetroom. We had a nosey into some of the other rooms and suites and all of them were lovely some with their own sun terraces. The Riad is surprisingly large with great rooftop facilities for sunbathing. Cooling pool on ground floor and kacuzzi on roof. I really enjoyed the layout with many different staircases with nooks and crannies. Would be a problem for disabled as indeed would be Marakech.  The Hammam and massage were very good and I would recommend that you do not miss a two hour session. All of the staff were most helpful. Free wi fi and use of Pc's was a welcome facility.  Breakfast on the roof was more than adequate and the parasols provided nice shade when the sun was up. Nice french style bread good coffee and a reasonable selection of fresh fruitand cereals. We dined on the roof terrace twice out of three nights. The food was wholesome tasty and authentic. Moroccan wine is very drinkeable and modestly priced in the Riad. I thought the price of the meal was a little high. However we also dined in a French restaurant in the Medina recommended by Joel. It was a lovely location if full of tourists and it would seem that the Riads meals were slightly cheaper than those at the restaurant. There are not many good restaurants in the Medina and I was not persuaded to eat at the the much lauded stalls in the squre. No doubt the reader will make up his own mind on viewing the fare there.  Very pleasant place to stay and in all honesty could not find any grounds for criticism. Great facilities great staff and accordingly great value for money.,Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bothwell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notmichaelwinner
Riad Karmela,Rand0m_Th0ughts wrote a review Sep 2010,50,Beautiful traditional riad - tranquility in Marakesh's madness,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights on our first trip to Marakesh and chose a riad as we wanted to see something of a more ""real"" Morocco rather than a generic hotel.    The hotel is run by a Frenchmen who therefore has a much better idea what foreign tourists are going to want. He has decorated the place very well and it is so quiet and peaceful inside that contrasts with the madness outside.    Rooms are simple but traditional in style and clean. Everything you could ask from this style of hotel. There is even free internet in main relaxation area and it reaches to some of the rooms.    The service was excellent and the whole place made you feel at home.

Riad Karmela,AndyOros wrote a review Sep 2010,50,Great Karma,Karmela was the first place we stayed on arrival in Morocco for a two week holiday and it was an incredible introduction to an incredible country. The staff were outstanding. The place stunningly beautiful with a real Moroccan feel Thank goodness we were met by one of the staff at the airport as we would never have found our way through the maze of alleyways in the Medina to find the place - which is tucked away behind a carpet shop near some fruit stalls a mosque and a live chicken butcher - like every other street in the Medina. Joel was a tremendous help and suggested great places to eat as well as a good day out in the mountains - he and his staff could not have been more helpful.  The views from the rooftops of the Riad are stunning.

Riad Karmela,rfixsen wrote a review Sep 2010,50,"Beautiful riad, lots of space, fantastic dinners",Riad Karmela was really beautiful and a great place for socialising with other guests. The roof terraces are lovely though in August it was far too hot even early in the morning to spend much time up there. Downstairs guests gathered around the plunge pool to cool their feet. Our room (one adult two teenage children) was good and the air conditioning was effective -- this was really important at that time of year. Joel the owner was very helpful and friendly while being quite formal as were the rest of the staff. We had a lovely relaxing massage and enjoyed being able to walk out of the door and experience the medina. The Djema el Fna was not too far away. The dinner in the evenings was extremely good though at 20 euros more than I was expecting to pay in Morocco. We soon learned that good meals out are just as expensive in Morocco as in the UK -- for tourists at least! The breakfasts were not great -- very little choice and sometimes bread took a while to arrive. It was also too hot on the roof to enjoy breakfast in August. It would have been good to be able to eat downstairs instead. But that is a small point. We had a great stay and would recommend.,Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rfixsen
Riad Karmela,Chachachingching wrote a review Sep 2010,40,Excellent Value,Stayed here - 17 Aug 2007 - 22 Aug 2007    I came here for my 30th birthday with 4 other friends.    We were picked up at Marrakech airport as organised by the riad owners. There was a little bit of a mix up and we wended up having to call them for them to come pick us up which was a little stressful. Eventually they came ... no problem.    On first view the place looks as if it's in a run-down suburb. However when you go through the door you realise you are in a beautiful oasis of calm and tranquillity -with a beautiful ice-cold plunge pool and orange/lemon trees in the winter-garden (forecourt).    The Jemal El Fnaa (the famous square) is about a 10-15 minute walk form the riad .. not far at all.    We stayed in the Oum Katum apartment with housed all 5 of us at a cost of 200Euros per night and included breakfast. Again excellent value. The room was clean and equipped with fresh bottles of water every day. The apartment had it's own terrace with was beautiful.    The riad had it's own plunge pools and sunbathing on the top terrace was an option too. We arranged dinner on the first night which was a little pricey but the food was OK. Breakfast was again ok .. cereals bread jams butter spread and milk and a variety of teas and a toaster should we wish to consume toast. I didn't really like the breakfast and admit to eating it under duress from my hungry stomach.    In terms of location - fantastic.  Ambience - great again.  Food - less so enjoyable - some breakfast foods were on ice but in the heat and flies made it less appetising.    I loved the owners and dealt primarily with Joel and Nadia (the manager). Internet connection was available. As a surprise for my birthday they gave me a selection of baklavas which I thought was a lovely lovely touch. I can only hope the riad goes from strength to strength as the customer service was excellent.,Date of stay: August 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Isle of Man, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chachachingching

The moment we arrived we were welcomed with some refreshing mint tea. Joel gave us some advice about Marrakech as we were first time visitors we appreciated this.  Rooms were very spacious and clean. Free Wifi and also PCs if you didn't bring a laptop. Breakfast was a continental style and very tasty.  The Riad itself was only a few minutes from the souks and square.

Joule's recommendations for evening dinner are exquisite both in house as well as beyond in the Medina and Ville Nouvelle.

One evening we had a hammam and massage followed by dinner at the Riad; the hammam was incredible and the dinner was lovely. We also took up one of the excursion options to the Atlas mountains was a great day. Breakfast was modest but more than fine; great fresh juice fruit cereal breads jams etc. Was nice to sit on the roof terrace at night with a cold beer after having been out in the amazing hectiness that is the Medina.

Riad Karmela,yims wrote a review Aug 2010,50,An excellent and peaceful place to stay amidst the hustle and bustle of the medina,Riad Karmela is a truly beautiful welcoming and extremely comfortable place to stay in Marrakech. Prior to our stay we looked at the pictures of the riad and were unsure if reality would match our expectations...it far exceeded our expectations!    Our room was fantastic we stayed in 'al mansour' and it was very comfortable clean and COOL due to air conditioning which was essential in the August heat! We had bottled water provided daily which was very welcome and meant that when we arrived we didn't have to purchase any.    The location of the hotel ensures that you have an authentic experience of Marrakech life! It was very close to the main attractions and if the weather had been cooler I would have explored the city more. The hotel has wi-fi and also a computer room which is great and enables you to keep in touch if you want/need to.    We received excellent service - the staff at the riad were extremely helpful and provided all the information and assistance that we required to have a fantastic holiday. The staff will book restaurants if you wish and will advise of local places which are very good. It was the best 'hotel' experience I have had due to the excellent service and cannot advise of any negatives!    Ensure that you eat at the riad at least once during your stay - you won't be disappointed! Also ensure that you arrange transport from the airport to the riad we booked this directly with the riad and once again this was an excellent service and reasonable price!

Great food staff lovely and the electricy and water were fine (i've heard some bad things about other hotels on this matter.)    I would recommend this hotel to couples and perhaps groups of adults.

Joel and the team are very helpful and Its a great place to stay and get a real feel of Morrocan hospitality. Much better than staying in a hotel.  It is well worthwhile asking the hotel to arrange transfer to and from hotel for only €15.  The initial approach to the Riad is not brilliant a short walk through narrow pasageways but when you realise what the city is about you will realise it is normal and really in keeping with the atmosphere of Marrakech.  There are limited sight-seeing opportunities in Marrakech 3 days is probably enough.

There are lots of other hidden areas in the Riad to escape to including a TV lounge and free internet room. They gave us a detailed map so it was relatively easy to find your way around.

Riad Karmela,joanna_api wrote a review Jun 2010,50,AMAZING- We wanna go BACK again and again,There is no way we are booking another hotel or riad for our next trip to marrakech!    We believe you can only taste the culture of a country only if you go for the traditional stuff so we never book rooms in big hotels\resorts for a start. It was our first trip to Marrakech this June and we booked riad karmela at random after reading couple of reviews on trip advisor.    At first we didn't expect the riad to be as good as the photos but as soon as we walked in the main courtyard...it was like heaven on earth. We were welcomed to the riad with traditional mint tea and buttery biscuits. Our room Fatima was beautiful cosy and very practical! Our small balcony overlooking the courtyard had jasmine flowers.  The staff was very friendly always smiling and willing to help you. The breakfast was excellent! We particularly enjoyed the very tasty fig and apple jams. We also made a good use of the jacuzzi on the roof garden for extra relaxation and deck chairs for sunbathing.  They gave us a map and explained were everything is and how to get to the main sites. We didn't get lost and we found people around the riad to be very friendly! Prepare to get dusty as soon as you walk out of the main door. We really enjoyed our shower room after those long walks in the suks.    We were very pleased with our choice!!! especially when we visited the new part of the Marrakech city (Gueliz) and we thought it was like another European city. It was lovely to go back to riad everynight and enjoy peaceful moments in the candlelight before going to bed.    I got one of those soap bars (used as deodorants) from the Spices square that I wear everyday. It makes me feel I never left riad Karmela and Marrakech.

The service at the Riad was the best I've experienced. The accommodation was beautiful and excellent value for money. The staff were incredibly helpful and provided lots of useful advise. They recommended places to eat which were excellent - a visit to the fondouk restaurant is a must.    The Riad itself is very calm and quiet which is just what you need after a day in the city. It's a great location but you will get lost so just except it and go with the flow. The accommodation was good - we booked an appartment sleeping 4 with our own sitting room. However we didn't spend much time in it as the hotel has lots of beautiful areas to relax. We booked a meal for our first night which was kept for us despite being two hours late which was a great relief and helped us to relax after a stressful flight. If you stay here it's worth booking the hotel food for at least one night as it was very good.

It was wonderful they saved us from having to spend the night in Morroco. They will arrange trips for you spa treatments (on site and very good!) restaurant reservations (even though the food at the Riad is great) breakfast (free of charge) everything. It is wonderful.

Riad Karmela,Khal wrote a review May 2010,50,Very nice Riad next to the center of Marrakech,"This very nice Riad is well situated not far from the center of Marrakech and Jamaa El Fna. The rooms are well decorated clean and you feel a little bit at ""home"". The staff is very friendly and always available to help you and accommodate you.    We had 2 dinners inside the Riad the food was excellent and the decor superb. Obviously the price of the meals are a bit high but you are at home well served and eating great food.    It is strongly advised to ask the Riad to send a car to pick you up because it is difficult for a random taxi to take you there without ripping you off.    The staff also gave us good advice about the surrounding restaurants and things to do.

The only drawback is the location but if you are good with directions it won't be a problem.

Riad Karmela,ManjS wrote a review Apr 2010,50,A Haven amidst the madness!,My review starts with the service that we recieved before we entered the country. Our hosts sent an emial providing me with valuable information about the Riad transfers currency exchange etc. Upon arrival into the country we chose not to take the riad up on their offer of a pick up from the airport because it was cheaper. On hindsight although it was cheaper than the 15 Euros they were quoting it would have been much more conveinient. My advice to anyone is pay the extra otherwise you may find yourself lost in the medina handing out tips to everyone and anyone who is able to point you in the right direction!    The Riad itself was beautiful tranquil and very friendly. Our room was spacious and unique and despite the delay in our room being available the hosts were more than accomodating by offerring us another room to freshen up in. The indiviudal court yards are very pretty and the stray robin every so often is a pleasant surprise.    By staying here you are in walking distance to the souks spice market the palace the tombs and a great cafe and restaurant. The staff's recommendations were spot on although we were told not to drink the orange juice or eat at the night market but we did anyway and glad that we did!    Overall we had a great time and would most definately recommend this Riad.

The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly and went out of their way to sort out our travel problems.    The breakfasts are reasonable but more should be done to prevent the local birds - who are a pleasant feature of the open courtyards - snacking on the bread and cereals.    The rooms are comfortable but facing onto the open central courtyards could be subject to noise from neighbours - although the staff emphasise the need to be quiet when moving around the Riad at nighttime.,Date of stay: April 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hursley

Riad Karmela,monkeysonparade wrote a review Apr 2010,50,A Pocket of Comfort in an Insane City,The Riad Karmela gets it right; exotic decor flawless service comfortable beds and genuine warmth for the guests. Joel and Bouchra make you feel welcome the minute you duck your head and enter the curious little entrance door that seals out the craziness that is Marrakech.  First accept their offer of a taxi pickup from the airport. You will never and I mean never find this place on your own. The streets in the old town are randomly configured and usually not marked. Second have at least one meal there. There are many bad places to eat in Marrakech (nearly all of the restaurants surrounding Place Jemaa El Fna. The Riad Karmel's food is pretty good and you don't have to swim through narrow alleyways stuffed with people.  The rooms are comfortable and well insulated from outside noise. We heard the call for prayer one morning but quickly fell back to sleep and that was all. There is a nice rooftop lounging area with a jacuzzi but as it was March we didn't spend much time there.    The riad has a book with some excursion options. The one we chose to Imlil in the Atlas Mountains would have been good except for the heavy rains that had washed out the road and the fact our 5 year old daughter wasn't really up for a big hike. The only annoying thing was that the driver insisted in taking us to a women's co-op where they make soap and almond-nut pastes for as long as the tourists are watching. The idea of course is to get you to buy their wares. Our daughter carsick from the windy road up the mountains promptly vomited on their doorstep. Ha! Take that!    Marrakech is a wild exotic city but not necessarily relaxing one. Riad Karmela allows you that option which is especially welcome at the end of a long day haggling at the souks. Riad Karmela offers a good and surprisingly inexpensive hammam/massage package as well as other spa treatments. They even mailed us our daughter's toy bunny that she had forgotten to put in her bag before we left.

Riad Karmela,acpjnr wrote a review Apr 2010,50,Beautiful classy Riad,My daughter and I stayed here for the first 2 nights of our holiday in Morocco our first trip to the country. We were met at the airport and greeted at the Riad by a Moroccan member of staff who served us mint tea and delicious litlle pastries. He explained everything and showed us all the places to go on the map. The building and the decor are beautiful so tasteful and with a strong Moroccan flavour. The roof terraces are brilliant...... we sunbathed up there and later enjoyed a gin and tonic before dinner. We had dinner there the first night and the food was wonderful. I know there has been some criticism of the food in the reviews but honestly I think it was the best meal we had in Morocco.....and we did also go to a couple of superb restaurants in Marrakech. We really thought the food was amazing.  I have also noticed some comments about thefts of cash. Well our room was downstairs by the restaurant area and I stupidly left the safe door wide open while we went up to the roof... and there is no lock on the room door. When I discovered what I had done I was horrified as everthing was in there ....passports a lot of cash credit cards video camera.....the lot. Thankfully it was all there nothing was missing.

Riad Karmela,emdiar wrote a review Mar 2010,20,"Gorgeous, as many Riads are, with a not-so-gorgeous attitude.","We stayed in the Riad Karmela at the very end of our trip in Morocco. Although we had experienced a number of beautiful riads by then we were still very impressed by the beauty of this one. We were warmly greeted by one of the Moroccan staff (I specify because the place is owned by a couple of French guys) who sat down with us over tea and pastries and gave us an orientation of the place and its surrounding medina. So far so great.    Then we got to our beautiful rooms which we oo'd and aah'd over despite the dust bunnies all over the floor. The trouble started when I went into the bathroom and saw sitting on a big fluffy towel hanging directly across from me a very dead but very real bedbug. Working in public health and knowing that there's a worldwide epidemic of these incredibly difficult-to-get-rid-of creatures across hotels and homes it wasn't the bedbug that bothered me (we always take precautions with our luggage no matter how fancy the hotel to make sure we don't take an uninvited guest home). What really bothered me was when I went down to the front desk and had a low-voiced conversation with one of the French owners who looked at me blankly and told me he had never heard of such a thing at his hotel. Not wanting to get into an argument and just wanting them to get rid of the bedbug and be alerted to the fact that they might have a hotel-wide issue on their hands I didn't push it since the staff came in and collected the towels and reportedly cleaned our bathroom (I'm not sure why) while we were away.    That was the last time the French owner (who I'd see in the lobby throughout the length of our stay) acknowledged it or my presence. After a week in Morocco where it was the warmth of the people that really stood out this was a cold surprise. This chilliness characterised this riad - with an indifference towards their guests from the owners that while to be expected in a large chain hotel was surprising in a riad in Morocco and especially after there having been an issue with one of its clients. There was zero attempts to either make amends or even ask if we were okay/if there had been any problems. One of the people traveling with me asked for water during the buffet breakfast the next morning and the response from the staff was that the water was ""over""! Brunch was on for another half hour.    There are hundreds of beautiful places to stay (both more and less fancy than this one) in Morocco in general and in Marrakech in particular. This was one of many options and it left a sour taste in our mouths with its attitude and indifference.",Date of stay: March 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,Toronto,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emdiar

Riad Karmela,Claire P wrote a review Mar 2010,50,We loved it!,Riad Karmela is a delightful and charming Riad. It makes an idyllic retreat from bustling city of Marrakesh. The shared spaces are well decorated with Morrocan inspired decor divided to give a feeling of intimacy with a number of small open fires adding to the charm . Our lovely room was one of the rooms pictured on the website and it looked over the original central court yard. This time of year the center of the Riad was quiet but I did wonder whether it might be more noisy in high season. We tried the massage and Hamam. This was a very relaxing experience but being washed by a a lad in his twenties wearing only short  was a rather unexpected and bizarre experience. My husband seemed more at ease with it. The food was genuinely really good and it's worth booking dinner for a least your first night. Joel is an excellent host who advised us well on the do's and don't of the city and where to eat.

Riad Karmela,kiriLondon wrote a review Feb 2010,20,Could do better!,Agreed with other reviews re some of the good points e.g. welcome was v good as was decor of the riad and the food was very good even for vegetarians. However my stay was spoiled by the following:    1) The Female wating staff at breakfast time were very rude and aggressively grumpy when we wanted to sit at a different table!!! terrible hospitality skills I was really angry about this considering how much we'd paid to stay at this riad.    2) Towels were not changed over our 3 night stay.    Little things do matter and these are actually pretty important factors. Because of these disappointments I would never go back there or recommend this riad. Time they worked on being nicer to all their clients not just a select few who they think will spend more money on extras.

We were led to a half-door (reminded me of a scene from Harry Potter!) and then we were led into this beautiful calm setting. Joel and his staff were fantastic - there when you needed them. Joel greets all his guests with welcoming mint tea and gives out sage advice and recommendations on arriva. Food was very good. Setting is excellent - very close to the Souks.

Riad Karmela,sowie wrote a review Feb 2010,50,A Wonderful place to stay,"My partner and I had a wonderful 5 night stay at this Riad and would recommend it without hesitation to any travellers wishing to get a real flavour of this enchanting old city.    We were picked up from the airport in a pre arranged taxi by a nice driver who helpfully showed us where to exchange money before running us from the outskirts of the city into the heart of the old Medina.    Having not visited Morocco before our first impressions were ""where on earth is he taking us?"" The little Fiat taxi wound though increasingly smaller  narrower and more densely backed streets and lanes until we finally stopped in a very small square near a mosque. From here our driver let us down dark streets and even darker alleys until we reached a small and unremarkable door which led into the Riad.    The inside of the Riad was sensational. Quiet tranquil and beautiful. We were offered a seat and served mint tea and small local pastries before completing the hotel registration and getting a map of the medina from a very helpful member of staff. We were then taken through to our room on the ground floor just off a central open courtyard. Our room consisted of a large room with double bed seating dressing table and hanging space. There was also an en suite bathroom with toiled hand basin and shower. The room had a safe which you programme yourself so security of personal money / passport etc isn't an issue.    We then went through to the dining area where we enjoyed a wonderful 3 course meal and a nice bottle of local white wine.    We ate at the hotel for a few nights (book a table in the morning) and can thoroughly recommend the food. My partners favourite meal was the lemon chicken while mine was a wonderful lamb dish rich and falling apart tender cooked with prunes and apricots.    Breakfast is served between 8 - 10am and you just help yourself. Tea / Coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice bread cheese honey jam etc also freshly looked pancakes / thin crumpets and a selection of cereals.    I took advantage of the in house hammam / massage that was so relaxing and just the thing for my aching legs after wandering around the souks all day!    Having arrived late in the evening we didnt leave the Riad until the following morning. The map you are given is best viewed as a guide so prepare to get lost!. Like everyone we spoke to during our stay we got lost within minutes of leaving the Riad.    Tip 1. When (not if!) you get lost don't panic. Few of the streets have name signs and all look quite similar at first. Just keep walking. Eventually you will find a landmark and be able to get your bearings. you will be approached numerous times by locals offing to guide you out or steer you to a friends shop. Either politely refuse their offer or accept and be prepared to offer a few dihrams as a thank you.    Tip 2. If you take up the offer of a guide be sure they take you to your destination before paying them. Dont let them take you somewhere and then inform you that your destination is just around the corner. It probably wont be! You will be lost again and have to pay someone else!    Tip 3. Haggling. You have to haggle for everything bar food and drink. Don't be phased by this. It's just the way it is done. Ignore the opening price the seller offers. This is usually way inflated. Your first offer should be way too low. Then the dance begins! Bear in mind what the cost might be in the UK and keep that as your absolute maximum price. If you can't agree a price simply thank the seller and walk away. 9 times out of 10 he will come after you with a better price    Tip 4. If you want a guideline price or simply dont want to haggle go to one of the fixed price shops. There is a very good one close to the central mosque (up the road from KFC and across the road from the cyber park)    Tip 5. (For smokers) UK brands are hard to find in Marrakesh. Buy cigs on the plane going out at £16 for 200. This is cheaper than buying at duty free in Marrakech airport (You can also buy on the plane returning to UK)    Tip 6. (For drinkers) There are not many places to buy beer or wine in the medina. Most cafes don't have an alcohol license. Expect to pay around £2.50 for a beer and £12 for a bottle of wine.    Tip 7. Visit the trip advisor Marrakech forum. It's chock full of great advice    Tip 8. Take a walk up to the roff of the Riad.

Excellent location that is best found by asking the Riad to book your taxi. Outside is a maze of lively backstreets with donkeysmopeds dogs and 'look my shop'. At the door you wonder where you are going but inside is a calm oasis that is a world away from the exterior. If breakfast was a little uninspired they can be forgiven and the fresh orange juice made up for it. Our room was large comfortable and the shower powerful though it did tend to flood the floor.

They had upgraded us to a suite such a welcoming friendly happy smiley team.

There are not enough adjectives to describe this Riad and the people that make it a wonderful place. yet another surprise on my birthday.

Joel gives you a lovely welcome and some good advice on where to go felt very safe throughout 5 days in Marrakech had 11 year old son with us and he loved it too. Food in Karmela is lovely although no choice for dinner they just bring you your meal starter of soup and main course tagine were delicious but our oranges with cream desert a bit unusual not a problem though as totally stuffed at that point. La Foundouk is gorgeous for food but is a bit pricey nice for a special meal. Joel told us to avoid the stalls in the medina which we did. I was a bit surprised at how expensive eating out in Marrakech is but I suppose like anywhere they cash in on the tourists. Get into haggling you will get better each time the trick is to walk away if your not happy with the price they will always come after you with a lower price. People generally very friendly didn't get harassed too much you do a bit in the medina but they leave you if you say No,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Musselburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljt1612
Riad Karmela,Wallibarbe wrote a review Jan 2010,50,Riad Karmela - A wonderland of peace and tranquility amid chaos and bedlam.,Riad Karmela  If you have ever wanted to stumble like Alice in Wonderland down a rabbit-hole to discover a different world here’s your chance. Marrakech is a wondrous experience giving an exciting flavour of what life might have been like – in any continent - many centuries ago. But when you enter the rabbit warren which leads to Riad Karmela you can have no concept of the surprise that awaits you as you stoop to enter that magical door. The warmth of the welcome the calm of the courtyard the serenity of the staff the beauty of the buildings all combine to make Riad Karmela a unique and unforgettable experience.    Joel and Phillippe have created a remarkable home for those lucky enough to have chosen to stay at Riad Karmela. The warm welcome and informal explanation of life in Marrakech accompanied by mint tea gave our apprehensive party of three (in our 60s)renewed enthusiasm to try new experiences. What we may have previously thought intimidating was revealed to us as a way of life into which we could smoothly fit if we observed a few simple principles. Following Joel’s advice we were able to venture confidently into the soukh take taxis haggle for purchases and eat local food.    Wherever you go there is always someone ready to complain – and when we’re on holiday we usually find them – if they don’t find us first. But at Riad Karmela we found no-one amongst a huge variety of guests any less satisfied than we were. This was a first for us.    Special mention:  Cuisine at Riad Karmela: if you like good food eat dinner at home in the Riad.  Majorelle Gardens - beautiful - and lunch in the café is satisfactory and reasonable.  Mammounia Hotel – no jeans or trainers. Elegance taste refinement….for us it was an opportunity to visit palatial grounds and gardens we’d have little likelihood of visiting in any other circumstances. Afternoon tea for a group of five was 240 Dirham – about £20  The same group of five in a horse-drawn carriage. It was fun haggling the price from 250 Dirham to just 75. Our driver (No 143) always greeted us warmly when we saw him several times subsequently.  Exploring the beautiful interlinked roof terraces of Riad Karmela  The staff at Riad Karmela: Joel seems to have infected them all with a will to make their guests feel special.  This was a remarkable and tantalising trip. Because it was all too short we’ll definitely go back. But if we couldn’t stay at Riad Karmela we wouldn’t go.

We had an equally superb stay another fantastic hammam and massage and many delicious meals in the Riad having now spent 2 weeks in Marrakesh I can hand on heart say the food in this Riad is superb the courgette soup is to die for.  The staff are fantastic and the attention to detail and customer service and friendliness of this place makes you want to return again and again.

Riad Karmela,jsymons1 wrote a review Jan 2010,50,"Interesting experience, the Raid was the calm in the storm",Joel was incredibly helpful he tried hard to sort us out ( You stay right in the thick of the Souk and are forever getting lost ! ) he made our stay enjoyable. We stayed in December so it was very chilly at night so bring warm clothes but the Raid had lovely open fires to sit round in the evening where you could drink a glass of the excellent house white at about £12.00 a bottle.  We went for the full on local massage experience etc at the Raid and I am glad we did that there as it was perfect and much better than going to another hotel. We also did the Quad biking with our 16 and 18 year old which went down well Joel fixed it all up for us.  The building and conversion is very attractive -they have done a good job - you feel safe.  We would recommend but may be not for very small children as they might find the souk a bit full on. There was a computer provided f.o.c which was useful and the breakfast and evening meal were pleasant.,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled with family,North Somerset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsymons1
Riad Karmela,Becky8206 wrote a review Dec 2009,40,Good Introduction to Morrocco,It was mind boggling when we decided to plan our own trip to Morrocco the choice of accommodation was overwhelming. We decided after research to stay in a Riad and I cam across Riad Karmela on Tripadvisor and decided to opt for this Riad.    Our stay didn't get off to the greatest start as there was a problem with our pickup from the airport which meant that we had to phone and were waiting at the airport for approximately 1.5 hours. When we eventually arrived at the hotel the owner attempted to say that this mistake was due to us not informing them of our plane time change but this was not the case as I had the printout confirming that they had received my email of the change of time.    Apart from this the stay was fantastic. The staff were fantastic but not obtrusive the riad location was perfect the riad was fabulous (great sun terrace to relax fantastic inhouse masseuse) great traditional food and the list goes on.    The only thing that I would point out is that the riad is not cheap to stay in. I was quiet surprised at how much our 3 night break ended up costing. I suppose in my innocence I had booked the break as a cheap quick break for me and my partner but in all honestly did not end up like this.    Bearing this in mind I would definately recommend but would wait to visit again myself as there are lots of other cities that are in the same price range that I am also interested in seeing.,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Plymouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becky8206
Riad Karmela,TallulahB wrote a review Dec 2009,40,Lovely large riad,Riad Karmela was by far the largest riad we stayed at. I would say it borders on being a boutique hotel in a riad style. The riad itself is very elegant and is a comfortable oasis but a tad impersonal . There were a lot of other guests there but the rooms are off in different directions so you don't hear all the people (although if you are in the room off the breakfast area I imagine there would be some noise). We could hear motorbikes and smell the smells of Marrakech as our wing had an open roof. Our twin room was well laid out and provided plenty of room for two travelers. The bathroom was very clean and there was a powerful shower. Although oddly enough there was no trash receptacle in the entire room. There was a hair dryer provided. There was a heater in the room which we could control and worked very well as it was December when we were there. The room however did not lock--just to note. Other riads with traditional doors provided us with a padlock.    The staff spoke French and some English.    The breakfast spread was a self-serve buffet heavy on bread products. The local birds also liked to partake in it. We ended up having dinner at the riad as well and the meal was very pleasant (but costly). They also made a quick sandwich for us one night even when we did not book in advance when we had problems finding a restaurant.    They have a computer in the sitting area for guests to use.    The location is down an alleyway which can be quite intimidating at night (and this is coming from a New Yorker). We were accosted by a young man in the alley one night and groped (we were two women traveling unchaperoned). It was annoying but nothing the riad can really do anything about.    Although the riad gave us a map of the medina it was truely useless (as are probably all maps--with our two guidebooks and that map we struggled with directions). But I think they could have given better directions based on landmarks rather than the map. We did follow the path the riad provided to the Djemaa el Fna. And found our way there however this was the path where we encountered the most harassment on the way back in the evening. Another path via the Ben Salah square was much safer and was always busy with other passersby. And we would recommend that route for all women.    Riad Karmela definitely offers a lovely respite from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. It is not far from the souks and Ben Youssef Medersa. Even a walk to the Djemaa el Fna is not far. I would recommend the riad to others if looking for a larger traditional style accomodation.,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TallulahB
Riad Karmela,andrea martin f wrote a review Dec 2009,50,Don't look at any more Riad's - book this one!!!,Before we booked our trip I must have gone through hundreds of descriptions and reviews of different riads and not knowing Marrakesh it was a bit difficult to decide on 'the one' . However in an earlier review for Riad Karmela someone wrote 'Stop and book this one' they were absolutely right.  We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Riad Karmela. It was everything we expected and more. Many of the reviews on this site tell you about this beautiful riad and even though there are many photos on the site you need to see it to believe it it really is fabulous. As far as we were concerned it is ideally located a short walk from the souks and the main square but far enough away from the frenetic and frantic madness and noise of them.  Our upgraded suite was gorgeous very comfortable and beautifully traditionally furnished (as was the whole riad) it had its own balcony overlooking the courtyard which was perfect. There are small comfortable lounges dotted around the riad where you can sit and relax with a glass of wine and as it was a little chilly in the evening the fires were lit which made it really cosy. We had a meal at the riad (booked on the afternoon we arrived) and that was delicious and the setting for dinner in the courtyard was very romantic with candles and Morrocan lamps and the mosaic fountain in the background. The rose and red wines are very good as well. The breakfast was also great a selection of different freshly baked breads jams honey cheese cereals and yoghurt with freshly squeezed mandarin or orange juice which gives you the energy that you will need to tackle all the haggling you will be doing in the souks!.  The staff were really nice not in your face but attentive all the same. It really is a lovely place to stay and we will definately definately be back,Date of stay: December 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Valencia, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Senorainspain

Riad Karmela,Faerfoxe wrote a review Nov 2009,50,"Loved it, wouldn't hesitate to return",I'm so bad at posting these on time. I can't believe nearly a year has gone since we were here!    We stayed in the Riad Karmela from 9th to 16th December 2008 a time that included the festival of Eid al-Adha. This caused a little disruption as fewer staff meant that the meal we'd booked for the first night was unavailable until the next day but this was very well compensated for by a speedily-made restaurant reservation in the lovely Fondouk (not cheap but excellent value) and a free upgrade to a lovely suite the Haroune. It's easy to praise an establishment when all goes right but how things are handled when there are problems separates great places from not-so-great ones. Riad Karmela is a great place.    The photos on the riad's website are a very good reflection of the quality of the accomodation; the roof terrace is just stunning the perfect place to catch sun or shade & on a clear day you can see the Atlas mountains from the trellis area. The courtyard is equally beautiful especially at night when the candles are lit. We only ate at the Riad once on the second night but it was absolutely delicious and smelled fantastic on other evenings too.    The location is superb very close to the souks yet away from the touristy side of things. There's a local shop with price-marked products (blessed relief after the souks!) where you can get bottled water and other essentials very reasonably priced.    I found everyone at the riad to be friendly professional and extremely knowledgeable about the area with lots of information about local tours etc but with no hard sell. special mention to Nadia and Phillipe who bore my clumsy mangling of his native tongue with the patience of a saint ;) (English is very well spoken in the Riad but I wanted to practice my French - and oh boy did I need practice!) I wouldn't hesitate to book again should we return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: December 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Newport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Faerfoxe

Riad Karmela,JanRam wrote a review Nov 2009,50,Quiet Oasis,Riad Karmela is a quiet oasis hidden behind high walls and small alleys. Once you step through the door the hustle and bustle of the outside world disappears.  It is ideally located with the souks and main square a short walk away and once you have got your head around the narrow little streets and alleys it is easy to find.  They will help you organise trips to the coast and mountains with good drivers. We had two enjoyable trips out to Essouria and the Atlas Mountains.  We ate in the riad on a few nights as we found the food outside of the riad to be very ordinary.  It was lovely to relax on the roof terrace in the afternoon and evening after being out for long day.  My friends and I were in room Haroune which slept four it was a bit dark and noisy but we did peek into other rooms as they were being cleaned and they looked beautifully decorated and spacious.  If I was to go back to Marrakech I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone else.,Date of stay: October 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanRam
Riad Karmela,ITRAVEL4ALIVING wrote a review Nov 2009,50,Peace and tranquility in a great location,We booked Riad Karmela because of it's reputation on tripadvisor and were not disappointed.    Entered via very narrow dusty and chaotic streets you are suddenly tranported in to the most beautiful cool tranquil central yard with a fountain and fruit trees. The height of the building walls means the sun rarely beats down on the yard keeping it beautifully cool even when the temperature outside the Riad was in the 30's.    Each bedroom is slightly different but going by the one we chose (Laila) they are well proportioned nicely furnished and again pleasantly cool.    As this is a private house there is no official restaurant but a good quality continental breakfast is served in the courtyard and dinner can be arranged on request.    If you are planning a city break to Marrakech this is the perfect place to stay being just 5 minutes from the frenetic madness of the souks.

Riad Karmela,Midlife traveller wrote a review Oct 2009,30,lovely Riad but....,The riad is extremely beautiful and tasteful very stylish. It is in a good location about 10 mins walk from the main square. The staff are lovely and very friendly. The hammam experience was fantastic as was the masage (thanks Laila!) and the roof terrce is superb. The roof jacuzzi was absolutley FREEZING though so you will have it to yourself!    However two things let this place down. First the food is very average compared to other places we ate especially the next hotel we stayed at where the food was incredible. Secondly although Joel (the owner) is pleasant enough he seems distraced and looks at you very strangely when you ask the most normal tourist question. There were a couple of things we mentioned which were fixed only on the last of our 3 night stay - shower tap that didnt work properly (no hot water) and no lamp/light on the private balcony that we paid extra for so we couldnt sit out there. We did mention these things as soon as we arrived. I expected better service to be honest. Also the bed was very hard indeed.    I think this place is over confident of its ability to fill up and has started to be a little bit resting on its laurels. If I were to go back to Marrakesh I dont think id' stay here again. But then Im not sure id stay in a Riad for all that they are beautiful and authentic there is no minibar/fridge no TV and no room service so when you wake at 630 you have no drink until breakfast at 830 and everytime you want a drink you have to get dressed and go and find a member of staff.

Riad Karmela,JULDublin wrote a review Sep 2009,50,Loved Karmela and Riad El Nour!,Our first trip to Marrakech was a truly memorable one. Although we stayed in Riad El Nour we had full use of the facilities in Riad Karmala and it felt no more than an annex to the main building. Both Joel and beautiful Nadia were more than helpful when we needed information of any kind. They kept a professional distance but seemed always to be in the backround and available to help.  Our ground floor room was lovely opening onto the courtyard where breakfast was served although slightly lacking in privacy we were conscious that Joel had selected a more spacious room for us as we were staying for a longer period than most.  Evening meal which we had on only one of our 5 evenings was very relaxed and enjoyable.  Both properties are beautifully decorated and have various 'lounging' areas to relax with a drink sunbathe or to simply enjoy the peace and tranquility.  Taxi drivers arranged by the Riad were all incredibly friendly and I would suggest this option to future guests as our experience of some other taxi drivers was not quite as positive!  I would highly recommend both Riads and their staff to all.,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled on business,Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JULDublin
Riad Karmela,ccascun wrote a review Sep 2009,50,Stop reading reviews and book,We booked at Riad Karmela for the last 3 days of our holiday. May be a bit hard to find (like everything else in all the narrow streets of Medina) so make sure you follow the directions they give you. It's only 5/10mins walk from the main square. As soon as we got there we were greeted by Joel given some mint tea and that's when 3 relaxing days started. He gave us a tour of the riad. It has free internet 2 courtyards with a small jacuzzi hammam massage room a comfortable lounge and a lovely terrace which also has a jacuzzi deck chairs lounge and breakfast area. I was in the blue room. Very spacious bedroom and large bathroom (shower only) a/c bottled water changed every day and enough towels (shower gel etc are not provided don't think they provide them in any hotel in marrakech tho).    Joel recommended 2 restaurants - Le Fondouk (Moroccan) and La Trattoria (Italian) - both where delicious and easy to find.... and safe! We didn't get the chance to try the food at the riad but breakfast was good. We also booked a tour via the Riad. We went to Ourika valley... taxi driver called for us at the riad. It was great. The only problem was the tajine I ate from the restaurant recommended by the taxi driver. Apparently it's the safest but it didn't work out that way in my case. Anyway that's nothing to do with the riad.    On the last day me and my partner booked the hammam - scrub + full body massage - at the riad. It was great and just what we needed to finish off our holiday! We asked for some sandwiches to be prepared after the massage since we had to leave immediately to the airport. So that can be done as well. Before you leave I suggest that you book a taxi from the riad. It may be a bit more expensive but you avoid all the hassle of walking to the main square cos the taxi comes at a closer square (Ben Saleh) .    You got my point... I recommend it!!,Date of stay: September 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccascun

Definitely arrange to be picked up by the hotel taxi the place would be hard to find on your own. The taxi parks several blocks from the hotel and then the taxi driver walks you the rest of the way which was not a problem only made arrival more interesting...  The riad is very nice very calm and relaxing. We liked our room on the second floor and it was larger than it looked on the website. You can sit in the central courtyard - very pleasant at night - or on the roof. Internet access in a common area worked consistently and well.

We were greeted with Moroccan tea and pastries after we had taken in the beautiful scenery of the orange trees little turtle (what a delight) and the tranquil water piece!    Nadia and Phillipe were amazing! We couldn't have asked for more everything we would have wanted to know or ask about was addressed in the most thoughtful and informative manner before we were given a guided showing to our room and the rest of the Riad.  This would be home for a few days!    The website for Riad Karmela shows a tranquil and relaxing haven away from the busy streets of Marrakech. What can be seen from the website is an understatement!    The staff were amazing! They made an effort to ask us everyday if we would like to have dinner at the Riad during the evenings so that they could prepare through-out the day. First off - if you get a chance to eat here - do! The food is INCREDIBLE! Home cooked with amazing flavours served with much care and manners as any 4 or 5 star restaurant! The staff do an amazing job - the center courtyard is transformed into an amazingly serene and romantic ambiance for dinner with mood lighting and wine if you so desire!    After a few tries me and my partner decided we felt no need to experience dinner anywhere else - it was way to nice and relaxing to eat at Riad Karmela.    Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were able to arrange taxis directions a bottle of wine or drinks field questions organise spa treatments and offered as much help in the most polite and friendly manner. Staying here felt like we were both friends and/or Queens and Kings!!!    We were given the Aicha standard room - it was very quaint and the small details were lovely - the tiled bathroom and cast iron on the windows looking to the courtyard!    If I could find anything to complain about I would be really have to be picking - but the room can let a little noise in at times - however this IS Marrakech and any sound is of the culture and the city and something to be experienced!    Also the lack of locking the doors may concern some however the whole time I was here I felt very safe and in a secure location.    Besides the absolute outstanding patronage of the staff the Riad itself is very well-taken care of - it is obviously a product of passion for the owners. It is clean well-kept and deliberately made for it's stayers to feel welcome relaxed and comfortable.    After a few days of experiencing the busy Souks and finding our way through the bland Guerliz we decided to stay the whole day at the Riad and relaxed atop with wine and olives - I don't think I had quite feltl this relaxed on a holiday in many years!    I would love to go back to Marrakech again just to stay at this Riad.    I thank the staff Phillipe & Nadia for their attentiveness and their beautiful home/Riad and only apologise it has taken me this long to write a review! Ten Stars stay here if you go to Marrakech you could not possibly be disappointed! In fact book a trip to Marrakech just to stay here!!!,Date of stay: March 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kerrie_E
Riad Karmela,GoodtoGoSwitzerland wrote a review Jun 2009,50,WOW-now THIS is a vacation,We stayed with the Riad in June of 2009. From the moment we arrived we were in for a treat. Knowing fully that this was a Riad and not a hotel we got MORE than we expected. The staff Nadia Joel Jimela Abdou..all incredibly helpful welcoming and warm. We were especially delighted to find a huge dinner with music and dancing planned the day after we arrived! We have plans to return with friends!    We stayed in one of the other nearby properties (but had full access to all of the services in the mail Riad) but enjoyed the trip back and forth feeling as if moving around the streets was just part of the overall experience.    Centrally located and convenient this is a GREAT Riad.,Date of stay: June 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodtoGoSwitzerland
Riad Karmela,James M wrote a review Jun 2009,50,Sweet Marrakech,We stayed in Riad Karmela which is in a great location North East of the Jma El Fna square in the medina. A short walk from the square either through the Souk or another choice of winding alleys brings you to a solid looking door behind which is a tranquil retreat from the excitement of Marrakech. The roof terrace which looks out over the city is the perfect place to soak up some desert sun in the afternoon or to relax on the cushioned seating in the shade. There's also a jacuzzi which offers a little temparature control in the hot sun. Our room was beautiful with a four poster bed and a balcony which overlooked the courtyard. The owner and staff were all friendly and very accommodating. I would highly recommend Riad Karmela to anyone wishing to visit Marrakech.,Date of stay: June 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stool
Riad Karmela,nushka50 wrote a review Jun 2009,40,Great Riad in a busy Medina,We have just returned from four days at the Riad Karmela. It is tucked away in the Medina within walking distance of the Jemma El Fna square (8 mins). The Staff and owner are very friendly efficient and speak perfect English. Day trips from the Riad can be organised we visited Ourika Valley a great trip and it gets you away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a day. It has a beautiful courtyard a roof terrace for sunbathing with a small dip pool to cool down in when in need of a rest from the souks. The contrast between the peacefulness of the riad and the lively bustle outside is wonderful. Dinner is recommended; we had a fabulous fish Tagine on our first night. The Riad is a peaceful calm retreat It is very good value I would recommend Riad Karmela to anyone who wants to stay within the old Medina and experience what Marrakech is all about.,Date of stay: May 2009,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Enniskerry, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nushka50
Riad Karmela,Bina08 wrote a review May 2009,30,Food and prices in Riad are the worst parts but otherwise nice,Suprised my husband with a holiday for his birthday. Not what I expected to be honest. Thought it would be more for tourists but is a proper village. However its about 8 minutes walk to the main square where there are stalls and a few restaurants so its close for this. Firstly the flight was delayed and awful flying with easy jet. Got to the riad later than expected. The first thing was we were told there was a mix up with the rooms. We had a choice of two rooms. We saw one which is in another building opposite and the other building is like a minutes walk but noone opened the door so we settled for the first one. I requested a double room but got 2 single beds put together. The standard room was not what i expected. Quite small and no toilet door just a thin sheet. We were given the suite for the last two nights which was lovely and worth staying in a suite. There are no locks on the outside for the doors. No room card or key. People can walk in and out but it seemed pretty safe to leave it unlocked. They have a safe in the room for valuables. For food there is no menu!! For about £18 it is a set menu. For me as a vegetarian there is a very limited selection. I got a morrocon salad which is seansoned vegetables and Veg Tajine which is cooked vegetables mainly potato with seasoning mainly. My husband who eats meat had chicken Tajine twice and lamb tajine for the 3rd meal. The food was definatley overpriced and not very nice at all. Dont get me started on the drinks !! A glass of wine is about £10 and a vodka and mixer is about £7. Horrendous prices. We asked for a massage and Hammam but on the day were told the Hammam was not working but the massage was very relaxing and lovely. The staff were really friendly. Nadia as mentioned in other reviews is very lovely and Mohammed is also very helpful. They organised some lovely excursions. Overall nice Riad and nice people but not nice food and definately not nice prices !!!!!!,Date of stay: May 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bina08
Riad Karmela,holidaygal28 wrote a review Apr 2009,50,Fantastic experience!,Cannot recommend this place enough! The Riad was magical a peaceful haven in the madness of Marrakech. The short walk to the Jeema-El-Fna through the souks was a daily treat but returning to the Riad after a hectic day touring & fending off sellers was wonderful. We ate at the Riad twice during our stay and the food is highly recommended definitely the best local cuisine! All the staff are friendly & more than happy to help. We stayed in the Kaiss suite which I'd recommend as it has a balcony overlooking the courtyard.,Date of stay: April 2009,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holidaygal28
Riad Karmela,ExplorerLausanne wrote a review Mar 2009,50,Great service and ambiance,We were three women (three generations) staying at Riad Karmela. Overall it was one step above the other riads we saw. The Riad is very calm cozy and charming. The service is impeccable and very friendly. They work with a network of very competent and trustworthy guides and drivers who can provide a great experience whatever you want to do. The food at Riad Karmela was the best we had during the whole trip with carefully selected and freshly cooked ingredients (compared with the precooked and reheated food in many other places).

Riad Karmela,James G wrote a review Dec 2008,50,Great place for a buisness retreat,This is the second time I have stayed at Riad Karmela. The first time was a romantic getaway in January. This time with 8 business colleagues escaping from London for a weekend of pampering and bonding. Right from the start being collected from the airport and guided down the narrow twisty streets. Being welcomed with a beaming smile and a hot steaming mint tea.  Nadia and the team made us most welcome we also took over the Riad opposite El Nour and stayed up late into the night talking.  The home cooked food is excellent and great value for money the Riad beautiful.  I would thoughly recomend both Riad Karmela and Riad Elnour and if I had one criticism the rooms can be a little cold at night.

Riad Karmela,Debbie H wrote a review Dec 2008,50,What fantastic accommodation!!,Everything about our stay at this riad was fantastic. They arranged for us to be met at the airport which was great and the taxi drivers they use are polite and helpful. The riad is STUNNING. Our room was fabulous and the bathroom was lovely. The courtyard and roof terrace are amazing and we really enjoyed coffee on the roof in the afternoons. The food is great both breakfast and evening meal. The best thing about the riad as far as we were concerned (aside from the fantastic decor!) was Nadia who works on reception. She is SO lovely and helped us with everything - where to go what to do and not to do in the Medina. She could not have been more helpful. I am looking forward to coming back to Marrakesh and will definitely be staying at Riad Karmela.

Riad Karmela,goondie88 wrote a review Dec 2008,50,Magical,I was just here at the end of November and this place is absolutely magical. The courtard of the riad is truly lovely and the staff are very thoughtful. When we first arrived we were upgraded (at no extra cost) to a larger room because (I believe it was Phillipe) thought we'd have more privacy there. The details make the difference - there are magazines everywhere to help you relax on the grounds. Sipping a glass of wine with pickled olives as a snack in the courtyard at night was tryuly enchanting. I would definitely return here.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,boston,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goondie88
Riad Karmela,HighPeakStation wrote a review Nov 2008,40,stunning space and helpful staff,Riad Karmela made our two short nights/1 day in Marrakech exceptionally easy. After a delayed flight we were picked up from Menara airport by a very upbeat driver who took us through the maze of streets in the medina to a great dinner at the riad. The place was just as it is on the website an oasis of space and calm in the madness. Nadia and her staff were great suggesting restaurants a local hammam maps etc. Apart from a slight misunderstanding on when we should settle up our bill prior to an early departure (we were unaware the reception was closed) the experience was fantastic and I would recommed Karmela to anyone travelling as a couple or small group (we were 6).

Riad Karmela,MendipBristol wrote a review Nov 2008,50,A little gem in the Madina,We stayed in Riad Karmela for 4 nights in a splendid junior suite on the first flor with a lovely sunny balcony overlooking the courtyard and orange trees  The suite was decorated in the most stunning colours yellow and red with beutifull ornaments and vases to enhance the effect.  On our first evening we enjoyed an excellent Morocan 3 course meal in the Riad. On other evenings we ventured out to eat out locally in the Madina but consider the Riad fare very good value for money and the local wine provided was excellent. We could also take advantage or our lovely balcony after a hard days sight seeing to rest and enjoy a bottle of the hotel's wine together with nuts and olives all of which were served by freindly and attentive staff.  Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for the Riad staff to organise and we took advantage of a trip organised by them to visit a local Berber market and the Atlas mountains already covered in snow.  We had an wonderful stay in Riad Karmela and loved the lemon chicken tagine served for dinner and the fabulous chocolate cake served for breakfast on our last day. We hope to return one day.,Date of stay: November 2008,,Bristol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MendipBristol

A beautiful room nicely decorated and with a good-sized bathroom. We also had our own balcony looking down at the courtyard.

Riad Karmela,RR325RR wrote a review Nov 2008,30,"Beautiful place, okay service","As others have mentioned this riad is beautiful and Nadia is very helpful and welcoming. However I was unimpressed with other aspects of the service:  -My family members were coming to the riad after me and they got lost. Then my mobile phone ran out of minutes and yet Philippe refused to let me use the front desk's phone. Given that it was an urgent situation this lack of hospitality surprised me.  -When I asked for help turning on the heat in my room he said that ""nobody else is using heat"" as though I should not want it either.  -At night I found myself in a somewhat uncomfortable situation slightly lost walking back from dinner and the night employee refused my request to meet my group at the street corner claiming he was the only person there.  -The night employee and Philippe spoke essentially no English. While I was there the other guests were Swedish (speaking English) Scottish British and French.

Riad Karmela,DrSAH wrote a review Nov 2008,50,3rd time in Morroco - best riad yet,Just back from a week at the Riad Karmela in Marrakech. Despite 2 days of torrential rain we had a great time. Booked the Haroum suite for myself wife and 2 kids - direct via email with Nadia at the riad. Taxi waiting at airport lovely meal on first night. The suite was great with 2 bedrooms (aircon & heating) a sitting room (with TV + DVD) and bathroom (shower). The main thing that sets this riad apart from the others I've stayed in are the public areas. A cool central court yard with a variety of sofas or tables next to a small pool (bit to cold to use in November). A sitting room/dining room - with open log fire (nice in November) and a superb roof-top terrace. This had a great mixture of sunloungers tables deck chairs a jacussi and a partially shaded sitting area. We spent almost the whole of the warm days lapping up the last of the Autumn sun. The staff too are delightful - nothing is too much. especial thanks to Nadia. The riad is within minutes of the souks and there are several small and friendly food shops directly opposite - for drinks chocolate and even fresh bread.

Riad Karmela,Pisces718 wrote a review Nov 2008,50,Amazing! Loved it!,"Words cannot express how much we loved this Riad and it's sister property (just down the lane) Riad el Nour. Nadia and staff were wonderfully helpful and attentive. The food in the riad was great (although we only opted to have it once the evening we arrived) and we enjoyed wine every evening in the riad's common areas (rooftop etc). My friend lost her camera bag while we were there and they very kindly emailed us after the fact to return it... our entire stay was lovely and had that ""personal"" touch. The room was fantastic (we stayed in Zahia in the Riad el Nour)--clean warm pretty and perfect for two gals on a weekend holiday. The property itself is located in a slightly quieter area of the old town which is a PLUS I promise you and you're only about 10 minutes from the Jemaa al Fna and all the rest.

Riad Karmela,Stevelux wrote a review Nov 2008,40,An oasis in the middle of the middle ages,My wife and I had an excellent stay at the Karmela. From the moment we were picked up from the airport to the final moments of our stay everything went like clockwork. The Riad is located in the old part of the city and after being led down dark alleys by the taxi driver you come to the door set in a humble wall. You enter a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of nomal Marrakech life outside. The room was large clean and overlooked the central courtyard. It had a/c which we used to heat as it was a little cool at the time of year. The trips organised by the Karmela staff were on time hosted by friendly drivers and good value for money as were the 'in house' massages. If you want to feel the true Marrakech as soon as you step outside you are in a market street for townspeople. You can find your way around without a guide and are not to hassled as you walk around the souks. We will definately go back and would stay at the Karmela again.,Date of stay: October 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Zanzibar Island, Tanzania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevelux
Riad Karmela,FloCor1975 wrote a review Nov 2008,50,"Perfect, unobtrusive, friendly - a fantastic place to stay",We are just back from stay at Riad Karmela - it was perfect. We stayed in one of the suites as there were four girl friends so that worked perfectly. We pre-ordered a taxi to pick us up from the airport which is a must - the taxi driver was there waiting for us on arrival. Once at the Riad we felt very at home the staff are fantastic but not 'in your face' - they leave you in peace unless you need their help. Nadia was so friendly and helpful. We had supper there on one evening which was delicious - particularly the puddings!    The weather when we were there was not fantastic and on one day we got totally soaked and the Riad dried and ironed our clothes for no charge which was so kind of them.    There was a review previously about the cost of the taxis - I would happily pay what the Riad charges (15 euros) to the airport - its peace of mind you don't have to haggle they take your luggage to the taxi rank - can't imagine the other reviewers taxi driver was so helpful.    Would totally recommend this Riad and if we go back which I really hope we do I will definately stay here again.,Date of stay: November 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Evanton, Scotland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FloCor1975

It is truly a place of calm and beauty in the midst of the Medina. Nadia Philippe Joel and staff are very welcoming and nothing is too much trouble. Our suite was lovely and the decor typically Moroccan we especially loved our own roof terrace where we could just chill out.  Although breakfast is continental - as you would expect - it is sufficient and our request (most mornings) for omelettes and boiled eggs (done perfectly for 4 minutes) was always met willingly.  The taxi arranged by the Riad to meet and return us to the airport was waiting on time - as were other taxis we had throughout our stay.

Riad Karmela,Marc L wrote a review Oct 2008,50,Great Stay,I am really surprised about some of the comments.  I stayed there a weekend and it was absolutely perfect!    We arrived very late (1am) but the our taxi driver was there as promised and very friendly.  He showed us the main Must see buildings and explained us the architecture of Marrakech on the way to the Riad (which took like 10 min). I really recommend that you take their taxi.    I was informed that we got upgraded to a better suite a couple days before we arrived and it was just beautiful and very clean. I have nothing to say about the room expect that it was perfect.    It is true that the top floor Jaccuzy was kinda dirty but what do you expect? it's on the top floor! You are not going into a 5* hotel with 50people cleaning it everyday. It's a Riad. The air temperature was not hot enough to get in anyway .    Breakfast was good nothing extraordinary but good enough. It could be maybe a little more Moroccan. Even if it was supposed to be closed because we were very late we were given plenty of time to eat peacefully.    The hammam and massages were great. You have to ask them in advance to get into the hammam since it takes a couple hours to get hot.    Nadia and Phillipe were adorable very friendly and very helpful.  They helped us to find our way in the Medina and made a reservation at a restaurant close by (Foundouk - Awesome).    -----------------  Just a little comment for the English speaking people traveling abroad. Do not expect everybody to speak your own language the world just doesn't work like that. Each country has its own culture habits and language.

She spent some time going through the area and made sure we had everything we needed. The room was lovely although it wasnt the room we were told we woulld have and I also had the best massage ever during my stay!    Unfortunately there were a couple of down sides. The breakfast was very basic very little choice and not very appetising for the price we paid. We stayed at another establishment for 1 night during our stay that cost less than half the price and the breakfast was fab. I found the plunge pool and the jacuzzi to be dirty and therefore didnt use them. I also found that the older gentleman that was on reception occasionally who I assume is the manager to be rude and very uninterested in guests. Not quite sure why he is working in a guest house!!

Riad Karmela,DublinProfessor wrote a review Oct 2008,20,Hugely disappointing,"Let's start with the positives; Riad Karmela is certainly a beautiful building. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed. The massage according to my girlfriend was the best she ever had. Our hostess Nadia was very welcoming and extremely helpful  to us as were all the Moroccan staff.    The two gentlemen proprietors could learn quite a few things from Nadia sadly. We were at no point made to feel welcome; there was no attempt to offer any of the kind of basic courtesy usually extended to guests in an establishment like this one.    When our bill arrived we found that we had been overcharged; when we queried this they were reluctant to take our word and made us feel like we were trying to get something for nothing.    The breakfast buffet strangely did not appear every morning; when we asked we were told that it was put out only when the Riad was full (when it was not it was basically tea a roll and yoghurt - hardly a ""full breakfast""). We had simliar difficulties with the hotel's taxi service as mentioned by another TripAdvisor member. One of the proprietors was rude and condescending when we decided not to take their taxi.    It is a nice place but for the money you could get somewhere as nice and where you might actually be made to feel welcome..    Finally some advice for Riad Karmela - it is arrogant to assume that your guests do not speak your language. The dismissive remarks spoken (by one of the proprietors) in French to a staff member when we returned to collect our luggage were not appreciated.",Date of stay: September 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DublinProfessor
Riad Karmela,dbolger wrote a review Sep 2008,50,Fantastic stay,Marrakech is a full-on colourful noisy aromatic place. If you are going there then you really need to be in the thick of things to appreciate the culture which means the Medina. And if you do stay in the Medina you will need a safe and comfortable haven to retreat to at the end of a hot old day.    Riad Karmela is one of the more civilised places that we have stayed in on our many travels. Situated in the thick of the action but behind its door all is calm. We were more than happy with our accomodation which was extremely comfortable and in keeping with the architecture. We enjoyed our breakfasts and dined on the roof terrace on a couple of evenings in some style.    The ambience created by the environment and especially by the staff was very relaxing and allowed us to achieve a wonderful balance between the hurly burly of the Medina and the peacefulness of our sanctuary.    We had a great time and congratulate the staff on providing us with a such high standard of customer care and making us feel so welcome in the midst of Ramadan when they were all observing the tradition to fast while we were enjoying ourselves.

Riad Karmela,Colinclassique wrote a review Sep 2008,50,Our 1001 Nights,This 5 day visit was simply to get away from everyday life for a little. Riad KArmela came up to everything we expected.  From the initial contact by telephone the warmth and friendliness was already apparent.  Knowing the difiiculties of arriving in Marrakech at the airport the Riad arranged transportation which was already there and waiting on our arrival. We also used this for our return to the airport. We loved the authenticity of the Riad and the beautiful Morrocan decor. We were happy the first evening to be able to dine enjoying a wonderful Tagine al fresco. On other evenings we were happy to take the advice of the owner Philippe as to where we should eat. The main Piazza was only 8 minutese walk from the Riad through an exciting maze of streets and markets.  It was very relaxing in the afternoons to be able to sit on the terrace and sunbathe. The Riad had also a small Hammam and we were able to arrange massages by a very fine masseur each day.  Thr reception desk were very happy to give advice as needed but before arrival already sent a comprehensive letter of information which would be excellent for a first time visitor to Morocco.

Riad Karmela,sunshineenjoyer wrote a review Sep 2008,20,not that nice,after reading the good reviews  we decided to book in this riad. We got an appartment for 4. It is true  the riad is in the middle of the medina and is still very quiet. The 4 of us who are big travellers were really disappointed. The patio is really nice but our rooms weren t impressive: dark and with a strange smell. the breakfast wasn t great at all: bread was disguting ( and trust me it si easy to get good one in this country!!!). Then our return flight was at 8.45am and asked if we could get something to drink in the morning before going. The owner wasnt happy after our request ( even if we were paying 200eur per night for B&B)and first denied then said that something will be prepared. In the morning surprise...he left us cold coffee on a table with plastic bread!!!!...oh I nearly forgot the best part: a man that we met in the city offered us to go to the airport he was so friendly that we accepted; when we told the owner of the riad that we didnt need his taxi (20eur) he nearly did a nervous breakdown even if we had never asked for it. Well If you re not posh...stay somewhere else. The rest of the staff (marrocan) is really nice though.,Date of stay: September 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Saint Louis, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshineenjoyer

I would def recommend Riad Karmela to everybody it was our perfect piece of heaven so peaceful & tranquil away from the hustle & bustle & for very good money too & i want to go back now instead of being at work & dreaming about it!! It's not far from the main square 7-10mins walk max & we didn't get lost once trying to find our way homebut it would be very easy too.Thank you so very very much to all of you guys for making our holiday very special.

Riad Karmela,lyd01 wrote a review Sep 2008,50,a haven of peace in a city on speed!,Marrakech is a crazy. We arrived in July so in the searing heat after a week in Essaouira (where temperatures are much lower) and immediately were being pestered by shopkeepers flies and everything else that crowds the city of marrakech. The Riad Karmela however is utterly peaceful. From the moment you head off the road down a quiet alley and through a door made for dwarfs the atmosphere changes completely to one of utter serenity. The rooms are decorated incredibly stylishly yet with respect to traditional moroccan design and seem more like little apartments than rooms. There is also a spectacular balcony upstairs with a cooler seating area that looks out over the roofs of Marrakech. At the end of a long sticky day in the magnificent but busy centre there was nothing anyone could possibly look forward to more than a dip in one of the two mini plunge pools and some moroccan mint tea.    I shall definitely be returning here!,Date of stay: July 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,South West,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lyd01
Riad Karmela,NishaLeidschendam wrote a review Sep 2008,50,A hidden little gem,A hidden little gem of a place situated totally unexpectedly amidst the chaotic bustle of narrow streets. My heart sank as our taxi driver negotiated the alleys which sometimes seemed barely wide enough for a moped let alone a 4 x 4. I wondered what we had let ourselves in for. Finally we stopped at a square in the already searing morning heat to find a porter waiting with a cart to take our bags to the hotel a 5 min. walk away through ever narrowing and gloomier alleyways. Then suddenly we stopped at a low ancient looking doorway through we stooped into the most gorgeous little courtyard. It was a perfect little oasis after having done the circuit and summit of Toubkal. Everyone was very friendly helpful and efficient. We were more than happy with the quality of the rooms. It is not always easy to find something for a family of 5 but we stayed in a beautiful little 'suite' for 4 with an extra bed made up. And thank God for the air-conditioning! We stayed for 3 nights and apart from the occasional forays into the souks or to Jemma El Fna square I stayed in and savoured the peace and quiet of the place.,Date of stay: August 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,Leidschendam,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NishaLeidschendam
Riad Karmela,Bobbylad wrote a review Sep 2008,40,Lovely Welcome to Marrakech,Karmela is one of a staggering amount of beautiful riads in Marrakech. Trying to choose one above another can be a little confusing.    You'll find more luxurious riads and more beautiful riads but karmela still makes an excellent choice. It's location is great for exploring the staff are delightfully friendly and helpful the food is good and the price point is very competitive.

Riad Karmela,lou05 wrote a review Sep 2008,50,Loved Riad Karmela,We have recently returned from a 5 night stay in Morocco; 2 of those were at the Riad Karmela. You arrive at the Riad to an old wooden door down a (safe) alley. On opening the door you step into an oasis; the sound of trickling water in the pool and comfy sofas organised around the patio. We had some pastries and the best Moroccan mint tea of our whole stay. The rooms are luxurious and very clean. We couldn't have dinner at the hotel on the first night as planned (the oven was broke) but was recommended a very good riad restaurant only 5 mins away. The main square is only an 8 minute walk away and very easy and safe to walk to/from at night. We finished both nights on the beautiful terrace with a glass of wine or Flag beer.

The food from the hotel dinner i had one night was THE BEST! (Ask for the deer with peaches and dates...)    When i go back i will be staying atleast 1 - 2 weeks with this Riad (or possibly in the 'Le Sultan' suite at their sister house - Make sure you ask about it... very cool secluded spot)    If i had to say anything negative...5 minutes later i'm still thinking...Oh - maybe a fridge in your room would be nice? but they let you use their fridges in the kitchen anyway...So i really can't say anything negative - These guys even posted me some stuff i left behind in the rush for the airport!

Riad Karmela,Mandy P wrote a review Jul 2008,40,Fantastically Peaceful Stay,Riad Karmela helped make our stay in Marrekech wonderful.    I booked it after reading the fantastic reviews as we wanted to stay somewhere that would give us a traditional and more moroccan experience rather than a bog-standard hotel outside the Medina. We were *not* disappointed in the slightest...    The riad is located on a side street about 10 mins walk from Jemaa Al Fna and in the middle of the chaotic Souks. Although once inside the riad it is hard to imagine that you are surrounded by chaos. It has a very peaceful and serene feel to it with hardly any noise.    We booked to stay in Aisha room but unfortunately the A/C was having problems so they put us in the Oum Kaltoum apartment - which was absolutely AMAZING! The decor is stunning with extra authentic touches everywhere. We did stay in the Aisha room for one night which was equally stunning. The rooms are much better than most of the 5-star hotels we have stayed in.    The staff were fantastic in accommodating our needs. We really appreciated their efforts especially with our CONSTANT request for Mint Tea!!! - almost every night when we got back after dinner we shared a pot of mint tea in the courtyard before bed and relax a bit which was just lovely.    I would recommend pre-booking a taxi through the riad to save any problems or hassle on arrival to Marrekech. We also booked the day trip to Ourika Valley through the riad (about 90 Euros) which was FANTASTIC and worth the extra cost. The driver spoke very good english and was able to answer all our questions. And the 1hr30min hike around the waterfalls was great.    Definitely recommend it.

Riad Karmela,Ember26 wrote a review Jul 2008,50,"Very nice place, great service",I went to Riad Karmela with my family.  We were 8 people and we spent our Christmas holidays there.  Among all the riads that are available in Marrakech I chose this one because it had a good quality/price ratio.    The place is really nice. When we got in through the small entrance door... wow! we thought we were in a small paradise.    The patio has a jacuzzi orange trees sofas tables and a fireplace. Very relaxing.  The rooms are not luxurious but cosy and well decorated.    And the most important thing:  the owners helped us a lot when we where in trouble!    A few months before arriving at Marrakech we had booked a big 4X4 car for a seven days trip in the High Atlas. The car agency (I cannot remember its name) was supposed to bring us the car at Riad Karmela the day of the check out but...... Surprise! There was no car waiting for us! The rent-a-car agency just called us the very same day they were supposed to give us the car saying they were sorry but they had no car available for us.    Well the owners of Riad Karmela found a 4x4 car for us which is almost impossible during peak season such as Christmas and new year's eve.    If it was not for Riad Karmela our vacations would have been a nightmare!    Last observation: meals at Riad Karmela are very good too.,Date of stay: December 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,Valencia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ember26

The owners and staff Philippe Joel and Nadia were particularly helpful extremely efficient and always gracious.    The food was always scrumpuous and varied from the ample breakfasts to the tasty dinners.    We loved the decor and the variety of rooms.

Riad Karmela,nellb wrote a review Jul 2008,40,Spent a week there must say of all the streets to stay in Karmelas in the best,To go and want to stay in the heart of it all Riad Karmela has to be the best option. We went for a week at the end of May. Every day we went out via the souks so really got ourselves a good idea of other areas. From the main square you have to walk thru the spice market and the narrow street selling vegtables - a walk I really enjoyed...some narrow streets we wandered down were not as pleasant tho they were not in any way bad or dodgy - the walk back to the Riad just seemed to be in a better area. In the Spice market area is a cafe called the Spice Cafe so a good place to get a drink there is a bank on the corner as well.    Anyway Riad Karmela....both Nadia and Phillipe were pleased to help us book days out and other restaurants to eat in. We ate in the Riad twice and the food is good.    I was amazed at how little or no noise could be heard from the streets outside the Riad door. Yeah the sun rise calls woke me a few times but thats what you expect. The noise within the Riad seemed to be trapped in and the people that came back at night propably didnt relaise their debate about the next day was really loud and long and a little selfish. I only wished Phillipe was in to tell them to shut up as he often couldbe heard shouting shut up when anyone in our group laughed a little loud tho I have to say I found this really a cheek as when he would shout shut up we were the only English people in thats the only Enhlish he knows! Sitting having a drink around 5ish just back from a day out before getting sorted for dinner chatting a group of maybe 5 then you would hear SHUT UP mumble mumble shut up! Like I said he should be there when breakfast is set up from early o'clock and again late at night when the late homers wake everyone up! He would get a sore throat from telling people in all different languages to shut up!    That said the rooms were clean and we felt well looked after by the staff and Phillippe did help us choose other restaurants to eat in. Breakfast was fine plenty of good coffee (I am a coffee snob) bread and honey figs and cereals so good overall. We sat with our feet in the pool in the court yard which was wonderfull after a day in the souks and the roof terrrace came in handy for my husband to retreat to when he couldnt souk any more! He very much enjoyed laying up there having a beer in the afternoon.    We stayed in the Aicha room - which on the website doesnt look the best - I think its cos its blue but I have to say (I saw a few of the others as my mates were in them) the Aicha was the best. Great shower We had a problem with the sink tap which was taken care of the same day. My sister had a suite and apart from the little balcony thay had the Aicha was my favorite.    We brought water from the little shop near the Riad. So out of the Riad turn right towards the vegtables and the little shop is on the left. Expect to haggle!    OTHER STUFF - we went up in a hot air balloon 2050dh per person with C'iel d Frique - simply fantastic do it! Nadia booked it from reception for us and it is an early start. book a table in advance at El Fassia in Gueliz (short taxi ride) restaurant run by a womens co op - was this trips best holiday dinner! Nadia booked it for us from reception. We did eat in the Marrakchi - but wouldnt again. Now Chez Chegrouni - best place to sit and watch the sun set and the evening call get there early to try to get a table upstairs on the top along the balcony the food was great cheap and simply - would go there again and again. We ate in the Fondouk and again like the Marrakchi we wouldnt go back. Nadia booked us a day trip to the Atlas mountain which was a bit more of a hike/moutain climb than we expected which was brilliant....should have worn proper shoes not flip flops should have had a ruck sack not a hand bag and my sister wore a skirt! We thought it would be a little taxi excursion over the mountains and a look round a 'berber' market luch and back....no no it was a trial for my mate who doesnt do heights and had to be carried crying by the guide the pics are great and we are all pleased we did it (even the crying vertigo mate) laughed a lot...We had a day at the Sunset club which is called someting else but cabs will know where you mean great pool scene and yet another one of the citys great contradictions! Huge double sunbeds like a Miami film set...white clad staff and chilled Ibiza tunes loud and throbbing! The pool was realy cold and the drinks about £8. for a water/coke. Lunch was not so expensive and really was good food. No kids allowed. Expect to see the top of a digger truck over the wall on the building site and a cloud of dust and you will have a fun day! We went to Les Bains for a soap and gommage. I also had a head massage and a hot stone massage. I was a little supprised when the head massage extended to my [--] and when my sister said the same I was a bit releaved it wanst just me and my [--]! I was so relaxed I could hardly speak! hen we left we got lost for 2 hours in the Jewish 1/4 which stopped being funny as it started to get dark! Just needed to pay more attention to the way we wandered out of the spa! We did have a horse and carriage go round which was nice enough when we agreed the price we asked to be taken back to the Riad after - which he did do poor bloke as far as his carriage would go up the narrow alleys - in the end we told him to stop - he was causing chaos up the narrow streets but he was doing as he had agreed - taking us back to the Riad! He didnt think it was a problem...you will see! We did wander round Koutoubia and the gardens are lovely we went to the Musee de Marrakech Ben Yousef Medersa the Badi Palace and we are glad we did see them all.    If I went again I would stay at the Riad Karmela. Would I go again? If I did it would only be to take the kids when they are at least 14 and I would book a week on the coast as well - after a week in the souks a week on the beach is what you need!    While we were at the Riad Karmela an English family with teenagers were also there and they seemed to have a great trip too.    I would tell anyone I knew planning a trip to Marrakech to stay in Riad Karmela. It really is a good base for a city trip.    My sister stayed for 5 nights then went to the new town bit to stay in a hotel with a big pool - which she tells me was great too and she was glad she spent her week that way. She stayed at a place called the towers or three towers or like that...?    Oh and what to wear - dont worry too much about shoulders out most visitors did have on vest tops and knew lenght shorts/skits. Dress for comfort and expect to get dusty and a bit grimey as soon as you step outside the Riad Door - I only wore half the clothes I took. I used a beach wrap/sarong thing round my shoulders somtimes!

Riad Karmela,Cacapon wrote a review Jun 2008,50,Delightful 6 day stay,We just returned from a week in Marrakesh staying at Riad Karmela. It was truly a delightful stay. We opted for the riad experience as we thought it had a bit more of character than a hotel might have and we were not disappointed. However if you are the type that wants or needs 24 hour room service a riad is not really the place for you. But if you prefer to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Marrakesh while still having a retreat from the delightful chaos at the end of the day a riad is the place. And Riad Karmela was our wonderful jewel in the heart of it all. We hightly recommend this place with its wonderful staff.,Date of stay: June 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington, DC",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cacapon
Riad Karmela,Paul H wrote a review May 2008,50,An Oasis Amidst the wonderful chaos of Marrakech,Visiting Marrakech for the first time is quite a daunting experience. The city is a marvelous place where you rapidly get absorbed into the hustle and bustle of this market town. The Riad Karmela is an incredible place a real Oasis set in the heart of the Medina. From the moment we stepped out of the arrivals to when we were dropped back at the airport Philippe and Nadia took great care of us and everything ran so smoothly.  The Riad is located down a very narrow street / passage and as soon as the door opens and you see the plunge pool and the furnishings you know this is a special place. The accomodation is very high quality and the food is excellent at a reasonable price. Service is very personal and excellent also very reliable (where in England does the taxi arrive 10 minutes early and not complain when you ask him to wait).  Strongly recommend you get the Riad to collect you from the airport as the Riad is not directly accessible from the main roads and you will only get so far in a Taxi and then have to walk the remainder of the way or get a 'barrow for hire' to take you.  Also recommend the Rough Guide Map (http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rough-Guide-Map-Marrakesh/dp/184353360X/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212052876&sr=8-7) as it is the only map that we found that has sufficient detail to navigate your way around. Also it has the road with the Karmela on it which other maps do not.    I would recommend the Karmela every time it offers comfortable quality accomodation in the heart of the city so everything is within easy walking distance.,Date of stay: May 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Petersfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulHofRake

Riad Karmela,Joy011 wrote a review Apr 2008,20,Aweek at Riad Karmela..........................,We have just spent a week a Riad Karmela in Marrakech. It is a beautiful town house in the middle of the bustling souk area a welcome relief from the hetic life outside.The main courtyard is absolutely stunning (although neither the plunge pool nor the jacuzzi were in use) and our room was adorned with Moroccan artefacts and very comfortable. Breakfast in the courtyard was fine and the evening meal was OK - nothing special but we would recommend booking an evening meal in advance on the day of arrival.  The week was marred by the theft of some money from our room. Although a member of staff was questioned I felt that the incident was not taken seriously no apology was offered at the time and certain members of staff were very cool towards us for the rest of the week which spoiled our stay.  We were provided with a map but tourist information was non-existent - we were only offered very expensive limousine trips organised by the riad and had to work very hard to organise our own expeditions.,Date of stay: April 2008,,Nottingham,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joy011
Riad Karmela,babyjune wrote a review Apr 2008,50,Fabulous Stay,To celebrate my 40th birthday my husband and I booked a 4 day stay at the Riad Karmela. We were impressed by their website having searched many and booked with them direct. From the start their correspondence was helpful swift and informative.  Having been collected at the airport by a taxi arranged through the hotel we were not disappointed on our arrival. We were greeted warmly by all staff and offered mint tea and a chance to unwind and relax in the beautiful court yard whilst our bags were taken to our room. Nadia ( the manageress) gave us an overview of things we may like to see and talked us through the various maps she gave us so that we could venture out into the busy streets of the Medina prepared.  We were equally impressed by our suite 'Al Monsieur' and due to travelling so early that morning had to drag ourselves away from the comfort of the room to make the most of the short time we had in Marrakesh.  After exploring the busy vibrant streets surrounding our Riad we returned to dinner which we had pre booked. I strongly advise you do this as it does take the pressure off searching for somewhere. the meal cooked by the in house cook was fabulous tasty and as we discovered having ventured into far more expensive restaurants on subsequent nights excellent quality and value for money so good in fact that we made sure we booked again for our final night this meal surpassed the first.  Breakfast was great simple and self service but a good selection of breads cereals jams honey yoghurt fresh fruit and fabulous freshly squeezed juice which I just couldn't get enough of and really set you up for the day ahead.  The atmosphere at Riad Karmela is relaxed and friendly and the surroundings comfortable and attractive a real oasis to return to after a busy day shopping in the hectic but so exciting souks. The staff were only too happy to deal with any requests we had or to sort our any difficulties that arose  (the hot water failed in our room and was fixed immediately and even though we were happy with their swift response to our problem we were still presented with a complimentary bottle of wine at our last night meal at the riad as an apology for the inconvenience such is their level of customer care).

Riad Karmela,Americaine-in-Paris wrote a review Apr 2008,40,Wonderful place with nice staff,I stayed here for 3 nights in March 2008. My sister-in-law and I enjoyed our stay there and would go back again. We had dinner at the Riad 2 nights. The meal was delicious (20E) and the interior patio is very relaxing. The beds were comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water (not the case with the other places we stayed in Morocco). Although you couldn't lock the door to your room there was an in-room safe.    The Riad is within easy walking distance to the major sites. I highly recommend arranging with the Riad to have their taxi driver pick you up at the airport as the Riad is not on a main street (but there are signs on the main street to lead you back to it later).    We also took advantage of their gommage/hamman option - the 15E were well spent and we came out feeling very relaxed and with very smooth skin.    Even if you don't speak French there is an English-speaking receptionist/manager.    The only negative point is that all the rooms in a Riad are off the central patio. There were some other guests who came in late the first evening and made quite a bit of noise in the patio area. It's better to bring some Euros with you to pay in cash for extra services as there is a 5% surcharge to use a credit card.,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"San Francisco, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Americaine-in-Paris

Riad Karmela,Killie50 wrote a review Mar 2008,50,Very relaxing!,My friend and I stayed in Riad Karmela for 4 nights in March wanting a nice break from London and be able to chill out. Karmela was the perfect choice. The service was excellent with Nadia and Phillipe on hand to assist. The food was first class. We chose to eat there every night as it was better than anywhere we went for lunch. The room was lovely and the Riad on the whole was very clean with decor perfect.

All staff helpful and the service was excellent. Nadia and Phillipe are excellent hosts. We also enjoyed the Hamman and massage. We also did a trip to the Atlas mountains which was good as we had our own driver for the day. We also arranged airport pick up through Nadia which is a must to do as ordinary taxis would never find it !  Hope to visit Marrakech again and will certainly stay here at Riad Karmela.

Riad Karmela,charlie_londonw9 wrote a review Mar 2008,40,Tucked Away,A well appointed and refurbished Riad tucked away in a back lane at the top end of the main Souk. Extremely tricky to get to initially (use taxi) but easy to find thereafter. Not good location for those travelling with lots of luggage. The receptionist Nadia was welcoming lovely and extremely helpful and provided maps of the local area so my companion and myself were able to navigate the area easily. The room was nice and the bathroom clean. The roof area was lovely and if you wanted to chill out and sunbathe or relax under awning cover it is ideal.    The buffet breakfasts were good quality throughout the stay. We tried one dinner in-house on the last night which was okay but decided we preferred eating out at the many good restaurants on offer. Most alcoholic beverages are available on request throughout the day and served up nicely.    Be sure to scrutinise your bill thoroughly before paying to make sure no mistakes have crept in. The proprietor was very distracted when we checked-out and the bill had been wrongly calculated (double!) and had to be corrected. Despite this overall our stay was a good experience and a nice change from the ordinary.,Date of stay: February 2008,,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlie_londonw9
Riad Karmela,Fossilandy wrote a review Mar 2008,50,"Fantastic Riad, in a great city",We stayed for 4 days and found the Riad Karmela a unique beautiful & relaxing place to stay exactly as the website shows. Phillipe & Nadia are great hosts and all the staff are friendly. It's located in the heart of the Medina about 5-10 mins walk through the atmospheric alleys leading into the souks & main square and the contrast between the peace & quiet of the Riad and the giddyness of the markets is fantastic. All in all a great place to stay in a fascinating city.,Date of stay: February 2008,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fossilandy
Riad Karmela,Kittylupo1 wrote a review Mar 2008,50,A charming Hotel,"We have just returned from a week stay at the Riad Karmela in Marrakech. This lovely hotel ( Riad) is situated right in the middle of the medina (old town) with walking distance to most important sights and museums and only minutes aways from the JDjemaa El Fna main square. The center of the Hotel is a beautifully restored Patio (courtyard) with its comfortable sofas sorrounded by 3 floors of rooms and apartments all open towards the Patio. It all ends in a beautiful terrace overlooking the Medina where dinner is served in the summer. As we are in march we had our dinners served in the romantic Patio. By the way dinner should be reserved in advance ( the same morning is enough) as it is not an ordinary restaurant. The kitchen is really excellent ( local Moroccan food) and it is a must to taste their Tajines and Couscous. Some very nice traditional restaurants can be found just around the corner.    The staff at the Karmela can organize all sorts of excursions; a trip to the surrounding Atlas mountains a dessert tour or just a guide through the souks ( highly recommended). Believe me after a couple of days in the souks you might need to leave the somewhat noisy city of Marrakech for a day or two. Philip the owner or Nadia are very forthcoming so do not be afraid to""bother them"" with all kinds of questions.  Me and my wife spent 5 days here and we are more than pleased with our stay at the charming Karmela. we can highly recommend it and we will certainly come back again.",Date of stay: March 2008,,Basel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kittylupo1
Riad Karmela,SuKe wrote a review Mar 2008,50,Riad Karmela - a gem in the heart of the Medina,We stayed at the Riad Karmela for 3 nights and had a fantastic holiday.    The Riad is situated in the heart of Medina and is only 8-10 minute walk from the main square - Place JDjemaa El Fna. It's tucked away behind an unassuming door in a small alleway and once inside it is a real gem and haven of calm. Because of its location I would recommend that you pre-book a taxi from the airport. The staff at the Karmela can organise this and it really did save us a big headache (and haggling over the price) upon arrival in Morocco.    Upon arrival we were ushered into the courtyard and offered complimentary mint tea and patisseries by Phillipe (the owner) and given a map of the Medina with the Riad's location clearly marked.    The Riad's soul is the peaceful courtyard with comfortable chairs and sofas. Most of the rooms lead off the courtyard either directly or by stairs to the first floor. The courtyard is also the setting for breakfast in the winter and dinner. On our first night we opted to have dinner at the Riad and were treated to a candle-lit freshly prepared Moroccan dinner with wine.    There were 3 of us - me and my husband and my mother-in-law - so we booked the Haroune apartment on the first floor and weren't disappointed. Two clean comfortable bedrooms with beautiful Moroccan decor a separate sitting room and a lovely Tadelakt (polished plaster) bathroom. A nice touch in the rooms was the provision of bottled water and dried dates upon arrival.    We saw some of the rooms which opened onto the courtyard and they were decorated in traditional Morrocan style and looked lovely. The only drawback to these rooms is that anyone eating breakfast dinner having drinks in the courtyard can hear what's going on - one couple had a bit of heated discussion at breakfast and we could hear every word! - so I'd recommend opting for one of the rooms on the first floor.    The roof terrace is amazing and I can imagine that in summer is a fab place to relax. It has stunning views of the Atlas mountains and a jacuzzi.    The staff are equally fantastic and only to happy help with any query. Nadia speaks fantastic English and is very helpful. They can organise a hammam massages etc in their own hammam and we took advantage of them organising a day trip to the Atlas Mountains with a local taxi driver - a great day and a great price.    The Riad is lovely and I certainly wouldn't hesitate to book at the Karmela the next time I go to Marrakech - I defy anyone not to be touched by its charm!,Date of stay: March 2008,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuKe

We could not fault anything. Nadia in particular speaks excellent English and was very helpful. She even advised on how much to pay for taxis. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.  I would recommend that you eat dinner in the Riad as much as possible. The food is genuine Moroccan and wonderful. We were disppointed when we ate out nothing could compare.

Riad Karmela,kenmaestro wrote a review Mar 2008,50,a haven of tranquility in the perfect location,"We decided upon Riad Karmela following the excellent TA reviews....    We were not disappointed. The Riad is located in the heart of the Medina just off the vegetable market and two minutes from the souks. It is a haven of peace & tranquility enhanced by the wonderful hosts Philippe & Nadia and the marvellous cheerful service from Assiz who did everything from make mint tea to walk us to the Restaurant Fondouk on our second night in order to give us our bearings.    We took a two bedroom apartment with private roof terrace and it was superb! The pix on the website don't really do it justice. It was like having our own Moroccan home within the Riad and the private terrace was a perfect place to read relax and reflect. The main roof terrace is also very pleasant (see photo's below) with areas for sun bathing and for relaxing in the shade. Nadia arranged our airport transfers and also dinner on the first night. The food was delicious and the wines excellent both in quality and value. I would highly recommend this for your first night experience as it allows you to settle in and then awake fresh to a new day to start your exploration.    Breakfast each morning is served until 11am for late risers and is plentiful with fresh fruit cereals breads and local cheese.    As you first arrive you can be forgiven for thinking ""what are we getting into here"". The walk from Place Ben Salah (the closest your taxi can get you) although only two minutes takes you along a lane filled with life donkeys hauling carts people going about their business before turning into an alleyway with kids playing football and then once again into a covered dark alley that appear to lead nowhere....and then the huge oak door....    you knock and a 4'6"" 'pass-door' opens and reveals the wonders beyond!    The Medina is easy to get lost in but you soon find 'markers' that you can use to navigate your way around. If you really get lost there is always someone prepared to help you get back on track and walk you to your Riad for a couple of dirhams.    If you haven't been to Marrakech before It's important to know that there are two entirely different experiences to be had - you can stay in 'new Marrakech' in French built 1980's concrete hotels with swimming pools etc. or you can stay at one of the many wonderful Riads in the Medina. If you want the real experience of this amazing city the the later is the only way to do it.

We stepped into a beautiful courtyard shutting out the bustle of the city behind us.  Nadia offered us Mint Tea and an explanation of the city and the major attractions.  Dinner in the Riad was a delight (book the evening before) and a very pleasant end to the day. Even the chance to sample some of the local wine (when chosen by the french you can be sure of the quality) was a joy after a teetotal day in the Medina.  The rooms are exquisite. decorated with care in the Moroccan style and set off the city experience very well.  The owners were even able to organise transport visits outside the city (Ouzazarte is a must!) and smooth even the most difficult cultural issues.  A beautiful room terrace complements the entire experience.    If you are going to Marrakech don't stay anywhere else!    p.s.

We took advantage of being picked up at the airport at a cost  of 20euros; a facility we would highly recommend in a initially very confusing environment. Do not be put off by the surrounding  streets of the Medina as you will enter a small door that will immediately transport you to the comfort and outstanding ambience of this spectacular Riad. We also took advantage of arranging dinner at Karmela for the first evening where a traditiional Moroccan style meal was served. It is also worth mentioning that excellent local wines and beers can also be purchased in the Riad.

Other rooms (on the ground level) are less spacious. We had dinner one night in the courtyard and was a very enjoyable experience with high quality food attentive service (the cost of 25 Euro/person was very reasonable). We arranged the transportation to and from the airport through the Riad and the taxi driver was courteous and helpful.

Upon arrival we were greeted by Phillipe who ushered us into the stunning inner courtyard with orange trees a jazmine vine and a water fountain where were were served mint tea and Moroccan pasteries. He gave us a map and explained the basics to us.    We were a party of eight spending a week at Christmas and were given rooms that shared the same stair well making it more private for us. Our rooms were large and comfortable with very tasteful Moroccan decor and great attention to detail.    We had a spectacular Christmas dinner. The tables were beautifully laid with linen cloths candles strewn with rose petals.

Riad Karmela,Gilly63 wrote a review Jan 2008,50,Fantastic riad in the Medina,We stayed at Riad Karmela for a week over Christmas and had a really lovely time. On arrival we were welcomed by Nadia and Phillipe and shown to our apartment Haroune. Our party comprised me and my partner plus his father sister and her son and I had been a little sceptecal how we would all fare in a three roomed apartment. I need not have worried. We had a double room off a twin bedroom from which there was access to a shower room. The entrance was through a sitting room which doubled as another twin bedroom. There was also a TV/DVD in this room. It was all decorated with lovely Berber artifacts and the rooms painted in white with details highlighted in blue and green. There was heating in the rooms.    The riad felt large and spacious. Downstairs pool is heated most of the time. There is a small hammam to fit about 2/3 people but its sweet and cosy and above is a nice treatment room for massage etc. complete with very comfy bed candles music and incence.    Great views from roof terrace which has lots of space to chill good sun beds and I can imagine the jacuzzi is fab to use in summer.    staff were all lovely curteous and friendly. The evening meal we had was amazing. I've eaten at lots of Morrocon restaurants including Foundouk Narwarma Marrakechi and other riads and can honestly say this competed with the best.    It takes 8 mins fast walk to the square but its a nice easy walk and the riad is close to the top end of the souks.    On Christmas day there was a great party. Everyone was encourgaed to wear white clothes which was easy and an enormous amount of care was taken with dressing the patio tables with white cloths strewn with rose petals candles everywhere lovely music wafting fire sizzling in the chimney and then some fab and low key entertainment from two music groups and belly dancers. All very tasteful and not in your face or corny in any way.    One comment I do have is sometimes in the evening it was a bit cold sitting in the downstairs terrace. Although the roof is covered with a temporary see through plastic cover to protect from any rain. I'm not sure what could be done and it must be the same in all the riads in winter but possibly a central fire or something.    I'd highly recommend a stay and would definitly go back.,,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gilly63

Riad Karmela,maggieod wrote a review Nov 2007,50,Magical Riad with superb staff,It would be a mistake to visit Marrakech without stopping over in this beautiful and tastefully restored riad. The Riad Karmela is an absolute gem. From the outset Phillipe Nadia and Joel did all they could to make our stay an easy and enjoyable one. The staff were unfailingly friendly helpful and efficient. Booking on-line was a breeze they arranged airport pick up and ensured the taxi driver walked us to the front door (a must for anyone who wasn't brought up in the medina!) they confirmed restaurants & travel arrangements made personal recommendations etc and were keen to make sure we were feeling comfortable and at home. I was overwhelmed when all key staff all turned up at our room on the evening of my birthday (do also check out Neat's rstaurant) with a card and complimentary bottle of wine on ice & dishes of olives etc. Exactly the kind of service that marks this riad out as a special place to stay.    But apart from the staff who all appear to be genuinely lovely people the place itself is a delight; modern Moroccan decor a magical courtyard in which to sit relax eat & drink an atmosphere created by twinkling Moroccan lanterns fresh flowers everywhere the sound of water fountains and fabulous mood music. It was hard to pull ourselves away in the evening to see other places. But if that's not your thing then sipping a couple of beers on the terrace listening to the call to prayer or watching sunset over the rooftops of Marrakech is also a special experience. Last but not least the Karmela serves great in-house food - both at breakfast and evening meal (by arrangement).

We stayed in a suite with a balcony but all the rooms looked nice. The rooms can be fairly noisey at times as they are all around a courtyard so you are reliant on other guests being considerate. But Marrakesh is a noisey mad place so it all just adds to the experience. The owners are really helpful and booked some great restaurants for us. Definately worth asking their advice as you wouldn't come across these restaurants unless you knew where they were. Ask the hotel to organise your taxi or you will never find it. Then just enjoy wandering round meeting the people and seeing the place. You will soon find your way back for a relaxing drink in the haven of the hotel.

Don't be put off by trip advisor reports of dingy alleyways (this is Marrakesh and there are a lot of alleyways but the alternative is to stay in a business 4 star hotel outside the city and this would be a great shame!) and dodgy plumbing (it didn't worry us).

Riad Karmela,JoshuaLondon wrote a review Nov 2007,50,"Lovely place, delightful people, good food!",We stayed 6 nights at the Riad Karmela and really loved it. We ate dinner there on 3 nights and had tasty authentic Morrocan food each time. The place is charming clean and an oasis of calm. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Decor is traditional and tasteful. All the other guests we met were equally happy with their accommodation and the service.    We would highly recommend it.,Date of stay: October 2007,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshuaLondon
Riad Karmela,napl wrote a review Oct 2007,40,little oasis,Very stylish and comfortable little riad in the heart of Marrakech's old town. This place was really a find. We were made very welcome by the owners and very helpful staff. The rooms are each individually decorated and there is a roof terrace for sun bathing. Only problem I would say is unless you speak french or Arabic you might find it hard to be undersood but don't let that put you off. I would highly recommend it.,Date of stay: September 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Newcaslte upon Tyne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napl
Riad Karmela,James G wrote a review Oct 2007,50,Great Central riad,Karmela is a very cozy Riad located very close to the Marrakech action. About 10 minutes north of the central square it is just far enough away from the madness to give a very relaxed feel whilst being close enough to all you need. Beds were very comfortable the best nights sleep we've had in Morocco.,Date of stay: October 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Melbourne,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gibbo623
Riad Karmela,Lynda_and_Sarah wrote a review Sep 2007,50,What a fantastic Riad and Location,Riad Karmela is a fantastic place to stay if you want to be near the bustle of real life and the fantastic souks - which are only 2-3 minutes walk away - although you can spend hours walking round the souks before you return to the riad!!!  Nadia makes the Raid an easy and fabulous place to stay - in fact all the staff were great. Nothing was too much trouble.  The room was perfect the top terrance was beautiful and relaxing and the overall feeling was one of calm after a busy shopping day in the Souks.  The meals we had at the Riad were very very good.  We were two girls travelling together and we had read some reviews saying that women on their own were hassled. We did not find this - we found everyone to be polite helpful and of course makinga living. Try to take the attiude of 'I'm happy - they are happy - therefore everyone wins' bargining is fun but ensure you really want the item it would be rude to not take the item once you have bartered hard.  Both my friend and myself will be returning to Marrakech and would only consider staying in Raid Karmela.,Date of stay: September 2007,,Redhill Surey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynda_and_Sarah
Riad Karmela,RedDogNorman wrote a review Aug 2007,50,Tranquility in Marrakech Medina,We recently spent a family week at this riad and can say that it made our holiday. Amongst the bustle noise and heat of Marrakech in August Riad Karmela was peace tranqulity and calm. We had a lovely 3 room apartment in the riad decorated in traditional Marrakech style with efficient but quiet air conditioning which we desparately needed from time to time plus a nice shower room and toilet.    The public areas were execellent with a peaceful courtyard with tiled floor sitting areas and plunge pool with an inside dining room for winter dining. Facilities also included hammam and massage areas which the ladies utilised. In summer breakfast and evening meal - which could be ordered up to mid-day on the day required - were served on the roof terrace in a nice dining area. The food was excellent; we ate in twice in six nights and breakfast was a delight offering a wide choice of fruit cereals yogurt bread crepes preserves tea coffee etc. Evening meals were traditional Moroccan cuisine of salads and tagines. The rooftop also had a sitting area and a jacuzzi as well as great roof-top views across the medina.    The service and attention we received were of the highest quality without being obtrusive. Staff worked hard from morning to night and cold drinks from wine to beer cola to water were available from morning to night. Staff also arranged two trips for us booked restaurants and taxis and provided lots of detailed info in French or English. Philippe and Nadia were truly excellent hosts and we would strongly recommend this ideally located accommodation without hesitation. It is without doubt amongst the top three places I have stayed - and I've visited 70 different countries.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,Bristol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedDogNorman
Riad Karmela,Michael_Cheryl wrote a review Aug 2007,50,Exactly what we wanted from our stay in a Marrakech Riad.,My girlfriend and me have just returned from a two week break in Morocco. For the first three nights of our trip we stayed at the Riad Karmela before moving on to the coastal towns of El Jadida and Essaouira.  Two nights before we were due to fly out to Morocco my girlfriend fractured her foot! As a result there was a hightened anxiety leading up to our arrival in Marrakech and the Riad.  The anxiety however was quickly dispersed once we arrived and checked in at the Riad.  All communication leading up to our stay was very good including the booking of taxis from the airport. The excellent service continued on our arrival. Check in was smooth and after we were shown our room we sat in the tranquil communal courtyard and were provided with complimentary mint tea and biscuits.  Our room was on the ground floor and ideal under the circumstances! It was decorated to a high standard and a million miles away from any of the chain hotels we've stayed in around the world. The room was for two people and very spacious and although it had air conditioning we were surprised at how little we used it as the Riad was quite cool despite the high temperatures of the Medina and Morocco in general at that time of year.  The first full day of our stay was spent on the roof terrace sun loungers and Jacuzzi. It is quite a steep incline up a few flights of stairs to the roof terrace but if someone with a broken foot can manage with without any real difficulty then so should most!Breakfast is also served on the roof terrace and features plentiful supplies of orange juice coffee yoghurts cereal bread and pancakes. Although we didn't eat at the Riad on an evening food is available and was recommended by other guests.  The riad is located around 10 minutes (20 with a broken foot) walking distance from the Djema El Fna a journey that takes you through one of the main souks. I've read other reviews on this site that make reference to the the fact that the Riad is set back from the main larger streets. It is however we never felt threatened or intimidated in anyway and quickly got our bearings. In a way the location added to the experience.  The staff were always very friendly and keen to help without being overbearing. The two French owners of the Riad were on site during our stay and were very welcoming and friendly giving the Riad a homely feel.  Generally the Riad was an excellent base for our stay in Marrakech it was very clean friendly and tranquil striking the right balance in all aspects of our stay.  Highly recommended.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Middlesbrough - UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michael_Cheryl
Riad Karmela,ArielaBA wrote a review Aug 2007,50,Right at the heart of the Medina!,Phillipe (riad owner) spoke little english and my family and I spoke no french nor arab but it didn't mattered because our stay at this riad coulnd't have been any better. The rooms are lovely (we only stayied there 3 nights and were upgrated to the wonderfull appartments!) and the entire decoration is just magnificent. In the inner patio chilling inside the jacuzzi shadowed by the orange trees really makes you feel like beeing in an oasis right at the hear of Marrakesh Medina.  Both breakfast and dinner are a feast to the senses accompained with a great atmosphere and service. The roof is also very impressve overlooking the rest of the Medina where you can have you breakfast dinner or just relax in the other jacuzzi.  It is very important that you arrange your pickup in advanced as the riad is located right in the middle of the scrambled medina and can be very hard to find at first.  Above all this is definitly a recommended place to stay and inmerse yourself in Marrakesh's way of life we would totally stay there again.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,Buenos Aires,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArielaBA
Riad Karmela,SuC wrote a review Aug 2007,50,The best place before a long day walking around the Medina,Riad Karmela is a fantastic place to spend some days in the heart of Marrakech. My boyfriend and I were there from Spain and I could recommend to anybody. The place is wonderful all stuff is really kind and with the nice rooms and common areas the jacuzzis and the good temperature inside is a really special place.  On the other hand the worst points were:  - the breakfast is correct although I missed some pieces of fresh fruit.  - the air conditioner doesn't work really hard (we stayed in Aicha's room) but the temperature was nice (but not cool).  - it's a little difficult to find the riad... but I think that all guest houses in the Medina are difficult to find :)  We passed some of our most beautiful days in Riad Karmela so I can recommend it for all people in special for romantic travels.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Madrid, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SweetSuC

Everyone was really friendly and helpful. The Green Tea was LOVELY!!!!!    Really close to everything I would really recommend staying here.    My only tip would be not to book the trips they organise though the riad they are so expensive a trip to see the waterfalls etc day trip was 90euros per person. We just got a taxi for the whole day who took us to all the same places for £30. Much cheaper.,Date of stay: August 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leilacutler
Riad Karmela,ArwinSuffolk wrote a review Aug 2007,50,Haven of tranquility,Much more than just a hotel staying here was a real experience. Situated in the heart of the medina just a stones throw from the buzzing djeme el fna its the perfect compliment to the heat hassle and craziness of Marrakech. They have hospitality down to a fine art greating you with mint tea and such warmth you immediately feel very at home the decor is fantastic - all original and moroccan with two plunge pools and plenty of space to chill out in the shade its really hard to drag yourself away and do any sightseeing!!

Riad Karmela,A-and-G001 wrote a review Aug 2007,20,A little dissapointing,We have mixed feeling about Riad Karmela.    The place itself is impeccable the design is lovely and authentic. Candles night sky Calls to prayer echoing over the city. Situated about 8 minutes by walk to Jemaa El Fna. (As long as you follow their directions to a T hehehe...more on that in a full review of marrakesh). -    They organised a pick up from the airport though at no time during booking did they mention that pick up was at a cost. Also they are really bad at responding to emails all my dealing had to be done over the phone(thankgod for skype:D) .  This was incidentally a group taxi and cost us 15 Euros.    On arriving we were greeted by Nadia who took us to the courtyard and presented us with information and some lovely mint tea. The heat already bearing down the coolness of the courtyard was welcome and we felt like the holiday had begun.    On entering the room the air was more stiffling a lack of wind makes it difficult for the room to change air and with no electricity (the whole area was suffering a power outage due to upgrade works or something) the airconditioner was not functioning. This made sleeping rather hard.    Due to no electricity the water pumps where also not functioning so we had to use a toilet downstairs. Fair enough we thought no electricity is not something they cannot control.    However the next day electricity was back and apart form the water situation nothing much had changed. The airconditioner was on but not really doing anything.    Like all riads the food is priced at around €20 per person and its a standard good 3 course meal. However there are much cheaper alternatives for the same amount and quality of food. Also be aware of recommendations they make. When we first got there they asked if we wanted to make a reservation with any restaurant.  Not knowing the place we said if you have somewhere to recommend it would be great as we would like something small later. Nadia recommeded a place and proceeded to inform us that it would be best if we booked as it may be unlikely that we find a table if we just walked in. Again having just arrived we took her advice.    Once we found the restaurant later that evening it turns out to be one of those places where they serve you a huge never ending feast of food appropriatly priced. (€25 to 70 per person. still alot more delicous food then you will ever get for the same amount spent in europe). However it was not what we were expecting.  We did ask for a recommendation for something small and this place is what they call palace restaurant i.e. BIG MOROCCON FEASTS ONLY.  We embarrisngly had to say this was not what we expected and had to walk out of the booking -    A couple of minor incidents also irked us. The first was when we wanted to take a dip in the jacuzzi downstairs ( which was cleaner and cooler). However we where met by one of the owners who was sojouring in the courtyard. On realising we wanted to take a dip there she immediatly got up and suggested that we use the one upstairs instead she proceeded to show us the way and told me how to switch on the bubbles. We were out of her way.    The upstairs jacuzzi was filled with dust which frotted with the bubbles. We could have argued to stay downstairs but didn't fancy the hassle or the stress of an argument it just would have felt weird.    The second incident occurred when we accidentally spilt some Watermelon juice on the bed the night before. On coming back from a lovely but hectic day in the souks we where confronted by Nadia and one of the owners and castigated for eating in the room. Both my partner and i where amazed. Feeling like school children we could not believe the big deal they made out of it and they way in which they dealt with it.  They had taken our watermelon and would give it to us as long as they placed it only in the terrace for us to eat. This is not how you treat guests.    First of all you never take anything from their room.  Secondly if there was an accidental spillage you clean the room period. Accidents happen.    In the end the place didn't live up to its expectation for the price bracket within which it finds itself.    Apart from that the staff where friendly and helpful with a mention to Azziz who was an absolute star.,Date of stay: July 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Europe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A-and-G001

We have been to Marrakech before but the experience was far better on this occasion and a lot of that was attributable our stay at Raid Karmela.    Nadia and Philippe were super friendly and could not have done more for us. The Riad itself was spectacular with orange trees in the courtyard the resident tortoises roof top terrace moody candles and lanterns and beautiful rooms (with AC). We would also really recomend eating at the Riadas we did twice and the food was varied and really tasty.    Nadia & Philippe can also arrange excursions and the resident driver Kabbour speaks excellent english and is a very friendly chap.

Riad Karmela,CandySurrey wrote a review Jun 2007,40,Riad was very nice,We stayed for 3 nights at this riad in June. Marrekech is a real eye openerits like being taken back in time. The riad is down a small alley and is entered from a small wooden door that you have to duck to get in. I did wonder what we had let ourselves in for;-) We enjoyed Marrekech but I dont think it would be to everyones taste. The souks and square are madreally buzzing. You could just sit there alday and watch the world go by theres always something happening. Dont be taken in by the sellers asking you if you want your picture taken with themthey hound you for money and not a couple of pound!  As for the riad we stayed in the Kaiss suite it really was beautiful with the balcony overlooking the courtyard. The riad is idealright in the middle of everything but so tranquil. Nadia is lovely but we did have a couple of requests that were not met. I e-mailed to book a romantic meal for the first night for my husbands birthday and also asked for restaurants to be booked for the following 2 nights although Nadia did eventually book the restaurants. That was our only disappointment . Overall a worthwhile experience in a nice riad.,Date of stay: June 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CandySurrey

Riad Karmela,Aussieholiday wrote a review Jun 2007,50,Great Riad in Marrakech,Marrakech info@riadkarmela.com    Our family of four (2 adults + 2 children: 18 and 10) stayed in Marrakech for 5 nights during May 2007. We stayed in a Riad inside the walled city of the Medina as anyone should do if visiting Marrakech; Riad Karmela. Riad Karmela is a tranquil delightful oasis conveniently located near the centre of the Medina. It was only a short 10 min stroll past interesting markets and through the souqs to Jemaa el Fna the main square of the Medina. The Riad is furnished beautifully in traditional Moroccan style but with all modern comforts. There is a plunge pool which was a great diversion for our 10yr old son and also a good way to cool down after the heat of the day. The staff at the Riad Philippe and Nadia were very friendly and helpful as well which was a great bonus for us Aussies in a land so foreign. I would recommend this Riad very strongly to anyone considering travel to Marrakech and we would definitely stay there again if in the area.

If you like being in a local area where there are not very many tourists then this Riad is perfect for you. It's very close to the Museum and the souks. It's also close to Jemaa however if you want to travel outside of Marrakech via bus or around Marrakech via taxi taxi drivers loath driving to the riad.,Date of stay: June 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/velvettexas

Set in the centre of old Marrakech close to the spice souk and amongst the hustle and bustle of the medina Karmela and the staff are an oasis of calm with enduring hospitality humour and ultimate charm.

Riad Karmela,mitzie8 wrote a review May 2007,40,Peaceful oasis amid the hustle and bustle,Riad Karmela was by far one of the better riads I had found during my research and it lived upto its promise indeed. As you arrive you are seated in the courtyard to refresh with a pot of thirst quenching mint tea. rooms are airy and tatter free with nice moroccan interiors. The Al Mansour suite is particularly spacious with a small lounge area.    Staff are attentative and Nadia's english made it much more easier for us to communicate any questions or queries and the hotel can easily arrange for excursions which was very useful as local guides can be misleading.    One thing which I partcularly loved was breakfast time which in good weather is served on the roof terrace with great views of the city and the atlas mountains.    It is very much good service and great value.    Keep up the good work!    Mittal Dave,Date of stay: May 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitzie8
Riad Karmela,CwaltonSwindon wrote a review May 2007,50,Relaxation at its best,My wife and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Riad Karmela in Marrakech. We went to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The hospitality that was offerred to us by all of the staff was first class right down from the owners Phillipe and Joel to the girls that serve and clean. Phillipe and Joel are abley assisted by Nadia who is very fluent in english and extremely helpful to the british speaking guests. We chose to have a junior suite the Kaisse which we have to say was just fantastic very large and has its balcony looking down into the heart of the riad overlooking the orange trees and plunge pool. The riad is located down a very dark alley and our first impressions of this were not at all favourable but once inside the very low doorway it was just like entering a different world so calm quiet and just unbelievably relaxing. We ate in the riad for 3 nights and felt the food was just delicious very typically morrocan different types of tagines on all 3 nights. I (male) had a Hamman body scrub and masage at the riad which again was extremely relaxing definately worth doing.  The location of the riad is only a few mins from the Jemma El Fna square. We did not eat in the square this time but would definately try it on another visit as the the food looked so good.  Definately book a taxi to collect you from the airport doubt that you will find it otherwise and the taxi cannot take you to the door as the streets are so narrow - again taxi driver was extremely pleasant.  Watch out for the snake charmers and orange juice sellers in the square who will 'rip you off' at the slightest chance. The orange juice is fantastic though - about 20p a glass!  Wandering through the souks we were only occasionaly hassled by sellers but most of the time they all just smiled. Found very few beggers and all in all found the place to be very friendly.  Would definately go back to Marrakech and would always go back to Riad Karmela and have no hesitation in recommending this riad to others.,Date of stay: May 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swindon, Wiltshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CwaltonSwindon
Riad Karmela,dux86 wrote a review May 2007,50,Great Riad,The Riad Karmela was great. Location is very good- walking distance to all of Marrakech's attractions. It is a bit hidden from the main street and at times we had slight difficulty getting back but Marrakech is very safe even during the early evening so we never had any problems. The rooms we had were lovely. They were spacious and well furnished with great plumbing and comfortable beds. Up to the standard of any nice European hotel I've stayed in. The rooftop terrace was beautiful. We really enjoyed the view of the mountains. The setting was great at night- we had a bottle of wine on the couches and played cards used the hot-tub etc. A great way to relax! The breakfast was quite good- a nice variety of food and always well stocked.  The service however is what sets the Riad apart. Nadia was SO helpful and polite. She was always willing to provide assistance is booking excursions restaurants etc. Her English is perfect and she really is an invaluable asset to the Riad. The rest of the staff while they did not speak fluent English spoke at least enough to understand basic requests and were equally friendly and helpful.  We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend Riad Karmela without hesitation.,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,dux86,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dux86
Riad Karmela,Live For Holidays wrote a review May 2007,50,Met all our expectations!,We stayed at Riad Karmela over the May bank holiday weekend and had a fantastic time. We booked Suite Kaisse for £100 for the room per night which was a really lovely room and is the only room that has its own balcony. Nadia and Phillipe were really helpful and friendly and would always offer to give us directions and book restaurants for us whenever we needed. We booked a meal for our first night at the riad and I have to say the food was outstanding - considering that we arrived in the evening it was a must.    The riad is very peaceful and relaxing - the courtyard is really pretty and the roof terrace is a welcome retreat away from the hustle bustle and craziness of the souks. We also had no problems with the hot water as some other people on Trip advisor had experienced. It was really refreshing to stay in a place where not only the staff were welcoming but the other guests were also really friendly as the riad is set up to be a sociable yet un-imposing environment.    If you’re staying over the weekend and are keen to go to some of the great restaurants I would advise booking in advance as some of the most popular ones get booked up days in advance. Also have a hamman gommage and massage at the riad – a real experience.    We loved our stay here and would highly recommend it.,Date of stay: May 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liveforjolibobs
Riad Karmela,Steerpike wrote a review May 2007,50,"Beautiful oasis of peace, tranquillity and relaxation.",You are lost amidst the crazy chaotic hustle and bustle of the Medina's myriad streets and alleyways. You have no idea where the hotel is but the friendly Moroccans keep stopping to help you and they go out of their way to lead you to the hotel front door.    The streets in the vicinity of this riad make you wonder what sort of place this will be! But once inside you are transported to a total oasis. Nadia and Philippe welcome you warmly to their stunningly beautiful riad. First they sit you down at the couches and tables in the central courtyard surrounded by little orange trees plants and the sound of trickling water in the jacuzzi pool. There is gentle mellow music and you are immediately served with complimentary mint tea while you relax and forget the noise and crowds which seem a world away. You sign in the register and are taken to your room. The rooms are comfortable very clean and out look over & into the central courtyard.    There is a jacuzzi on the roof terrace which has reclining sun-loungers and stunning views of the Atlas mountains.    The food is superb - better than at the restaurants we dined at.

Riad Karmela,ensOxfordshire wrote a review May 2007,50,Absolutely exquisite,I booked Riad Karmela in January of this year and it is by far one of the very best holidays I've had because the hospitality was absolutely 1st Class!!! From the moment of our arrival to our tearful departure we were made so incredibly welcome that I genuinely felt it would be the first of many visits. Philippe and Nadia are unobtrusively friendly and helpful and it is not difficult to feel at home in this exquisite Riad. I had a peep in all the rooms and without exception they are all spacious tastefully and comfortably decorated whilst keeping an authentic Moroccan feel about them. Breakfast is relaxed and you wont be disappointed if you decide to eat in....their cook is excellent. The roof terrace is as beautiful as it looks in the photos (ie no trick photography) and it was never any trouble for them to bring afternoon tea up to us.

Riad Karmela,rosa_mariposa wrote a review Apr 2007,30,Think twice if you're not French,The Riad is certainly beautiful with gorgeous rooms and a lovely courtyard. The food is excellent too. However our stay was somewhat soured by the owner Philippe who makes very little effort with the non-French guests to the point of being very rude and dismissive (we did the best with the little French we had and Nadia a local member of staff was extremely helpful and friendly) but nonetheless the atmosphere was not as nice as it could have been and was in other Riad's we stayed in in Morocco.,Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosa_mariposa

No only the building has just recently being fully renovated but it is also full of ambience.    The rooms are elegantly decorated and the view from the terrace is unique.

Riad Karmela,1984H wrote a review Apr 2007,50,A memorable stay,What an Oasis of calm this Riad is. We had a really lovely and memorable stay here at the Riad Karmela. Our room was just lovely great bathroom with a shower for 2! The  staff (Nadia and her crew - and Philippe the owner) were very nice helpful and friendly and the food really was quite  exceptional. My congratulations to the Cook! Recommended 'to do' in Marrakech Mnebhi Palace & Museum the Parks and gardens in particular the Jardin Majorelle and the Cyber Park. The Souqs of course and the daily activities in the Djemaa el-fna too. Eating out is great and we really enjoyed simple and cheap lunches at the Cafe Argana overlooking the Djemaa-el-fna and the Bougainvillea. Our treat was an evening at the Stylia where the food was not only superb but the drama and ambience of the venue is somenthing we'll not forget. They also have 2 talented musicians. An evening at the Tangier for great food and belly dancers is also recommended. We would definitely visit Marrakech again.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lancashire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1984H
Riad Karmela,Travellers-r-us wrote a review Apr 2007,50,Full marks,We chose this Riad because of all the good reviews and we were not disappointed. We brought our two children with us aged 10 and 12 and they loved it. The accommodation was perfect for us as we had a 2 bedroom suite. The kids had there own large room with both a single and double bed which was great. The suite felt more like we were staying in a small house rather than a hotel room and we heard nothing at all from other guests - the kids didn't even hear the 'call to prayers' which rather tempted me to swap rooms but perhaps they just sleep through anything. We also had glass patio doors leading to an outdoor staircase taking you to your own private roof terrace with a comfy sofa and chairs and little table completely hidden from view and it all lit up so it could be used at night as well. A lot of thought had gone into the decor and it made the stay feel very special. Nadia and Philippe were lovely and very helpful. Would definitely recommend the taxi collection from the airport. We had two evening meals in the Riad out of our 4 night stay and they were very enjoyable. Overall couldn't fault it and would definitely stay again.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,Surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellers-r-us
Riad Karmela,mousella wrote a review Apr 2007,50,Traditional Morroccan experience,we stayed here for 3 nights over Easter. The Riad is beautiful inside and the rooms large and spacious. The service from Nadine and the other staff was excellent. Inside the riad is a courtyard that serves as a welcome relief from the bustling streets of Marrakech. the location is great - within the medina. 5 mins walk to the souks and 10 minutes to the main square.    highly recommend staying here.    Strongly advise the following:  * a pre-arranged taxi to the Riad (Riad Karmela arrange this on request)  * a meal in the riad. we did this the first night. Excellent personal service and great food.  * a hamman scrub and massage in the riad!  * if eating out at the weekend and you want the best restaurants pre-book (again Riad Karmela will organise for you)  * the Kosybar by the Badi Palace - excellent food!,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,liverpool,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mousella
Riad Karmela,new_world_travellers wrote a review Apr 2007,50,Great stay!,We stayed a couple of nights at the Riad Karmela early April 2007. We had a well appointed suite with two bedrooms and a private terrace. The suite was well decorated and very charming.  The patio offers a great atmosphere with delightful orange trees and a jaccusi. The patio is covered in case of bad or cold wheather which is a real plus.  The owner and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. On arrival the owner spent considerable time providing useful tips on the life in Marrakech. He also recommended several restaurants and assisted with bookings.  The breakfast (and breakfast service) is nice but could be potentially improved when compared with other Riads in Morocco (we stayed two weeks in Morocco and stayed in 5 Riads).  The Riad offers good value for money (we paid 150 Euros per night for 2 adults and two young childs including breakfast).  Overall a very nice place with a friendly owner.,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/new_world_travellers
Riad Karmela,gwynnethv wrote a review Apr 2007,50,Great Riad,My husband and I stayed at Riad Karmela in April 2007 to celebrate my 50th birthday - it was a little oasis of calm in a hectic place and we really enjoyed it. We stayed in a suite called Kais and it was superb - spacious room with a private terrace overlooking the internal courtyard. The staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfasts were fine and served in the courtyard - unfortunately the roof terrace was being refurbished while we were there but once done I'm sure this will be a great asset to the Riad as they have a jaccuzi. We had a hamman treatment and Jhislane was fantastic - an absolute gem of a girl who scrubbed and massaged us into total relaxation!

Was well run and the staff are very helpful and friendly and can organise any excursions or treatments for you. Our Room was very nice and the food we tried in the evening was great tasty fish tangine!  Suitated in the heart of the medina and not far to walk to the Main square the Djemma el Fnaa. Good price to stay here and would recommend to email the riad to pick you up from the airport as hard to find otherwise.

Riad Karmela,blue817 wrote a review Apr 2007,50,Beautiful!,I chose Riad Karmela due to the other reviews on this website and i have to echo all the postive sentiments! It truly is an oasis in the madness that is the medina. We had arranged a taxi from the airport with the Riad - which was a relief as i doubt we would have found it otherwise! I can not stress how much of a contrast there is between the little alleyways and the riad itself.  The staff were very helpful polite and friendly. Nadia is wonderful and a real asset to the Riad. Phillipe does not speak English but really this is not a problem - i took a small French phrase book and used my GCSE french and managed to communicate with no problems what so ever.  We stayed in the Habib room (it was perfect!) which is on the ground floor - there is some noise in the mornings when breakfast is being served but it is not too early. The worst was when two other female guests came home drunk at 3am and insisted on having a very loud conversation which lasted a couple of hours! This of course was not the fault of the Riad but i would say if you want wild nights out you may wish to chose somewhere else and avoid yourself the embarassment! The noise does carry and guests need to be considerate to others.  The riad is conveniently located within minutes of the Souks and Jemma al Fna (Main square).  Whilst we were staying there there was some work being carried out on the roof but it wasn't too noisy - will be worth it as it means meals will be served up on the roof and there will also be a barbeque area.  We are already planning our next trip to Marrakech and will definitely be revisiting the Raid Karmela!,Date of stay: April 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blue817
Riad Karmela,Melbournenitee wrote a review Mar 2007,40,Almost perfect!,"We stayed here in March 2007 & it cost €110 per night.    Riad Karmela is a true oasis amongst the lovely madness of the medina. When you get taken though the narrow alleyways you can't help but think you are being taken for a ride & as the driver rings the bell - nothing can prepare you for what's behind the tiny door.    To take a step back - we took them up the offer of being picked up from the airport. Believe me it is worth every penny. Some comments: 1) both cash points at the airport often don't work 2) the bank at the airport will only exchange money against cash - not on card. 3) take the Riad's number with you - some people didn't get picked up. 4) be patient there was at least 50 men with various signs held up in a half hearted fashion 5) do NOT pay the driver - the cost will be included in the final bill at the Riad.    None of the rooms have locks which takes a bit getting used to. Our room for the 3 first nights was Aicha and in our opinion it was the best room on offer. There were several rooms on the ground floor that opened up into the courtyard area & everyone that stayed there said they were great. Our room however was set one floor up overlooking the courtyard which gave it more light and space. They way it looked was fantastic. My only negative point about the room was the lack of hot water. It lasted only a few minutes & then we had none. However we can't really complain about this as we kept forgetting to bring it up with the staff - they might been able to fix it easily. The lack of hot water was perhaps due to the building work going on at the roof. They were re-tiling the pool area. It was only meant to last 1 week - but we had not been informed about it. The banging started just after 9am or 10 and didn't stop until around 7pm. It was very very loud and annoying.    The second room we stayed in was a suite ""Haroune"" & imo it's not worth the extra money it would cost. Sure it has 2 nice areas to sit in & a TV/DVD (I don't get why you would need this) & technically it's quite big. However the bedroom itself is smaller than the Aicha & the only natural light in the whole suite comes from a shaft (like a 1x1m courtyard) with glass doors. Also there was a generator humming in the wall which annoyed me.    Another warning: if you book a trip with them - be very careful that the driver don't get a guide for you. We didn't want a guide but when one appeared we assumed it was a part of the package. At the end of the trip he demanded money & we refused to pay as we already paid €120 for the trip & had definitely not agreed to a guide. He got very angry & was shouting at us which was not acceptable. The driver claimed the guide said we had booked him - I don't believe that for a second they were very friendly & clearly knew each other.    The breakfast was fantastic absolutely fantastic. We also eat the food at the Riad the first night it was very nice but not amazing in our opinion. & for €25pp (not inc wine) - it's very expensive compared to eating anywhere else.    The staff are incredibly friendly Nadia's English is very good & she is the only one that speaks it - so get your business done before she goes home!    The lack of hot water the building works & the fake guide definitely put a mark on what would otherwise been a perfect stay - however as long as the prices don't go up too much I would not hesitate to stay here again as it was nothing in the big scheme of things. We had a lovely stay & to have such a nice place to go home after a long day - grab a bottle of wine & sit on the roof enjoying it was heaven.",Date of stay: March 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Melbourne, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melbournenitee

Riad Karmela,alfredSurrey wrote a review Mar 2007,50,An Oasis of calm,Riad Karmela is an Oasis in amongst the kalioscope of sensorial impressionns and the human hubhub of the Medina.  When you enter from the dusty streets the first impression is the cool of the interior and the warmth of welcome from Nadin. This warmth and care will continue throughout your visit from all the staff. The Riad has eight rooms ensuring a friendly and open enviroment. The decor is informal but breathtakingly beauitful.  Our room felt so luxurious and yet within minutes we were at home. There is a a roof top garden where you can sit and sun take a dip in the small pool or watch the sunset and stars in the evening. If you so desire the Riad can organise day trips for you or you may want to take the opportunity to have a sauna and massage. We did. Absolutely fabulous!!! The food and the atmosphere at the evening meal refreshed us from a hard day at the souks shopping. I can not recommend more highly this accomadation. It was the highlight of our stay.,Date of stay: February 2007,,surrey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alfredSurrey
Riad Karmela,kolumbus wrote a review Feb 2007,40,Tranquil oasis amid the chaos,We spent a week at the Riad during half term.  Approaching the Riad through the narrow alleys of the old part of town we wondered what on earth we were going to but as soon as we were through the front door we were very impressed.  The layout and decor are just as we imagined a typical Riad to be. There's a beautiful central courtyard (which doubles as lounge and dining area) with orange trees and ornate 'plunge pool' (although don't expect to be getting a swim but it is big enough to sit and cool off in which is probably much needed in the heat of the summer if not in February).  We stayed in two different rooms during our week - a standard for 4 nights and a suite for two nights. Both rooms were spacious and tastefully done in Moroccan style. Fairly basic on amenities - i.e. no telly/fridge/kettle etc. but we didn't need or miss anything. We had a free upgrade to the suite because they needed our room for another booking. I don't know how much extra they normally are but although it was slightly bigger it was not worth paying much more for.  The courtyard acts as a communal area and because there aren't many rooms in the Riad you soon get to meet everyone which is really handy for getting advice on things to see and do and tips on the essential haggling techniques. Minor downside being that noise travels really well through the Riad so don't be first to bed or have a blazing row as one couple did to the amusement of everyone else.  Two minutes out of the front door (at a leisurely pace) you are submerged into the chaos of the Souks. Nadia gives you a map of the alleys on arrival at the Riad. Guard it well. Its the most important bit of paper you'll get. If you even look slightly lost in the souks there's always someone trying to guide you back for a huge fee. Beware! (After a couple of days we were navigating our way without any problems)  A few minutes away is the main square where all the action happens. You can 'people watch' for hours from the terraces of the restaurants that surround the square.  The new town is dull and Marrakech has a limited number of landmarks to see. A week was plenty. The open top bus does the highlights in an hour. For some of the 'attractions' driving by is thorough enough.  We did an excursion to the mountains which was great. Our driver did however make quite a few stops at shops along the way in the hope of some commission no doubt. We weren't pressured to buy though.  We'd have liked to see the Sahara but that was a two day trip.  The Riad belongs to Phillipe but Nadia seemingly does most of the running of it and dealing with guests. The only thing that is lacking a little is her memory. We had three things that we had arranged with her on different occasions and each time it came to it she had either forgotten or the price had changed - miraculously always in their favour. They did always honour their original agreements but it was a nuisance to have to spend time arguing the toss over generally little things that they could have avoide with a bit more organisation.  Overall though a stunning Riad perfectly located for Marrakech's main features - the square and the souks.,Date of stay: February 2007,,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kolumbus
Riad Karmela,ThelmaLouiseUK wrote a review Feb 2007,40,The hidden gem,My friend and I have recently returned from a stay at the wonderful Riad Karmela. Although we had seen pictures on various websites before we arrived we could not believe how beautiful this place is compared to the alleyways you wander through in order to find it!    As others have said it's worthwhile getting the staff at the Riad to arrange your taxi from the airport as it's tricky to find. Once you arrive the staff are great at supplying you with information to help you get the most out of your trip. We were really impressed at the friendly and helpful nature of the staff. We only speak basic French but managed to get by no problem in Marrakech both at the Riad and out in the 'real world'. It is an added bonus to have an English speaker at the Riad - Nadia but the owner Philippe (French speaker ) is great and will do anything to help his guests even if your French is as basic as ours. Nadia is a real asset to the Riad.    There are some problems getting hot water at some times of the day but hey it's Africa! We recommend the Hamman and Gomage experience on offer at the Riad.  Food is good but it's nice to eat elsewhere too.  Riad bedrooms are clean tidy and big.  The communal (yard) area is a great place to chill out with a drink and a chance to chat to other guests. It's a really serene environment. Some of the bedrooms are situated around this area (as mentioned by others you may be woken if there is lots of activity in this area - we didn't experience this though).    Thoroughly recommend this Riad - well worth a stay.,Date of stay: February 2007,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Northern England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThelmaLouiseUK
Riad Karmela,SurreyFootloose wrote a review Feb 2007,50,A tranquil oasis in Marrakech,My wife and I spent 4 nights here in the Almansour suite and enjoyed every moment. Phillipe & Nadia (who speaks fluent English) were most hospitable as were every member of their staff.    Nadia took a personal interest in making sure we took the right excursions in our short stay to see the most of Marakech and the Atlas mountains. Our driver was on time and again took a keen interest in making sure we got to see the major points of interest.    The riad is deep in the Medina and the journey in from the airport after dark gives one some feelings of foreboding but on arrival there is a warm welcome and hot mint tea in the orangery quickly dispels any misgivings you may have.    Had dinner in the orangery on two nights and really enjoyed the Moroccan fayre and local wine. Self service Breakfasts too were very enjoyable.

Riad Karmela,dalston wrote a review Feb 2007,40,All round enjoyable experience,As previous reviewers have said it almost essential to take up the riad on their offer of arranging a taxi from the airport (even if it costs 3/4 times as much as it would otherwise) since its a nightmare to find. Even our taxi driver took us down the wrong dark alley at night but with the help of a local we eventually made it to the riad. We arrived to find no english speaking staff there which was a little strange but all was ok.    Fully agree with previous comments about the pleasant nature of the riad and how helpful Nadia is. She is happy to make reservations in restaurants or arrange trips we went for a day to the Atlas mountains for just 60 euros (for up to 4 people). Without Nadia the place would not function for english visitors who were the vast majority of the people staying there during our stay. No sign of this second english receptionist mentioned below. Nadia should ask for a payrise!!    The set up of the riad is nice and the communal nature of the living space means everyone staying there gets to know each other and socialises which for us really added to the experience. Only downside is that breakfast is served in the courtyard and while this is lovely for those having breakfast this can be pretty noisy if you are wanting a lie in (especially if kids are staying) but guess this is the same in any riad. If you can sleep through the noise then bonus is that breakfast is served till 12noon.    Marrakesh is a nice place to visit but 4 days was long enough for us great cultural experience but not a huge amount of landmarks.,Date of stay: February 2007,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalston
Riad Karmela,NellPrz wrote a review Feb 2007,40,Midnight at the Oasis!,We had a great 4 nights staying at this very attractive riad which is only 10 minutes walk from Jemaa el Fna through the souks and Place des Epices - well worth stopping for a coffee at the little cafe.    The approach to the Riad through the alleys is unsettling but quite safe and adds to the transformation when you get inside this little oasis.    Philippe does not have a lot of English but is very charming and welcoming . Nadia is very fluent and both are extremely helpful - nothing is too much trouble and you are made to feel very much home. Would recommend it to our friends as well as unsuspecting Trip Advisor readers but suggest you get up early to be sure of a hot shower! Strongly suggest that you take them up on their offer to meet you at the airport - it only costs 15 euros for 2 people- money very well spent.

The website lead us to believe it would not be a problem but if we had not had a local person helping us we would have not been put in the correct room not known when breakfast was served nor any of the other basic things a person needs to know. There was a hired person that spoke some English but she was not there when we arrived or for large parts of our stay. There was nothing available even written in English.

Riad Karmela,Raia wrote a review Jan 2007,50,Riad Karmela a haven of tranquillity in Marrakech,Riad Karmela is set in the heart of the Marrakech medina but is a haven of calm quiet and tranquillity. Reburbished recently from a traditional courtyard-based property with just a few rooms (all en-suite) the hotel has an intimate feel which is augmented by the friendly and helpful staff. Everything is decorated in wonderful luxurious but toned-down Morrocan taste and rooms have air-conditioning. Rooms are set around the courtyard on two floors with breakfast and dinner served in and around the courtyard. The courtyard contains sofas cushions and tables four orange trees and a small hot pool with jacuzzi. We had dinner at the hotel two nights and it was superb - delicious and very tasty versions of Morrocan food with wonderful fresh ingredients. The hotel's other big drawcard is the roof terrace looking out over the Marrakech roof-tops towards the snow-topped Atlas Mountains. The roof terrace has a comfortable covered terrace area with sofas cushions and tables - perfect for a sundown drink (and fabulous nibbles) - sun loungers and a small pool.

The staff went out of their way from the offset to make us feel welcome.    We opted to be picked up from the airport which I am truly thankful of - Marrakech is confusing enough without having to make your way through the warren like streets bleary eyed! We arrived to find ourselves upgraded from a standard double to a suite on the second floor which had been kitted out in a traditional yet tasteful Moroccan style bed was comfy and room was large and very clean.    I had a peak at the other rooms and they were all finished to the same high standard - the two ground floor doubles were smaller than the suite but opened into the central courtyard of the riad so you could open the double doors and lounge on one of the sofas.    Wireless internet throughout the building was a bonus and the breakfast of pancakes bread jams and fresh orange juice was delicious. We didn't really have time to eat dinner at the riad but judging from what other guests said it sounds well worth investigating.

This Riad has recently been taken over by Phillippe who tastefully re-decorated all 8 rooms and the lovely roof terrace. Also has a small jacuzzi. All rooms are uniquely different check out the website to see ""[--]"".  Should you wish one of the lovely artefacts just ask Phillippe and he can source one for you at a better price than the souks. Personally we got a lovely date pot which we could not find in the Souks  Nadia runs front of house and is lovely efficient and able to help with all your queries.  Ask for them to cook you a meal one night a culinery delight and at 20 euros a real bargain.    Hint: When you book call them and ask to get picked up from the Airport this will:  a) save the hassle of negotiating the fare  (anything from 175 to 300 dirhams) and is the best value.  b) The driver will know where the Riad is a big advantage as the normal Marrakech Taxi drivers knowledge of any Hotel or Riads location is minimal or non-existant.
