La Villa Jardins D'Isa,Steve Brown wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Highly recommended,Villa is a great location on the outskirts of Marrakech. Centre. 15 mins by taxi to the Medina. Staff are very friendly Villa and grounds pool are very clean and well maintained. We stayed in one of the Villas which was separate from the main building and gave us some privacy. It is very large and can easily accommodate 6 guests. Two large family bathrooms with excellent shower facilities. There are cooking facilities and a large fridge and freezer if you prefer to do self catering although meals are available in the main building. We ate out each evening so can’t comment on the food but the other guest seemed very happy.    This really worked for us as you get the best of both worlds facilities of a small hotel but the privacy and cooking options of a private villa and much better value for money.    We hired a car but taxis are also easy to get and reasonably priced. Make sure you stick to the speed limits if you hire though as the local police stop cars regularly to check documents and will fine you on the spot for speeding.    I would also recommend for families with young children as well as there is a large pool and badminton table tennis and football games onsite..    It is a family run Hotel and all the staff are extremely courteous and friendly and provide excellent service. We will definitely return.    Thanks to the family for a great weeks holiday.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7280BCsteveb
La Villa Jardins D'Isa,A. Soren wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Beautiful oasis,We stayed two nights at Villa Jardins during our trip and it was the absolute best decision! Beautiful bright room connected to the pool patio. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. We had two dinners at the Villa and it was some of the best food we had in Morocco. It's a little drive out of the Medina which meant that it is completely quiet and peaceful. Can absolutely recommend staying here!,Date of stay: July 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D5689NVanjas
La Villa Jardins D'Isa,Mehna C wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Recommend it all day long! Such a wonderful place. Only real complaint is the ice pool!!,"Overall I could not recommend Villa Jardins D'isa enough! Firstly they were the most hospitable people I've ever come across in a hotel abroad. Every night my partner and I requested Mint tea from Ilyas (who worked overnight) and he would bring it to our room specially. He made our stay very memorable as he was so warm and kind.    As a follow on the food there was lovely! But be prepared to have the same dish come out in different forms. The first night of our stay we had the spaghetti in this beautiful sauce and then we ordered the same pasta a couple of days later and the sauce was completely different! Needless to say we were slightly disappointed as the sauce was our favourite part of the dish and had we known it was going to be different we would have ordered something else. But in all honesty that's the most we have in terms of a ""complaint"". That and the pool was absolutely freezing. I wanted to jump in so bad but in all honesty it felt more like an ice bath than a swimming pool!    On the last day we had some issues with our card for payment and I cannot explain enough how calm and kind Anna was about it. She ensured our stay wasn't affected by it and was incredibly accommodating about the whole situation where I think most places would have made a big deal about the whole thing.    Our room was wonderful! We had the suite mountain view room and it beyond exceed our expectations! We thought the hallway in our room was communal!! The shower was huge however the pressure was slightly lacklustre but to be honest that's me being pinnickity. The wardrobe is nice and spacious and the bedroom as well.    Lastly there is a free shuttle to the city which is super helpful! It runs at 10am and then 5pm so if you happen to finish there you would need wifi to contact the hotel. Wifi is very scarce in Marrakech. The only place we found it was near the banks and exchange places  just next to the main square.    All in all a relaxing place to stay with a lovely ambience. I would highly recommend anyone in a couple to stay here as it has a very romantic aura about it. Thank you Anna and David!",Date of stay: February 2020,,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mehna96
La Villa Jardins D'Isa,Zarete S wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Such a wonderful quiet stay with great service!!,Nothing to complain about here had such a lovely peaceful in such a beautiful well kept property. The staff were excellent so accommodating and extremley attentive. Anna and David were superb always arranging taxis for us even if a very last minute request (thank you) and they consistently served us with a smile which always makes such a difference. I must say the food was lovely so much so that even just the smell of spices from the kitchen was enough to satisfy us. The grounds are absolutely beautiful with accessibility to most areas and as well as WiFi there are games and activities to keep you occupied should you not have any outings planned. Will certainly return!,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaretes

La Villa Jardins D'Isa,Zatur wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Great place with amazing host !,When we were in Marrakech we stayed at a villa own by AnnaCasandro (not sure Ofni spelled her name right). We stayed in 2 rooms since we’re a family of 4. I love the design of the place including room toilet pool garden etc. everything is well organized clean etc. Host was amazing friendly and accommodating. She helped us a lot throughout our stay in Marrakech.  Since this is a private villa with small number of rooms there’s no buffet for meals like in other hotels but as long as you place orders in advance food can be prepared for you. And they are all delicious. I would definitely come and stay in the same place again. You can also get your hammam and massage done in the same place. Just book in advance.    Note: the location is not in city hence be prepared to spent around 130-150 dirham for cab if you want to go to city/mall.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lagos, Nigeria",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zatur456
La Villa Jardins D'Isa,Caroline J wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Relaxing oasis of style and comfort,Perfect location 15 min drive outside Marrakech. We didn't want to stay right in the heart of the city and this was the perfect choice. The hosts Anna and Davide a young french couple made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The food they cooked breakfast and dinner was delicious. It was authentic Moroccan food cooked in a tangine and lovely locally baked bread was always offered. We enjoyed the selection of Moroccan wines and their how grown olives. We had a suite with pool and mountain views. The room was beautiful modern interior with moroccan touches. Large bathroom with walk in shower and two basins. The dining area and lounge also have beautiful interiors. The hosts were very helpful and on request arranged a taxi to take us to the mountains stopping at Argan Oil places and a Berber house on the way. A guide was also organised for us to take us walking to the waterfalls. After a day out it was lovely just chilling at the guest house enjoying the lovely chilled out music they play sitting around the pool. We also experienced a Hammam at the guest house as well. Would highly recommend Villa Jardins D'Isa we stayed 4 days on a half board basis and combined sights with relaxation a perfect stay.,Date of stay: March 2019,,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/141cazjackson

La Villa Jardins D'Isa,I-B_MUNGAN wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Superb service in a quiet area,This is our second time in Marrakesh for a wedding so we wanted to stay outside of the Medina.

La Villa Jardins D'Isa,Harry G wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Could not have asked for a more perfect stay,We spent a week at Villa Jardin d’Isa and had an unfortgettable stay. Anna and David are brilliant hosts and nothing is too much to ask. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced the rooms are immaculate and very modern with great ammenities. Anna would arrange a taxi into the centre of Marrakech for 100dh each way which was excellent and very reliable. We were lucky enough to have the whole place to ourselves for the week and thoroughly enjoyed how peaceful and relaxing our stay was. We would recommend anybody to stay at Villa Jardin d’Isa and we look forward to returning in the future we could not have asked for a more perfect stay!    Thank you once again Anna and David.    All the best  Harry and Emma,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233harryg
La Villa Jardins D'Isa,Andy C wrote a review Apr 2018,50,A true escape from the hustle and bustle,We spent 3 nights at D'Isa for Easter and thoroughly enjoyed the tranquility that it offers. Very clean well decorated great service great food and fantastic value. This is a family owned property offering only 6 rooms or so in total. There are 2 big villas and 3 or 4 smaller rooms of which we took 2 for my family and my inlaws. The smaller ones are still quite spacious and as a recent build were in great condition with all the mod cons you would expect.  It is located 20 minutes from the City center so easily reachable by taxi or rental car. Not the easiest place to find but Google maps managed it well enough.  The pool is more than generous for the amount of people staying there and were able to relax in a very quiet and comfortable retreat from the madness of Marrakech.  They catered for our baby with no extra charge for a travel cot and could not have doen more for us hot milk in the evening to get him to sleep seperate bowls of fruit for his breakfast again at no extra charge. Very kind and thoughtfuol people,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyc771
