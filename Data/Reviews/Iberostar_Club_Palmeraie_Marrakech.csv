Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,AnnChelvey wrote a review Mar 23,40,"Beautiful grounds, great facilities.",Hotel has beautiful well maintained grounds lovely to walk around. Rooms very pleasant well equipped bathrooms we found the mattresses and pillows rather firm and took some getting used to. The staff were very helpful. The pools were excellent great to have an adult only pool. The facilities were amazing archery tennis badminton petang etc and even trapeze work.  Food - loved the breakfasts ( bread amazing) lunch- really enjoyed the salad bar but unfortunately the hot food was only ever warm and rather bland the dishes very similar. Desserts too nice 😂  The hotel is half an hour from Marrakesh but there are free shuttle buses.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Backwell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnChelvey
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,simon3004 wrote a review Mar 23,50,Lived up to the hype,Amazing grounds  with very friendly staff. Although some of the waiters seemed more interested in topping up glasses for perceived tips. Food was spectacular. Wonderful Moroccan section great pasta and fresh salads. Plenty of options for a vegetarian. Shuttle bus offers a regular service but more buses in the afternoons. Superb swimming pools and adult only area was very popular. Clean and spacious rooms. Yes staff spoke more in French but usually spoke some English.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Elaine S wrote a review Mar 20,50,Fantastic All Inclusive hotel,Just returned from a fantastic holiday at this hotel. Probably the best all inclusive hotel I’ve stayed at.    Rooms  Are spacious  Plenty of storage  Fantastic powerful shower with loads of hot water  Great size of towels. This might seem trivial but when the towel wraps all the way round with some to spare it’s a luxury.  Shower gel smelt beautiful  It was cleaned to a very high standard every day  Water was in the fridge when we arrived  Beds were comfortable  Great magnifying mirror in the bathroom  Balcony on the small side but we didn’t use it    Staff  With only one exception the staff were extremely friendly  They couldn’t do enough for you  The restaurant staff remembered what you like to drink after the first day. Your tea/coffee was in your table when you get back with your first plate at breakfast and your wine at dinner.  Nothing was a problem for them  Same could be said for the bar staff at the main bar. Friendly cheery people.  Staff in the al a carte restaurant were not near as friendly or efficient as the main restaurant.  My exception is one girl at reception Khadija. Firstly she left us sitting for about 30 mins waiting to check in when we’d had a long day traveling and it was late. When she was approached about this she was extremely unfriendly. I also experienced this attitude on another two occasions within days of arriving.  This seemed even more disappointing when the rest of the reception staff were so helpful and pleasant. It’s a shame because she was the first person we had an interaction with.    Food and drink  The food was marvellous. From simple vegetables tasting amazing to the best burgers from the barbecue I have ever tasted.  The variety was great.  The opportunity to taste many traditional food and flavours was also great.  I wouldn’t recommend the al a carte restaurant. The food was ok the service less than ok. Even although it’s good to get your food served to you it was a much better dining experience in the buffet restaurant.  The cocktails delicious. So many all inclusive hotels offer watered down coloured liquid and call them cocktails. The ones here were proper cocktails.  Wine was lovely in the restaurant and been able to help yourself was nice.    Pools and gardens  I can’t talk about the main activity pool as I didn’t use it choosing instead the quiet adult pool.  Beds were comfortable  Area was clean  If you went to move a bed to another position the pool attendant came over and moved it for you.  Magnificent gardens constantly being attended to by an army of gardeners. It was a delight to walk through them.    Shuttle Bus  Shuttle bus to the centre was great. Always on time.  It’s drops you about 25 mins walk from the Medena.  We usually got a taxi back as we could face the walk back to the bus  Taxis were 150 dirams. We were never scammed they always asked from the same at the end of the journey.    For consideration  Advertise that there is food a available from the barbecue. Had we always used the main door into the restaurant we would never have known the barbecue was there.    Have a facility to offer hot water at the pool bars. I wanted tea when I used the burger truck but was told I’d need to get it from the main bar in the hotel.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"North Lanarkshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainesZ6361KA
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Adrienne E wrote a review Mar 20,50,A wonderful week,We've just returned from a wonderful week at this fantastic hotel. The grounds are large and beautifully landscaped meticulously maintained by the hard working ground staff. The hotel throughout is exceptionally clean too. The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  For an all inclusive hotel the food is exceptional. My friend and I are both vegetarians and often struggle to eat something other than grated carrot at our holiday hotels! This was most definitely not the case here. A fantastic choice of salads tangines fritattas rice and lentil dishes all delicious.  The staff are a definite strong point of the hotel always friendly and polite. Particular mention must go to Abdel (who always greeted us with a smile at the entrance to the restaurant) Youseff (waiter working from the main hotel bar) who was so friendly and smiley and also the hotel Manager himself Walid. On chatting to Walid we complimented him on the hotel food. I mentioned that it would be nice to have some nuts with the breakfast buffet to go with the yoghurt and dried fruit. Walid very kindly arranged for a generous supply of walnuts cashews and almonds to be delivered to our room that we could take to breakfast every day. Excellent customer service and very much appreciated.  The hotel is a little way out of Marrakech but runs a free shuttle service throughout the day. Do note though that it does drop you a good 20 minute walk away from the main square so factor in the heat of the day when you book your times. If you prefer to take a taxi there are always a few waiting outside of the hotel. Typical costs would be 150 dirham during the day rising to 200 dirham at night. We did find throughout our holiday that the taxi drivers will try it on with their fares so don't be afraid to negotiate!  We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dursley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eloisecherry
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,JandGWestSussex wrote a review Mar 19,50,Amazing getaway to the sun,My husband and I spent 5 nights at this wonderful hotel last week. The hotel is in a great location away from the city centre so very peaceful and relaxing. From start to finish the staff were incredible - they really go the extra mile to make your stay amazing. Special mention goes out to Khalid Lacoste Ashraf Meriem Adraoui (he’s is AMAZING) Adil and Ben.  The buffet restaurant offered really good variety to suit all palates with live fresh food being prepared too. The Moroccan restaurant is well worth a visit (book when you arrive as it isn’t open everyday). We had traditional Moroccan dishes including a delicious vegetable soup seafood pastry and of course tagine!  The entertainment team go to all lengths to keep everyone engaged and having a fun time. There’s a variety of things to do from water polo to yoga and trapeze. There’s also a quiet pool if you don’t want to engage in the activities.  The shuttle service to the city is really good and we went into the souks etc one morning.  We had an Atlas Mountain facing room and it was lovely to wake to the birds tweeting in the morning. I would highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for an escape to the sun with nice food accommodation facilities and most of all the BEST staff.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,West Sussex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JandGWestSussex
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Tricia wrote a review Mar 17,50,Perfect holiday - please read for honest review,My husband and I stayed at this wonderful resort for a week and I always try to be as honest as I can when writing reviews.  The resort is wonderful - check in seamless. We had a garden view.  Gardens are well kept which the gardening staff worked on every day.  Pool - we choose the Zen Pool as it was quieter. All pools are clean and cleaned down each day. Sun beds are reserved early.  Food - good food the A La Carte Restaurant is only open 5 days a week- you need to book.  Gym- why is opens at 9am I will never know strange time why not earlier?  Staff-all helpful and friendly.  Running track - it’s okay for running a little uneven though in places lovely walk around here watch out for the goose with attitude 😂  Cats - a few cats around that steal the hearts of the holiday makers. One small tabby very friendly and walks around inside.  Bus to the centre - great free service and runs several times a day and you need to reserve a time.  What nobody seems to mention in the reviews are the street dogs active at night. One beautiful girl is outside the hotel every morning. She’s timid but so friendly and gentle. Please show her an act of kindness and pass it on in your review for the next person to read. She can’t tell you that she is hungry scared and in need of human kindness-but she is. She’s not fussed on bread. Take 5 minutes out of your day to check she’s doing okay and perhaps a little ham ?,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Chesterfield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriciaE94

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mayur K wrote a review Mar 1,50,Iberostar Marrakech,Amazing Staff from the moment you enter the hotel very welcoming. Upon arrival we were shown our rooms and then taken to the restaurant for meal as we arrived late evening staff from each area were absolutely amazing and hospitable. The Chef's were making sure my family was looked after as 80% were pure vegetarian. The Bar staff were polite and very kind always happy to serve no matter what time of day you wanted a drink. Entertainment Staff were all there all the time to help you with either your exercise or anything that you would like. I would like to thank the team off Sara and rest of the Management Team for doing such a Fantastic Job. I'll definitely visit again.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176mayurk

From quick and easy check in on late arrival to friendly bar and waiting staff we were well looked after. The buffet food at breakfast lunch and dinner is fresh varied and very well presented. rooms are large clean and well fitted out. The grounds are large and the two main pools perfect to spend time by. The hotel is some way from the centre but there is a transfer service if wanted although we didn't use it.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,lucinda d wrote a review Feb 2023,50,"Amazing stay and hotel, staff exceptional, food delicious and all so clean",This hotel was brilliant for two families with teens. It is so clean the rooms are excellent and comfortable and house keeping can’t do enough. The staff through out this hotel is incredible Zahara on reception Ismeil in the bar and the man who ran around the pool till 6pm looking after everyone are worth a special mention as well as our waiter in the restaurant who keep us well supplied in wine. The food is delicious and so fresh with lots of choices the a la carte did an amazing tagine. It’s nice when Star mascot bananaman pops by the restaurant! Good coffee at the lobby inside bar the self serve coffee machines are like coffee roulette on what you will get but it all tasted ok!! The bar staff are amazing and good drink’s selection included and lots of cocktail parties and events to get sparkling wine too. Lovely gardens and grounds loved listening to the birds in the morning and seeing the resident peacocks. Pool immaculate. Gym was great for our teenage son. Spa well priced. Good entertainment team and lots going on.    One small improvement is needed please - the sports equipment needs updating one shuttle cock that is falling apart some new rackets and table tennis bats are needed and new good quality footballs - if this is sorted it would be perfect!    We did not use the shuttle as a taxi is only 150 dirham into town and you can get a taxi anywhere in Marrakesh for return.    If you get a poor weather day check out Enigma escape rooms in Marrakesh and grab a taxi there it was brilliant! Loved the hotel loved the city and loved Morocco!,Date of stay: February 2023,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucindad963

The staff was extremely friendly the restaurant very flexible and accomodating. All the restaurant staff deserves a special thanks. We had ten great evenings here which we will cherish forever.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,tanyaball76 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Amazing holiday,We have just returned from a weeks stay at this amazing resort. It was our first all inclusive and it did not disappoint. We found our stay relaxing and stress free. The staff were hardworking welcoming and are a true asset to this hotel as their customer care was 10/10. The rooms and hotel were spotless and clean with the rooms being refreshed everyday. The outside gardens were immaculate with not a leaf out of place. It was lovely to hear the birds every morning and observe the peahen's walking past the door.  The food was delicious there was so much to choose from. Every salad you could think of fresh fish and meat being cooked while you wait roasted vegetables soups smoothie's and a large varieties of bread. After a fulfilling meal there was an array of puddings and fresh fruit to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Highly recommend the tour of the souks in Marrakech out tour guide Mohammed made it a perfect experience with his knowledge and tailoring the tour to suit us and what we wanted so see and do.  We will 100% be returning. It was a perfect holiday for all the family so if you are reading this review don't hesitate on booking as you will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanyaball76

The photos really don’t do the place justice the grounds are stunning. As a family of 3 with an almost 13 year old we enjoyed the pool when the sun was out ping pong badminton etc. my daughter joined in with the other kids playing volleyball etc. Here she met other kids & then happily spent the nights with them.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Live The Dream wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Outstanding 4 star hotel,I booked this hotel directly. As a 4 star hotel I simply cannot complain about it.    It is about a 20 minute drive from the hustle and bustle of the city. There are several hotel coaches each day taking you to the city for free.    The rooms are basic ie no coffee facilities etc but exceptionally clean and well maintained - the largest bed I have seen in a hotel for a long time. I did find the corridors very echoey so when people returned to their rooms at night it was quite distrubing. Our room was interleading to another and was some sound coming from the earlier risers room.    The hotel grounds are manicured to perfection.    There are PLENTY activities to do ie archary trampolines bouilles 3 pools tennis badminton table tennis - the list goes on. You or your children will never be bored.    The food was good - very traditional but plentyful and fresh. As it is all inclusive the wine at lunch and dinner was self service - loved this idea as it saved you waiting endlessly for a glass of wine.    The endless entertainment by hotel standards was impressive. There was entertainment during the day around the pool (albeit we had awful weather) and at night time.    There is a spa which is run independantly. I found it to be pricey by Morroccon standards and prices in Marrakech itself. This might have been the hotels only let down but as I said it is not owned or managed by the hotel.    There is a kids club which we did not use but from the staff I understand there were some great activities.    The staff cannot do enough for you. They are all friendly and go above and beyond and specifally Sara. We had a small medical emergency (childs own fault) and needed to see a doctor offsite. Both the nurses and Sara remained calm and help with language barriers between doctors and pharmacy etc.    This is my first time staying at an Iberor hotel and certainly has left me with a positive feeling to return and most certainly when we return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedomwithtravel

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Dwanderlustpinoy wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Great Hotel,The hotel has a lot to offer. Good food (some) brilliant staff and things to do.    Facilities- you will never ran out of things to do. They have 3 swimming pools badminton court tennis court trampoline and many more activities in the hotel. They also have a shuttle bus to take you to the souk which runs quite frequently.    Staff - The reception staff particularly Zakaria and Zeinab has been very helpful throughout our stay. Zakaria goes out of his way and take that extra mile to please the guests. Having said that some staff particularly at the restaurant seem less friendlier. My friend and I asked for some help in our first night as we arrived late and when we went to the restaurant it was full so we asked if there is anywhere we can sit and we weee just told to wait but they never got back to us. In the end we took our food and sat outside. One lunch time the person on the grill (outside) was very grumpy. I asked for the turkey to be well done and he looked at me as if I was asking for too much. In summary the staff has been lovely aside from those in the restaurant.    Ver Good - it’s lovely and they have theme nights. The only thing o was disappointed about is that they cancel our restaurant booking last minute. Unfortunately we booked it in our last night so we were not able to re book it.    Overall a brilliant stay for us!,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/londonerwanderlust

The surrounding area is dusty but worth going for a walk as we did to a village- which was interesting.  The Hotel provided all the necessary comfort one could imagine for a beautiful stay in Morocco that would make one to return. Daily coulple/family activities and evening entertainments  The Hotel also provide several slot times for complimentary shuttle to the Medina and the Menara area (new city).

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Shantele72 wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Great choice of all inc for Marrakesh,This was my first experience in an all inclusive hotel and first time in Marrakesh. Have to say that we had a great time there. The grounds are stunning the room was good we also had a little balcony and there is loads to do on site. It is in the middle of nowhere so don't expect to be able to wander to a shop/restaurants outside its a taxi journey to nearest and about 20 minute drive to Marrakesh itself.    I's heard horror stories about all inclusive and food but the buffet food was fabulous - loads of choice and really tasty with stations where they'd cook you fresh food. The Morrocan food was lovely. Someone else mentioned it was not labelled which is true - some (very obvious food like salads) is labelled and others that aren't so obvious aren't?! One thing I'd say is give the 'special restaurant' that you can book once during your stay a big miss. We booked for the last night and the service was shocking and the food despite being pre ordered was awful meagre portions and the tagine didn't have any extras - no cous cous veg etc. Ruined our last night when we were hoping for a special meal.    Drinks flowed freely great choice bar staff are friendly and attentive - special thanks for Mohammed 7 who was AMAZING!! Pool area is lovely and the entertainment staff work very hard to offer something for everyone. The night time entertainment was great just a shame there weren't more people there as the theatre area is massive. At points I'd say entertainment staff were a touch aggressive trying to drag people up that don't want to engage and could be a little cliquey where they are dancing around with their friends. But overall the shows were really good and the dancers are just fabulous.    Few minor criticisms -  1. how cold the hotel was in the evenings in the bar area - they could do with some heating for the cold nights in Marrakesh  2. we had a triple room but had to keep asking for three towels despite it being very obvious that three adults were in the room  3. Didn't get sufficient information about what was going on in the hotel including about times when the shuttle bus was going into town - we ended up paying for a guide    Overall I had a great time and would definitely return. For the money it was great value and I'd recommend especially for families.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shantele72
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,PBDS wrote a review Feb 2023,30,Good but not great,Pro: Visit to Marrakech was amazing but hotel contributed to a small part of this. Booked a room for three people was given a room with only two single beds. Complained and got resolved but took a while as receptionist only spoke minimum amount of English which is fine as the manager helped us. Room later given was clean and nice.    Con: Food was plain didn’t have much flavour. Food isn’t labelled so hard to pick and know what to eat. Most food got cold quickly so if you didn’t come in as soon as breakfast lunch or dinner was opened your eating cold food. Mainly didn’t eat the food in the hotel and ate outside because of this.,Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bellajaiye

The entertainment live singing dancing cocktail night were all very good. The outside space was beautifully landscaped. With a variety of sport areas eg table tennis tennis golf swimming. A lovely place to take a walk after a fabulous meal. Lots of variety with a mix of Moroccan and European food.  I was surprised the room didn’t have complimentary tea and coffee and also water bottles. The regular coach to and from jemma el Fina was so handy what a brilliant idea .

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Zak W wrote a review Dec 2022,50,Amazing stay!,Me and my partner visited in December and it was a pleasant stay the staff really make you feel welcome the entertainment team are great always remember your name and always say hello the room was great and spacious and was always cleaned to a high standard there is plenty to do with various activities through the day and different competitions.    The food was okay for all inclusive standards only thing I would say is not enough meat options on the cookers expect a lot of fish and occasionally chicken there is a restaurant where you have to book to get a dining experience but for me it wasn’t that great I’d rather eat in the inclusive restaurant.    We have booked again to visit next year and we’re already looking forward to it I can’t thank the staff enough for making us feel welcome and going above and beyond to make our stay more pleasant.    One last thing the lifeguard in the “Zen” pool really needs to cheer up he tells people to be quiet even though there not talking that loud and looks miserable as ever the zen pool is supposed to be an adults only relaxing pool however you can hear people screaming on the trapeze which is located right behind the zen pool so you can’t really have the cheek to tell people to be quiet when that is going on.    Other than that though this hotel is amazing!    See you next year!,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zakw565
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ab5469 wrote a review Dec 2022,10,An honest in-depth review- please read if considering this hotel,"My husband and I are Iberostar club members and have visited multiple other Iberostar hotels in Mexico DR and Portugal all with good experiences. I have also visited over 30 countries and traveled to many types of hotels. We stayed at this hotel to explore Marrakech and also have a relaxing stay but had a very negative experience beyond what I expected. First of all I would like to be fair and mention that I think this hotel in general just is not the best for young couples like ourselves. The guests mostly consist of French families and the hotel caterers for them- there are multiple activities for children and there were very few adults traveling without children. They have a trapeze class which is very unique and three different pools. Regardless I would not come back here even if I had children based on the experiences we had at this hotel. If you are considering it I would say don't waste your money here stay at a riad don't trust the 5 star reviews for this resort.    Staff: A few members of the staff at this hotel were kind and friendly but I had multiple unprofessional experiences with employees especially at the reception. When we first arrived to check in we were barely acknowledged and told to sit in the lobby while we were given paperwork to fill out. There was no ""how was your flight?"" (especially since we had been traveling for 12 hours) and there was not even an explanation of the hotel services or map. In addition we had many issues with miscommunication when speaking in English. We had called a few days before our arrival to ask a few questions and make a dinner reservation at the Moroccan restaurant in the hotel. We spoke on the phone with the same man who checked us in and he had told us over the phone that he would make the reservation at the restaurant when we arrived at the hotel. However when we got there he told us that he made the dinner reservation for tonight and seemed very annoyed at us for questioning it. We told him it was no problem and we were happy to go to dinner tonight we had just misunderstood what he had told us over the phone. But he could have responded with ""I am sorry for the miscommunication would you still like to keep the reservation tonight?"" instead of the way that he addressed it. I then realized later on that a lot of the issues we had were due to the lack of English spoken at the hotel. I speak a little French and everyone at the hotel speaks French so the next time I went to the reception I asked something in French to the woman working there. However I made a few mistakes and the woman looked at me and asked in French ""I don't understand do you actually speak French?"" instead of trying to be nice that I was accommodating with speaking a language that is not native to me. I found the comment unnecessary and rude.    Food: there is one Moroccan restaurant and one buffet at the resort. The Moroccan restaurant was underwhelming and we ate there the first night and did not come back. The buffet was slightly better but the food was still not great with not enough options. If you are a picky eater you will probably have issues with this. I also noticed (which multiple other reviewers had mentioned) that nothing in the buffet is labeled so it can be very hard to tell what the food is. This was very challenging for me as a vegetarian because I never knew if what I was choosing may have meat. I don't think it would be so hard for them to put a sign saying what the food is or putting a vegetarian symbol- I can imagine if you have a child with allergies this would be very stressful. The drinks were absolutely horrible- terribly mixed flat no flavor. During the day by the pool there is a food truck with burgers which was okay. The bar by the pool accumulates tons of bees making it impossible to get a drink from the soda foundation. Overall not enough options. This was especially challenging as the hotel is far from the center of Marrakesh- it is in the middle of nowhere so you can't so easily just go to the city for a quick night out at a different restaurant unless you want to pay hefty taxi bills. During the day there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the city center which is a huge plus but it is about a 25 minute drive.    Wifi: The wifi was HORRIBLE at this hotel. If you rely on wifi to call home or need to get work done I would not come here. We were not able to get enough wifi to facetime our family in the US because it was so spotty.    Rooms: Biggest issue I had with this is that the hallways get very loud and it made it very hard to sleep. The hallways echo a lot and I found that a lot of the guests were very loud with no consideration of those sleeping. This was very bad the last night we were there when people would be in the hallways talking very loudly close to midnight. We had to wake up early for our flight the next day and it made it impossible to sleep. In addition to the fact that every morning the call to prayer woke me up at 6:30 I didn't get the best sleep here.    The rooms themselves are okay for a 4 star hotel but they consist of 2 twin beds pushed together. I would have much preferred a queen or king size bed for us though this isn't a huge deal for a few days. The cleaning staff does clean the actual room well but I did notice that if someone left a dirty cup or plate in the hallway it would not be picked up for several days and would start to accumulate fruit flies all over it which was a little disturbing. I'm surprised that for three days straight no one could pick up the dirty dishes to remove it.    When we checked out we asked to exchange some money to euros which we had done at check in. The woman working there said she couldn't help us she didn't even ask someone else or try to accommodate. Her manager overheard this then asked us how much we needed and he then said to her in French that she should help us and exchange the money with us which the hotel has always been able to do. Again no ""how was your stay"" or ""hope you had a nice time."" Overall terrible service and I just feel that if you are going to spend the money to come to Marrakech go somewhere better and enjoy your experience more.",Date of stay: December 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ab5469

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michael JJ wrote a review Dec 2022,50,A WONDERFUL OASIS IN MARRAKECH,In fifty years of serious traveling to all parts of the world it has come to my attention that the main difference between hotels comes down to the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. The Iberostar Club Palmerie Hotel does not disappoint.  From the General Manager on down everyone has one goal in mind and that is to provide a first class experience for their guests. A customer service team that is the equal of any luxury hotel.  Upon arrival we were met by the Bellman who secured our luggage ushered us into the lobby and provided a refreshing drink.  Check in was accomplished in under 5 minutes by Mr. Muhammad Ali and the front desk staff. Throughout our stay he went out of his way to ensure our every need was met and our room selection satisfactory. Muhammad Ali’s colleague Zenab also needs recognition for her friendliness and unfailing assistance.  The food at every meal was amazing. Breakfast lunch and dinner offered endless choices of local and western cuisine catering to all tastes. The food was beautifully presented and easily accessible. The varied tastes were incredible and the restaurant staff met every need. Rachida was a special delight. It was readily apparent that each team member took extreme pride in their contribution to the dining experience.  Bar service was quick friendly and efficient and the drinks varied and excellent.  The rooms are spacious clean and neat with every amenity one expects from a premium hotel. The rooms were kept immaculately clean by the professional chamber maids led by Noura.  The Lead Customer Service Representative Sara ensured our every request was satisfactorily dealt with and she kept us informed of all upcoming hotel activities and events.  The multi-talented entertainment team presented a variety of professional shows and events daily with something for every taste. First class.  The heated pools are maintained immaculately with ample new sun beds in beautifully maintained grounds.  Tours can be easily arranged through the hotel to all of the local sites. The trip into town center is available at no charge and takes 25 minutes each way by modern tour bus. An amazing cost savings over taxis and is a great way to experience local color.  In summary the hotel rooms amenities services cleanliness cuisine pool spa etc. will not disappoint and are what you should expect from a luxury accommodation. However more importantly are the people. The first class experience of this hotel is directly related to each team member providing you with a personalized selfless customer interaction. Thanks to everyone for a memorable and relaxing 11 day vacation.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Atlanta, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeljE9283FI

The pools are heated which is great at this time of year. We particularly enjoyed the adult only pool which was really tranquil yet having its own bar.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,bsmitty1983 wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Wonderful and faultless hotel,I have stayed at other Iberostar hotels in the Caribbean and have never been disappointed. This was no different. Staff are fantastic go out of their way to please and make your stay special. They really make you feel like you are on a luxury holiday. Food was brilliant always something different and the quality was fantastic. Yes the scrambled egg wasn’t piping hot but it was more than edible and there is microwaves if you need it hotter. Lots of choices for all meals and with different bars offering snacks between the main meal times you are never going to go hungry. Main pool area music was a bit intrusive but not offensive and the zen pool area was great never had a problem getting a sun bed some people were reserving them with towels but it wasn’t necessary at this time of year. There are extensive and wonderful gardens to walk round with plenty of different wildlife. There are cats everywhere which I loved they are friendly and cute and very appreciative of a little something from the buffet. The hotels gym was very well equipped for a hotel gym and although it doesn’t open until 9am it is right in near location to bedrooms so it’s understandable and not a massive problem. There’s no kettle in the room but Very decent coffee machines available at all times. Massage in the spa was very good and reasonably priced at about £50 for 55 minutes. The free bus into town is great too I can highly recommend taking one of the guides around the market as it’s very easy to get lost and they will take you to some cool places they do take you to places to buy stuff but we’re totally fine if you didn’t want to there was no pressure. We went in the morning and it was busy but I understand it’s busier at night. Honestly could not fault the hotel or staff at all they work tirelessly to attend to all needs and keep the place constantly clean and tidy. I can’t wait to return to this hotel.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Drivercarps wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Loved the cats,I’m leaving this hotel shortly after five days.    I’ll do some good and bad points.    Good: the food is excellent extensive and well cooked and presented. I’d say it’s faultless apart from one thing (see bad section).  The animals: I chose this hotel because I read on TA there were cats here and I love animals. I brought them some treats from home but then read the welcome sheet from the hotel which said not to feed them. If guests don’t feed them who looks after them? They are lovely so I ignored the request and fed them daily. There are peahens and geese too. Loved them all. I’d return just for them.  The staff: nearly all were smiling helpful all the time.  The pools: They are heated. Not to be hot or warm but to a temperature that is perfect. Generally I hate pools as think they are unhygienic but I got in the quiet one as it looked so clean and was very inviting. It was great.  My bed: comfortable as was the room but would have loved a kettle.    The bad: Most of the (delicious) food isn’t labelled so you have no idea what’s in it. I am a pescatarian so the only meat I eat is fish and I kept selecting salads (and even though I looked hard when dishing them onto my plate) I only discovered bits of meat when I was putting it into my mouth. This is so frustrating as I missed out on so many dishes as I didn’t know what was in them. A simple green V on a card next to a dish would help a lot. I saw this mentioned in previous reviews too.    The clientele: in common with a general lack of consideration for others across society these days the guests of this hotel woke me up every night without fail. I requested a quiet room away from entertainment and the hotel kindly obliged. However every night I was woken by laughing loud voices shouting door slamming etc right outside my room in the corridor at almost midnight as they were coming back from the entertainment. The tiny signs in the corridors of a finger on lips are easily missed and not enough. The lack of sleep and then call to prayer at 6.15am meant I was sleep deprived for the entire holiday.  The walls are also really thin so I could hear talking and coughing all night too.    An addition thing to appeal to cat or animal lovers.    I’m worried about a little cat family living on the raised terrace near the outside stage (which doesn’t seem to be used). They are gorgeous. A mother cat and three kittens and I think she’s pregnant again. Please look after them. I fed them and gave them water and they were very grateful as are all the hotel cats. I’ll miss them please cat lovers bring them some nice things and please Iberostar staff keep them fed watered and safe.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Ryan M wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Very pleasantly surprised. Would return,Initially I’m struggling to understand so many of the negative points raised here about this hotel. Whilst I appreciate a lot of a stay can be portioned down to fortunate timing we had an exceptional week. The food in the main buffet surpasses any expectations I could have had when booking. Variety of food from traditional moroccan to well made Pizza and fries if you so desire. Bbq and hot plate cookery was always a treat where often there’s fish being made at lunch. Dessert pastries are exceptional at both lunch and dinner. Admittedly the buffet restaurant exceeded the “table service” restaurant which you visit once during your stay this night was in fact the low light of the trip. Not down to the food but the staff were often inattentive - perhaps we had a bad night. However there were no instances of feeling sick from any food or anything to indicate poor hygiene standards whatsoever. Was endlessly being cleaned to a high spec which truly impressed me.    The room (Garden view ground floor) had a very large and comfortable bed. Lots of wardrobe space and acceptable bathroom some areas of it could be smartened up a bit but certainly are more than an acceptable standard. I can see however that a pool view room would certainly be noisier due to the Speaker system and activities happening around that pool.    We kept to the adults/Zen pool where the bar was well stocked people friendly and staff ensured was peaceful and quiet.    Staff were exception here helpful and attentive without being pestering or annoying. They’ve a good attention to detail and seemed to have an excellent demeanour with everyone not just us.    Was very happily surprised by this hotel have even recommended to my mother as a single woman that she’d be more than happy here and would even come back myself if am ever looking to return to Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanmM3540WT

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Amanda S wrote a review Nov 2022,40,"Fabulous hotel , lovely holiday",I write this review sitting by the pool on our last full day !  I’m here with my husband- we left the kids at home for our first trip in 7 years child free - we wanted winter sun and a good quality all inclusive hotel and we definitely got both!  The weather for the end of November is amazing - cool in the morning and evening - 11-5 pm glorious and about 23-26 degrees.  My husband is a travel consultant and with his job we have travelled the world staying in many 4-5 and 5 star plus hotels  so it’s from that experience I write this review .  Firstly I have to address the review that said they waited 4 hours to get through customs- it took us 20 mins…. There is a form that needs to be completed - we got this online and filled in before we left  if you don’t have this it will cause a delay .  Tip- exchange money at the airport after customs but before luggage - the rate is good.  We arrived at the hotel in the evening  quick check in  up to room down for dinner.  The buffet is obviously very clean  the staff lovely  the food offering very good . A Moroccan station- all amazing spiced vegetables and meats .  There is a big salad bar  lots of bread  chips pasta and pizza and then a theme each eve mexican / sushi for example . All in all I found the food good enough ….. for the price we paid for the holiday - amazing.  The restaurant you get to go to once was also good - lovely fish starter  soup  incredibly tender beef tagine …. A nice change one eve from the buffet .  Lunch was a burger by the pool for us or freshly cooked fish cous cous and salad at the buffet. All to a good standard  We spent most our time but the adults pool - nice and quiet  bar near by - toilets pool side always very clean.  The drinks are good - I’d agree with another review the wine could be a bit better the cocktails too - mojitos were nice but others not so… but again- for the price point I was happy with the offering.  Managers cocktails on Monday night was really lovely - the champagne flowing  canopies- i have experienced this is many hotels and it always makes you feel special .  Hotel as a whole is very clean gardens immaculate staff happy .  There are a few points that have ment I haven’t given 5 stars….  It is a bit noisy at night - not guests  just the building  furniture moving  pipes  water - if you think this will bother you just bring some ear plugs!!  We had single beds - very comfy ! But single - not sure if this is in all rooms - but would have preferred a double .  The gym - very good - but dated but everything worked and the selection of weights is good - for me though ( could just be me ! ) I like to work out shower and then have breakfast.  The gym says open at 9- sometimes it was 9.20  breakfast ends at 10. So just my preference- I’d was the gym Open at 7/8 am.  All in all a good hotel  a lovely holiday  for what we paid an incredible resort - one that I would 100% return !!,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandasX758GI
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Alan Couser wrote a review Nov 2022,40,Great hotel but could improve a few small things.,"Have just returned yesterday from my third visit to the Iberostar Club Palmeraie and look forward to visiting again next March. The weather in early November and in March is excellent especially for us from a north of Europr.    Mostly what I have to say about the hotel is EXCELLENT. It is as clean as whistle; the staff are friendly and efficient; the gardens are lovely and very extensive; two pools are superb plus there's a dedicated kids pool. Food was buffet style and there were changes every day; the Moroccan food offering was excellent but most of the buffet was international and extensive.    I do have two down-sides but not enough to put me off returning.  1. The main dining room lacks character....badly. It is very brightly lit and is a bit ""canteen-ish"". It needs better  more pleasant lighting to give it a welcoming atmosphere. That said it is spotless and efficient.  2. The all-inclusive drinks were of very ""average "" quality especially the wines. We drank plenty of it but a slightly better quality would enhance the offering Some of the spirits on offer were also only good for cocktails. But if you're prepared to pay a few quid occasionally you can upgrade to regular brands. It would be nice to offer a few upgrade wine options which we would definitely have availed of.    Other than those small points this is an excellent hotel.",Date of stay: November 2022,,"Donaghadee, N. Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CruiseDreamer

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jo M wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Our second visit in 2022 and still highly recommended .We will be back soon!,This is the second time we have visited this hotel. We highly recommend it. From our greeting in reception from lovely Nabil who was still smiling despite being very busy at that time to the professionalism and efficiency of manager Mohammed this really wonderful hotel.  The food is amazing my husband eats like a king for the week and is then very miserable when he comes home to normal food! The staff clearing the tables are fantastic It genuinely feels like a restaurant which can be challenging catering for high numbers.    When I booked I did not have a choice of rooms. I emailed and we were changed to a garden view room as when we visited the first time we found that the double pool view room was too noisy for us (without young children) and the garden view rooms are peaceful. We visited in April 2022 and the main pool was much busier then. November is a great time to visit. Weather was gorgeous and we felt very relaxed at the end of our stay.    We attended cocktail evening by the pool which was lovely but not other entertainment just because we enjoy making the most of time together as we have such busy working lives. But from hearing the cheers it certainly sounded like guests were enjoying it. We would have struggled understanding as English as we only heard french and we can only speak the basics!    The only issue we had was that a bulb blew in our bathroom and was fixed approx 30 minutes after we reported it. Thank you SO much to all of your staff. We will be back for the third time!!!,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514joannam

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Joe M wrote a review Nov 2022,40,A relaxing stay and would return. Few improvements would help,Overall we had a great stay and would return again.    We were met by welcoming staff and shown to connecting rooms as requested. The adult only pool was extremely relaxing and comfortable with plenty of space to relax. Lots of entertainment and the archery instructor was sassy and fun while helping us. We liked him a lot!    Food was all fresh and tasty albeit sometimes a little cold. Bars were well stocked and there was an enthusiastic evening entertainment team.    While a little outside the city it was easy to travel when needed. However also offered an oasis of calm for a very relaxed trip. Cabs always outside.    Very cheap late checkout also available which was very welcome.    Few areas of improvement:  1) Doors to the room and connecting doors aren’t soundproof at all and so not quiet when walking past or hearing next door.  2) Wifi was great when it worked but a little patchy and not good by pools  3) bathrooms could do with upgrade as basic and felt unfinished. Soap etc stuck on which fell off  4) no tea etc facilities in room and no drinks to take back  5) it if off season but no hot snacks provided as would expect if you miss meals  6) Pool was a little chilly when advertised as heated.  7) meal times a little short given on holiday    As above while there’s room for improvement we had a great stay and would likely come again and have recommended to others.,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joemK8665FN
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Matt A wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Exceeded Expectations,The hotel is lovely. The grounds are so well maintained the pools and facilities are great. The drinks are perfect with lovely coffee G&Ts great cocktails (espresso martinis mojitos or even Abdou's specials).  There are even peacocks strolling around the grounds.    Food was brilliant with plenty of choice. There is a section for pizzas and pastas for people who want some home comforts. They do different specials each day ranging from savoury crepes to kebabs. There is also a BBQ outside which changed each day.    The staff are brilliant from the waiters and bar staff to the spa staff. Plus Hassan as a golf instructor and you can't praise the entertainment staff enough - Emma Lacoste Perris and Oumi. They do whatever they can to make your holiday extra special.  We had one event where I could not communicate with the driver as my French was not brilliant but the manager came out and translated our requirements.    Learning French and Arabic was fun but the staff are brilliant at speaking most languages including English.    The shuttle coach into the markets is really useful and runs most hours. Being round the markets and finding cafes and restaurants is a lovely experience and found all the people to be lovely.    Did the Fantasia 1001 trip which is like Vegas! It is surreal but brilliant!  Also did the Ourika Valley trip which was stunning and a great experience!    Other points:  - There was never an issue with getting a sun lounger.  - Evening entertainment was really good with a very talented dance troop  - You might notice the cats and kittens if you eat outside but the staff see if someone does not want them around and they beckon them away. But they were more entertaining than a nuisance  - Rooms are really clean and cleaned daily  - You get a large bottle of water in your room fridge and you can always get extra/replacement from the bar  - there are limited labels on the food but you can usually ask the chef what is in it  - IMHO don't bother getting a room upgrade I paid for a Double Garden View and I got a Twin room with a view of a tree not quite what I expected!    In summary I would definitely return to Marrakech and to the Iberostar Club Palmeraie.,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Fareham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StretchArmstrong

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sue S wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Great Stay,Just returned from Marrakech Hotel was great - I think the reviews are unfair - the hotel is an older hotel but our room an surrounding areas were always very clean. Pools were great - the Zen pool is very quiet but the main pool was lively but not too loud. Morocco's 2nd language is French and this is spoken mostly but most of the staff can speak English and are very helpful - Shout out to Lacoste who was great fun - all the activity staff work really hard.  The food is OK - much like most All Inclusive buffets - always something to choose from - my one complaint is that the food needs to be labelled better my son is allergic to nuts and we were unsure a) what we were eating and b) what contained nuts - this needs to improve.  We had a great week - weather was glorious - every day 29 degrees - we ventured into the Medina which was good fun and great for shopping - we also went into the Desert and quad biked and watched a show - which was excellent.,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueS1420

The hotel is the ideal place for this sort of holiday but also for a quiet break as a couple. The two heated pools one quiet and one with entertainment mainly for French people who like that sort of thing are excellent.  I cannot prise the staff enough Sara and Mohammed Ali in the lobby Rachida and Bouchra in the dinning room Samir at the pool and many more. All so kind and helpful. My son had an accident and needed hospital treatment and they were amazing.  The all inclusive is really all inclusive the food in the restaurant is superb the choice endless with grilled meats salads vegetables all of excellent quality and the desserts are scrumptious.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,OGW1066 wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Nice stay,Stayed here in October half term. Lovely clean hotel and excellent staff. We didn’t do our homework and unfortunately the hotel was packed with French and the hotel catered entirely for the French. The entertainment was not great and the hotels very remote not that there’s bars restaurants etc to go to it’s a very different holiday experience. The food was ok fresh but very boring.  If you are thinking about going to Morocco be prepared for a 2 to 3 hour wait to get through their customs and immigration control. Absolutely diabolical with border staff really not bothered and basically wasting everyone’s time watching you tube clips and having a laugh with the other staff. There’s also a hour to get through the customs on departure also!!

Hotel is spotless the grounds are absolutely immaculate rooms cleaned to a very high standard. Pool areas lovely and enjoyed the house wine and beer also the fizzy drinks were very good. I cannot complain for the price at all! It may be a bit out of the city centre but I found Palmeraie to be much more relaxing then the city we went to the YSL museum in a taxi for less then £25 return and the Souks near the main square for £30.

They are very friendly and not in your face. The food was very nice fresh tasty and varied everyday. The entertainment team are amazing. The grounds are immaculately clean and makes you want to walk round all the time. The facilities are great too and activities always going on at different times of the day.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mesney wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Such a great stay!,Very relaxing stay! We especially enjoyed dining outdoors under the olive trees in the evenings. The food is outstanding and there’s a huge choice. All the restaurant staff are particularly friendly and were happy to assist with our daughter's nut allergy. We thoroughly enjoyed our massage in the Spa. The adults-only Zen pool and bar is a haven of tranquility. The hotel is a set in several acres of gardens which are surprisingly green and attractive. Comfortable rooms with lovely garden views and the surprise flowers on the bed were a nice touch. The gym is much larger than we expected and very well equipped with new machines. The free bus into the city (30 mins) was really great.    Our favourite cocktails included San Franciscos and Mojitos and the beer and wine are pretty good too. .    Improvements? Not many: Please label the food at the buffet for the benefit of pescatarians vegetarians vegans and nut allergy sufferers.

The grounds are immaculate and the staff work herd every day to keep it this way. There some resident cats and kittens and they are very clean well looked after and friendly. Everyone loved them. The rooms were great. Spacious and clean. Housekeeping went in every day and sometimes left rose petal designs on the bed. Nice touch. The shower was always hot and had good pressure. There were a few mosquitos when we arrived but we asked reception if someone could spray the rooms which they did straight away. We only went to the aduts only pool but it was great. So relaxing and always plenty of beds. It has a little bar at the end where you can get all kinds of drinks. The buffet restaurant was fab. So much choice and always fresh. The wine in the hotel is really good. There was a lady called Rashida who was always there at lunchtime to greet us. After day one she knew our drink order and as we walked in our drinks had already been put on our table. Nothing was too much trouble. In fact every member of staff we came across were fantastic and friendly. Thank you to all of the staff for making us smile every day. We gave some of the staff a tip at the end as they truly deserve it. I wish I could have tipped them all.

After the ""luxury"" of our Ryanair flight we had a simple transfer and a lovely welcome to the hotel. Staff sat us down gave us a drink of fresh juice and our all inclusive bands. We were sent off to the restaurant so we could have lunch before it closed and returned to find ourselves all checked in.    Rooms - OK nothing spectacular but cleaned everyday to a high standard. Water pressure wasn't great!    Food - reasonable. We are something different most days. It's not the hottest but there is a microwave which we used. The foot truck burgers were great!    Pools - we only used the Zen pool. It was lovely and quiet. Cold going in but refreshing. Didn't need to put towels down unless you want a specific spot.    Medina - we went once. Easy to use the shuttle but we found it a bit overwhelming. My daughter was put off my the leering men and the monkeys on a lead.    Staff - the staff are amazing. Constantly cleaning and gardening everyone we passed we said hi to and they were all lovely despite some rude guests who treated them like slaves!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,siggouk wrote a review Oct 2022,10,"Didn’t even last 12 hours, hell on earth! Avoid unless you like cold food, flat drinks, hard beds, bricks as pillows.",To say this hotel was a disappointment is an understatement. We arrived last night having booked in good faith via BA Holidays after reading all the ‘wonderful’ reviews on trip advisor and simply cannot now understand how the hotel can attract so many five star reviews when it falls so short on every level.  To summarise:  In no way whatsoever is this place ‘4 Star’  Receptions smells of bleach  All other communal areas smell of smoke  Decor generally very old and tatty  No staff on hand outside to welcome you / help you with bags when you finally arrive (location is in the middle of nowhere)  Staff are only polite if you tip them our ‘bellboy’ insisted on bringing our bags up to the room in the very old lift and had obviously just been out for a cigarette as reeked of smoke. I had no cash to tip him as the hotel ATM is out of order (reading these reviews it sounds like that has been for some time) but that didn’t stop him lingering in our room then being very off hand with us when he realised we weren’t joking about having no money / I am on holiday with my teenage daughter and as two women travelling I felt quite uncomfortable - extremely unprofessional.  We also flagged the fact we had paid extra for an Atlas Mountain view - he literally laughed in our face and when we woke up this morning in the daylight I saw why / there are no mountains in sight - a total rip off.  Our room was extremely small and felt like a cell the mattresses are like boards and the pillows are solid lumps which are impossible to sleep with I literally slept for an hour before I woke up with neck ache. Not to mention the noise! Extremely noisy from the night club (!) outside bar and general corridor traffic until gone midnight.  Breakfast like dinner was cold despite the fact it is all food that should be warm. So many people have reported illness from the food in previous reviews which we began reading last night when we could not sleep. Added to this a cappuccino came out from the machine as a hot chocolate with powdered milk and juice is clearly powdered/concentrated not exactly 4 star food ideals.  By this point we could not wait to leave as we simply could not imagine a week of this despite having paid up front for the experience. We approached the hotel reception at 8am this morning to hand in our keys and ask for a refund of the city tax we had paid for the duration of our stay only a small amount but out of principle it felt like the right thing to do as I still had the card receipt from last night . The male receptionist who had started out with good English suddenly seemed not to understand me yet took my credit card and began to take copies of it on the photocopier - I demanded my card back and grabbed the copies out of his hand this is illegal and could result in my card being cloned - and all this from an international hotel group which clearly delivers good service in our locations.  I will be fascinated to hear what the ‘Guest Relations’ response is to this review - I have already complained directly to BA Holidays and will be seeking some kind of compensation for the day of hell I have had trying to find us another suitable hotel at short notice.  Just read the bad reviews as well as the good before booking this hotel you will be shocked at what you read but having been there I can now say I can see how it could all be true! I would also like to point out that I am not a serial complainer and do not delight in moaning but this place needs a wake up call!  The final memory was of us walking out onto the main road with our bags past another family doing the same and they seemed visibly upset - they were not English so I couldn’t check the exact situation but sometimes words aren’t required! Hoping they found somewhere to stay too - never ever again will we risk an Iberostar experience.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siggouk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Gary-Jodie wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Great Holiday,We arrived on 07.05.2022 for a 14 day holiday. After a short taxi transfer from the airport we were the only people checking in. Although check-in wasn’t until 15.00 they managed to get our room ready by 13.00.  We were given our room number and set off to find it. Our luggage arrived shortly after.  The room was a good size with a bathroom and a very small balcony with a table and chairs overlooking the gardens. The beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning coped very well with temperatures hitting 40 degrees. The cleaner did a fantastic job all through our stay and even left towels and toilet rolls outside the room if we were having a break from the sun. There was plenty of wardrobe space to hang all of our clothes which can normally be a problem. The only thing missing from the room was coffee making facilities but after reading previous reviews I had taken my own. There is a TV and fridge in the room. Bottles of water are available from the bar to take to the room. We had some problems with the safe not working during our first week but this was resolved with a new battery.  The food is good quality with a good selection but it was very hit or miss if the hot food was hot. The salad selection was very impressive as was the deserts. We ate in the Moroccan restaurant once and really enjoyed the food and the restaurant is very well decorated.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hinckley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gary-Jodie

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Julia J wrote a review Oct 2022,50,Hassan will be watching,"To be honest we picked this hotel because it was in the Iberostar group and we've had many happy holidays in Cuba and Crete so we knew what to expect with the quality of food and accommodation generally.    The icing on the cake was the daily Golf lesson with Hassan - all part of the Animation programme. This was excellent. We had one to one attention and it certainly has made us think more about our game. We are both fairly new to the game but have tried to keep up a weekly 9 hole practice. When we attempt a shot we say ""Hassan will be watching"" or ""Hassan will be proud"" when it goes well.    Only slight criticism is the lack of labelling of food or a general menu which could be put on the entrances to the restaurant. This would be particularly useful around the show cooking.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Surreygirl wrote a review Oct 2022,20,Great place for weight loss!,Where to start with this one…. Check in was simple and staff were helpful informed me my poolside room would be ready in one hour gave me the wrist bands to get food/drink use facilities etc and all seemed great. Poolside seemed fun and the animation team were friendly and helpful the trapeze is brilliant and my daughter loved it instantly nice addition. The gardens are very well kept and everything on the outside of the building is great. Except the food truck the quality of food I couldn’t comment on as after watching the flies crawl over it all I decided to swerve it. Drinks were poor but there are other better bars so no big deal. First impressions were excellant. From there it all went downhill….. pool side room was a nightmare if I strained my neck and squinted my eyes I could just about see one corner it was clearer at night as water was lit up to assist with location tracking. The noise however was off the scale and I certainly didn’t need to strain to hear it. We were unfortunately situated over the restaurant/evening bar area. I had tried for days before to check in online and pick my room no luck at all and now I was in a living hell. Music screaming shouting some sort of music quiz all of which ment no relaxing holiday 7.45 am on the Sunday morning it started so much for a lie in! Asked to change rooms very abruptly told no. I’m sure if you get a room overlooking the zen pool things would be different or better still don’t bother with the extra cost of a pool room. The room itself appeared clean and of a good size how wrong the room was actually filthy just look in the corners….. two towels for three people no coffee or tea making facilities beds however are very comfortable shame the noise until late and night and early in the morning stops you from enjoying them. Food the buffet seemed okish picked this hotel as daughter is a coeliac and gluten free available in fact they make a big thing of it on check in including signing a disclaimer. There were indeed gluten free options and a specific area at breakfast. The buffet was simple food of average quality exactly what you would expect I guess. Drinks in all bars are not very good cocktails are ready made syrup based drinks which are pretty poor local beer is poor but the wine is drinkable…. Just. We then made the mistake of booking the Moroccan restaurant for the second night big mistake…. There ended my holiday as myself and my daughter both opted for the chicken tangine. I cannot describe how Ill we both were first time I have ever experienced this whilst travelling and we travel a lot to many many places. Husband had the beef and was fine. This was after having to intervene twice to stop my daughter being given the soup/bread and various other items which clearly contained gluten - big sign on our table booking stating gluten free I assume they can’t read. Of the four dishes given only one was gluten free and that was the chicken tangine. Top tip drink wine eat beef and def avoid the pool view rooms. If you are looking to lose weight however eat the chicken 🤣🤣🤣. On a serious note last two days of our short four day stay we’re spent in bed in pain desperate for sleep which was never going to happen as bloody Celin Dion was determined by night to keep us awake and early mornings were covered off by the local drum bashing whistle blowing equivalent of Chas and Dave. Don’t even get me started on the nighttime entertainment…. Hi -Di- Hi has never looked more like a well choreographed West End show before.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,TC1810 wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Good service,The hotel staff were friendly but the buffet food was luke warm would wait for more food to be freshly cooked and the Moroccan restaurant was not worth it. One waiter who did not speak english and was not traditional food. There were a lot of french staying there that smoked (a lot) even whilst we were eating. Not pleasant and the compare spoke mostly in french.    We had a nice relaxing time around the Zen pool but a five days was enough. The rooms were clean but fairly basic (not enough hangers),Date of stay: October 2022,,"Hartley Wintney, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TC1810

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Nicky S wrote a review Oct 2022,30,50/50,This is a really mixed review. I don’t think this hotel is worth the money. The food was terrible and I ended up with campylobacter and have been sick for 2 weeks! The activities are amazing though  I loved the Archery Trapeze and spin. The entertainment team are mostly really nice especially Abdo Morad Achraf and Hocine and they really want you to have a good time. The waiters are also lovely. They had a good couple of entertainment evenings and the white party was the best..Morad in the fire show was amazing. The director of the hotel was very welcoming but the reception staff were just rude. The room was nice and very big but not the cleanest. If I could just go back for the activities pool and people I would but not worth the food poisoning!!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266nickys

Lots of activities to keep you busy.    The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best.    Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas.

Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this?    We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner nicer and more authentic then this place.    From the start this place was a let down:    The reception staff on check in ran quickly through the paperwork and didn't explain anything about what's included and not they didn't explain where anything was or even how to get us to the room we walked around for 20mins before we realised we were on the opposite side of the resort we were meant to be. We didn't realise there was a zen pool and it had the bar next to it where the other big main pool the cocktail bar was inside. We didn't know that they stop serving hot dogs at 3.30pm so when we went to get one at 5pm we were rudely told they can't do them instead of explaining I'm really sorry we stop making them at 3.30pm.    The golf desk wasn't open at 10am and when we asked reception what time they would open they just said come back tomorrow which is when we wanted to golf you usually need to book your golf tee time ahead of time not on the day we then asked the lady at the guest service desk and she called the golf tour desk man straight away and he came and made a booking at a great course for us they even had new golf clubs to hire. These are the only two people at the resort that were friendly and helpful.    You have to pay 100 dirham for pool towel hire. We didn't have any dirham and the ATM at hotel was down we had Australian cash although they didn't accept Australian so said we couldn't hire any towels we asked to pay with card and they refused so we couldn't get any towels.    Activities like archery mini golf ect is only opened 2hrs a day. Once again we wernt told this until we went to play it and found out we missed it for the day.    Then at the bar my husband ordered a beer which wasn't included in the all inclusive price but we didn't know there was some that were and some that wernt included as it was never explained. Beers also wernt very cold.    The room was old & outdated and wasnt overly clean with mould in the grout a cracked dirty mirror hair on the floor ect. Although I would say the grounds were clean.    The food was terrible it was luke warm & bland I didn't enjoy one thing I eat from the 3 meals over the 3 days & nothing had any signs to say what it was not great if you have allergies or are vegetarian.    The second resturant is morrocan which you only have the option of one tagine from which you need to preorder and book and your only allowed it once during your stay other times you have to eat from buffet.    The spa is super expensive but the staff in there was actually excellent.    It's 20mins from the main part of marrakech in the middle of nowhere so you don't even know your in morroco.    Most guest are French and rude and majority of them smoke so sitting by the pool with people smoking on both sides of you is extremely difficult to breath. The staff also serve French guests or other staff members before English speaking guests.    WiFi worked ok.    The enertainment was entertaining.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151Brodiew

Good sized clean and comfortable rooms although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management bar staff reception and cleaners everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we soon found the quieter side of the main pool after the first day - we did a bit of aqua fit to make up for all the food😂 my son loved the foam party & the white cocktail party had great entertainment - there’s more available if you want it and it’s announced in French and English. No problem with sunbeds there’s more than enough available no matter what time of day. Lots of dips in the pool and shade from the trees & parasols help you cope with the heat!!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kelvin wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Just do it and go and enjoy the experience of this hotel and Marrakech,Having reviewed many of the reviews of the hotel and Marrakech prior to going I was a little unsure of what to expect. Don't read any of them expect this one and the positive ones.  Having spent a week at the Iberostar I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Arrived earlier than the check in time due to the time of the flight welcomed with a drink and an expected time of when the room would be ready (1 hour). Able to use all the facilities and start the holiday straight away whilst we waited for the room.  In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food don’t worry about them if you can’t find something from the plethora of choices available from breakfast all the way through to the evening meal then I’m not sure any restaurant would be able to cater for your needs.  The thing that made this a great experience was the staff from the activity staff encouraging all to take part in the numerous activities available and not hassling you if you wanted a chill day. To the reception bar food and cleaners etc all were great. The top three that made it great was  3. Gentleman on reception (Apologies but forgot his name) – When we realised that my partner had forgot to take some prescription medication we spoke to the gentleman on reception and it was sorted within 24 hours. Took a lot of stress out of worrying about it and when we thanked him the response was “it’s a pleasure”. Great communication throughout.  2. Halima – The first person at the bar that introduced herself always smiling happy and happy to help with anything. Never forgot our name the whole time we were there making it comfortable and chilled.  1. And lastly the highlight of staff was Ismail. - What a credit to the hotel this person never stopped always offering to bring drinks etc always taking way glasses and plates etc. Also made conversation about different things will all from football to advice on the medina etc with us and 2 teenage boys. Though he was great and made a massive difference the experience we had all very positive.  On the medina go and explore it day and night both very different experiences and both very good. There are people that will hassle you but not in a threatening way no different to going to any other popular holiday destination and being hassled to go into bars or restaurants keep walking and don’t engage if you’re not interested and you will be fine. The hotel has a free shuttle bus but we went with a tour on the day trip which included pick up and drop off. And because we wanted to go to the media for sunset and sit in a rooftop café we got a taxi (Taxi rank opposite the hotel) for about £15 each way. Be prepared you may be taken a different way to see some different areas and close your eyes on the way back as they don’t hang about and how they get through certain gaps I do not know but a great experience all the same.  We are looking forward to going back due to the experience we have just had.    Hope this helps,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khefuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eirinn B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing holiday,This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms and without any fuss or hassle we were upgraded.  The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners the ground keepers the food truck staff the entertainment team the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them!  The gardens pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day.  The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters. Plenty of food to choose from hot and cold. Lots of new cuisine to try but also has foods such as pizza chips etc for fussy eaters. Lovely outdoor seating area as well.  There is entertainment each night which is great as the hotel is a fair journey from the nearest town. Through the day there is so much going on at the main pool - aqua aerobics water polo foam parties dancing and music. If this isn't your vibe then there is also the quiet pool. The food truck next to the main pool offers hot and cold drinks and snacks such as hotdogs burgers waffles crepes etc throughout the day.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the souks in Marrakesh. This service is great. The bus arrived on time and dropped you at the same place you'd then be picked back up from. The drop off place is a 10 minute walk from the souks.  There is a rep/tour organiser who sits in the hotel reception. He booked us onto a camel ride (only £20!) which included a half hour camel ride and mint tea and biscuits on our return. This was a highlight and the tour guides were excellent.  I really couldn't pick out any faults from my stay at Iberostar. It has been such a great holiday and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!  Well done to the staff who really do make it 10/10 you are all stars!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Arturcor79 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Found a second place in this Resort,what a wonder of space we found here. I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people was immediately and before anything else they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome they make us feel really special and very well treated from Zacharias at the reception to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys in general like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent with comfortable rooms always with AC. working perfectly because of the heat that is too much and they are very quick to solve any problems that arise. On the last night they are careful and friendly to make a special cocktail for those who leave the next day. For all this and for everything I don't remember to write now I give it 5 stars with the intention of giving 6... I RECOMMEND and stay here if you go to Marrakech you won't regret it... it's worth staying 20 min away from the center of Marrakech...

We arrived long before we could check in tired from the trip and without eating. Without asking for anything we were immediately told that we would have breakfast while the rooms were prepared. We realized right there that the stage was going to go well!  Super clean and well maintained hotel.  The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good.  Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools one more confusing and always partying one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos! the best mojitos are made at the Zen pool bar!!!  The nightly entertainment is quite good and there is already some production involved. We love it! But also because it's the people who make the places and the staff here was the best I've ever encountered during so many trips.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Filipesequeira

And because we wanted to go to the media for sunset and sit in a rooftop café we got a taxi (Taxi rank opposite the hotel) for about £15 each way. Be prepared you may be taken a different way to see some different areas and close your eyes on the way back as they don’t hang about and how they get through certain gaps I do not know but a great experience all the same.  We are looking forward to going back due to the experience we have just had.    Hope this helps,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khefuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eirinn B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing holiday,This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms and without any fuss or hassle we were upgraded.  The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners the ground keepers the food truck staff the entertainment team the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them!  The gardens pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day.  The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters. Plenty of food to choose from hot and cold. Lots of new cuisine to try but also has foods such as pizza chips etc for fussy eaters. Lovely outdoor seating area as well.  There is entertainment each night which is great as the hotel is a fair journey from the nearest town. Through the day there is so much going on at the main pool - aqua aerobics water polo foam parties dancing and music. If this isn't your vibe then there is also the quiet pool. The food truck next to the main pool offers hot and cold drinks and snacks such as hotdogs burgers waffles crepes etc throughout the day.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the souks in Marrakesh. This service is great. The bus arrived on time and dropped you at the same place you'd then be picked back up from. The drop off place is a 10 minute walk from the souks.  There is a rep/tour organiser who sits in the hotel reception. He booked us onto a camel ride (only £20!) which included a half hour camel ride and mint tea and biscuits on our return. This was a highlight and the tour guides were excellent.  I really couldn't pick out any faults from my stay at Iberostar. It has been such a great holiday and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!  Well done to the staff who really do make it 10/10 you are all stars!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Arturcor79 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Found a second place in this Resort,what a wonder of space we found here. I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people was immediately and before anything else they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome they make us feel really special and very well treated from Zacharias at the reception to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys in general like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent with comfortable rooms always with AC. working perfectly because of the heat that is too much and they are very quick to solve any problems that arise. On the last night they are careful and friendly to make a special cocktail for those who leave the next day. For all this and for everything I don't remember to write now I give it 5 stars with the intention of giving 6... I RECOMMEND and stay here if you go to Marrakech you won't regret it... it's worth staying 20 min away from the center of Marrakech... We will be back!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arturcor79
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Filipesequeira wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic Staff,Of the many resorts I've been to this was without a doubt where I felt the best! the staff is absolutely fantastic (thanks Achraf and company) . We arrived long before we could check in tired from the trip and without eating. Without asking for anything we were immediately told that we would have breakfast while the rooms were prepared. We realized right there that the stage was going to go well!  Super clean and well maintained hotel.  The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good.  Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools one more confusing and always partying one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos! the best mojitos are made at the Zen pool bar!!!  The nightly entertainment is quite good and there is already some production involved. We love it! But also because it's the people who make the places and the staff here was the best I've ever encountered during so many trips.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Filipesequeira
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Austin O wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Great for a short 3-4 stay to relax,The hotel facilities and staff where were very friendly and helpful but tipping and thanking definitely helped better service. Lots of activities to keep you busy.    The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best.    Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas.    The bar selection is good and the drinks are nice but all bars close at 12am with no option of a late drink as town is 25 minutes in a taxi,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kilcock, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozzieaustin01

Staff were so happy to help those who needed it and I saw them rushing to help anyone who wanted anything. We were very pleased with the attention given by the general manager who was always out and about making sure everything was up to standard.  Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall.  Waiter service was excellent for drinks etc and once our order was ‘known’ we were often brought drinks by regular waiters from different stations (6 beers for 2  of us!)

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this?    We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner nicer and more authentic then this place.    From the start this place was a let down:    The reception staff on check in ran quickly through the paperwork and didn't explain anything about what's included and not they didn't explain where anything was or even how to get us to the room we walked around for 20mins before we realised we were on the opposite side of the resort we were meant to be. We didn't realise there was a zen pool and it had the bar next to it where the other big main pool the cocktail bar was inside. We didn't know that they stop serving hot dogs at 3.30pm so when we went to get one at 5pm we were rudely told they can't do them instead of explaining I'm really sorry we stop making them at 3.30pm.    The golf desk wasn't open at 10am and when we asked reception what time they would open they just said come back tomorrow which is when we wanted to golf you usually need to book your golf tee time ahead of time not on the day we then asked the lady at the guest service desk and she called the golf tour desk man straight away and he came and made a booking at a great course for us they even had new golf clubs to hire. These are the only two people at the resort that were friendly and helpful.    You have to pay 100 dirham for pool towel hire. We didn't have any dirham and the ATM at hotel was down we had Australian cash although they didn't accept Australian so said we couldn't hire any towels we asked to pay with card and they refused so we couldn't get any towels.    Activities like archery mini golf ect is only opened 2hrs a day. Once again we wernt told this until we went to play it and found out we missed it for the day.    Then at the bar my husband ordered a beer which wasn't included in the all inclusive price but we didn't know there was some that were and some that wernt included as it was never explained. Beers also wernt very cold.    The room was old & outdated and wasnt overly clean with mould in the grout a cracked dirty mirror hair on the floor ect. Although I would say the grounds were clean.    The food was terrible it was luke warm & bland I didn't enjoy one thing I eat from the 3 meals over the 3 days & nothing had any signs to say what it was not great if you have allergies or are vegetarian.    The second resturant is morrocan which you only have the option of one tagine from which you need to preorder and book and your only allowed it once during your stay other times you have to eat from buffet.    The spa is super expensive but the staff in there was actually excellent.    It's 20mins from the main part of marrakech in the middle of nowhere so you don't even know your in morroco.    Most guest are French and rude and majority of them smoke so sitting by the pool with people smoking on both sides of you is extremely difficult to breath. The staff also serve French guests or other staff members before English speaking guests.    WiFi worked ok.    The enertainment was entertaining.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151Brodiew

The room was spacious comfy good AC tv with a range of channels and a nice bathroom. Whilst relatively small the balcony offered a nice view into the gardens and the sunset could be seen behind the buildings. 3 good pools with plenty of beds no early rush and plenty of options. Food was a good standard but repetitive although they did offer theme nights which was nice.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Amanda P wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic holiday,I was convinced by previous reviews stating great staff and lovely food when booking and wasn’t disappointed! Good sized clean and comfortable rooms although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management bar staff reception and cleaners everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we soon found the quieter side of the main pool after the first day - we did a bit of aqua fit to make up for all the food😂 my son loved the foam party & the white cocktail party had great entertainment - there’s more available if you want it and it’s announced in French and English. No problem with sunbeds there’s more than enough available no matter what time of day. Lots of dips in the pool and shade from the trees & parasols help you cope with the heat!!!! Very enjoyable holiday…. shame we are home & back to the cold & cooking our own food - oh and normal pub measures for drinks!!!!😂😂,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandapC2229QD

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kelvin wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Just do it and go and enjoy the experience of this hotel and Marrakech,Having reviewed many of the reviews of the hotel and Marrakech prior to going I was a little unsure of what to expect. Don't read any of them expect this one and the positive ones.  Having spent a week at the Iberostar I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Arrived earlier than the check in time due to the time of the flight welcomed with a drink and an expected time of when the room would be ready (1 hour). Able to use all the facilities and start the holiday straight away whilst we waited for the room.  In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food don’t worry about them if you can’t find something from the plethora of choices available from breakfast all the way through to the evening meal then I’m not sure any restaurant would be able to cater for your needs.  The thing that made this a great experience was the staff from the activity staff encouraging all to take part in the numerous activities available and not hassling you if you wanted a chill day. To the reception bar food and cleaners etc all were great. The top three that made it great was  3. Gentleman on reception (Apologies but forgot his name) – When we realised that my partner had forgot to take some prescription medication we spoke to the gentleman on reception and it was sorted within 24 hours. Took a lot of stress out of worrying about it and when we thanked him the response was “it’s a pleasure”. Great communication throughout.  2. Halima – The first person at the bar that introduced herself always smiling happy and happy to help with anything. Never forgot our name the whole time we were there making it comfortable and chilled.  1. And lastly the highlight of staff was Ismail. - What a credit to the hotel this person never stopped always offering to bring drinks etc always taking way glasses and plates etc. Also made conversation about different things will all from football to advice on the medina etc with us and 2 teenage boys. Though he was great and made a massive difference the experience we had all very positive.  On the medina go and explore it day and night both very different experiences and both very good. There are people that will hassle you but not in a threatening way no different to going to any other popular holiday destination and being hassled to go into bars or restaurants keep walking and don’t engage if you’re not interested and you will be fine. The hotel has a free shuttle bus but we went with a tour on the day trip which included pick up and drop off.

Though he was great and made a massive difference the experience we had all very positive.  On the medina go and explore it day and night both very different experiences and both very good. There are people that will hassle you but not in a threatening way no different to going to any other popular holiday destination and being hassled to go into bars or restaurants keep walking and don’t engage if you’re not interested and you will be fine. The hotel has a free shuttle bus but we went with a tour on the day trip which included pick up and drop off. And because we wanted to go to the media for sunset and sit in a rooftop café we got a taxi (Taxi rank opposite the hotel) for about £15 each way. Be prepared you may be taken a different way to see some different areas and close your eyes on the way back as they don’t hang about and how they get through certain gaps I do not know but a great experience all the same.  We are looking forward to going back due to the experience we have just had.    Hope this helps,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khefuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eirinn B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing holiday,This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms and without any fuss or hassle we were upgraded.  The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners the ground keepers the food truck staff the entertainment team the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them!  The gardens pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day.  The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters. Plenty of food to choose from hot and cold. Lots of new cuisine to try but also has foods such as pizza chips etc for fussy eaters. Lovely outdoor seating area as well.  There is entertainment each night which is great as the hotel is a fair journey from the nearest town. Through the day there is so much going on at the main pool - aqua aerobics water polo foam parties dancing and music. If this isn't your vibe then there is also the quiet pool. The food truck next to the main pool offers hot and cold drinks and snacks such as hotdogs burgers waffles crepes etc throughout the day.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the souks in Marrakesh. This service is great. The bus arrived on time and dropped you at the same place you'd then be picked back up from. The drop off place is a 10 minute walk from the souks.  There is a rep/tour organiser who sits in the hotel reception. He booked us onto a camel ride (only £20!) which included a half hour camel ride and mint tea and biscuits on our return. This was a highlight and the tour guides were excellent.  I really couldn't pick out any faults from my stay at Iberostar. It has been such a great holiday and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!  Well done to the staff who really do make it 10/10 you are all stars!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Arturcor79 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Found a second place in this Resort,what a wonder of space we found here. I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people was immediately and before anything else they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome they make us feel really special and very well treated from Zacharias at the reception to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys in general like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent with comfortable rooms always with AC. working perfectly because of the heat that is too much and they are very quick to solve any problems that arise. On the last night they are careful and friendly to make a special cocktail for those who leave the next day. For all this and for everything I don't remember to write now I give it 5 stars with the intention of giving 6... I RECOMMEND and stay here if you go to Marrakech you won't regret it... it's worth staying 20 min away from the center of Marrakech... We will be back!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arturcor79

We arrived long before we could check in tired from the trip and without eating. Without asking for anything we were immediately told that we would have breakfast while the rooms were prepared. We realized right there that the stage was going to go well!  Super clean and well maintained hotel.  The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good.  Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools one more confusing and always partying one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos! the best mojitos are made at the Zen pool bar!!!  The nightly entertainment is quite good and there is already some production involved. We love it! But also because it's the people who make the places and the staff here was the best I've ever encountered during so many trips.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Filipesequeira
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Austin O wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Great for a short 3-4 stay to relax,The hotel facilities and staff where were very friendly and helpful but tipping and thanking definitely helped better service. Lots of activities to keep you busy.    The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best.    Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas.    The bar selection is good and the drinks are nice but all bars close at 12am with no option of a late drink as town is 25 minutes in a taxi,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kilcock, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozzieaustin01

Staff were so happy to help those who needed it and I saw them rushing to help anyone who wanted anything. We were very pleased with the attention given by the general manager who was always out and about making sure everything was up to standard.  Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall.  Waiter service was excellent for drinks etc and once our order was ‘known’ we were often brought drinks by regular waiters from different stations (6 beers for 2  of us!)

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this?    We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner nicer and more authentic then this place.    From the start this place was a let down:    The reception staff on check in ran quickly through the paperwork and didn't explain anything about what's included and not they didn't explain where anything was or even how to get us to the room we walked around for 20mins before we realised we were on the opposite side of the resort we were meant to be. We didn't realise there was a zen pool and it had the bar next to it where the other big main pool the cocktail bar was inside. We didn't know that they stop serving hot dogs at 3.30pm so when we went to get one at 5pm we were rudely told they can't do them instead of explaining I'm really sorry we stop making them at 3.30pm.    The golf desk wasn't open at 10am and when we asked reception what time they would open they just said come back tomorrow which is when we wanted to golf you usually need to book your golf tee time ahead of time not on the day we then asked the lady at the guest service desk and she called the golf tour desk man straight away and he came and made a booking at a great course for us they even had new golf clubs to hire. These are the only two people at the resort that were friendly and helpful.    You have to pay 100 dirham for pool towel hire. We didn't have any dirham and the ATM at hotel was down we had Australian cash although they didn't accept Australian so said we couldn't hire any towels we asked to pay with card and they refused so we couldn't get any towels.    Activities like archery mini golf ect is only opened 2hrs a day. Once again we wernt told this until we went to play it and found out we missed it for the day.    Then at the bar my husband ordered a beer which wasn't included in the all inclusive price but we didn't know there was some that were and some that wernt included as it was never explained. Beers also wernt very cold.    The room was old & outdated and wasnt overly clean with mould in the grout a cracked dirty mirror hair on the floor ect. Although I would say the grounds were clean.    The food was terrible it was luke warm & bland I didn't enjoy one thing I eat from the 3 meals over the 3 days & nothing had any signs to say what it was not great if you have allergies or are vegetarian.    The second resturant is morrocan which you only have the option of one tagine from which you need to preorder and book and your only allowed it once during your stay other times you have to eat from buffet.    The spa is super expensive but the staff in there was actually excellent.    It's 20mins from the main part of marrakech in the middle of nowhere so you don't even know your in morroco.    Most guest are French and rude and majority of them smoke so sitting by the pool with people smoking on both sides of you is extremely difficult to breath. The staff also serve French guests or other staff members before English speaking guests.    WiFi worked ok.    The enertainment was entertaining.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151Brodiew

The room was spacious comfy good AC tv with a range of channels and a nice bathroom. Whilst relatively small the balcony offered a nice view into the gardens and the sunset could be seen behind the buildings. 3 good pools with plenty of beds no early rush and plenty of options.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Amanda P wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic holiday,I was convinced by previous reviews stating great staff and lovely food when booking and wasn’t disappointed! Good sized clean and comfortable rooms although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management bar staff reception and cleaners everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we soon found the quieter side of the main pool after the first day - we did a bit of aqua fit to make up for all the food😂 my son loved the foam party & the white cocktail party had great entertainment - there’s more available if you want it and it’s announced in French and English. No problem with sunbeds there’s more than enough available no matter what time of day. Lots of dips in the pool and shade from the trees & parasols help you cope with the heat!!!! Very enjoyable holiday…. shame we are home & back to the cold & cooking our own food - oh and normal pub measures for drinks!!!!😂😂,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandapC2229QD

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kelvin wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Just do it and go and enjoy the experience of this hotel and Marrakech,Having reviewed many of the reviews of the hotel and Marrakech prior to going I was a little unsure of what to expect. Don't read any of them expect this one and the positive ones.  Having spent a week at the Iberostar I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Arrived earlier than the check in time due to the time of the flight welcomed with a drink and an expected time of when the room would be ready (1 hour). Able to use all the facilities and start the holiday straight away whilst we waited for the room.  In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food don’t worry about them if you can’t find something from the plethora of choices available from breakfast all the way through to the evening meal then I’m not sure any restaurant would be able to cater for your needs.  The thing that made this a great experience was the staff from the activity staff encouraging all to take part in the numerous activities available and not hassling you if you wanted a chill day. To the reception bar food and cleaners etc all were great. The top three that made it great was  3. Gentleman on reception (Apologies but forgot his name) – When we realised that my partner had forgot to take some prescription medication we spoke to the gentleman on reception and it was sorted within 24 hours. Took a lot of stress out of worrying about it and when we thanked him the response was “it’s a pleasure”. Great communication throughout.  2. Halima – The first person at the bar that introduced herself always smiling happy and happy to help with anything. Never forgot our name the whole time we were there making it comfortable and chilled.  1.

Halima – The first person at the bar that introduced herself always smiling happy and happy to help with anything. Never forgot our name the whole time we were there making it comfortable and chilled.  1. And lastly the highlight of staff was Ismail. - What a credit to the hotel this person never stopped always offering to bring drinks etc always taking way glasses and plates etc. Also made conversation about different things will all from football to advice on the medina etc with us and 2 teenage boys. Though he was great and made a massive difference the experience we had all very positive.  On the medina go and explore it day and night both very different experiences and both very good. There are people that will hassle you but not in a threatening way no different to going to any other popular holiday destination and being hassled to go into bars or restaurants keep walking and don’t engage if you’re not interested and you will be fine. The hotel has a free shuttle bus but we went with a tour on the day trip which included pick up and drop off. And because we wanted to go to the media for sunset and sit in a rooftop café we got a taxi (Taxi rank opposite the hotel) for about £15 each way. Be prepared you may be taken a different way to see some different areas and close your eyes on the way back as they don’t hang about and how they get through certain gaps I do not know but a great experience all the same.  We are looking forward to going back due to the experience we have just had.    Hope this helps,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khefuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eirinn B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing holiday,This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms and without any fuss or hassle we were upgraded.  The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners the ground keepers the food truck staff the entertainment team the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them!  The gardens pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day.  The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters. Plenty of food to choose from hot and cold. Lots of new cuisine to try but also has foods such as pizza chips etc for fussy eaters. Lovely outdoor seating area as well.  There is entertainment each night which is great as the hotel is a fair journey from the nearest town. Through the day there is so much going on at the main pool - aqua aerobics water polo foam parties dancing and music. If this isn't your vibe then there is also the quiet pool. The food truck next to the main pool offers hot and cold drinks and snacks such as hotdogs burgers waffles crepes etc throughout the day.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the souks in Marrakesh. This service is great. The bus arrived on time and dropped you at the same place you'd then be picked back up from. The drop off place is a 10 minute walk from the souks.  There is a rep/tour organiser who sits in the hotel reception. He booked us onto a camel ride (only £20!) which included a half hour camel ride and mint tea and biscuits on our return. This was a highlight and the tour guides were excellent.  I really couldn't pick out any faults from my stay at Iberostar. It has been such a great holiday and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!  Well done to the staff who really do make it 10/10 you are all stars!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Arturcor79 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Found a second place in this Resort,what a wonder of space we found here. I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people was immediately and before anything else they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome they make us feel really special and very well treated from Zacharias at the reception to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys in general like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent with comfortable rooms always with AC. working perfectly because of the heat that is too much and they are very quick to solve any problems that arise. On the last night they are careful and friendly to make a special cocktail for those who leave the next day. For all this and for everything I don't remember to write now I give it 5 stars with the intention of giving 6... I RECOMMEND and stay here if you go to Marrakech you won't regret it... it's worth staying 20 min away from the center of Marrakech... We will be back!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arturcor79

We arrived long before we could check in tired from the trip and without eating. Without asking for anything we were immediately told that we would have breakfast while the rooms were prepared. We realized right there that the stage was going to go well!  Super clean and well maintained hotel.  The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good.  Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools one more confusing and always partying one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos! the best mojitos are made at the Zen pool bar!!!  The nightly entertainment is quite good and there is already some production involved. We love it! But also because it's the people who make the places and the staff here was the best I've ever encountered during so many trips.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Filipesequeira

Lots of activities to keep you busy.    The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best.    Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas.    The bar selection is good and the drinks are nice but all bars close at 12am with no option of a late drink as town is 25 minutes in a taxi,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kilcock, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozzieaustin01

We were very pleased with the attention given by the general manager who was always out and about making sure everything was up to standard.  Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall.  Waiter service was excellent for drinks etc and once our order was ‘known’ we were often brought drinks by regular waiters from different stations (6 beers for 2  of us!)

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this?    We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner nicer and more authentic then this place.    From the start this place was a let down:    The reception staff on check in ran quickly through the paperwork and didn't explain anything about what's included and not they didn't explain where anything was or even how to get us to the room we walked around for 20mins before we realised we were on the opposite side of the resort we were meant to be. We didn't realise there was a zen pool and it had the bar next to it where the other big main pool the cocktail bar was inside. We didn't know that they stop serving hot dogs at 3.30pm so when we went to get one at 5pm we were rudely told they can't do them instead of explaining I'm really sorry we stop making them at 3.30pm.    The golf desk wasn't open at 10am and when we asked reception what time they would open they just said come back tomorrow which is when we wanted to golf you usually need to book your golf tee time ahead of time not on the day we then asked the lady at the guest service desk and she called the golf tour desk man straight away and he came and made a booking at a great course for us they even had new golf clubs to hire. These are the only two people at the resort that were friendly and helpful.    You have to pay 100 dirham for pool towel hire. We didn't have any dirham and the ATM at hotel was down we had Australian cash although they didn't accept Australian so said we couldn't hire any towels we asked to pay with card and they refused so we couldn't get any towels.    Activities like archery mini golf ect is only opened 2hrs a day. Once again we wernt told this until we went to play it and found out we missed it for the day.    Then at the bar my husband ordered a beer which wasn't included in the all inclusive price but we didn't know there was some that were and some that wernt included as it was never explained. Beers also wernt very cold.    The room was old & outdated and wasnt overly clean with mould in the grout a cracked dirty mirror hair on the floor ect. Although I would say the grounds were clean.    The food was terrible it was luke warm & bland I didn't enjoy one thing I eat from the 3 meals over the 3 days & nothing had any signs to say what it was not great if you have allergies or are vegetarian.    The second resturant is morrocan which you only have the option of one tagine from which you need to preorder and book and your only allowed it once during your stay other times you have to eat from buffet.    The spa is super expensive but the staff in there was actually excellent.    It's 20mins from the main part of marrakech in the middle of nowhere so you don't even know your in morroco.    Most guest are French and rude and majority of them smoke so sitting by the pool with people smoking on both sides of you is extremely difficult to breath. The staff also serve French guests or other staff members before English speaking guests.    WiFi worked ok.    The enertainment was entertaining.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151Brodiew

The room was spacious comfy good AC tv with a range of channels and a nice bathroom. Whilst relatively small the balcony offered a nice view into the gardens and the sunset could be seen behind the buildings. 3 good pools with plenty of beds no early rush and plenty of options. Food was a good standard but repetitive although they did offer theme nights which was nice.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Amanda P wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic holiday,I was convinced by previous reviews stating great staff and lovely food when booking and wasn’t disappointed! Good sized clean and comfortable rooms although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management bar staff reception and cleaners everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we soon found the quieter side of the main pool after the first day - we did a bit of aqua fit to make up for all the food😂 my son loved the foam party & the white cocktail party had great entertainment - there’s more available if you want it and it’s announced in French and English. No problem with sunbeds there’s more than enough available no matter what time of day. Lots of dips in the pool and shade from the trees & parasols help you cope with the heat!!!! Very enjoyable holiday…. shame we are home & back to the cold & cooking our own food - oh and normal pub measures for drinks!!!!😂😂,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandapC2229QD

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kelvin wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Just do it and go and enjoy the experience of this hotel and Marrakech,Having reviewed many of the reviews of the hotel and Marrakech prior to going I was a little unsure of what to expect. Don't read any of them expect this one and the positive ones.  Having spent a week at the Iberostar I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Arrived earlier than the check in time due to the time of the flight welcomed with a drink and an expected time of when the room would be ready (1 hour). Able to use all the facilities and start the holiday straight away whilst we waited for the room.  In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food don’t worry about them if you can’t find something from the plethora of choices available from breakfast all the way through to the evening meal then I’m not sure any restaurant would be able to cater for your needs.  The thing that made this a great experience was the staff from the activity staff encouraging all to take part in the numerous activities available and not hassling you if you wanted a chill day. To the reception bar food and cleaners etc all were great. The top three that made it great was  3. Gentleman on reception (Apologies but forgot his name) – When we realised that my partner had forgot to take some prescription medication we spoke to the gentleman on reception and it was sorted within 24 hours. Took a lot of stress out of worrying about it and when we thanked him the response was “it’s a pleasure”. Great communication throughout.  2.

To the reception bar food and cleaners etc all were great. The top three that made it great was  3. Gentleman on reception (Apologies but forgot his name) – When we realised that my partner had forgot to take some prescription medication we spoke to the gentleman on reception and it was sorted within 24 hours. Took a lot of stress out of worrying about it and when we thanked him the response was “it’s a pleasure”. Great communication throughout.  2. Halima – The first person at the bar that introduced herself always smiling happy and happy to help with anything. Never forgot our name the whole time we were there making it comfortable and chilled.  1. And lastly the highlight of staff was Ismail. - What a credit to the hotel this person never stopped always offering to bring drinks etc always taking way glasses and plates etc. Also made conversation about different things will all from football to advice on the medina etc with us and 2 teenage boys. Though he was great and made a massive difference the experience we had all very positive.  On the medina go and explore it day and night both very different experiences and both very good. There are people that will hassle you but not in a threatening way no different to going to any other popular holiday destination and being hassled to go into bars or restaurants keep walking and don’t engage if you’re not interested and you will be fine. The hotel has a free shuttle bus but we went with a tour on the day trip which included pick up and drop off. And because we wanted to go to the media for sunset and sit in a rooftop café we got a taxi (Taxi rank opposite the hotel) for about £15 each way. Be prepared you may be taken a different way to see some different areas and close your eyes on the way back as they don’t hang about and how they get through certain gaps I do not know but a great experience all the same.  We are looking forward to going back due to the experience we have just had.    Hope this helps,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khefuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eirinn B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing holiday,This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms and without any fuss or hassle we were upgraded.  The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners the ground keepers the food truck staff the entertainment team the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them!  The gardens pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day.  The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters. Plenty of food to choose from hot and cold. Lots of new cuisine to try but also has foods such as pizza chips etc for fussy eaters. Lovely outdoor seating area as well.  There is entertainment each night which is great as the hotel is a fair journey from the nearest town. Through the day there is so much going on at the main pool - aqua aerobics water polo foam parties dancing and music. If this isn't your vibe then there is also the quiet pool. The food truck next to the main pool offers hot and cold drinks and snacks such as hotdogs burgers waffles crepes etc throughout the day.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the souks in Marrakesh. This service is great. The bus arrived on time and dropped you at the same place you'd then be picked back up from. The drop off place is a 10 minute walk from the souks.  There is a rep/tour organiser who sits in the hotel reception. He booked us onto a camel ride (only £20!) which included a half hour camel ride and mint tea and biscuits on our return. This was a highlight and the tour guides were excellent.  I really couldn't pick out any faults from my stay at Iberostar. It has been such a great holiday and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!  Well done to the staff who really do make it 10/10 you are all stars!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Arturcor79 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Found a second place in this Resort,what a wonder of space we found here. I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people was immediately and before anything else they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome they make us feel really special and very well treated from Zacharias at the reception to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys in general like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent with comfortable rooms always with AC. working perfectly because of the heat that is too much and they are very quick to solve any problems that arise. On the last night they are careful and friendly to make a special cocktail for those who leave the next day. For all this and for everything I don't remember to write now I give it 5 stars with the intention of giving 6... I RECOMMEND and stay here if you go to Marrakech you won't regret it... it's worth staying 20 min away from the center of Marrakech... We will be back!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arturcor79
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Filipesequeira wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic Staff,Of the many resorts I've been to this was without a doubt where I felt the best! the staff is absolutely fantastic (thanks Achraf and company) . We arrived long before we could check in tired from the trip and without eating. Without asking for anything we were immediately told that we would have breakfast while the rooms were prepared. We realized right there that the stage was going to go well!  Super clean and well maintained hotel.  The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good.  Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools one more confusing and always partying one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos! the best mojitos are made at the Zen pool bar!!!  The nightly entertainment is quite good and there is already some production involved. We love it! But also because it's the people who make the places and the staff here was the best I've ever encountered during so many trips.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Filipesequeira
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Austin O wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Great for a short 3-4 stay to relax,The hotel facilities and staff where were very friendly and helpful but tipping and thanking definitely helped better service. Lots of activities to keep you busy.    The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best.    Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas.    The bar selection is good and the drinks are nice but all bars close at 12am with no option of a late drink as town is 25 minutes in a taxi,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kilcock, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozzieaustin01

We were very pleased with the attention given by the general manager who was always out and about making sure everything was up to standard.  Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall.  Waiter service was excellent for drinks etc and once our order was ‘known’ we were often brought drinks by regular waiters from different stations (6 beers for 2  of us!)

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this?    We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner nicer and more authentic then this place.    From the start this place was a let down:    The reception staff on check in ran quickly through the paperwork and didn't explain anything about what's included and not they didn't explain where anything was or even how to get us to the room we walked around for 20mins before we realised we were on the opposite side of the resort we were meant to be. We didn't realise there was a zen pool and it had the bar next to it where the other big main pool the cocktail bar was inside. We didn't know that they stop serving hot dogs at 3.30pm so when we went to get one at 5pm we were rudely told they can't do them instead of explaining I'm really sorry we stop making them at 3.30pm.    The golf desk wasn't open at 10am and when we asked reception what time they would open they just said come back tomorrow which is when we wanted to golf you usually need to book your golf tee time ahead of time not on the day we then asked the lady at the guest service desk and she called the golf tour desk man straight away and he came and made a booking at a great course for us they even had new golf clubs to hire. These are the only two people at the resort that were friendly and helpful.    You have to pay 100 dirham for pool towel hire. We didn't have any dirham and the ATM at hotel was down we had Australian cash although they didn't accept Australian so said we couldn't hire any towels we asked to pay with card and they refused so we couldn't get any towels.    Activities like archery mini golf ect is only opened 2hrs a day. Once again we wernt told this until we went to play it and found out we missed it for the day.    Then at the bar my husband ordered a beer which wasn't included in the all inclusive price but we didn't know there was some that were and some that wernt included as it was never explained. Beers also wernt very cold.    The room was old & outdated and wasnt overly clean with mould in the grout a cracked dirty mirror hair on the floor ect. Although I would say the grounds were clean.    The food was terrible it was luke warm & bland I didn't enjoy one thing I eat from the 3 meals over the 3 days & nothing had any signs to say what it was not great if you have allergies or are vegetarian.    The second resturant is morrocan which you only have the option of one tagine from which you need to preorder and book and your only allowed it once during your stay other times you have to eat from buffet.    The spa is super expensive but the staff in there was actually excellent.    It's 20mins from the main part of marrakech in the middle of nowhere so you don't even know your in morroco.    Most guest are French and rude and majority of them smoke so sitting by the pool with people smoking on both sides of you is extremely difficult to breath. The staff also serve French guests or other staff members before English speaking guests.    WiFi worked ok.    The enertainment was entertaining.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151Brodiew

The room was spacious comfy good AC tv with a range of channels and a nice bathroom. Whilst relatively small the balcony offered a nice view into the gardens and the sunset could be seen behind the buildings. 3 good pools with plenty of beds no early rush and plenty of options.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Amanda P wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic holiday,I was convinced by previous reviews stating great staff and lovely food when booking and wasn’t disappointed! Good sized clean and comfortable rooms although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management bar staff reception and cleaners everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we soon found the quieter side of the main pool after the first day - we did a bit of aqua fit to make up for all the food😂 my son loved the foam party & the white cocktail party had great entertainment - there’s more available if you want it and it’s announced in French and English. No problem with sunbeds there’s more than enough available no matter what time of day. Lots of dips in the pool and shade from the trees & parasols help you cope with the heat!!!! Very enjoyable holiday…. shame we are home & back to the cold & cooking our own food - oh and normal pub measures for drinks!!!!😂😂,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandapC2229QD

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kelvin wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Just do it and go and enjoy the experience of this hotel and Marrakech,Having reviewed many of the reviews of the hotel and Marrakech prior to going I was a little unsure of what to expect. Don't read any of them expect this one and the positive ones.  Having spent a week at the Iberostar I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Arrived earlier than the check in time due to the time of the flight welcomed with a drink and an expected time of when the room would be ready (1 hour). Able to use all the facilities and start the holiday straight away whilst we waited for the room.  In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food don’t worry about them if you can’t find something from the plethora of choices available from breakfast all the way through to the evening meal then I’m not sure any restaurant would be able to cater for your needs.

In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food don’t worry about them if you can’t find something from the plethora of choices available from breakfast all the way through to the evening meal then I’m not sure any restaurant would be able to cater for your needs.  The thing that made this a great experience was the staff from the activity staff encouraging all to take part in the numerous activities available and not hassling you if you wanted a chill day. To the reception bar food and cleaners etc all were great. The top three that made it great was  3. Gentleman on reception (Apologies but forgot his name) – When we realised that my partner had forgot to take some prescription medication we spoke to the gentleman on reception and it was sorted within 24 hours. Took a lot of stress out of worrying about it and when we thanked him the response was “it’s a pleasure”. Great communication throughout.  2. Halima – The first person at the bar that introduced herself always smiling happy and happy to help with anything. Never forgot our name the whole time we were there making it comfortable and chilled.  1. And lastly the highlight of staff was Ismail. - What a credit to the hotel this person never stopped always offering to bring drinks etc always taking way glasses and plates etc. Also made conversation about different things will all from football to advice on the medina etc with us and 2 teenage boys. Though he was great and made a massive difference the experience we had all very positive.  On the medina go and explore it day and night both very different experiences and both very good. There are people that will hassle you but not in a threatening way no different to going to any other popular holiday destination and being hassled to go into bars or restaurants keep walking and don’t engage if you’re not interested and you will be fine. The hotel has a free shuttle bus but we went with a tour on the day trip which included pick up and drop off. And because we wanted to go to the media for sunset and sit in a rooftop café we got a taxi (Taxi rank opposite the hotel) for about £15 each way. Be prepared you may be taken a different way to see some different areas and close your eyes on the way back as they don’t hang about and how they get through certain gaps I do not know but a great experience all the same.  We are looking forward to going back due to the experience we have just had.    Hope this helps,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khefuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eirinn B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing holiday,This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms and without any fuss or hassle we were upgraded.  The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners the ground keepers the food truck staff the entertainment team the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them!  The gardens pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day.  The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters. Plenty of food to choose from hot and cold. Lots of new cuisine to try but also has foods such as pizza chips etc for fussy eaters. Lovely outdoor seating area as well.  There is entertainment each night which is great as the hotel is a fair journey from the nearest town. Through the day there is so much going on at the main pool - aqua aerobics water polo foam parties dancing and music. If this isn't your vibe then there is also the quiet pool. The food truck next to the main pool offers hot and cold drinks and snacks such as hotdogs burgers waffles crepes etc throughout the day.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the souks in Marrakesh. This service is great. The bus arrived on time and dropped you at the same place you'd then be picked back up from. The drop off place is a 10 minute walk from the souks.  There is a rep/tour organiser who sits in the hotel reception. He booked us onto a camel ride (only £20!) which included a half hour camel ride and mint tea and biscuits on our return. This was a highlight and the tour guides were excellent.  I really couldn't pick out any faults from my stay at Iberostar. It has been such a great holiday and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!  Well done to the staff who really do make it 10/10 you are all stars!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Arturcor79 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Found a second place in this Resort,what a wonder of space we found here. I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people was immediately and before anything else they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome they make us feel really special and very well treated from Zacharias at the reception to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys in general like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent with comfortable rooms always with AC. working perfectly because of the heat that is too much and they are very quick to solve any problems that arise. On the last night they are careful and friendly to make a special cocktail for those who leave the next day. For all this and for everything I don't remember to write now I give it 5 stars with the intention of giving 6... I RECOMMEND and stay here if you go to Marrakech you won't regret it... it's worth staying 20 min away from the center of Marrakech... We will be back!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aveiro, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arturcor79

We arrived long before we could check in tired from the trip and without eating. Without asking for anything we were immediately told that we would have breakfast while the rooms were prepared. We realized right there that the stage was going to go well!  Super clean and well maintained hotel.  The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good.  Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools one more confusing and always partying one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos! the best mojitos are made at the Zen pool bar!!!  The nightly entertainment is quite good and there is already some production involved. We love it!

Lots of activities to keep you busy.    The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best.    Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas.    The bar selection is good and the drinks are nice but all bars close at 12am with no option of a late drink as town is 25 minutes in a taxi,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kilcock, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozzieaustin01

Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this?    We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner nicer and more authentic then this place.    From the start this place was a let down:    The reception staff on check in ran quickly through the paperwork and didn't explain anything about what's included and not they didn't explain where anything was or even how to get us to the room we walked around for 20mins before we realised we were on the opposite side of the resort we were meant to be. We didn't realise there was a zen pool and it had the bar next to it where the other big main pool the cocktail bar was inside. We didn't know that they stop serving hot dogs at 3.30pm so when we went to get one at 5pm we were rudely told they can't do them instead of explaining I'm really sorry we stop making them at 3.30pm.    The golf desk wasn't open at 10am and when we asked reception what time they would open they just said come back tomorrow which is when we wanted to golf you usually need to book your golf tee time ahead of time not on the day we then asked the lady at the guest service desk and she called the golf tour desk man straight away and he came and made a booking at a great course for us they even had new golf clubs to hire. These are the only two people at the resort that were friendly and helpful.    You have to pay 100 dirham for pool towel hire. We didn't have any dirham and the ATM at hotel was down we had Australian cash although they didn't accept Australian so said we couldn't hire any towels we asked to pay with card and they refused so we couldn't get any towels.    Activities like archery mini golf ect is only opened 2hrs a day. Once again we wernt told this until we went to play it and found out we missed it for the day.    Then at the bar my husband ordered a beer which wasn't included in the all inclusive price but we didn't know there was some that were and some that wernt included as it was never explained. Beers also wernt very cold.    The room was old & outdated and wasnt overly clean with mould in the grout a cracked dirty mirror hair on the floor ect. Although I would say the grounds were clean.    The food was terrible it was luke warm & bland I didn't enjoy one thing I eat from the 3 meals over the 3 days & nothing had any signs to say what it was not great if you have allergies or are vegetarian.    The second resturant is morrocan which you only have the option of one tagine from which you need to preorder and book and your only allowed it once during your stay other times you have to eat from buffet.    The spa is super expensive but the staff in there was actually excellent.    It's 20mins from the main part of marrakech in the middle of nowhere so you don't even know your in morroco.    Most guest are French and rude and majority of them smoke so sitting by the pool with people smoking on both sides of you is extremely difficult to breath. The staff also serve French guests or other staff members before English speaking guests.    WiFi worked ok.    The enertainment was entertaining.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151Brodiew

Whilst relatively small the balcony offered a nice view into the gardens and the sunset could be seen behind the buildings. 3 good pools with plenty of beds no early rush and plenty of options.

Good sized clean and comfortable rooms although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management bar staff reception and cleaners everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we soon found the quieter side of the main pool after the first day - we did a bit of aqua fit to make up for all the food😂 my son loved the foam party & the white cocktail party had great entertainment - there’s more available if you want it and it’s announced in French and English. No problem with sunbeds there’s more than enough available no matter what time of day. Lots of dips in the pool and shade from the trees & parasols help you cope with the heat!!!!

Don't read any of them expect this one and the positive ones.  Having spent a week at the Iberostar I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Arrived earlier than the check in time due to the time of the flight welcomed with a drink and an expected time of when the room would be ready (1 hour). Able to use all the facilities and start the holiday straight away whilst we waited for the room.  In essence I have read reviews stating that the French guests are favoured above the English or other nationalities I can assure you this is not the case. All the staff treated everyone equally and with a smile. Reviews about the lack of variety of food don’t worry about them if you can’t find something from the plethora of choices available from breakfast all the way through to the evening meal then I’m not sure any restaurant would be able to cater for your needs.  The thing that made this a great experience was the staff from the activity staff encouraging all to take part in the numerous activities available and not hassling you if you wanted a chill day. To the reception bar food and cleaners etc all were great. The top three that made it great was  3. Gentleman on reception (Apologies but forgot his name) – When we realised that my partner had forgot to take some prescription medication we spoke to the gentleman on reception and it was sorted within 24 hours. Took a lot of stress out of worrying about it and when we thanked him the response was “it’s a pleasure”. Great communication throughout.  2. Halima – The first person at the bar that introduced herself always smiling happy and happy to help with anything. Never forgot our name the whole time we were there making it comfortable and chilled.  1. And lastly the highlight of staff was Ismail. - What a credit to the hotel this person never stopped always offering to bring drinks etc always taking way glasses and plates etc. Also made conversation about different things will all from football to advice on the medina etc with us and 2 teenage boys. Though he was great and made a massive difference the experience we had all very positive.  On the medina go and explore it day and night both very different experiences and both very good. There are people that will hassle you but not in a threatening way no different to going to any other popular holiday destination and being hassled to go into bars or restaurants keep walking and don’t engage if you’re not interested and you will be fine. The hotel has a free shuttle bus but we went with a tour on the day trip which included pick up and drop off. And because we wanted to go to the media for sunset and sit in a rooftop café we got a taxi (Taxi rank opposite the hotel) for about £15 each way. Be prepared you may be taken a different way to see some different areas and close your eyes on the way back as they don’t hang about and how they get through certain gaps I do not know but a great experience all the same.  We are looking forward to going back due to the experience we have just had.    Hope this helps,Date of stay: August 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Khefuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eirinn B wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Amazing holiday,This holiday to Marrakesh has been absolutely wonderful. From the minute you arrive the staff are so friendly and do everything for you. The view from our room wasn't the best and so we asked if there were any other available rooms and without any fuss or hassle we were upgraded.  The staff at Iberostar are amazing. They work so hard and nothing is ever too much to ask. They always serve you with a smile and are so very attentive. Everybody from the cleaners the ground keepers the food truck staff the entertainment team the restaurant staff - I really can't fault them!  The gardens pool areas and rooms are immaculate and cleaned every day. The maids put out fresh towels each day.  The restaurant is wonderful and accommodates for all types of eaters. Plenty of food to choose from hot and cold. Lots of new cuisine to try but also has foods such as pizza chips etc for fussy eaters. Lovely outdoor seating area as well.  There is entertainment each night which is great as the hotel is a fair journey from the nearest town. Through the day there is so much going on at the main pool - aqua aerobics water polo foam parties dancing and music. If this isn't your vibe then there is also the quiet pool. The food truck next to the main pool offers hot and cold drinks and snacks such as hotdogs burgers waffles crepes etc throughout the day.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the souks in Marrakesh. This service is great. The bus arrived on time and dropped you at the same place you'd then be picked back up from. The drop off place is a 10 minute walk from the souks.  There is a rep/tour organiser who sits in the hotel reception. He booked us onto a camel ride (only £20!) which included a half hour camel ride and mint tea and biscuits on our return. This was a highlight and the tour guides were excellent.  I really couldn't pick out any faults from my stay at Iberostar. It has been such a great holiday and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!  Well done to the staff who really do make it 10/10 you are all stars!!!

I already say that I recommend it and that I will definitely return to this country and it will be in this resort that I will stay. We arrived long before check-in time around 9:30 am and the first concern they had with me and the family and we were 9 people was immediately and before anything else they sent us to breakfast so that we could eat something extraordinary Mohamed (maletero). the Staff is awesome they make us feel really special and very well treated from Zacharias at the reception to Yussef and Mohamed at the bar but who we really became friends with was Ashram and Elhocine from the pool towels. Very friendly and smiling guys in general like all the hotel staff. The facilities are excellent with comfortable rooms always with AC. working perfectly because of the heat that is too much and they are very quick to solve any problems that arise. On the last night they are careful and friendly to make a special cocktail for those who leave the next day. For all this and for everything I don't remember to write now I give it 5 stars with the intention of giving 6... I RECOMMEND and stay here if you go to Marrakech you won't regret it... it's worth staying 20 min away from the center of Marrakech...

We realized right there that the stage was going to go well!  Super clean and well maintained hotel.  The food is good and there is a lot of variety and the hotel takes care of having a grill with different meats every day. It's really good.  Super nice and well maintained spaces. Three pools one more confusing and always partying one for children and then the Zen one that was the most used for us and where we can relax with lots of mojitos! the best mojitos are made at the Zen pool bar!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Austin O wrote a review Sep 2022,40,Great for a short 3-4 stay to relax,The hotel facilities and staff where were very friendly and helpful but tipping and thanking definitely helped better service. Lots of activities to keep you busy.    The selection of food in the buffet was very good but some was cold. The traditional morrocian restaurant you get one night of your stay was very slow service and basic at best.    Alot of people smoke and have no concideration for people that don't especially around the pool and outdoor eating areas.    The bar selection is good and the drinks are nice but all bars close at 12am with no option of a late drink as town is 25 minutes in a taxi,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kilcock, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozzieaustin01
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,fmc1965 wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic stay,Absolutely brilliant. Facilities staff and rooms all fantastic. Staff were so happy to help those who needed it and I saw them rushing to help anyone who wanted anything. We were very pleased with the attention given by the general manager who was always out and about making sure everything was up to standard.  Food was very good and even when busy queues were minimal. The outside seating was a lovely escape from the noise of the communal eating hall.  Waiter service was excellent for drinks etc and once our order was ‘known’ we were often brought drinks by regular waiters from different stations (6 beers for 2  of us!)

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,151Brodiew wrote a review Sep 2022,10,Do yourself a favour and stay in a riad. Avoid this place at all costs.,After a day of staying at this resort i was really wondering how this place has so many 5 stars reviews and it seemed weird that everyone mentions the names of particular staff members when people usually write reviews they usually just write staff were great not particular names right? But I ended up finding out on the second day that staff come around and ask you to write a review and say to mention there name on it you even get credits for writing a positive review. Bribing some may call this?    We have been in Marrakesh for a week before coming here and our riad before here had way better service and was so much cleaner nicer and more authentic then this place.    From the start this place was a let down:    The reception staff on check in ran quickly through the paperwork and didn't explain anything about what's included and not they didn't explain where anything was or even how to get us to the room we walked around for 20mins before we realised we were on the opposite side of the resort we were meant to be. We didn't realise there was a zen pool and it had the bar next to it where the other big main pool the cocktail bar was inside. We didn't know that they stop serving hot dogs at 3.30pm so when we went to get one at 5pm we were rudely told they can't do them instead of explaining I'm really sorry we stop making them at 3.30pm.    The golf desk wasn't open at 10am and when we asked reception what time they would open they just said come back tomorrow which is when we wanted to golf you usually need to book your golf tee time ahead of time not on the day we then asked the lady at the guest service desk and she called the golf tour desk man straight away and he came and made a booking at a great course for us they even had new golf clubs to hire. These are the only two people at the resort that were friendly and helpful.    You have to pay 100 dirham for pool towel hire. We didn't have any dirham and the ATM at hotel was down we had Australian cash although they didn't accept Australian so said we couldn't hire any towels we asked to pay with card and they refused so we couldn't get any towels.    Activities like archery mini golf ect is only opened 2hrs a day. Once again we wernt told this until we went to play it and found out we missed it for the day.    Then at the bar my husband ordered a beer which wasn't included in the all inclusive price but we didn't know there was some that were and some that wernt included as it was never explained. Beers also wernt very cold.    The room was old & outdated and wasnt overly clean with mould in the grout a cracked dirty mirror hair on the floor ect. Although I would say the grounds were clean.    The food was terrible it was luke warm & bland I didn't enjoy one thing I eat from the 3 meals over the 3 days & nothing had any signs to say what it was not great if you have allergies or are vegetarian.    The second resturant is morrocan which you only have the option of one tagine from which you need to preorder and book and your only allowed it once during your stay other times you have to eat from buffet.    The spa is super expensive but the staff in there was actually excellent.    It's 20mins from the main part of marrakech in the middle of nowhere so you don't even know your in morroco.    Most guest are French and rude and majority of them smoke so sitting by the pool with people smoking on both sides of you is extremely difficult to breath. The staff also serve French guests or other staff members before English speaking guests.    WiFi worked ok.    The enertainment was entertaining.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kelowna, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151Brodiew
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Chris J wrote a review Sep 2022,40,A great place to stay for a week in the sun.,Arrived and greeted with a nice drink and early check in which set the standard for a good holiday. The room was spacious comfy good AC tv with a range of channels and a nice bathroom. Whilst relatively small the balcony offered a nice view into the gardens and the sunset could be seen behind the buildings. 3 good pools with plenty of beds no early rush and plenty of options. Food was a good standard but repetitive although they did offer theme nights which was nice. However we personally felt that breakfast wasn't the best but did enjoy the pastries.,Date of stay: September 2022,,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chris13james
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Amanda P wrote a review Sep 2022,50,Fantastic holiday,I was convinced by previous reviews stating great staff and lovely food when booking and wasn’t disappointed! Good sized clean and comfortable rooms although we didn’t get any toiletries until half way through our holiday. Probably the friendliest team of staff I’ve ever come across - from management bar staff reception and cleaners everyone we met was cheery and friendly. There is constant cleaning maintenance and gardening going on but it’s not intrusive on your holiday the gardens are amazing. Food selection is varied & delicious - lots of stations every meal time where they are freshly cooking food for you; some things are the same each day but there are also new things to try for variety - including roast beef on Sunday! Entertainment is there if you want it - we soon found the quieter side of the main pool after the first day - we did a bit of aqua fit to make up for all the food😂 my son loved the foam party & the white cocktail party had great entertainment - there’s more available if you want it and it’s announced in French and English. No problem with sunbeds there’s more than enough available no matter what time of day. Lots of dips in the pool and shade from the trees & parasols help you cope with the heat!!!! Very enjoyable holiday…. shame we are home & back to the cold & cooking our own food - oh and normal pub measures for drinks!!!!😂😂,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandapC2229QD

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,JastFab wrote a review Oct 2021,30,Avoid if you don't speak French,"Well this hotel was rather disappointing. The main issue is the inability to speak English from most staff member. Of all staff only 2 people could communicate with us. The remainder staff entertainment staff included would ignore us because they did not know English. It was shocking actually experiencing people coming to us speaking in French ask them to speak English and actually turning around and go away. I was appalled. The only English speaking member of the entertainment staff was Mydi who was really nice and good to us and would deserve a 5 star on his own. Aimad was the only staff member at the services in the Zen pool bar who could speak an amazing English and would actually talk to us.    We had a suite which was nice and acceptably clean.    Most of the food in the restaurant isn't labelled hence you are never sure on what is what or what you are eating. Some is labelled. However overall the food is rather boring and average. The inability of staff to communicate in English makes the simplest things more difficult like ""can I have a fried egg or can you warm up the pizza or what is this???""    There are 3 pools one for kids a loud ""party"" pool and a Zen pool quieter and more relaxing. The bartender here AIMAD was English speaking and we received an incredible outstanding service from him!    We had 1 hammer and another day both manicure and pedicure. All the spa service was very good. Shame the communication was so difficult.",Date of stay: October 2021,,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JastFab

Excellent animation team lots of activities like a zoo big kids pool mini disco etc. Very beautiful grounds. Special compliment to the Chef. Food is really well cooked and variety is great my only negative comment about the food offering is the pastry in the morning is so so. Taking into account we r in Morocco (where bread and pastry r somewhat amazing on average) it is close to terrible. Waiters are very prompt and attentive 5* for their service. The only reason why I didn’t put 5* for the hotel is because I was disappointed with lack of enforcement of mask wearing in the restaurant. The majority of the customers are moroccan many of them seem to believe they have a superior protection so they don’t bother about the masks and hotel does nothing to change this. If you are concerned about safety you should go to Spain where this would be unthinkable based on my last 2 stays in 2 dif Iberostars in Andalusia.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Balafrej-ahmed wrote a review Jan 2021,50,excellent hotel,A good comforting impression settles since the reception with the warm welcome of the great professional Mr. Mohamed Ali: big thank you Sir. An excellent animation team abdou hamid khalid yassine imane mehdi morad and all the animators and of course the animation manager the magnificent Abdel big bravo they are all real professionals and friendly people. Safety standards are respected in the restaurant the friendliness of the kitchen and catering staff and without limit they do their best to satisfy you. for this club hotel there is no room for boredom the day is busy and packed with activities. The big advantage as I mentioned is the diversity for example the duck lake the nice corner with farm animals the grassy field for football fans several and different sports fields the trapezoids of circus ... and also the heated swimming pool for adults and the swimming pool for kids with slide ... what is missing in my opinion is an indoor swimming pool it is very important especially in winter for activities like the Aqua zoomba or other. finally I recommend this club to everyone.,Date of stay: December 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rabat, Morocco",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balafrej_A

Received from hotel an automatic message of welcome in my Agoda account next replied the message to inquire about city shuttle details.  Was never answered therefore using the iberostar customer care plus the direct hotel’s email address this time for a much more urgent matter.  My flight back to Portugal was cancelled and alternative flights needed to show another Covid test  so I needed information where I could go in Marrakesh to do it and hotel’s assistance for advance booking.  Even told them without it I would cancel my stay.  Iberostar customer care first answered and told that forward the case to Iberostar Marrakesh to answer me.  No reply at all....  I even insisted again with both to be answered and nothing.    It’s a very bad signal when an hotel group so much in need of guests as all are today and treat this way the very few bookings.  I will cancel my booking of course and look to another more professional and attentive hotel.,Date of stay: December 2020,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Porto, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariomacau

It's a very nice hotel with huge comfortable rooms friendly and helpful staff. I was studying and needed some files printed out and the receptionist was so obliging I felt really taken care of. The buffet breakfast and dinner were always plentiful with lots of options especially for kids. They also have a selection of local cuisine which made the dinners more interesting.

High standards in this all in resort.    Starts with a perfect room: daily spotless cleaning large bed sofa desk closets and storage room aircon safe tv wifi minifridge balcony with chairs and table. Large bathroom with towels and toiletries (soap bodylotion showergel shampoo and conditioner). Laundry service if you wish.    The buffet is amazing. Lots of different food and is constantly replenished. Unfortunately breakfast and lunch did not have many options for a Vegan. You can sit inside or outside. The waiter even remembered what I drank at dinner!  Also the bar staff remembers what you drink and arranged soy milk for me.    The hotel resort offers all kinds of sports/activities/entertainment. All for free. The crew is very friendly and wants to make your stay unforgettable. Every day a new show in the theater entertainment in the bar (casino dance quiz drinks & dance in the lobby). There's a hug spa wellness center for your ultimate relaxing. You can walk around and swim 1 one of the 3 pools (1 heated and for adults only).  Food and drink stands everywhere.    A free bus will take you to the city center and back. There's a little shop in the hotel (no cigarettes) tourdesk and an ATM.    The hotel is environmentally friendly! And the staff is super hospitable helpful funny and friendly.    As a coffee addict and slow starter I'd prefer a coffee machine and kettle in the room.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,96be wrote a review Mar 2020,10,Worst hotel experience ever - zero luxury or customer service. Solo females please avoid!,After staying previously in a Spanish Iberostar which I loved I booked 3 days here solo for a supposedly relaxing break in a 4* hotel. The grounds are beautiful it’s close to the airport by taxi and I enjoyed the house wine. The positives stopped there for me.    - Harassed by several Male members of staff (leered and gawked at continuously plus the lifeguard literally shouting after me ‘your beautiful’ several times like some creep on the street). Insane behaviour at a 4* hotel I’d never seen unprofessionalism like it. Felt like most staff had just walked in off the street and picked up working!    - Most staff do not speak English very well (or at all) and make absolutely no effort to do so as very few guests are English compared to french. Especially bad were the bartenders to the point where I had to have one go and get his colleague as he literally spoke no English at all.    - found staff generally cold rude and some outright aggressive. I had to report TWO members of staff by the afternoon of my second day (a first for me and hopefully a last).    - As a lone English speaking young female traveller I felt isolated and objectified the whole time by staff who acted like they hadn’t seen an attractive female in their entire life.    - zen pool area not cleaned much at all which meant food and drinks everywhere long after people have abandoned them    - children and babies in pool at times despite saying adult only (no notice from lifeguard)    - People dive bombing in the pool (again no notice from lifeguard) and I generally just found it extremely noisy    - room corridor is unbearably loud. Could hear other guests walking to their rooms and clearly hear every part of their conversations whilst in bed    - could hear screaming and cheering from entertainment in my room until midnight    - No hand or face towel    - Only 2 syrups available for a 4* hotel (mint and grenadine if your wondering). Goodbye to dreams of strawberry mojitos.    - Cocktails taste like watered down slushies. Never seen them shaken or blended no matter what I ordered - what kind of daiquiri is 3/4 lemon juice 1/4 rum and 2 ice cubes stirred for a second?    - Dined at the Morocco restaurant on my last night which I’m sure was the cause of food poisoning the next morning. I woke up violently ill and had to check out and catch my flight where I was still throwing up as we were landing back in Belfast which just about wrapped up a horrific trip.    Zero luxury zero customer service zero charm and in general just not suitable for lone females - certain staff at the this hotel are literally disgusting. Plus I could make better cocktails myself at home. Unbelievable that I paid to experience such an unpleasant situation!,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96be

From check-in to leaving our stay was amazing. The hotel has beautiful grounds and amazing facilities. You can either go full one and partake in all activities or just lounge around the pools (they have three!) We were AI as I believe most of the guest were. Food was good better if you are a meat eater but we were never disappointed being vegetarian. My only criticism would be food labelling we had to on a number of occasion ask what the dish was. From Breakfast to dinner there is plenty of choice. The food truck was also very good my husband said he had one of the best cheese baguettes from there you will definitively leave a few pounds heavier.    The staff are what make this hotel great they are super friendly and nothing is too much trouble. They have themed nights which are really good. They made a real fuss of my husband for his birthday which was really nice.    The bus into the median was good and ran on time.    Rooms are basic but any issues are resolved quickly.

The bathroom doors are not good and did not open or close smoothly.

Staff very friendly and helpful the grounds well maintained and promote a relaxing environment. Love the burger van.  The weather was good but chilly in the morning and cold at night obviously because of the time of year. You could change money at the reception for a good rate if you wanted to but they had a cash machine which you could use if you don’t have money to exchange.  I stayed for one week rooms cleaned every day to a very high standard with special touches each day. The food was incredible. So many traditional dishes and each tasted lovely.

Good activities outside but could do with a bit more for the late afternoon crowd. We missed out on things like archery which would have been fun but they only had it at 10am when we were out. Shops were also closed too early so we never got a chance to pop in. Rooms were fairly basic as they lacked certain things a budget hotel would have such as face towels bottled water (only one between 2) Iron was available on request which was good. Food was OK except if you are an earlier riser breakfast was prepared an hour in advance of opening so was always cold for the first people there. The WiFi was terrible. No WiFi whatsoever in the rooms. Food at lunch and dinner was decent would be good to get some insight in to what is being served each night as sometimes it varied. There was a dedicated member of staff who helps with booking golf but he doesn't have any special offers. More offers on golf would be great. Overall its decent. Will come back next year.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,LesleyEM22 wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Outstanding Hotel - You WILL Be Back,I had booked this hotel as a 70th birthday treat for my mum and I could not have chosen better. We arrived several hours before check-in but the porter immediately took our luggage we were offered a seat to complete the necessary forms brought cold fruit juices and told someone would be with us shortly. Within 10 minutes a lovely gentleman introduced himself and took us on a tour of the grounds and facilities. This has NEVER been happened at any other hotel I have stayed in and is a lovely touch. As soon as this was completed to our surprise our room was ready.    The room was spacious and the bathroom generously sized with a huge shower with a wonderful rainfall shower head. They had even went to the trouble of putting petals on my mum's bed wishing her a happy birthday. That was followed by cake and biscuits to our room. So very thoughtful and kind. She could not have had a better beginning to her birthday trip.    The grounds are truly lovely. Literally a little oasis. All the public spaces were washed down each night. As stated the main pool is not heated so in winter it is not for the fainthearted. However some people did brave it and the music and atmosphere around the pool is great. The Zen pool IS heated so I can understand why children want to use it at this time of the year. To ensure it is adult only the hotel really do need to consider heating the kids pool.    I've noticed that some reviews say the entertainment is a little 'samey'. Well it consists of the same six dancers (at least at this time of the year) but their enthusiasm is undeniable and it's still a great way to spend an hour while sipping a cocktail. The main male dancer is also the choreographer. I think his name is William. What a talent! I particularly enjoyed the 'Dirty Dancing' sequence - amazing! At the minute the 'White Party' is on a Wednesday so be sure to pack your white outfit.    The food and drink is flawless. Again in response to those who say it is repetitive i would say that there are some of the same foods there every dinner time - i.e. pizza and chips but that's because there will always be people looking for these things - especially kids. However if you want something different every night then try something different! There is enough variety to do so and there will always be something there that wasn't there any other night that week. A found the house red wine to be a little harsh but the rose was perfect.    We used the free shuttle bus into Marrakech several times. While it is a great facility you need to be aware that it leaves you off a good 20/25 minute walk from the main square and the souks. I'm not sure why it cannot get you closer. There are sometimes men hanging around the drop-off place who will immediately tell you that you are going the wrong way. They'll offer to take you to the 'right place' for money of course. Just say 'no thank you' and walk on! Walk straight up the road where the bus leaves you. There will be a large fountain on the roundabout BEHIND you. Keep walking straight up the road to the famous Kutubiyya Mosque. There is a pedestrian crossing in front of it. Cross there and you'll be on a road with horses and carriages on it that leads you directly to Jama El F'na Square. Amazing place but do keep your wits about you as I saw some tourists get a snake flung around their neck and have to pay to get it removed again.    This is an absolutely gorgeous hotel with kind caring staff that I have no hesitation in recommending. In fact I'm looking at an excuse to head back next winter. It really is the perfect place for some rest and relaxation and the perfect antidote to the chaos (in a good way!) of Marrakech itself.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Bangor, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesleyEM22

There was always an area with Morrocan food which was my favourite. The hotel fell short in some areas such as bidet decent shampoo and shower gel face towels and of course water in the rooms. The bar areas were good but lacked that extra luxury. The hotel is also small comparatively with others in the area.  All in all a great hotel good price and exceptional customer service,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alai2018

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Richard B wrote a review Mar 2020,50,"Sunny, warm, great pools and with very friendly and helpful staff",We have just returned from a great all inclusive week. A new holiday experience for us so we were slghtly nervous but pretty much everything exceeded our expectations. The site is very large and well maintained so it is easy to stroll away from the main pool and bar areas if you want a bit of quiet. We swam in the heated Zen pool with no problems - just swim when it opens and you avoid the children which some others have complained about. We also used the table tennis and boules with no problems. There is an extensive choice of food the tagine could probably could have been more spiced for us but overall we had lovely meals. And the staff were all brilliant - friendly and helpful.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Purley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardbC3153NS
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mariella T wrote a review Feb 2020,30,Iberostar Palmarie Marrakech,Having gone to Marrakesh a few times we decided we’d try a different hotel this year.    1. The “Zen” Pool - Advertised to be “adults only” on the website however it is constantly filled with small children being loud and most of all interrupting other’s swimming. This seems to be very randomly policed which only causes more arguments.    2. Wifi is pretty non-existent and temperamental at that    3. The Traditional Moroccan Restaurant - Offered couscous and pastilla on the website which we received none    4. Room’s are very echoey and housekeeping are often moving beds early in the morning which can be heard 5 doors down!    5. The reception activities are unnecessarily loud especially for such an echoey place. We found it impossible to be near it and hear each other talking and could hear it crystal clear from inside my room    Besides this the service has been fenomenal. Lovely people working there with excellent facilities and food. Furthermore we were a group of 3 adults expecting a relaxing stay and although there are relaxing aspects of the hotel it is probably better suited to those with children or large groups. Therefore it is unlikely we will be returning to this hotel. Just a few issues that bugged us a little too much.    EDIT: We expressed our concerns to Sara (amazing power woman!!) who very kindly offered us a pastilla and couscous specially and took our suggestions on how to improve the issue of the Zen pool (e.g bigger sign marking the age restriction creating lanes with rope to section off those who want to do laps and children). The hotel is very concerned with making sure that everyone is happy and wants to return and we greatly appreciate their effort in dealing with the issues raised.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641mariellat
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,RoxetteBillones wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Couples trip/first time in Morocco,Just got back from holidaying at this hotel and would highly recommend. The staff are very friendly and super attentive especially with drinks - one waiter (unfortunately have forgotten his name!!) always made sure we had drinks and we never had to go to the bar and he always remembered what we drank. The food is great apart from the 'bacon'at breakfast although there is lots of choice and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. There is also a food truck outside which is convenient in case you want to lounge by the pool all day and not have to get dressed up to go inside and have lunch in the main restaurant. Our room was cleaned everyday and towels changed everyday. There were of sunbeds around the pools and staff members bringing you drinks/snacks/clean ashtrays at regular intervals. The entertainment team are very engaging and ensure everyone is ok and having fun. The hotel is very beautiful and the grounds are very large-do make sure you walk around and explore!    One minor 'complaint' although probably not fair to say is that there are cats wandering around inside the hotel and around the outdoor eating/drinking areas. I'm petrified of cats although this didnn't ruin the holiday for me and they were harmless and just wanted to be fed - you are instructed not to feed them. Another minor complaint would be the transfer journey on the way to the hotel - it was a bit of a rough journey very hot a tight squeeze in the car with other passengers and the driver became quite verbally aggressive when we (kindly) refused to tip him - he didnt ask the other passengers for tips and only asked us which we thought was very cheeky.    Overall a gorgeous hotel    Tips:  - If you smoke bring plenty/enough cigarettes supply and ask for an ashtray to keep on your balcony. The hotel does not sell cigarettes and it is a bit far out in the middle of nowhere. Fellow smokers often ended up asking us for cigarettes as they had clearly run out.    - Bring ear plugs so you don't get woken up by any animals or the call to prayer. (I heard this at about half 6 in the morning).    -,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxetteBillones
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Julie J wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Beautiful Hotel Great Staff,My husband and I and our 14 year old son visited for 5 nights in February. After surviving the transfer from the airport( there appears to be no road rules!) we were relieved to reach Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech. The hotel is beautiful with luxurious furnishings and decorations and perfectly manicured gardens. We were immediately seated in the reception area and we had a glass of juice while completing the check in paper work. We then visited the restaurant for lunch before it closed and then went back for our room key. The room was ideally sized with a large spacious bathroom. We had a pool view although we were directly over the outside restaurant seating area which wasn’t particularly attractive!  We walked around the grounds which are extensive and noted that there were so many things to do. Tennis table tennis pétanque spinning volleyball badminton football archery and even trapeze!  There are two pools the main pool was freezing. The smaller zen pool is heated but supposed to be adults only. Children did swim in here and I think as long as they are not too boisterous no one seems to mind. We sat around the main pool and there were plenty of sun beds. We started at one side of the pool and then crossed to the other side as the sun moved round without a problem!  We joined in with some of the games as did plenty of other people. The star friends were very friendly spoke wonderful English and although they did navigate the pool telling people about upcoming games they were not pushy!  We were slightly disappointed with the food in the main restaurant and felt there wasn’t enough meat choices and some of it was undercooked. The only hot potato appeared to be chips? There were potatoes but they were all served cold? There was plenty of cous cous and tagines and there was always pizza. The dessert buffet always looked amazing but they all tasted the same! At breakfast I appreciated the attempt at bacon but it was very fatty and the beef sausages were sat in congealed fat so not very appetising. The usual hotel toaster was in place were you have to wait for three revolutions before your bread has any colour. The eggs were aplenty though. The best food and service was at the food truck by the pool. Burgers at lunchtime and crepes after 3 o’clock the two guys who worked in there were so obliging.  Evening entertainment was mediocre and we tended to give it a miss.  In short a lovely hotel ideal for people who are willing to embrace cultural differences.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliej213

The mini water park was great for our 3 year old as was the swimming pool the female life guard was fantastic with the children and went out of her way to make them happy. Our son loves the zoo also.    Food was good although did become repetitive after a few days as most all inclusive do. Drinks were ok. The food truck was infested with wasps though and although our little one loved the idea we were worried of the hygiene of it.    Our main complaint was the mini disco. Our son love it but we felt it was way too late for little ones to start at 9pm.

For February we had fantanstic weather between 18 - 28 most days but chilly mornings. The staff are first class especially the animation team and bar staff. I was so shocked when they remembered my name and what drinks I would like! We really enjoyed the lunches evening meals and the snack van. Also while lazy by the pool the guys would come round with donuts and crepes wow! We had a meal in the restaurant and that was made special as it was my friends birthday and they provided a birthday cake without charge. My only one personal choice I made that I wish I didn't was to go to the spa. The guy who showed us the spa was full of cold that I then caught and still have. I paid 500dm for an hour and they actual treatment only lasted 10 mins the other time was sitting alone during each treatment. It all felt very rushed and quite painful! BUT I won't hold this against the hotel and yes I will be going back to the hotel but not the spa. I think it would be really helpful if on arrival a small map of the hotel and grounds was part of the welcome as we kept on asking were things were together with a scedule of daily activities.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"Courrensan, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579suzannen

Restaurant is buffet style with SO MUCH choice! All food needs are catered for including gluten free with the local dishes on offer being plentiful and amazing!  Staff in the restaurants are friendly attentive and once they have seen you a couple of times like family! Iberostar should be very proud of the team in Club Palmeraie.  The entertainments crew are bubbly attentive and full of the joy of life all loving their jobs.    Only complaints - were main pool was FREEZING! and reception staff were not always fully attentive.    Nice touches - The food van at round the big pool and the effort the hotel go to to entertain each evening. Shuttle to Marrakech is quick easy and comepletely reliable.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,riddg wrote a review Feb 2020,40,"Very friendly staff, very lovely food and a good place to stay.",I have just recently visited this hotel from the 2nd-6th February 2020. Me and my friend were lucky with the weather as it hit 28 degrees pretty much every day. I thought the zen pool was fantastic given that the bigger one hasn't warmed up due to the weather only becoming warm this week. The hotel staff were all very welcoming fun and friendly. The food I couldn't fault there was plenty of choice. For an all inclusive I did notice that the pool closed at six and some meals were only available at certain times. The van made it that you could have something always pretty much in the day but unfortunately after nine at night I don't know if there was anything available to eat. I might have just missed that to be fair. The bedroom was lovely and beautiful and clean but there was a leak that went into the corridor of our room. In saying that we informed the hotel staff and they sorted it immediately. It was slightly loud at night but that was just some of the guests and even then it wasn't too bad. Nothing to do with the hotel and generally I noticed the guests were extremely friendly and there was no problems there. The only other gripe was the cocktails. They were alot better at the zen bar but that closed at six also. But with all this the hotel was so beautiful to look at lots of greenery and the activity staff tried so hard. There was also a trapeze which I've never seen in a hotel before so that was cool. There was choice of archery darts and aqua gym as examples but there was more. I probably would stay here again as the staff were all so nice and just made everyone feel at home. It was a great place to stay! I had to give it four stars for the reasons I have given ✨😊,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bedworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jillbob101

What a wonderful week it was! First of all I would like to say big thank you to Muhammad who arranged a big surprise for my wife and kindly arranged for my wife a cake sparkling wine & a fantastic pair of swans made from towels and rose petals scattered all over the bed. If you want a great holiday then this is the place for you.  The hotel is very well managed and the staff/service is 5 star. It is obvious the staff enjoy working here. Always happy smiling and making sure you’re having a nice time. Reception staff were always helpful and helped us with phone calls on a few occasions. There is loads to do in the hotel and a different show each night. The entertainment team are excellent and very professional.  The food was brilliant and there was something for everyone with different food every night. Rooms were very clean and tidy and the cleaners were also very friendly and happy. The hotel also puts on a Managers invitation party they go all out with decorations and entertainment making it a great night.  Every member of staff was incredible and took the time to interact with us. I have a huge shout out to those below who made our short trip very special; Khalid Rachida Faissal Adele and Sara just to name a few.

Our room was clean and comfortable. The food was good with an excellent choice. The staff were fantastic they knew our names and couldn't do enough for us. whether in the resaurant the bar by the pool can't praise them highly enough. We just wanted to laze by the heated pool most days soaking up the rays but we were encouraged to take part in several daytime activities. We had a go at archery and petanque but didn't fancy a go on the trapeze although it was fun to watch others. There was a lively show most evenings in the theatre parties in the vast reception area and musicians and dancers in the restaurant and lounge.

Our only criticism would be the cats that seem to have the run of the place. Not sure if they were wild but there were loads of them hanging around the outdoor dining area every day and on our 2nd day one jumped up on my lap while I was eating - that was the last time we sat outside for lunch!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sammy W wrote a review Feb 2020,40,Pleasant Surprise!,BACKGROUND: To start I am an avid traveller and have stayed at many resorts in Mexico Cuba and Dominican Republic. For this trip the purpose was to experience Africa for the first time and enjoy the culture while experiencing some time to relax at an all-inclusive. I stayed from Jan 26-Jan 31 and travelled with my cousins (2 adults and one 3 year old). We arrived at the resort and the front desk staff was very pleasant. The check-in was smooth and they spoke enough english for us to have all of our needs taken care of. We were 30 mins from airport!    ROOM: Our room was close by to the pool (pool-view) and lobby. The rooms were not 'high-end' per say however they were very decent and tidy. The doors to the bathroom were very cool and the window in the room was also very interesting. The beds were very clean (I checked for bed bugs every day and there was nothing very clean!). The maid kept forgetting to leave us towels when she took our old ones so I had to ask almost everyday. There was ample closet space to put things away as well as a pull-out couch.    FOOD: I am a very picky eater and the food was EXCEPTIONAL. Especially for a 4-star resort I found so many options for each of the 3 meals and never once questioned any of the dishes. There were 3 offerings of Tagine's (moroccan dish with various meats and veggies) every meal. I tried many of them including the chicken and the fish and they were all exceptional. I have a weak immune system so I was super thankful to never once feel sick from anything I had eaten. A+ on the food.    DRINKS: average not great not terrible. The cappuccino and coffee offerings were amazing and the bartenders were very friendly.    ENTERTAINMENT: the entertainment team was totally awesome. Khalid was great to the 3 year old family member and gave him attention all week which was perfect! Jamal also did an amazing job with the young family member always keeping him entertained. All of the entertainment team made sure that we were always having a great time. We loved the variety of games all day - a ton of options even though it was not busy season. The nightly shows were way better than expected. I have been to many resorts and the entertainment was top notch at night. I couldnt have asked for better shows and they involved guests at the end by getting them on stage.    POOLS: the heated pools were very cold. it was 25 degrees there during the day but dropped to 10-14 overnight and in the mornings it was cold. So I would assume they just couldnt keep the pools hot with the cold weather. the kids pool was awesome for the little one it was like being at his own amusement park. this resort is perfect for young ones but also not boasting with kids.    SHUTTLE: free shuttle into Marrakech which was super handy.    Overall a 4.3/5 because of the pools being cold (not swimmable) in this weather however maybe that is not something they can control. Lovely staff and lovely experience for our first time in Morocco!!,Date of stay: January 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammywilson9
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Brian04062010 wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Sweet surprise,After arriving at Marrakesh airport you are treated to a spotlessly clean airport and very quick (as long as you in fill your little white sheet of paper for everyone in your party with every detail it asks) but very secure entry to another part of the airport but before your allowed to leave you again have to put your bags on to another x-ray machine but after that it’s straight outside to a lot of taxi drivers asking to take you to your hotel but if you pre-booked your transfer just go to where all the boards are and look for your name give it over then enjoy your ride to your hotel.    When you get to the hotel the security guards help you take your bags in to all I can say is a magnificent open reception area with a jaw dropping chandelier the reception staff are more than helpful in understanding what you need while you yet again fill in those white entry to Marrakesh forms when your done the reception staff kindly give you two bottles of water to quench your thirst before being given your room card and then your taken to your room.    Don’t worry about running out at the crack of dawn to put your towels out cause even at 8-8.30 there’s still plenty for everyone to choose from and if you don’t like where you are then just move your beds to a more convenient spot also don’t be shy in asking a life guard for a parasol as they will give it 100% to find you one as they want you and your family to be safe in the sun. They even helped us out by finding a parasol one afternoon to shade our little boy as he slept.    All your meals times and what you need to know are available in your room.    Breakfast is big and plenty with something for everyone even if your very fussy a fried egg on toast is still good but make sure you ask the lady cooking it to flip the egg over to cook it all the way through otherwise you’ll end up with a gloopy egg there are coffee/tea machines along side of a juice machine or fresh juices on ice there is also cereal and fresh fruit for the healthy kick starter in us. Lunch can be eaten outside in what I can only describe as a water mist area yes that’s right while enjoying your dinner outside in the sweltering heat your treated to a vapour mist of cold refreshing water which is fabulous if your slowly baking in the heat like I do or you can have your dinner inside in a clean ventilated well spaced area the food is light and not to much of the same stuff at tea time the seating arrangements are the same but the food is different and will tantalise your taste buds.    Also bear in mind that if you don’t want to go to the food hall at dinner time there is a big food truck up behind the pool area which serves burgers hotdogs and waffles along with soft drinks and ale (just be mindful of the wasps that seem to think that the truck is there for them and not the guests).    All the bar staff are very friendly however we had a particular favourite who looked after us as a family and our friends. Mo the waiter (aka Snoopy) was very good at looking after us and remembering all our drinks snacks or even making special mock cocktails for our young son. He was always around when needed and very attentive to our needs making our holiday great; one evening he brought over 2 very ice cold bottled waters for our son & a large bottle of sprite for the wife after our little boy was sick at dinner time & we were taking him up to the room to relax for the night around 9pm & I was even pleasantly surprised with 2 very cold beers (he said it was to carry on our drinking upstairs) whilst we looked after our little boy; nothing is too much trouble for any member of staff there.    When it comes to entertainment staff you think people who run round with loud voices annoying the crap out of you and trying to get you to do things you don’t want to do but what you get here are a group of young lads who are willing to go that extra 1000 miles further just for you yes you as a person they will entertain you talk to you remember you ask if they can join you and your family for breakfast dinner or tea and watch your child’s iPad with them or just talk to them while you enjoy your meal the Entertainment staff are fabulous beyond words and they are James Hamza Mouse Mounain Khalad Amine but I’m really sorry to say this but this next young mans name escapes me but all I can say is that he reminded my little boy of the fantastic LFC footballer “Firmino” (see enclosed 9th picture).    There are different night themes on every night BUT please remember your white clothes for the pure white party all are welcome and it’s set at the adults only pool so easy to find cause you know you never go cause you’ve always got your kids with you.    There is only one slight negative with this hotel and that’s the WiFi to get the best WiFi its in the reception area but pretty bad everywhere else but to be honest it’s not the end of the world and could give this hotel 10 stars I still would.    Remember if you have a Birthday while your there don’t try to keep it a secret (cause you won’t be able to) so let your partner tell the staff so they can sing a very very loud Happy Birthday to you and make you the centre of attention for everyone to see.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brian04062010

The food was varied and plenty to choose from including a different specialty each day. There was a food truck for burgers and waffles throughout the afternoon and a Moroccan restaurant which you could visit once in your stay. The main buffet to be honest was just as nice.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,DavidO wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Great relaxing week away,Just back from a very relaxing and enjoyable week at the Iberostar. We read all previous reviews with anticipation so now our thoughts on this pleasant hotel.  The Food is very repetitive but can’t fault it. Something for everyone and plentiful. Lovely breads salads tagines etc. The food is good and the wine is lovely both red white and rose. The quality of alcohol is very good and water coffees teas are plentiful and easily accessible all day.    The animation team are all very pleasant but do border on a bit annoying after a few days of saying ‘no thanks’ to their persistent attempts to get you to join in. I appreciate its their jobs and they do a good job of said jobs but not everyone wants to play crazy golf or aqua Zumba when instead they’d rather enjoy their book in the sun. At times it became quite invasive and was hard to find a quite spot to just enjoy the sun and space. They meant no malice just over attentive.  The large pool area is lovely with good chill out music played but it’s dangerously freezing for swimming. There is an adults only ‘zen’ pool which is heated but we didn’t find it very zen.  Cats are a pain roaming around when eating but the peacocks are very serene addition.  Our room was lovely airy and bright with a large bathroom and constant hot water. Cleaned every day and cleaners always putting rose petals and towel displays.  It is remote here and if you get easily bored just chilling make sure you book some trips. There is a free shuttle bus into Marrakech.  Evening Entertainment is very tame if not lame. It’s basically a dance troupe dancing to songs which go on far to looooong. It’s almost cringe worthy....well it is...I've been a holiday rep and had to get up there and do a full reps cabaret all be it In The late 90s and some times I was embarrassed at the stuff we presented back then but looking back we were like the Moscow ballet compared to this. It’s 30 years out of date and the animation team pass by the next day saying how wonderful it was and it’s all a bit stepford wives. DO NOT get us wrong we appreciated everything everyone did but management need to reassess which is hard as catering to so many nationalities and cultures. There’s not a lot else to do on a night so after the main 9.30 pm show which is basically dancers dancing to music we would head back to the room and watch downloads on the IPad with a few vinos. We found the WiFi ok a bit hit and Miss but on the whole pretty good.  All in all a great stay in a lovely clean hotel. We would most certainly recommend and return especially for the winter sun and relaxation.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,AndyJulie1 wrote a review Jan 2020,30,"Good, but not overwhelming...",We had wanted a quick getaway in January not too far from UK reasonable weather and good quality hotel. The Iberostar in Marrakech seemed to fit the bill and we have just concluded a six night stay.  The hotel was chosen for a number of reasons:  - All inclusive ( at extremely good value when comparing to the bed/breakfast option)  - Adults only pool  - Choice of restaurants  I will come back to these shortly.    The hotel is half an hour from central Marrakech and is serviced by a free shuttle bus which runs throughout the day. The grounds of the hotel are vast with three pools an array of activity options including trapeze(!) and children’s club. The staff are most attentive helpful and multi-lingual.    Overall our experience at Iberostar has been fair to good but our reasons for choosing this resort above have not been without compromise:  -All inclusive. Visitors should be aware this is not strictly true as the drinks menu contains free and chargeable drinks.  -Adults only pool. Pool staff did not oversee or enforce this with many families choosing to flout the rules despite the availability of excellent family and children facilities on site.  -Choice of restaurants. This comprised a main buffet a food truck for lunch and afternoon snacks and a Moroccan restaurant which was restricted to once in a vacation visit.    This has been a pleasant holiday but we would have appreciated having full facts before deciding to visit.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyJulie1

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MamaNimmy wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Bri’’’aaannnn,Amazing family holiday filled with everything we needed.  Can not fault the hotel staff location and overall experience as soon as you walk into the main reception you are welcomed with a high level of service.  We stayed in the main block and had a garden view rooms cleaned everyday to a very high standard with special touches each day. Food and drinks are lovely and we always found something to eat and drink.  We made friends with a lot of staff/ waiters but are favourite was Mo ( Snoppy); he was so attentive with us and especially with our little boy and always brought extra treats and made a special effort.  The jewel in the hotel’s crown is the entertainment team especially James Mounain and Firmino (my little boy changed his name as he looked like the LFC footballer )  Special mention Amine who embarrassed my husband everyday changing his name ( Bri’’’aaannnn) and giving him a shout out!!!  They work non stop and get everyone involved with such enthusiasm energy but understand it’s your holiday and you want to relax. We still sing the holiday song in the car and my little boy still does the dance!!!  Many thanks Iberostar Club Palmeraie we will be back for more fun games and special cocktails 🍹.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaNimmy
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michelle M wrote a review Jan 2020,50,New Year get away,Stayed here for 6 nights with our 2 teenagers over the New Year period.    The hotel is very well managed and the staff/service is 5 star. It is obvious the staff enjoy working here. Always happy smiling and making sure you’re having a nice time.    The NYE gala dinner was amazing. All food and drink in the resort was excellent. Lots of activities if you want to get involved.    A visit into Marrakech is a must. It would’ve been nice if the tour company within the hotel had information in English. We did eventually manage to book a tour with them into the Atlas Mountains which I must add was an excellent day out in a 4x4.    Overall we had an excellent experience staying at the Iberostar. A fabulous allinclusive 4star hotel with a 5star service. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. A huge credit to the staff!

Great rooms delicious food the grounds were beautiful.  The weather was good but cold at night obviously because of the time of year. Beds were lovely & comfy with plenty to do during the day with all sorts of classes & activities going on. We booked a guide to take us around the city to all the focal points of interest! The staff were very helpful and happy to accommodate. I would definitely go back to the Iberostar Palmeraie as it was spotlessly clean.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,WonderJones wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Wonderful resort,Stayed here for a week in January. Lots of activities to do during the day: archery trapeze boules table tennis spinning... plus a small gym which was suitable for a decent workout.    The food was lovely. Yes it was a little repetitive however there were so many things to choose from- you could eat something different most days. I’m also vegetarian and had a great selection    All the staff were fantastic. Reception staff were always helpful and helped us with phone calls on a few occasions. I also used the spa. The hammam was amazing! I loved it and went twice. Meena and Amina were fantastic. The waiters and animation team were also superb    A few negatives- a little more info about things going on in the bar would have been good. We missed bingo and games night as we didn’t know it was happening! Perhaps some pool tables or something else to do in the evening if you didn’t want to watch the entertainment.    If you’re a light sleeper bring some ear plugs. Lots of noises during the night.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WonderJones
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,399Debbie129 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Five Day Stay,Just returned from 5 days at this hotel and had a fantastic time. The hotel is excellent and service/staff five star. Check-in was quick and professional and our room was changed after a request that the original room smelt strongly of cigarette smoke. Rooms are clean and beds very comfortable. The food in the main self-service restaurant is excellent - lots of choice and lovely fresh food often cooked in front of you. Different choices each night - we especially loved the sushi raw tuna and prawns. The salads were delicious too. We ate one night in the Moroccan restaurant which you can only do once during your stay. There was a bit of confusion about booking it as was originally told it was fully booked and open only three nights a week but we managed to get a booking on Friday evening. The restaurant is lovely with very attentive staff. Sadly we thought the food was lack-lustre. Much preferred the standard served in the self-service restaurant. The hotel wasn't busy when we went so it was nice not to have to queue for food and it wasn't noisy which this kind of restaurant often is.  There is loads to do in the hotel - archery high wire trapeze spinning zumba salsa cooking class - and a different show each night. The entertainment team are excellent and very professional. The gym was a real disappointment - two out of the three running machines didn't work neither did one of the bikes and step machines.,Date of stay: January 2020,,"Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399Debbie129
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,angdrusso wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Excellent Christmas Week,We arrived on 22 December to this wonderful resort. The reception staff were very attentive when we arrived. Initially we had a drink in the bar and then headed to our room. Our initial room was on the ground floor however after speaking to the reception staff we were moved to a 1st floor room. The staff at this hotel were all amazing. They were all friendly and attentive. Nothing was too much trouble. The food was varied. Live cooking on 2/3 stations each night. Chocolate fountain breakfast lunch and dinner! The pastries/cakes were supberb. I can not faults the food at all. The local Rose and beer was good. As were the local gin and barcardi! Evening entertainment was varied at the bar area before dinner with quizzes most evenings and a casino one evening too!    The adults only pool was accessible to children during the time we were there as it was the only heated pool at the resort. However they would not tolerate noisy children or jumping in!    A special mention to Katie (animation team) and Zalar (Zen Pool) who were amazing and really looked after us for the whole week!,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angdrusso
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jacqui wrote a review Jan 2020,40,"Great hotel, family friendly, plenty to do!",First time in an all inclusive to Morocco. The grounds are huge so enough space to run/walk they have a basketball court football pitch 2 x tennis courts 2 table tennis tables archery trapeze swing (a highlight!) outdoor spinning/dancing 3 pools beach volleyball animals to feed (goats chickens sheep etc). We had a 12 and 6 year old and enough to do for them and the adults. The large pool was far too cold but kids were allowed in the heated 'adult' pool as long as they weren't too noisy. Kids were allowed to roam around freely as they complex is enclosed and safe. Food was great especially the range of vegetables and vegetarian food (i'm not vegetarian!). Staff were lovely and entertainment great. They made a massive effort on New Year Eve. Free bus to Marrakesh and back (a must if you go here!) Only downside is that the room was cold! I guess this is because they are usually so hot in the summer months. But we will definitely go back.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquiYS

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,BriDo wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Great Hotel & Great Staff,Wonderful Hotel and equally wonderful staff make this a great place to stay. Arriving late we were shown to the restaurant where we had a late bite to eat and drink then shown to our room by a member of staff.  The staff on this hotel are probably the most friendliest people I have met in all my travels always smiling and polite the Animation team are always happy but never pressure you to participate Khalid was a great member of this team as they all are I got to know all them all by the end of the week whilst I was there although not really my thing I did a few activities wonderful to watch the kids (and some Adults) trying the Trapeze again the staff look professional and really look after their participants. Waiting staff and bar staff also very friendly never a moan or a problem from them spacial mention to Muhammid & Salah & Leliaih going the extra mile to make us feel welcome also the Pool Lifeguard at the Zen pool very friendly the staff in the Burger van were also always pleasant always high fiving me even when they met me within the grounds and looked like they enjoyed their job This was our First time in Morocco and not the last.  We had the pleasure of being there for the New Years eve Dinner Gala this was wonderful from a champagne reception to the most exquisite buffet meal with live music followed by an evening of entertainment in the Theatre.  The Moroccan evening was also excellent with live musicians.  My only complaint is that the heated pool was a bit on the cold side.  Shuttle bus into Marrakesh was no problem and nice to visit the traders were not that pushy as I expected them to be. We were in room 1122 2 Adults and 1 teenager daughter spacious enough for us occasional noise from people going back from the bar but nothing much to complain about apart from that pretty quiet.  There are a few cats in the hotel and grounds my wife who is petrified of cats seemed ok as they do no harm the pool Guy at the Zen pool took the cat away for the duration of our stay at the request of another guest.  Well done to ALL the staff at the Iberostar keeping up their standards and making us feel most welcome in Morocco they are all a real credit to Morocco and the Hotel.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandJ3357FF

Wide variety of food up to you if you eat the same thingeveryday but definitley not required. Room was good. the entertainment team were good. on the first two days in the bar at around 7pm they do a mini fun section first night was casio games and the second a movie theme quiz and we had high expectations then sadly on the next 3 nights it was a managers cocktail party twice and dancing to the keyboard player..hmmm not our cup of tea and the main reason why im not giving it 5 stars. enjoyed walkign around the complex every day.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,RWandSW wrote a review Jan 2020,40,"Good stay, most staff were great",Our stay started badly one of the handles of a new suitcase was damaged by the porters (taking it from the taxi to inside the hotel) and they kept this away from our other three suitcases in the reception area. Initially I thought they missed a suitcase and went back to the taxi because it was not on the trolley but they had quickly put this inside to hide that the handle was damaged by them.    The whole check-in process took nearly 45 minutes you have to fill in a form and they provide your wristbands to show that you are staying ‘all-inclusive’; staff were trying be efficient and dealing with different groups of people at the same but in reality seemed ‘lost’ and ‘confused’. It took nearly 30 minutes and most of it was waiting (it took staff five minutes to provide with us with penda) front desk wanted an email confirmation of our stay even though they had the details from British Airways; the WiFi was so slow that it took me 15 minutes to send an email which they did not receive (the WiFi was generally bad in the reception area during our stay) they finally gave-up and said if they need it they will request it. My advice would be to take a print out of the confirmation or email it to the hotel before arriving.  It was raining when we arrived and it was not ideal to show around the hotel but some basic information would have been appreciated; during our stay we saw some people being shown around the hotel (inside and outside).      Our room was facing the outer garden of the hotel we had booked a garden-view room which can be facing the main garden depending on the room you are given we were in room 1129 (first floor); all the even number rooms in the main hotel building face the interior garden or are pool-view rooms.  The room and bathroom were a good size too; there is a small balcony where one can smoke or leave clothes out to dry. The double bed was actually two single beds put together with separate bedding for each and we found the beds stiff there was a travel cot (similar to what we have at home) and a comfortable sofa; the wardrobe space is ok for a couple but for families it was tight although there was a lot of table space and we used one section of it as a nappy changing area and there is a small fridge in the room which we mainly used for water.  The WiFi was very poor in the room and would only work continuously early in the morning or late at night the TV only had a few English new channels but you can request reception to get someone to open the block channels. The shower was powerful with warm water almost all the time but the area was small and slippery a hair dryer is provided but no robe or slippers there was an issue with the shower fan because the glass and mirror would always steam up and the bathroom doors did not lock (you could only close them).    The hotel has a lot of space near the rooms on the first floor they had several small break-out areas with seating and they had the best WiFi signals in the hotel; the reception area was quite large and you can spend some time away from your room there there was a TV room that was not busy and they had a lot of channels available and near the bar there was a lot of space.  The garden area is not that big considering the hotel size they have plenty of seating; I found the two shops very expensive one shop was selling drinks/snacks and swimwear while the other was selling goods (leather goods souvenirs gifts like tea-sets etc).  The main pool and kids’ pool are near each other near the kids’ pool was a club room (star club) for young children with activities on an hourly basis; the adults’ pool was further away and had a small bar. The main pool was a nice quite area to get some ‘sun’ and no one used the pool the adults’ pool was the noisy area with people using the pool; the kids’ pool was quiet but that was expected as we were visiting outside of school holiday period. After the main pool if you walk towards the adults’ pool there have the sports area where one can play different sports or take part in activities.    I exchanged currency at the front desk as I ran out of Dirhams as we got some photos printed and they would only take cash the exchange was 12.57 Dirham for £1; if have Euros at home it is worth bringing with you as the photographers at the hotel take Euros or Dirhams plus at Marrakech airport shops prefer Euros (the Starbucks was more expensive if paying in Dirhams while the restaurant opposite was not).  In the reception area they have a desk area for paid excursions; they had a variety of tours from guided tours of the Marrakech to ten-hour day tours. At the front desk they have details of the hotel shuttle to the Medina with times of arrival and departure – a guest we met during the stay said the shuttle runs on time he missed it away times by five minutes.    Breakfast lunch and dinner is served in the same dining area during their respective hours; most of the time the food was the same or similar; for example they would have fries every lunch and dinner they would have several potato dishes three/four different rice dishes different pizzas couscous Moroccan sausages and Moroccan fish dish varied at lunch and night. They had certain things that changed one dinner they would be making burgers another roast chicken etc; sometimes they would have non-Halal food but it was clearly marked for example bacon rashers for breakfast and one evening they had roast pork.  By the end of the week it did get a bit boring with the food options but that is where maybe it worth eating at the Moroccan restaurant on a Monday (if you staying for a week) and on Thursday the hotel has a Moroccan night in the main dining area (and evening show) and in between try the other dishes plus they have so many salad options.    If you have a sweet tooth they had a large variety of items on their dessert station; at least a dozen different cakes meringues four flavours of ice creams and on Moroccan night they serve biscuits. Towards the back of the dining area there is a drinks station for soft drinks beer and wine; the soft drinks were not ‘watered-down’ and they had Coca Cola Coca Cola Zero Sprite and orange Fanta but the latter did tasted similar to orange Marinda.    At the start of dining area they had a special station that varied during the meal times; the dinner options were nicer compare to breakfast and lunch; they had fresh crepes twice savoury crepe chicken sharwarma sushi seafood and on Thursday which is Moroccan night they had Moroccan lamb.    If you wish you can dine outside as well; just bring your food to your table and they had staff that specifically dealt with people dining outside to enjoy tables were cleaned regularly.    The food truck operated between 12pm to 6pm during our stay they serve food (burgers hotdogs and pizzas) desserts (pre-made crepes waffles and pancakes) soft drinks hot drinks and beer; the food truck is near the main pool staff were always friendly and there is seating with tables and table umbrellas near the truck. The burger was nice hotdog was ok the pizza varies daily and the one I tried was decent; however as the desserts were pre-made they were not great but ok considering it is not from the main restaurant. We did not have breakfast some days and the food truck was useful in-between lunch and dinner; if we missed breakfast we would have lunch as soon as it opens have something from the food truck around 4/5pm and then have a latter dinner.    We did not get a chance to eat at the Moroccan restaurant (where guests can dine once during their stay); I tried to book the restaurant towards the end of our stay (Thursday) but was unavailable until Sunday while we were checking-out on Saturday. The restaurant is closed on Thursdays because the main restaurant has a Moroccan night and a large group had booked the restaurant for Friday evening.    Sometimes members of the animation would ask to dine with us I did not have an issue with it and thought it was nice to speak to the staff whereas the other-half was not fond of it; the request was not pushy some people said no and the staff member did not persist and on a few occasions we dined with other guests in the hotel that we met during our stay.    The animation team dining room food truck and bar staff were brilliant; they all went above-and-beyond during our stay; I hope the hotel management appreciate the work they are doing. A lot of the staff spoke several languages although I would say French is the first language of the hotel followed by Arabic. The staff were friendly and loved playing with our son he enjoyed it so much that he would cause issues at night because he did not want to sleep and wanted to spend time with the hotel staff.    House-keeping was hit-and-miss and mostly the letter a few times they forgot to clean our room and we had to request our room to be cleaned and when they cleaned the room they would always be something missing not provided new towels no toilet roll provided or no new toiletries. Twice during our stay after having breakfast we came back to a room with a strong bleach spell and had to open the balcony and windows to get the smell out.    Every night at 9:30pm they had a show near the main pool you need to follow the stairs down and there a theatre with a small bar; they shows varied from Brazil show pop night karaoke and Moroccan night. Dinner service was until 9:30pm during our stay although there was always a few people eating until 10pm; staff would come around during dinner service and promote the evening show; however I think they should start their shows at 10pm to allow diners to have their evening meal and then see a show because the timings put some people off and they would rather spend time in the bar instead. The shows were decent sometimes these types of shows can be quite cheesy the dance team put on a good show and on Thursday they had acrobats during the Moroccan show.  Some reviews mention a White party during the warmer months this is near the main pool but during the colder months this is done in the hotel lobby. I thought the ‘party’ would be longer than expected maybe during the warmer months it runs on for longer they have a bar with the only alcoholic drinks available being the free ones with the all-inclusive package    The check-out process was simple but I had to go reception to ask for a porter when I had called twenty minutes earlier and was told a porter would be sent straight-away; when I went to reception the porter was at the main entrance talking to another staff member.    Overall a very good stay; for the animation and catering staff alone I would have given ten out of five a shame some shortcomings by the hotel. I would recommendation the resort we are planning a holiday here next year because son enjoyed himself so much and the resort caters for all (couples young families friends and older travellers); although we would venture outside the resort next time to places like the Medina and Atlas mountains there are four or five quad biking locations within 500 metres of the resort as well.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RWandSW

Staff are so friendly always stop to talk to you if you want and cannot do enough for you.    Had the Berber Hammam which cost about £40 which I think is a great deal.    Couple of little shops on site but if you smoke watch out they don’t sell cigarettes.    Could change money at the reception for a good rate and they had a cash machine.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Alice wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Ideal Luxury Retreat Close to the Palmeraie and City Centre That Won't Break the Bank,The good:  - breakfast lunch and dinner were amazing and probably the highlight of our stay as there was a lot of variety food was always well cooked and you could ask for your eggs to be cooked to your taste (including seasonings) and the times that food was available in our all-inclusive package was perfect for our stay (we were out and about ALOT in the Medina quad biking etc.)    - the premises are huge! we were there for 4 nights and didn't even get to explore the whole area and would describe the area more as a resort as it has everything you could ever need including activities like traditional Moroccan cooking classes entertainment in the evening playing afrobeats etc.    - the free bus in and out of the city centre was extremely helpful but it was also good that there were always loads of taxis out as we travelled into the city often at all times when the bus wasn't running.    - the rooms were spacious with ample storage and we loved the bathrooms and small toiletries although a shower cap would have been useful (minor point) and all the small communal areas dotted around the hallways.    - the spa treatments were great and we were happy that all six of us could be accommodated on the same day but it would be great if they could accept card or find a way to add to hotel tab for payment.    - last but not least the staff were AMAZING! One thing which can make or break a trip for me is the level of customer service and here it was truly above average from the small things such as the reception staff remembering all six of our names to the Manager and Assistant Manager arranging a birthday cake and bottle of champagne for free for our friend's birthday - can't    Things that can possibly be improved (if we're nit-picking!):    - perhaps making the bus schedule more frequent? Albeit we travelled in winter so assume that this may be the case during the busier summer months    - There is really good soundproofing between the rooms (we couldn't hear our neighbours on either side at all) but if anyone is making noise in the hallway it is quite easy to hear them through the door,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alice_TravelConnect

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sunayna wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Unforgettable experience,Can’t praise Iberostar club palmeraie enough for such a wonderful stay. We went with friends and our 7 year and 8 year olds who had a great time at the kids club. There is lots to do at the hotel. We enjoyed Darts Archery Table Tennis Basketball Cooking classes to name a few. The lounge and Bar area was perfect place to relax and play games as well. The staff at the Bar were very nice and served with a smile always. Had some great Morrocon mint tea here everyday. The Restaurant had good food choices ranging from traditional Morrocon to Sushi and Paella and lots of continental choices. Again the restaurant staff were amazing and never let your glasses go empty. Always helpful and serving you with a smile. The entertainment at the hotel was very good. They had themed nights every evening and it was very enjoyable. The entertainment staff made sure we had a great time and also made sure all the guests danced along and had fun. The hotel facilities were great with a spa 3 swimming pools relaxing seating around the pool and a food truck serving snacks and drinks. The resort has a lovely walking track taking you through a pond farm and activity areas. The shuttle service to and from the city was very convenient.    Overall we had an unforgettable trip and would love to go back. Thanks to all the lovely staff at Iberostar Club Palmarie Marrakech for being so hospitable.

We were welcomed from the start to the finish of our visit. The room we had was spacious and well appointed with a balcony with garden access.  The variety of food and drinks even this late in the year was outstanding and the service was great with the staff being very helpful getting drinks etc when we sat around the pool.  The hotel was spotless inside and outside I cannot fault the hotel.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ValerieandRoy wrote a review Dec 2019,50,SECOND STAY AS GOOD AS FIRST,"We had previously stayed at the hotel in November 2017 and made a return visit in November of this year.    As on our previous visit we found the staff to be really friendly and helpful.    Food was very good and always a good choice as well. Breakfast was really lovely. It was nice that you could either sit inside or out to eat - mainly at lunchtime as it could get quite chilly in the evening.    The food truck provided lovely food if you didn't wish to venture to the restaurant for lunch - burgers baguettes and then later in the afternoon waffles crepes and delicious doughnuts (didn't worry about calories as we were on holiday).    We had met a few lovely young gentlemen on our previous visit and were delighted to see that they were still there. We also met some who weren't there on our previous stay.    Our room was kept immaculate and the young lady who was responsible for keeping it clean and tidy always greeted us with a smile each morning.    As stated we were really pleased to see the following young gentlemen again:-    Mohammed Faisal and Abdou all of them were brilliant and a real delight to deal with.    We feel a special mention must be made to Mohammed who really took care of us throughout our stay and we felt that when we were leaving we had made a new friend - such a lovely young man and he is a real asset o the hotel.    The other member of staff we must mention is Aimad - this young man was really pleasant and always smiling and had time to have a chat and he called us his ""mum and dad"".    We hope to return to this beautiful hotel for a third stay in the future and would like to thank all the staff for making our second stay just as memorable as our first.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,perryburns wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Lovely hotel. Shame about the location,We chose this hotel because it was recommended as part of a BA package. And it is a fabulous hotel although the staff are a bit offhand and they make you wear a wrist bracelet to indicate your meal entitlement status. But it's a long way out of town and they're is nothing nearby. If you don't use the free shuttle it will cost 150-200DH (£12-£15) each for a taxi depending on your negotiating skills. Also be aware that the property is huge and if you are in building 2 it will take a good 5 minutes to walk to the main complex.  The breakfast though is fabulous.  If we were to come again we without pay more and stay in town.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perryburns

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Aaron B wrote a review Dec 2019,40,"Great Holiday, Amazing staff",We stayed for 10 nights back in October after a friend recommended the hotel. On arrival the staff were very welcoming our room the hotel in general and the grounds are well maintained and very clean. The food throughout our stay was a good standard good this included the food truck which we used throughout the say for drinks and snacks. The food was good quality but did sometimes get repetitive hence the rating of 4 out of 5 stars. what really made our holiday great was the hotel staff. This was our first Iberostar experience and we were extremely impressed with how attentive all the hotel staff were. The animation team put a lot of effort into making sure everyone has a great holiday throughout the day there is a range of activities on offer and on an evening there is entertainment. The shows on an evening were very entertaining and its clear that the performers and animation team put a lot of effort in to ensuring guests have a great time. The hotel also puts on a white party weekly they go all out with decorations and entertainment making it a great night. The main restaurant has an outside seating area which we personally preferred to the inside area as it had more of a restaurant atmosphere the service was good but we would like to specifically mention Abdflaziz and Androui who both went out of there way to ensure that we had a great dining experience. We would also like to mention Yasine Khalid and Hamid specifically from the animation team they really did make the holiday memorable. On our last day Yasine even woke up early and came to reception to say bye despite it being his day off. Thanks for a great holiday we would definite recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Bradford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abudwal
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,DayTrip824692 wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Fantastic place to relax and unwind.,Too difficult to single-out individuals but staff was excellent. Check - in was easy as receptionists (and rest of staff) speak lots of languages.  We were especially fortunate to have great weather in December. Tried as we might we failed to spot a Moroccan cloud all week!  The facilities were very good indeed - petang volleyball football gym outdoor spinning and the trapeze to name but a few. Sports' staff 'encourage' you to take part but are not offended if you decline. It is however recommended that you do as you need to burn off some calories acquired from the amazing food on offer! Some reviews describe the meals as repetitive but I would say that that is only so if you allow it! There is so much choice that you need to select you meal sensibly but every night has a different theme so there are always exciting new treats to try! We loved the sushi and the 'La Mer' events.,Date of stay: December 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip824692

All the staff were very friendly welcoming and accommodating. They were always smiling and nothing was too much trouble.    The whole place was kept clean especially the restaurants. There was a wide selection of food and lots of activities to keep one from getting bored. A shuttle service is available if you need to go to the souk for some retail therapy.    I really enjoyed the hammam and massage. The massage was specifically designed for my needs and everything was explained.    Special mention to the animation staff particularly Said who mans to booth for the pool towels and racket sports equiptment and Yassine who answered all our never ending questions. Both kept us company during lunch and dinner. My husband and I really enjoyed our conversations! Hamid who patiently looked for the wild arrows during archery!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Explore with Ethan wrote a review Dec 2019,50,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at (and I travel A LOT!),I honestly can not recommend this hotel highly enough. I have never been to a hotel where every member of staff I interacted with was genuine and friendly.    I travel monthly and have visited 58 countries and honestly this is an incredible hotel.    The only slight compliant I have was regarding the difficulty contacting the hotel ahead of our staff. It was my fiancé's birthday celebration and sadly I wasn't able to organise anything special for him. I tried speaking to a few members of staff but I was never able to get anything sorted. It wasn't a huge issue as we were only there for two nights.    The hotel has so many amazing activities from a trapeze bowls archery darts salsa classes and three lovely pools. We visited during winter so the large pool was very cold however the Zen pool was lovely (sorry for being noisy messing around) and there was a separate children's (heated in winter) splash area.    The food was incredible. So many traditional dishes and each tasted lovely. The desserts were incredible. Often buffet desserts look better than they taste but not here both presentation and taste were incredible.    What makes this resort so special is the staff. Every member of staff was incredible and took the time to interact with us. I have a huge shout out to those below who made our short trip very special;    Khalid  Abdou  Faissal  Yassoul    The hotel offers a shuttle service to the city centre for free. I highly recommend staying here instead of the city centre. The city is very busy smelly and I was nearly robbed. It's an interesting experience but for us it was nice to visit for an afternoon but that's it.    I've created a vlog of the hotel which shows far more detail so please feel free to search for Beckyboos Travel Adventures or the name of the hotel and it should come up.    You will not be disappointed if you book this hotel. We'll see you again next year.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Hornchurch, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExplorewithEthan

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Karl L wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Best holiday this year,We took a break to this sunny and charming hotel. The staff were AMAZING. The service was faultless and the food is always plentiful and varied. The in house local restaurant is not to be missed.  There is plenty of water and the hotel water is ok to drink.  The pool good and the hotel is well organised.  The bad bits were small and easily fixable:  - Wi-Fi is bad. Buy a SIM data card beforehand  - the hot water is warm  - there are too many paper cups used but single use plastic use is minimal  However the entertainment staff are engaging and their enthusiasm made the holiday the best this year. Kati Karina Khalid Osman Yassin Simo Saieed made the holiday for us and gave us so many memories. They work so hard and their upbeat demeanour is contagious!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Tim B wrote a review Dec 2019,40,"Nice hotel, great facilities, poor wifi, noisy",We stayed here as a family of four in three separate rooms. Parents arrived a few days before and had to move rooms because of the late night noise of drunks shouting and throwing up in the corridors. Echoey corridors and thin walls don’t help matters. Try not to stay in the main building there are other buildings on the hotel compound that are quieter. Check in was very average staff not really with it. Had to fill out a form to check in but wasn’t told why. I also had to email my reservation to them while they waited because I didn’t bring a print out (who brings print outs anymore?!) Hotel is nice large with good restaurants - more on that later. The noise can be quite bad at night if it’s not the loud constant noise of dogs barking or cats meowing it’s the sound of party goers. I suppose that’s what you get when it’s all inclusive. The all inclusive package is pretty good the food for the most part was excellent with different themes each evening. Alcohol is included but only local beer on tap and a few cocktails - better than nothing. Staff are friendly and the evening entertainment is fine but can feel much like a cheesy holiday camp rather than a fancy hotel.    Wifi connection was a real issue. Couldn’t even load a webpage in my room or anywhere else in the hotel. But the parents had a great connection so it’s quite strange how it works. The only way I could get a connection was to use a VPN.    Hotel facilities are great. Three pools archery darts table tennis boules and many other activities available. We had a great time playing boules when it wasn’t flooded by the rain! Overall a good hotel albeit spoilt by some tacky entertainment and attracting those that drink a bit too much.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4833GVtimb

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,A Prince wrote a review Dec 2019,50,Beautiful hotel!,My partner and I stayed from the 23rd-30th of November. When we first arrived we were greeted by the hotel receptionist staff with traditional Moroccan tea. The first impressions of the hotel were amazing! The lobby is so beautiful!  After we filled out our details and were all checked in we were shown to our room. We were on the bottom floor looking out to the Zen Pool. The room was very nice and very clean.    The breakfast was a mixture of food mostly French and Moroccan cuisine. This consisted of bacon omelettes crepes sausages sauteed potatoes pastries etc. There was a range of freshly squeezed juices (orange cucumber grapefruit etc.).  The lunch consisted of pizza chips pasta LOTS of fresh bread cheeses salad paella and of course Moroccan foods (e.g. couscous lentils etc).  The dinner varied from night to night. On one night for example they had a sushi night which tasted so good; and they also had a seafood night where they cooked fresh prawns mussels and langoustines! They do have the main dishes that they cook everyday e.g. paella chips pizza etc. For those that aren't as adventurous.  There is also an a-la-carte restaurant where they served us a lovely salad and mezze for starters followed by a tagine of beef or fish and then a fruit salad and a range of moroccan biscuits and cakes for dessert.  During the afternoon there is a food truck located by the main pool where they serve fresh crepes burgers hotdogs pizza doughnuts etc. So safe to say we were never hungry! Also loads of veggie options which was fab!    Overall I can say that the food was very flavorsome and diverse! There was always something new to try.    There was a range of drinks and cocktails to try and at dinner and lunch all the wine you could dream of.  There were three pools. The adult-only pool was our favourite as it was heated and right next to the bar. The main pool was fairly large but ice cold! There was also a pool for kids as well which looked really fun!  There were endless activities to try during the day such as tennis trapeze volleyball etc. During the evening there was entertainment which was very fun and enjoyable. There is also an underground nightclub which is a decent size.    There is a free shuttle bus service that takes you from the hotel to either the medina or the gardens in Marrakesh. My only advice to people travelling on this shuttle is that when you get off in the city centre be careful of 'tour guides' standing by the bus stop offering to take you to the Medina. They will charge you extortionate prices and not tell you that you have to pay initatially so you are under the impression that they are part of the hotel. We made that mistake as the bus driver told us that these people standing by the bus stop were part of the hotel service. The man showed us around the medina and then after insisted we pay him around 400 dirham in which he showed us to the ATM and stood by us while we took the money out to pay him. Subsequently we told the hotel about this and they immediately apologised and gave us our money back in less than 24 hours which we were extremely impressed and grateful about.    The hotel is honestly a beautiful one. But the staff are what make it even more special. I'd like to personally thank Salah one of the bartenders at the zen pool and all of the animation team especially the trapeze guy! All of the staff are friendly and accommodating and made our holiday at this resort one to remember!    We will definitely be back and would 100% recommend staying at this hotel!,Date of stay: November 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprince97

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Natalie wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Fantastic,Just returned from a 5 day stay here and all I can say is that I loved it! Please focus on the positive reviews of this hotel over the negatives.    Arrival: we arrived at about 2100 and were greeted and checked in by the lovely reception staff. Our luggage was taken from us and we were shown where to get some dinner before it shut. There was no delays in checking in however there were only 3 people arriving at this time. Understandably I imagine it can get a bit hectic if a huge bus full of people arrive at the same time!    Hotel: the hotel is impeccable. Very clean and well looked after. The grounds are beautiful and it’s well worth having a lovely walk round in the morning to get your bearings and see what the hotel has to offer.    Room: our room was perfect very comfortable and everything we needed (except a kettle actually. If this bothers you take your own!) little fridge that had a bottle of water in for our arrival. Further bottles can be collected from the bar as and when required. The room was cleaned daily and the cleaning lady we saw frequently was lovely (sorry I didn’t catch her name!) yes the beds are two doubles pushed together but that didn’t matter to either of us.    Entertainment: the entertainment staff are just incredible. They go above and beyond for every single guest and make efforts to talk to you throughout the day. Yes french may be the primary language however they all do speak English although perhaps a little broken. That doesn’t matter though make the effort to learn a little french/Arabic and you’ll get by just fine! We had no issues with language barriers whatsoever. As expected it just takes a little bit of time to communicate- you surely can’t travel to a different country and expect everyone to speak your language!!    Food/alcohol: no complaints here really. I guess it does get a little boring if you’re eating there all the time but there is so much choice you could eat something different every single day. They appeared to have a “speciality” every evening from kebabs to fish and paella. The alcohol is all local from what I could see minimal options to buy premium if that’s something you’re after. The local beer is good!    Staff: it’s the staff that make this place so special. We made friends with many of them and they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is everything you want it to be. Hamza (entertainment) was lovely made us laugh multiple times a day and encouraged us to take part in the games and sports that they had on during the day. Abdou (probably spelt wrong) was equally lovely endures we were enjoying ourselves and gave recommendations on what we could do inside and outside of the hotel. Aimad at the bar could not do enough for us ensuring we had drinks at all times and remembering exactly what we both liked to drink and preparing it for us when he saw us waiting at the bar.    Whilst here I suffered a bad bout of what I can only assume was gastroenteritis. The reception staff ensured the nurse gave me some medication to help me feel better and checked up on me a few times during the day. The day after the cleaner came and blitzed the room and also asked multiple times if I was feeling better. Although being poorly on holiday isn’t ever ideal I felt properly looked after.    It’s difficult to ignore bad reviews but please look at the positives they hugely outweigh the negatives. Yes the WiFi is poor but who goes on holiday to spend their time on Facebook anyway?    Highly recommend a trip to the medina be prepared for it be an ultimate sensory overload and make sure you stay safe.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trippinat
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Cas wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Wife’s 50th Birthday Surprise,Stayed here from 24 -27 Nov as a surprise for my wife’s Birthday.    Upon arrival we were greeted by the friendly staff and given an arrivals brief.  Our room was clean and tidy and a good size.    The heated pool is very popular at this time year because it’s heated and the larger pool was so cold. The heated pool is the “quiet” area so our party were asked to move for being to load. The fact that we were only chatting and laughing did annoy me at first but tbh the larger had a better atmosphere around as they have music playing and its were the entertainment team perform and do the organised activities which suited us better.    There is plenty to do during the day French Bowls Table Tennis Badminton and volleyball. The entertainment team also put on other events darts archery and Trapeze as well as cooking demonstrations and pool side dancing. They always asked if you wanted to take part but were never too pushy they knew when to stop asking.    The entertainment in the evening was well organised. The main bar area had a pianist and a quiz whilst the theatre had the main show with dancing.    The food in the restaurant was very nice with a large selection. Although i did struggle at breakfast to find something i liked ended up with eggs most mornings.    Overall a very enjoyable stay at a very nice hotel.    NEGATIVES    The location of the room wasn’t the best as we were out facing and separated from our group. Outside the hotel grounds were a group of dogs that barked a lot and keep me awake. If i was staying for longer i would have asked to be moved.    No tea or coffee making facility in the room. You could get a cup from the restaurant but the water from the machine was only luke warm.    The free WiFi was rubbish.... far too slow.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caspots
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Shelby1510 wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Amazing break at the Iberostar,Been meaning to write this review for a while. We stayed here in October. Myself and daughter and two sons. Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely young man who made sure check in was straight forward we were offered a room to change as our rooms were not ready. Rooms were beautiful clean and spacious our lovely cleaning lady made sure of that.  The hotel itself was always lovely and clean the staff there work so hard to make sure everything is perfect. I fell ill when then and saw a nurse within 10 mins of asking. The food is amazing they cater for everyone themed nights every day and a good selection of gluten free food which made my daughter very happy. When asked about what she could and couldn’t eat the Chef come out and explained everything to her and said he could make anything she wanted. There are 3 pools we only used the main one which was chilly to swim in but was also the best for keeping us amused we loved the different genres of music that was played with many oldies coming out. We got involved with some  Of the games that the animation team put on which is something I never thought we would do. This was mainly to the persuasive nature of the animation team 😁 the bar staff were all so friendly too in fact I don’t think I saw anyone without a smile on their face.  The animation team are amazing and work so hard keeping everyone entertained they made our holiday even better with their wit charm and shows every night.... the dancers were fab! We have to mention Khalid (who had us in stitches) we never got the chance to say goodbye and thank him. Said Yusuf Ayuub (I think) and the head of the animation team Medhi he was so good at what he did and his accents were brilliant he also gave us a good recommendation for a restaurant in the Medina. He and his team got us all up dancing to the cheesy club dances each night and kept an eye out for us. I know there are names I have forgotten and I apologise. Every single person at that hotel goes above and beyond to making sure the stay there was great! I would definitely go back and recommend it to everyone. Make sure you pack something white for the white party!,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelby1510
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Vallin M wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Great place to chill and enjoy Marrakech,I took a week’s break to relax and enjoy my wife’s birthday in Marrakech. The Iberostar hotel was clean with well maintained grounds. Check in was quick with their multilingual staff. French and English were the two main languages spoken. Please bring your own face flannel and cream as none was provided. We thoroughly enjoyed Moroccan cuisine and will be trying our hands using the Tagine cooking pot bought in the souk. There was a variety of dishes for every palate and we were pleased that Iberostar provided authentic Moroccan dishes. Although it was all inclusive with beers adequate wine etc do not expect premium/brand liquor. For the price it was good value for money. Entertainment was average but the white night party was very good. Main pool was freezing at this time of the year even though the temperature was a pleasant 20-25 degrees during the day. It gets chilly at nights. Credit to the hotel for providing a courtesy bus throughout the day right up to 10:30 pm for trips to the City centre/souks. It’s takes about 20 minutes. No visit would be completed without experiencing the hustle and bustle of the Médina Jama El f’na square to barter and buy stuff in souks. The hotel will also organise day trips to the Atlas mountain for breathtaking views and then down to the fertile value to see how native Aragon oil is made. It also gives you a chance to see how ordinary people live.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vallinm2013

Room large and kept very clean. Super shower. Grounds are wonderful. Very well kept and loads to do. Tennis football mini golf and even a trapeze 😊 The entertainment staff are fantastic.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,deano_lfc wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Made by the staff...,From check in to departure the staff are king!  I’ve been to some of the best 5 star resorts but you can’t buy friendliness and genuineness in staff! Me and my wife needed a short week away originally booked a 5 star all inclusive in Turkey but Thomas Cook went bust so this was very last minute..but so happy we chose here.    Positives:  Zen Pool adults only - kids quickly ejected Yay! And at the Zen Pool you’ll meet “Salah” who has to be one of Thee best bar:pool staff I’ve seen in twenty years of travel an absolute star!! This guy needs a major pay-rise as he single handily remembers everyone’s drink make sure they’re always topped up with a smile on his face and a genuineness to people in nearly every language!!  The food at the restaurant is fantastic fresh hot tasty and authentic...stay Moroccan it’s first class!  The animation staff are literally the best I’ve ever seen I played football twice and did some golf competition but they always try to get you involved and are so genuine spending time with you!  The grounds are stunning make sure you walk the full length around to see the peacocks baby goats rabbits and unreal birds like bulbuls and woodpeckers.  We also had a Hammam spa which was really nice and the staff were really good - highly recommend if like us you need to seriously chill.  The free shuttle bus to town is great  we did the YSL Gardens and museum which is awesome and they drop you on the way.  Cleaners do a good job of cleaning your room (however please read negatives for noise)..  The “Moroccan” restaurant that you can book on to is a nice experience but personally the food in the buffet is better.    Negatives:  Room noise - we had a garden view room and sadly in the middle of the night I awoke to think that a dog howling drunk people a man being sick (room above) the call to prayer the cockerel the cleaners (in the day they are soooooo loud you ain’t getting any siesta) was in my room...seriously guys...sort out the room noise (windows and sound proof doors you could earn 5 stars).    I was so disappointed I couldn’t have my daytime naps because the cleaners in the day literally shout down and up the halls at each other.  The cleaners are brilliant but please realise people come on holiday to rest and charge their batteries - I had stupid drunken neighbours so then couldn’t sleep in the day (also had maintenance work above one day which the reception did not do much to help me with when I told them of my insomnia)  - why have a fridge : mini bar in the room if you are not going to put some beer water & soft drinks in it? Really poor and is a must for 5 star!    Hey these basic things sorted and I’ll be back a lot!

Food was different but I did enjoy it my partner enjoyed it more than me. However I loved the pool snack bar (bus). Entertainment was ok some nights better than others. Nightclub was ok smelt a bit like the toilets. I think if this issue was fixed more people would’ve gone. Not much to do in the day. Pool life was a bit boring. Main pool is FREEZING took a bit to get used to but it was no problem. Staff were lovely especially Abdul Jamal and the guy who runs the entertainment.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,David R wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Safe haven,Had a three night stay and loved it as a safe intro to Morocco. Loved the food with much choice and lots of seating areas for different moods. Good pools and bars pleasant staff. Free bus into and out of town. One big plus point only became apparent after spending time in Marrakech that is clean air.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mark r wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Fantastic staff with plenty to do.,Just returned after 4 night stay Sat to Wed. The best thing by far are the super friendly staff. Nothing is ever to much and they are always willing to serve with a smile and a chat. Loads going on all day if you want to join in or just chill by one of the pools. The main pool was quite chilly but always plenty of beds and no need to get up super early or reserve a bed.  Always plenty of food although a bit repetitive. The food was hot for the majority of the time and being refilled regularly. Things like eggs omelettes fish chicken and pancakes cooked at hot plate which you might have to wait two or three minutes if there's a small queue.  There are basic local drinks with the all inclusive and the option to pay for premium brands. Cocktails are made to order along with coffee tea and soft drinks.  We stayed in room 2143 over looking the inner gardens and near to zen pool. The room was clean and airy with good air con and WiFi connection. There were fresh towels and toiletries everyday. The beds were firm but very comfortable but only one pillow. Small fridge with a bottle of water on arrival. The room was opposite the stairs and next to the lift but this did not cause an issue during our stay.  The restaurant was about a four to five minute walk.  We didn't use the free shuttle bus as was always booked. Taxis available just outside and cost rang from 100 - 250 Dhr one way for four adults depending on the time of day.  It would be easy to spend your whole holiday at the resort because the staff made you feel so welcomed and always remembered your name but the souks and madena are a must. Just be prepared for an exciting taxi ride and plenty to awaken your senses one you arrive in the souks.  Can't wait to book our next trip and will definitely be returning to the Iberostar.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F411JQmarkr

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,David P wrote a review Nov 2019,20,A hotel of opposites,First of all the good. The hotel staff are superb (not sure about the receptionist joking that there was no booking - not that funny) friendly helpful etc. The grounds are stunning and the rooms clean.    The bad. I don't recognise others comments about the food. We found it bland tasteless and we were very disappointed I also suffered from a bad stomach which made the journey home more stressful than it needed to be.    We had booked a double room which was two singles pushed together. Not that conducive to a couples romantic weekend retreat.    The wifi is virtually useless for any ]real time connection'. As an example I could not check into our flight. If you were up early facebook might work    We would not return despite the good points.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/david187067

Recommended for everyone from singles to people with small children. Please be careful with your transfers on arrival. Overall the hotel is very clean the food is excellent and the staff very friendly and polite. Nothing was too much trouble. This made the holiday easy and fun. There was sufficient food and snacks throughout the day and we did not feel hungry. There was also a shop on site for snacks and essentials if needed. WiFi a little hit and miss but there. Get your beach towel tokens on arrival for 10 Euro per towel at reception - saves the walking.  My particular room was above the restaurants on the side of the main building and as you can imagine this was somewhat noisy so if you require peace get one of the garden rooms not pool side views as they are quieter but more of a walk to the main areas. Every room is the same layout and has the same contents unless you upgrade but they are adequate. The showers are slippery though as found by my niece who slipped and broken two ribs!! So please watch your step.  We hired an English speaking guide (Tariq) with an excellent minibus via the male manager in the main reception for 900Din for 4 adults and 2 children. We went up into the Atlas mountains and had a fabulous day out. There is also a free minibus to the Souks which is about 30 minutes away.  Overall an excellent first visit to Morocco.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,CJB0017 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Half term break,We stayed here for 10 nights in October and had a fantastic time. The staff were so helpful and friendly and liked chatting to guests - especially the entertainment staff who were fantastic with the children (Mehdi Hamza & Ayyoub especially...). We had 2 interconnecting rooms which were of a reasonable size very clean and nicely decorated. There is also a fridge in the room. The food is predominantly buffet style with a fantastic choice and some variations from the staples each night (sushi seafood kebab chocolate fountains etc) and all very tasty but can be a little samey if you go both lunchtime and evening. We tended to make use of the food truck for lunch (burgers/hot dogs) for a change. Mid afternoon goûter of doughnuts and crèpes also delicious. The Morrocan meal in the themed restaurant is a must and is included for one meal per stay. The pools are good but should note that the Zen Pool (which is 16+ only) is heated whereby the main pool isn’t. There is also a toddler pool with small slide and water fountains. We loved all the entertainment the staff clearly love what they do and enjoy entertaining everyone....Trapezing tennis badminton boules darts midday game club dance.....something for everybody! They even teach you to ok - tagine paella....Don't miss the cocktail parties or the white party lots of fun and dancing! Entertainment every evening is good. Great choice of drinks throughout the hotel too but sometimes could do with slightly more alcoholic content as cocktails served with lots of crushed ice.  Shout out must also be made for the best birthday celebration for my son at dinner in the Moroccan restaurant including some of the entertainers carrying in the cake and literally making a big sing and dance in English French and Arabic.  Thank you for a fabulous stay - our young son cried on the way to the airport as he didn’t want to leave and our near teenager is desperate to go back and trapeze some more!,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJB0017
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,AlecLou wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Excellent!,On arrival knowing we might have to wait for our room to be ready we were met by some of the friendliest people I've ever seen!  Check in was completed with a glass of juice followed by wine... we we're late for breakfast but pastries were offered in the bar whilst we waited.  We soon had our keys and the bags were kindly taken to our room for the week.  The room was clean modern with a nice view in the 'quieter' part of the complex.  The food at meal times was some of the best I'd had on all inclusive a good variety of food for a week's stay.  All the staff I mean ALL staff in the restaurant were fantastic and a credit to the hotel always happy to help and nothing was too much trouble.  We as a family are always courteous when out and felt embarrassed as to how some of the guests behaved towards the staff but they remained professional always.  The entertainment during the day for our 15 year old boy was great loads of sports etc and the animation team especially Khalid made his stay and ours a delight thankyou.  There are three pools. 1 for small children (we never visited) 1 for children/adults with music games animation and one a more quieter one for over 16's. The Zen bar at this one was run by a charming chap called Salah who seemed to remember what everyone's tipple was!  There was no need to reserve sun beds but that might have been because it wasn't summer....  The evening entertainment was top notch with some excellent themes.  There is a a'la carte moroccan restaurant but the standard of food in the main hall didn't warrant us trying although other guests said it was great.    There's a free regular shuttle bus to the main town and back which is worth a visit we had a guide which only cost about €40.  The only negative I have and it is a small one is there was no kettle in the room for my morning coffee but then again I didn't ask if one was available! - On a plus it got me out of bed!!  All in all I would highly recommend this hotel and will visit it again if/when we return to Marrakech.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mayonews wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Third time lucky - a wonderful hotel,This was my their visit to the Iberostar Club Palmerie Marrakech and on returning to a hotel you have enjoyed previously there is always a worry:  Have the high standards been maintained?  Will the food still be excellent?  Will I enjoy this trip as much?  Yes  Yes  and YES.  This is a great hotel. The gardens are beautiful well maintained with loads of facilities for all to enjoy.  Staff are wonderful without exception always working hard to ensure your stay is comfortable and there is a feeling of being well looked after.  The manager is Omni present always on site chatting to customers and checking that standards are maintained.  We enjoyed the entertainiment most nights and partook in many of the daytime activities although if participation is not your thing you can go to the Zen pool where it is quieter.  The entertainment team work tirelessly. I don't know where they get their energy. There were a few new faces this time but I was delighted to see Hamza and Khalil were still there and good as ever. I think Hamza may have a career in comedy after his performance in the comedy show.  I could go on ...food was excellent rooms are lovely fresh and comfortable.  See you all next year!,Date of stay: October 2019,,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayonews
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,AvidTraveller73 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,An hotel within a park!!,This hotel is set some distance from the centre of Marrakech and is really a destination on it's own.  Guest rooms are spacious quite well equipped extremely clean and everything works. There are different categories and they are in a variety of locations throughout the grounds. Our Pool View room was very convenient for the hub of the hotel.  The lobby is impressive (old Morrocan style) and leads through to a wide selection of lounges close to the main bar. We liked the outdoor area for a pre/post meal drink.  The main dining room is light and airy and there is also an extensive outside dining area. The selection of food more than covers every taste with regular themed dishes.  Hajji the Food an Beverage Manager overseas an efficient operation with friendly professional staff. Rachida our regular waitress deserves special mention.  The hotel covers an area which would put many a municipal park to shame! The gardens and grassy areas are immaculate and the friendly bar staff are constantly clearing up.  The Animation and Entertainments team work tirelessly to keep guests active and amused. There are activities throughout the day and evening - for the active and those less so!  Mohamed Ali made sure our check-out was simple and wished us a speedy return.  Just 2 suggestions. A map of the hotel complex would be really helpful at check-in. You could nearly spend days looking for the adults pool or the trapeze area.......  The Spa is not publicised enough. Some information in guest rooms and a display in the lobby would help.  The hotel really is an oasis to return to.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AvidTraveller73

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,stuanddawn wrote a review Oct 2019,20,Basic ..NO luxury.. resort,We stayed here after a 4 day stay at a 5 * raid in the medina. Despite being well travelled we have only stayed at an all inclusive twice before once being Dubai and the thervtime the Maldives ..both were 5* ultra luxury. I know this resort was 4* but expected a certain level of luxury and I could not have been more wrong. On arrival this resort looked like a budget hotel and when I was shown our room I was so disappointed as it was beyond basic. Cheap furniture no bathroom just a small shower room no mirror above the vanity table no robes nothing luxury at all. We were here for 4 days so decided to make the most of it...the zen pool was okay the pool was basic and out dated. The sun loungers were not cushioned and there was no waiter service around the pool. There was a buffet restaurant that was self service food was good but the restaurant area was extremely overcrowded. I went to the spa on 2 afternoons just to escape from the resort and again the spa lacked luxury no nice smells no lighted candles etc the treatments were okay and the cost of the spa was cheap being half the price I would normally pay in a hotel but that said it was not a luxury spa. I got the feeling that 4 .. 5 * morocco is not the 4 ...5 * of the rest of the world as this resort would be 2 * in the far east to which i travel to most years. I would not come back to Morocco again as it does not offer me the luxury holiday i am used to. Coming to this hotel has taught me a valuable lesson and that is to carry out more research before I book a hotel.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuanddawn
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sue R wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Fabulous,Myself daughter and grandson aged13 came 2cdays ago. Met with the warmest welcome. Being near the city it is not as luxurious as beach resorts but still fab. Large grounds with rooms spread about so can be a walk to facilities if that is a problem. Large family pool is very cold but weather very hot. Food and drink is good in the buffet and not booked the other as yet. Alcohol has limited selection but fine for our group. Rooms are clean and comfortable although beds a bit firm. Staff are very approachable and friendly nothing too much trouble. We had a fabulous meal and bottle of wine in cafe arabe in the old medina for about £10 each. We got a guide for 100 dirham who took us and met us to bring us back to shuttle bus. Well worth it as we would have got lost. We plan to go again to the souls and a camel ride. Would recommend as a city holiday as lots of green around the Hotel also a pool for adults and another for young children.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suerO8423RS
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,sharonevans236 wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Great visit - already booked to return,Wow what a great few days! My Husband Jimbo and I visited for a few days of winter sun. After a friendly check in greeted with a cold drink local pastries and chocolates we were shown to our room which was lovely. We were invited first night to a cocktail party hosted by the manager before dinner in the gardens and it was lovely. The complex has 3 pools. One for children one which has music and entertainment and a final one which is a quiet pool for adults only. All are serviced by bars with a great range of drinks and cocktails and between all 3 is a snacks van open all day serving hot dogs burgers ( amazing burgers with real meat ) waffles crapes sandwiches and drinks. There is a full entertainment program which is all free and you can join in or not as you choose. There are two other restaurants a Moroccan one ( we did not dine there and it has to be booked 24 hours in advance but is included ) and the oasis main restaurant. The food was amazing ! Every night the whole menu changes and dinner is the high point of the day. There is a great salad bar- fresh baked breads- cheese counter and amazing deserts but the main courses were stunning - we enjoyed a variety of dishes including - oysters - a fish bar including muscles  cockles Dressed salmon and king prawns. We had sirloin steaks  roast beef lamb and a range of traditional Moroccan dishes. Every meal was fantastic and wow can they cook risotto ! I always like to leave a few tips to help the next guest so here goes:- You don’t need to pack towels. You pay a deposit for pool towels on arrival then you can change them daily by the pool then return them and get your deposit back at the end. There is no tea and coffee making in the rooms but if you ask at reception they will provide it. Take lots of sun oil - it’s really hot there and you will use loads. Take a white outfit as they have a “white cocktail and pool part mid week”. Gents are asked to wear long trousers for dinner. Finally have as good a time as we did - we are already booked to return next June - Sharon amd Jim,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonevans236
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Susy B wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Another Wonderful Holiday!,We have recently returned from a second blissfully relaxing 10 day break at this beautiful hotel. Whilst 'officially' classified as 4* the Club Palmeraie offers nothing less than 5* service in all areas. Nothing is ever too much trouble - requests are always fulfilled promptly with genuine warmth and a desire to please plus staff members regardless of how busy frequently take the trouble to exchange a few words or joke creating a lovely atmosphere with the personal touch. So impressed are we with the exceptional staff food and facilities of this hotel that less than a week after our return we are already planning to return for an unprecedented third consecutive visit next year. Whilst we are obviously unable to name everybody who contributed to the consistently excellent level of service we would like to mention just a few people who were outstanding in our opinion :    Reception : Mohamed Ali Nabil Ilyas  Guest Relations : Sara  Restaurant : Hajji Jihane Taki  Hotel bar : Mohamed  Truck bar : Hamza  Animation team : Ayoub Yassine Said ( towels ! )    We thank you all for another wonderful holiday !,Date of stay: September 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaidItAll
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,D H wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Beautiful hotel; Fantastic Staff,We stayed at the Iberostar for one week in mid-September and we had a fantastic time and if we were to return to Marrakech we would not hesitate to stay there again.  From check-in to check-out the staff were always friendly and on hand to help whenever required.  We had a lovely room with a garden view which was very close to the Zen pool. Due to this we had no problems with noise at any stage.  The greatest asset of this hotel is no doubt the staff members and the animations team were exceptional throughout. They lead all the activities throughout the day - stretching/yoga spinning ballroom dancing and belly dancing aqua gym water polo table tennis badminton volleyball football archery and trapeze! These are on offer every day and you are always encouraged to take part.  There is a free-shuttle bus into Marrakech city center which runs 6 times a day - twice in the morning twice in the afternoon and twice in the evening with return trips from the drop-off locations.  Entertainment is provided every night at 9.30pm and for us was a mixture of cabaret Moroccan culture 90s disco karaoke and an around the world theme - the dancers put a lot of effort in to all of the routines.  Plenty of food is on offer through the buffet dining room at meal times - there is a little variety between each meal time. As an all-inclusive guest you also get one free meal in the Moroccan restaurant located on-site with options of beef tagine fish tagine or vegetarian - this is most definitely worth trying. Beside the main pool there is also a food truck open from 10am to 6pm each day which provides sandwiches burgers waffles crepes hotdogs cakes and drinks - soft beer and wine.  If changing money into Moroccan Dirham the hotel offered us a much better exchange rate than we got at the airport.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolidayMan_001
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,samar14 wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Relaxing break,I travelled for a short break with my elderly mother. Weather was in the 40's  but didnt feel too hot due to the dry heat.  We had a double garden view near reception which was very clean and airy. The bathroom had a large walkin shower. The only amenities were shampoo  body gel and hand soap. Our room was just across from the indoor bar  restaurant and a short walk to the main pool.  The main restaurant had a good variety for lunch and dinner  but breakfast was very limited and we got bored by the second day. There is the usual egg station  limited fresh fruit and very fatty bacon.The items did not change the 4 days were were there. Other mealtimes were more variex  but again same tagines at each meal.We had dinner once at Jawahar the a-la-carte Morrocan. It is a set meal  which was nice but the restaurant had no atmosphere.  We spent most of the time by the main pool which was lovely. The entertainment staff were some of the friendliest we have seen in a resort  always stopping by for a chat and to check if we needed anything. There are loads of activities from Darts cooking lessons Boules water polo  archery and even a trapeze.  There is a food truck which serves burgers hotdogs for lunch and then crepes etc late afternoon. Most days there was a stall set up around 4pm making fresh donuts.  There is a daily evening show in the outdoor theatre which was basic but entertaining.  Just a couple of things which werent great. My mum had to use a wheelchair sometimes and i didnt find the hotel very accessible. There are ramps/slopes  but the ones inside were very short and steep and i found myself taking long detours to try to find better ramps. The theatre is up 2 flights of stairs  with no disabled access. The entertainment staff kindly lifted my mum in her wheelchair up and down the steps but this wasnt ideal.  You need to pay 100 Dirham deposit for a pool towel. They do not take any other currency. So i had to change money to pay but when the deposit is returned they will not exhange it back into Sterling  you have to do this at the airport. Unfortunately none of the kiosks at the airport had Sterling so had to accept Euros. It would be so much easier if the hotel took any currency.    With the exception of the reception who werent very friendly and unhelpful all the staff were amazing  always smiling and going out of their way to help us with anything we needed.The manager was always very helpful with any small problems we faced.    I would definatelty return as on the whole the hotel was lovely  beautiful grounds with wildlife and lots of flowering plants and olive trees. Everything within a short walk and amazing Morrocan hospitality.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samar14

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,happyhels wrote a review Oct 2019,40,What a fun hotel,Wonderful fun staff who go the extra mile to make you smile!  The rooms are spacious the hotel grounds immaculate and the pools clean and welcoming!  Loved both the Zen pool and the activity pool. The white party (on Friday night) was really fun.  Definitely use the free shuttle bus into the medina what an experience...but perhaps think twice before taking kids in. Lots of hustle and bustle the poverty is obvious and the traffic crazy!!!  A few things would need to change before I could give the hotel 5 stars...    1. Very little of the food at the buffet was labelled. I’m the kind of person that wants to know what they are eating and hesitant to tuck into the unknown! My daughter has a serious sesame allergy (luckily she wasn’t travelling with us) but the buffet would have been a nightmare for her as no allergens labelled and lots of cross contamination    2. Two out of the four of us got upset tummies.    3. The hotel was quiet and so the staff could have done waiter service at the poolside. This would have been welcome!!    4. The gardener woke us up watering the plants on our patio at 4am!    Having said all of this would definitely go back to this hotel. Really enjoyed the overall experience,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyhels
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,RosieT1988 wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Good stay,Staff super friendly and very helpful. Spoke multiple languages. All staff within the hotel were pleasant and accommodating. We felt very welcomed. Reception staff were able to easily accommodate our requests and able to help with a couple of things when needed. The security staff were fantastic as two female travellers they ensured we were safe when leaving the complex.    The room was good clean tidied daily as would be expected. Good size TV in the room - but we didn’t use it. Nice balcony area overlooking the garden which felt private secure and quiet. The bathroom was an amazing size. No bath but that suited us fine as we were not travelling with small children.    Entertainment team were great again supper friendly spoke multiple languages. We spoke to a couple on multiple occasions and they were familiar with the local area very informative and approachable. I did like how the staff ate in the restaurant and would interact with guests this added an extra personal touch to our stay as we felt we were dinning with friends.    The two pools were good we didn’t use the quiet pool as we felt it was too quiet for us. We liked the social element of the other pool but can see it’s appeal of you want a very chilled day. Can’t really comment on the children’s pool but form what we saw it looked pretty good. The little snack van offering food and drink during the day was ok they’re was clearly an issue with wasps and flies but I guess that can’t be helped. It was a little lacking with what was offered and given that it is considered the main pool bar I would have expected more variety. No cocktails available there and the food was burgers or hotdogs again ok but could have been better.  As for the rest of the food in the restaurant it was lovely but not very varied I don’t know if the variety is reduced because it’s slightly out of season or if that’s just typical of the resort. Now don’t get me wrong we ate well at each vist and what was served was nice but there was just an overall lack of variety. The restaurant was always clean and tidy food replenished throughout meal times and again staff were lovely and helpful.    We did consider using the spa however found the prices to be more competitive outside the complex but again this is something pretty standard within hotels.    Also loved the lobby area and bar area great if you just need an hour out of the sun.  Also WiFi was pretty good throughout our stay.    The overall stay was good I would return to Marrakech and would recommend this hotel for someone considering a stay in this area.    If you’re considering booking tours consider the company called click excursions. We ended up using them for all our day trips and and can’t recommend them enough - specially their spa experience.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosieT1988
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Rob wrote a review Oct 2019,50,Excellent week,Arrive at the hotel and as you approach the entrance your bags are taken from you and you are taken to reception to complete the form for your stay.    We were early so our room wasn't quite ready so went for lunch upon our return the room was ready and we were shown to our room.    As its a closed currency you can get Dirham at the airport or hotel we got some at the airport just in case and as it happens the ATM inside the hotel was out of service for a few days (commission at the airport is expensive so worth checking out).    If you want towels there is a deposit of 100 Dirham per towels pay at reception and get a token which is exchangeable in the building near the Zen pool.    Our room was on the quiet side which was perfect for us extremely clean and tidy. (a little advice if going to breakfast and intend going back to your room before going to the pool put the come back later tag on the bedroom door handle likewise if you're finished with your room turn the tag round).    There are three pools - Main Childrens and Zen (quiet) so depends what you want we spent our time at the Zen pool as wanting a quiet breakk just to recharge the batteries.    The grounds are immaculate and constantly being looked after.    The buffet restaurant was very good with plenty of choice available even for fussy eaters. We ate outside for breakfast and dinner and inside for lunch staff inside and outside are very friendly and attentive always had a smile for you and kept your glass filled.    You also have the option to visit the Moroccan restaurant during your stay this is a closed off room next to the buffet restaurant well worth a visit.    It's mentioned that shorts are not permitted in the restaurant area this refers to wet swim shorts at lunchtime smart shorts are permitted in the evening.    Can't really comment on the evening entertainment as didn't watch it although the staff were practising every day.    There is a shuttle bus to Marrakech which is free there are a number of times available for drop off and collection after being dropped off its a 20 minute walk to the Jemaa el Fnaa its worth being there in the evening to see the transformation and all the food stands. Be warned that you will get hassle but in a nice way.    Big shout out to Salah at the Zen pool polite young man always had a smile and did come round taking drinks orders as well.    Abdel was our waiter at the restaurant and he was great polite attentive and enjoyed a laugh with the gets and importantly kept you glass topped up.    You can have a quiet or busy holiday its up to you we opted for a quiet break and thats exactly what we wanted and got.    If you're considering going I couldn't recommend it highly enough and wouldn't hesitate in returning.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,JMBuk wrote a review Oct 2019,40,A nice hotel with great staff,We stayed here for a week all-inclusive with a very good deal from BA holidays. It’s a little way out of the city which may or may not be a good thing for you. There’s nothing immediately outside the hotel grounds to see or do or walk to but that is the same as all hotels in the Palmeraie area. The hotel runs a regular bus into the city - you are dropped around a 15 minute walk from Jemma el Fna square (not sure why they don’t take you closer to it)  Within the grounds there is enough to keep you busy or not! Pools are good with plenty of beds and some larger sofa areas separate pool for kids. Kids clubs and activities for teens also. Outdoor exercise classes during the day.  All the staff are super enthusiastic friendly and get to know you quickly. Never too much of a queue at the pool bar or indoor one.  There are various nationalities staying here mainly French Spanish and English. Various evening entertainment seems to be geared for all nationalities. It might be a bit noisy sat in the front row but everything was quite well done and you just get into the spirit of things. For UK readers Hi De Hi might spring to mind but not in a bad way!  The food in the buffet restaurant was good and varied. A lot of nice Moroccan cuisine but always pizza and chips etc for kids too. Enough choice if you are vegan/vegetarian and also various gluten free options for those that require them. After the first night we didn’t really need to ask for wine top ups and our Moroccan tea was served to our breakfast table every morning. Friendly and chatty staff as soon as you engage with them. Speaking French does help but all staff speak English too.  I should also mention the lovely lady who I believe was in charge of the hotel (I forgot her name) She had a wonderful calm air about her and seemed to be on top of everything at all times.  WiFi was pretty poor throughout the hotel but I believe there was an issue and they were aware of it. Staff kindly allowed us to use the front office computer on a couple of occasions but don’t plan to stream HD movies in your room.  Rooms were clean and tidy and of a good standard. The hotel isn’t 5* (and isn’t advertised as such) but it’s comfortable with pleasant grounds and staff are very helpful in spite of some very demanding guests. We made sure to tip our servers before we left.  NB If you do want 5* luxury peace and relaxation in Marrakesh you do need to book 5*.  The only minor complaint would be having to pay a deposit at front desk for pool towels before going to collect them which isn’t really explained as well as it could be.    PS It would be a good idea to read separate reviews of sightseeing tours especially before visiting Jemma el Fna main square and Souq. DO NOT get lost by venturing too far into the Souq backstreets without a guide and DO NOT accept invitations to see the Berber leather making process. It is a real assault on the senses (particularly smell) It’s not pleasant and you will want to leave be completely lost and have to pay someone to walk you back to the main square.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMB5791
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Taylorwyatt wrote a review Oct 2019,40,Short break,We travelled to the Iberostar with British Airways Holidays on a 3 night break.    We arrived on a Sunday morning and were quickly through passport control and baggage reclaim. We took advantage of the banks in the baggage hall to change up money.    We located our transfer agent outside the terminal. We were assigned a taxi driver and in doing so was also given a list of excisions that the company - Sahara Excursions offer. We were advised to contact via phone or what’s app to book. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. We booked an evening excursion and they never turned up. The agent lied instead of just admitting fault. There is an excursion agent at the hotel and would suggest using them.    The transfer takes you right through the middle of Marrakesh so you will experience the huddle and bustle of the city and crazy driving. The hotel is located in the Palmerie area. This is the more affluent area of Marrakesh with large houses and palaces.    The Iberostar is a beautiful hotel. Food was plentiful and varied. We used the Zen adults only pool which had lots of beds and was quiet compared to the music pumping at the main pool. There is also a pool bar. It appeared that if you “got in” with the bar man he would deliver drinks to your Sunbed. For the majority you gave to go to the bar yourself.    We booked into the Moroccan restaurant on site which you can use once on your stay. We were served a cold cucumber and tomato starter with various cold vegetables followed by a soup which was like a spicy broth and then a Taguine. It wasn’t to our taste and would suggest you have to be very comfortable with spicy food and different textures to enjoy.    The staff are friendly but many only speak French . This was the scenario in the Moroccan restaurant which was a shame.    We didn’t indulge in the evening entertainment but it looked varied.    The rooms are large with spacious traditional bathrooms.    You are a 25 min ride into the centre of Marrakesh. We hired a private tour guide for a half day tour of Marrakesh. So glad we did. We got all the history and saw the real Marrakesh. We weren’t hassled in the souks and enjoyed the experience. It cost about £80 for 2 people and 4 hours.    We had a late flight but checked out at 12. The hotel then offers a room for 30 mins later in the day so you can shower and freshen up.    Overall we enjoyed Marrakesh. The hotel offers a tranquility of calm compared to the chaotic city.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taylorwyatt

I would suggest booking transfers in advance to and from the airport Hoppa or something similar . It was a bit chaotic at the airport at arrivals you will need to get some money there too as you can’t take it in with youthere are exchange booths and cash machines or you can wait until you get to the hotel as they changed money too  Couldn’t really fault hotel. rooms lovely  food was always fresh and a variety was great . We were all inclusive and def worth the money . Hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff all very friendly and wanting to help . Lots going on in the day if you wanted to join in and a show at night time. only Criticism is that is was very much tailored to the French guests  But all in all a lovely relaxing short break and would def. stay there again  Now word of warning about coming home - however this may change come 31st Oct  we flew with Ryan air  you are not allowed mobile boarding passes outside the EU which I didn’t realise until we came to check in for flight home you have to print off  luckily our hotel was very obliging and sorted it for us . If you get to the airport without you boarding pass it will cost you 25 euros each for them to do it!  Also departures was a bit of a nightmare . firstly if you don’t need your Dirhams change it back at the desks there as won’t be any good to you unless you are planning to spend in the airport or planning a trip back  You have to queue at check in to have your boarding pass stamped even if you only have hand luggage . We didn’t know this so has to go back to queue for this . Then you go through security then passport control it’s a bit of a nightmare they do suggest getting there 3 hours in advance that’s clearly why! Just thought I would pre-warn anyone going there  Don’t let it put you off though as we had a wonderful time lovely little trip and a bit of winter sun,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shazzab18
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,alan6752 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,STAR QUALITY,For 10 nights we stayed in this lovely hotel.  We only have one moan and will get it out the way first!  For 4 nights of our holiday the owners of the property Voyages decided it would be fine to utilise the hotel for a rather large conference. This would have been sorted for maybe more than a year in advance surely the best thing would have been to book the whole hotel instead of imposing themselves on guests holidays or at least pre warn people looking to book that this was going to happen!  They took over the pools in particular the zen pool which was supposed to be be quiet and made it more of a 18 to 20 holiday pool! They took over the eating areas at meal times over staying there welcome making paying guests sit to one side and wait for seating surely none of this is acceptable and took the shine of a otherwise brilliant holiday!  Moan over the staff here were brilliant and absolutely nothing was to much trouble.  Outside the conference period the hotel was large enough for its guests but not too big and never felt over crowded. The pools and gardens were a delight beautifully kept and really green and we enjoyed to take relaxing walks around the grounds!  Not for everyone but we also really enjoyed the entertainment program through the day we did spinning Aqua gym and here’s one i had never seen before the trapeze!  We tried the shows in the evening but found after the first couple a little bit samey even though the animation team clearly worked very hard to give the guests a good time!  I suppose it’s sometimes the little things that would make this hotel a 5 star things like no coffee or tea in the room along with no mini bar even though there was a fridge but it was definitely value for money!  We would definitely return to this hotel and certainly recommend it! 👍,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Woodhall Spa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alan6752

We where from 9.45 am to 5.30 pm not a the hotel. The hotel has one pool without music und children over 200 meters away from the family pool. Very smart idea. All inclusive package leads at the end mix calculation for drinks. Only few one are good. Food is also okay but like many Arabic countries beef is not the core competence. Nights where quiet staff is very friendly. Taxi to Marrakesch Central is 150 Dirham daytime and 200 after 8.00 pm. Approx 20 Minutes driving time.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,martandvic wrote a review Sep 2019,30,"Connected, no internet !",Firstly three out of five is maybe a bit harsh but having experienced Arabic and Iberostar hotels before this one doesn't quite match other offerings. Don't get me wrong the service is super the cleanliness excellent and food pretty damm good so where can things improve ?  Firstly the wi fi anywhere outside the building is pretty useless if I saw the wording in the title once I saw it a thousand times ! In this day and age it needs to be as good as the inside.  The parasols are in a fixed position which if there was room to move the sunbeds into the shade it would be ok but you cannot always do this when people want to walk by.  There is a lot of smoking outside not everyone smokes so why not have a seperate area.  Not a fault of the hotel but there are times when kids are running around the buffet and it can be hazardous for all..  As mentioned the food choice and quality is good catering for all nationalities ( hotel has predominantly French German and Arabic) but teaspoons are like gold dust in the morning when you want a cuppa. The soup like the veg is sometimes cool sometimes hot  why ? There are 2 microwaves to assist here !  The rooms have a free safe only bbc world on TV and there is a free bus to the centre of Marrakesh or taxis over the road.    Overall we enjoyed our stay but would try Agadir next time to Morocco.,Date of stay: September 2019,,rushton england,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martandvic

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,tsogier wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great relaxing break,Stayed here for ten nights with two friends we were after a relaxing holiday with the chance of experiencing the hustle and bustle of Marrakech as and when we wanted. This is exactly what we got the hotel and all the facilities was just what we were after with the great addition of a free coach into town when we wanted. If the timings of the coach don’t suit there are taxis outside ready and waiting.    As all the previous reviews have stated the food was of a good standard and the staff were all amazing don’t really have anything to add on that front that hasn’t already been said.    I had one disappointment which was the main dining room/restaurant this room has no atmosphere and is not geared towards spending an enjoyable relaxing meal with family or friends. It is harshly lit and sparsely decorated because of this it is incredibly noisy. Thankfully the outside dining area makes up for this of an evening it is lit by candle light and has a really nice atmosphere. For my friends and I our evening meals are a big part of a holiday and if we’d have to have eaten in the main dining area we would not have enjoyed our trip half as much.    As other people have stated the WiFi is virtually none existent this was not a massive issue for us as we enjoyed being able to switch off literally. The only time we really required it was when trying to book a table at a local restaurant for a night out luckily this is where the guest relations desk in reception came in handy. They have a computer set up with a speedy internet connection and they kindly let us have use of it for five minutes to check menus online and book a table.    The only other thing I don’t think has been mentioned in many previous reviews are certain rules the hotel has that are not enforced. We noticed online before we left that one of these is a dress code for the evening restaurants that states that shorts are not allowed. We therefore packed accordingly but noticed on our first night that many people were wearing shorts. Two more rules we noticed that were also not enforced were sunbeds are not to be saved and inflatables are not to be used in the pools. These rules not being followed did not bother us at all but we just question the point of having these rules written down in the room information and on various websites if they are not going to be enforced.    Taking everything into consideration I would absolutely recommend this hotel for a relaxing trip with access to the amazing city of Marrakech!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Guernsey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsogier
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Andrew H wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Excellent Hotel and Staff,Stayed for a week from 11th September arrived late at night 10pmish. We were the only people checking in so this was swift and we were off to our room in a matter of minutes....the porter taking our bags.  We decided to head straight for the ‘White Party’ as we knew we wouldn’t really get to see it but it was just finishing however it did look like everyone had a thoroughly good evening.  Our room was spacious it had its own hairdryer a free safe air-con and a large TV.  The air-con in our room 1160 was very good the room as always chilled - however it was quite noisy so we did try a couple of nights with it turned off.  The TV has several channels with English but they are all news channels - except for BEin sports which shows English and continental football on.  The room was also two single beds (for us they were a little on the hard side) however a double bed would have been the preferred option. The room was a little tired in places nothing major just a few scratches and scuffs etc on doors but everything worked good. Rooms were cleaned everyday with fresh towels.  The hotel grounds are immaculate gardeners and handymen are constantly working on the appearance of the hotel. We spent the majority of our time round the main pool we did go to the Zen pool one morning but for us it was just too quiet (personal preference). There were always sun beds available even around the pool - however it was out of school holidays so this will have had an impact.  The food. In general it was good - a decent choice in the main restaurant and it did change daily however there was always the usual regular things for ‘fussy eaters’ chips/pizza etc. The food truck near the main pool served burgers toasties hotdogs pancakes and waffles. These were very tasty. The food truck also serves drinks and there are a lot of bees/wasps in and around the area that are purely after the sugar in the drinks - the staff just work as if they are not there and if you are not bothered by them they do leave you alone as annoying as they are. We did see 4 people get stung by them however it was down to standing on them/rolling over in them (accidentally).  We went to the Moroccan restaurant (you’re allowed one visit per stay) and it was nice to have table service throughout your time in there the food was good - although different and would be down to personal taste if it’s tasty or not - but definitely worth a visit.  The staff. These are the people that really make the hotel what it is from the maids to the reception to the entertainers to the bar staff. Everyone in the hotel is very friendly and chatty you can not fault them at all. The entertainment staff do come round trying to get people involved with activities (like they do at any other hotel I’ve been to) but they will leave you alone if you don’t want to. The all speak a good level of English so communication is never a problem.  Our main gripe with the hotel is the night entertainment - again nothing to do with the actual staff just what is available.  We were there 7 nights; weds - white party Thurs - acrobats Fri - Neon Party Sat - Disco Show Sun - karaoke Mon - Brazilian show Tues - Cabaret show.  The three shows were the night entertainment team dancing - don’t get me wrong they are good dancers but we feel it was just too much. Prior to the show starting there. Should be a kids disco - however they were few kids there so this was a none event.  The evening entertainment started at 9.30 and finished about an hour later and that was it. It just felt there could be more to keep the punters entertained.  There was an outside seating area of the bar where a man played the piano however it appeared to be a smoking area therefore as none smokers we really do not like the smell of smoke so never sat in there.  there was also a small nightclub which we went to most nights (closed on a Sunday) this is also all-inclusive but is only open till 1am.  Overall it’s a decent hotel and we would return.,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Halifax, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahembers

We had a lovely relaxing holiday and spent most of the time around the adult pool. The life guards and Salah the barman were very friendly and helpful if you wanted anything. The food was very good and there was a lot of choice. The gardens all well kept and looked very pretty. We stayed in room 2050 near the adult pool our room very nice but a bit tired in places (ie strached doors and handles that were lose) also the grass at the back by our terrace needed cutting I did request this at reception but it was eventually done on our last day. My husband also experienced seeing the back of a figure wearing a berka standing by the side of the bed which then walked through the wall into the bathroom (and no he hadn't been drinking and he doesn't believe in that sort of thing but he is sure that is what he saw 😱. The animation team worked very hard to entertain everybody they are a credit to the hotel. We also visited the souks and paid for a guide to show us around the more traditional areas it was very interesting and we had an enjoyable day.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Huzaifa wrote a review Sep 2019,50,amazing holiday for family,We visited on the first week of September. From the start of the holiday when we entered the hotel the service was amazing. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful immediately got us drinks and the check in was very fast. We had booked 3 rooms which weren't together initially. But upon requesting the manager; Mohammed Ali we were accommodated. There was a wide and tasty selection on the menu. The restaurant staff were always helpful and friendly and explained everything as my brother has severe food allergies. The chef (chef Hassan) in particular was very polite and accommodating and whenever he would see him he would ask if he needs anything. And was willing to make anything special for him. There was a good selection of non alcoholic mocktails.    The pools were amazing and the hotel had a range of activities including archery to trapeze. There was a free shuttle bus that would go every few hours to the city centre.  Overall we had an amazing experience.,Date of stay: September 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuzKam

We also went to the new city this is were the shopping centre this is lovely u will find lots of high street shops and places like McDonald’s Burger King etc  The evening entertainment was really good and the children really enjoyed the mini disco.. it was very warm when we visited the only down point during the day was the amount of wasp .

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Phil wrote a review Sep 2019,50,"Excellent hotel, food and staff",firstly we had an excellent holiday and if i made suggestions to improve it i would be being picky. i would however comment on the disabled access and facilities (i took both my disabled elderly parents with me). it is fair to say an effort has been made to make it disabled friendly but it is not really adequate. the ramps are far too steep and in some cases unusable for wheelchairs. we booked a disabled bedroom but it wasn't forthcoming. my Dad slipped and fell sustaining a cut to his head and elbow because the tiles in the shower were so slippery when wet (we had to put towels on the floor to stop him slipping). Disabled access to the entertainment area was via 2 lifts via the basement and staff areas in a lift used for goods.  my dads scooter broke down whilst we were there and the hotel staff repaired it free of charge.  the staff however were very attentive serving drinks ice creams doughnuts and goodies throughout the day to the side of the pool. the site was meticulously clean and the food was well presented varied and tasty.  we cant wait to go again and would certainly go to this hotel.  The entertainment team kept us busy throughout the day (aqua aerobics etc). the night shows were not to my taste however some very talented entertainers.,Date of stay: August 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V2639KNphill
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Shakeir A wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Amazing staff,I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my wife for our honeymoon. The staff were so nice and welcoming and helped acomdate all of our needs. The hotel itself is big and has lots of facilities and they have different food on each meal so you dont get bored of the same breakfast/lunhc/dinner.    The reason I loved this hotel so much was because whenever I asked the staff of any help they were always on hand ready to help.    The only slight criticism of this hotel I can give is it is far from the souks and you need a 20 min cab drive from the hotel they do offer bus shuttle service but this doesnt run on the hour. It would be nice if there were more regular bus shuttle service running into the market.,Date of stay: September 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shakeira2015
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Humaira wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Loved It,"Hi All So here goes...  Went 31st Aug - 7th Sept  Went as a family of 3 generations Sorry for the long review but thought I'd give as detailed information as I can.    SIM...  Went with Thomas Cook all inclusive. When we landed we exchanged money. And got a sim. ""INWI"" worked out expensive for us. So we got a sim stall next to it. However we couldn't top up from there. We got told the shop to top up was as soon as we get out however we had a mission and a half trying to find the top up shop. We did finally get there but it was closed so the ""INWI"" shop did it for us  5gb approx £8.  Apparently the bus had left as we took long but because we had transfers included we had a mini van take us.    ARRIVAL...  Once we arrived we were welcomed really well by the staff who served us drinks whilst we filled the forms. As there were few to fill he actually did most of them for us. One of the members had allergies (child) they told us once we were ready to go restaurant to come reception and personally take us. Went to the room. Excellent clean rooms however the bathroom has double doors which DON'T have a lock. Went reception took us to restaurant called the head chef who showed us all the foods  As we are Muslims they told us pork is served on one station and they serve bacon at breakfast. Told the child if there's ANYTHING he wanted to eat just to let him know. But he was tooo overwhelmed with the special treatment lol. They took a photo of him for their reference.  All the staff are genuinely happy to serve you.    RESORT & MINI FARM...  Had a walk around the resort... Bear in mind there is a mini farm towards the back of the resort so don't miss that.  We had 3 rooms 2145 and so on. Garden view near the Zen Pool.    SHUTTLE BUS...  We used the shuttle bus 3 days later. Apparently you're supposed to book the bus 24 hours. However we booked at 10ish for the 2'o clock bus. BANG ON TIME and when you're returning it parks in a side street and arrives on time on the main road so be there in advance as it won't wait    MASJID KOUTUBIA & JAMA AL FANAA...  As soon as you get off the bus face the direction the front of the bus is heading. And walk straight ahead. You'll be walking approx 15 - 20 mins in total. So carry on walking till you come to the mosque. You won't miss it as it has a very tall minaret. Carry on walking straight ahead few more mins and you will see loads of horse carriages on your left. Take a left towards them and carry on walking... Enjoy the Market.  We went to the Friday Prayer.    GIFTS...  You'll definitely find something to gift  I managed to get some lanterns under £5. Keyrings for 50p  Short Kaftans £8  Dried Fruit  Dates    From Market to bus stand we used to just taxi on the way back    LEAVING...  Last day we called for the porter. Check out was super quick. Bus came to pick us up. However it had to pick more passengers on the way to the airport so we felt we were rushing for ques at the airport and rushing.    Overall it was a great experience and would definitely recommend    P.s Few nights we experienced mosquitos in the room so we called reception 12oclock in the night. And they came and gave us a huge spray bottle which worked wonders. Bearing in mind our room was approx 5-10 min walk to reception.  Non alcoholic mojitos were brill. Unlimited water so ask for as many bottles you want at the bar.    3 pools...  Kids  Family  Zen    Family one they had few activities but never pressurised you to join    We don't do parties. They did have a cocktail party at the pool in the evening which we walked past. One night they had the white party I think which was quite loud as it was near our rooms.    For us being Muslims in Hijabs we were very welcomed.    Pm me for any more details    Many people did write the market was too much for them. To be honest for a big group in the daytime we were absolutely fine. If you agree to buy something then cancel shopkeepers do not mind at all in general. We didn't eat or drink in the market. We avoided going near the snake charmers.  We didn't go at night as thought we'd be pushing it lol.    And finally I did fall ill 2 days but I'm sure that was due to dehydration as it was 36 degrees. There is a doctor service at resort. She measured my no no charge. Obviously I'm sure she would have charged me if she gave me medicine but that I think is a great service. Nothing close by to the resort  Hope this helps",Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Blackburn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Humy01
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Pugs on tour wrote a review Sep 2019,40,All aboard The Marrakech Express,Booked through Sunshine Holidays. 2 people for 1 week in August was £1100 including flights so going to be a bargain. Got ripped off by Ryanair for £110 at Liverpool Airport as a glitch wouldn't allow us to book in ahead even though we had purchased seats as an extra.    Location  Hotel is 30 minutes by taxi from airport. Cost us £25 by pre booked taxi. As others have said hotel itself is in middle of nowhere. Don't go there thinking its in Marrakech as its not. Marrakech is a 20 minute drive. We walked to a supermarket near Riu and it was exactly 1 hour each way.    Reception/Check in  Nothing gets done immediately in this hotel as the atmosphere is very laid back (you are on holiday after all). So when you arrive after a very long tiring journey all you want to do is get a room or be able to get to the pool. Its a case of go and sit over there and we will get you sorted. 30 minutes later and you are finally checked in by extremely friendly staff. Be aware that there is a local tax to pay. Appears to be about £2.50 pppn.    Guest services is also in Reception. Lady was brilliant when we had a problem with safe and continued to ensure we were comfortable.    All staff speak very good English and where they don't why not make an effort to speak to them in the native tongue?    Rooms  Rooms are spotlessly clean. We had room 1171 which was spotlessly clean throughout stay. Chamber lady was such a beautiful person who kept on making shapes with towels etc on our bed. No iron in room so advise you take your own as hotel can iron clothes for you but it appears to be on a bookable basis. Hotel iron also needs to be booked. Fridge in room with water. Safe in room at no charge. Aircon was also very welcome. Usual shampoos left each day.    We had a room which overlooked gardens/dining area. Expect some noise in an evening as guests sit below drinking etc. An additional and most unwelcome addition was noise at 6am every morning with staff below setting up for Breakfast dragging chairs around/laughing and joking.    Dining  Food is available from 07.30 to 22.00 via restaurants/food truck Main dining room is spotless and staff are brilliant. You can help yourself to wine/beer and soft drinks. Each night there is a theme such as Japanese/Moroccan. On Moroccan night the staff dress up traditionally and live musicians.    There is always something to find to eat and you won't go hungry although you may need to mix and match. Worthy of note is fact that food was plentiful and always hot. Food truck by main pool also serves food but we were put off by major wasp problem. There is also doughnut making by main pool at 5pm.    There is a rather strange phenomena going on. In the dining room you have whole families who have mastered an art of eating with a fork (no knife required) and talking/updating on their phone without any engagement with those around them. We witnessed a family of 4 adults who would sit troughing on meals whilst holding a phone in their hands and ignoring a child who was kicking off. Clearly they had nothing to say to each other and didn't reallt want to to together!!!!!!    Drinks  You can drink youself silly with local beer and spirits (unbranded). Found bar staff extremely friendly even when guests were being rude to them. Big shout out to Ayad in top bar and great guy in Zen pool bar. Absolute credit to the hotel!    Unfortunately there is always an element of guests who think it is acceptable to get absolutely trashed on drink all day and abuse staff and fellow guests. We witnessed a couple from South East England who were drunk every day and encouraged others from South East England to join them in monopolising the bar sitting swearing and singing. Shockingly one was a school teacher who acted like a chav throughout. 1 day before end of holiday the ringleader approached us and asked us to concoct a story about having food poisoning so he could get his money back. Don't think so chavs (N & S).    Facilities  3 pools. 1 kids with slides.  Main pool where music is very loud and you are very activeky encouraged to join in games.  Zen pool is where to go to chill. Its very quiet except when idiots think it is ok to start shouting and drinking. This is very strictly policed by a wonderful Lifeguard who is an absolute diamond.    Entertainment  Animations are extremely good and will very actively encourage you to join in. Shows in an evening are a good way to spen an hour.    Hotel bus goes into Marrakesh several times a day and takes 20 minutes. You are dropped off 15 minute walk form Medina. Be careful as you get off coach as tourist touts will try and get you to give them money to show you around. Slightly disturbed (and recorded) that coach driver is clearly in cahoots with these people and told us we could not get away from coach until we spoke to them (recorded).    Overall for the cost we enjoyed the hotel immensely. The biggest negative of all is smoking in the hotel. Everywhere you go to relax there are people with ambitions on getting cancer smoking like old chimneys. If you want to sit outside in an evening listening to the singer you will be constantly smoked out. If you want to sit outside eating you will be smoked out if you sit by the pool you will be smoked out. In your room smoke is coming from rooms and below.. As a person with life limiting lung disease I don't want to be near this. Tell me a positive about smoking and I will start it.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Reena Melody wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Will be coming back for sure!,One of the best hotels & team hands down. Myself and two friends were guests here for a week and I can’t explain how hard it was when it came to leaving. The staff around the hotel are some of the nicest people you will ever meet  honestly amazing. They all go above and beyond to make sure your stay there is as comfortable as possible. When you first arrive you are greeted by reception with welcome drinks and then obviously check in by filling out a few easy forms. Now I’m not one to write reviews however it’s a must with this hotel. There is some kind of entertainment every night after dinner which is great  you get a huge variety of different dishes for all three meals along with snacks that are available to you during the day. There is always something going on during the day from water polo  group games to quick and simple cooking classes. Doesn’t really get much better than this. The house keeping team are the sweetest and make sure your room is perfect for when you come back to it in the evening. Overall the trip was amazing. The country is beautiful  the markets are definitely worth a visit and the weather is lush. I would like to give a very big shoutout to the entertainment team at the hotel  Hamza and Khalid especially. Two of the most caring people who weren’t just doing their job but doing everything in their power to make sure we were all having fun. From checking up on us whenever they had the chance to joining us for meals. It truly felt like we had made some great friends by the end of the holiday so thank you very much guys  you are incredible.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reenamel

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Matthew S wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Fantastic hotel for a lazy family holiday,"We stayed in this hotel with our two boys (12 and 10) for a week as part of a two week holiday in Morocco. The hotel is a little outside Marrakech (about 15 minutes in a cab) but that wasn't an issue for us as we had already spent some time in the centre of Marrakech. Most of the big all inclusive style hotels are in this area - there isn't space for them in the Medina.    The rooms were perfect. We had two rooms (one for the boys and one for us) with a connecting door in between that could be locked from both sides. This gave us a nice balance of being able to sit up when the boys went to bed but also being able to keep an eye on them. The rooms were relatively simple but very nice and comfortable. The daily housekeeping was excellent.    The food at the buffet is the best we have ever had with an all inclusive buffet. The variety and quality was excellent for breakfast lunch and dinner. There was a different barbeque every day at lunch as well as the indoor buffet. There is also a snack bar by the main pool that does burgers and fresh donuts - which were also very tasty. There is only one waiter-service restaurant here and you can only use it once a week. This was consistent with our experiences of all inclusive in Europe - you don't tend to get several restaurants like you do in places like Mexico. The food there was also very good and it was nice not to have to queue up and find a table to sit at for a night.    The main pool is excellent. Really sizeable and a good variation in depth from paddling to proper swimming. Most of the time it is not too busy but there are periods in the day where there are exercises classes and sports going on which is when it gets very busy and quite noisy. It is quite noisy and lively around the main pool. If you are looking for more relaxation there is a ""Zen Pool"" but under 16s are not allowed for obvious reasons and so we didn't use it at all.    There are lots of other facilities onsite such as tennis badminton football table tennis darts archery boules and beach volleyball. Some activities have to be done as part of a managed activity but a lot of them you can just borrow the gear and play by yourselves. We played a lot of boules and table tennis and played some badminton and tennis too.    All the staff are very professional and friendly.    There is entertainment every night. We were not very impressed with it. Mostly dancing. If your room is near to the entertainment area I can see how it could be a bit noisy if you were trying to get to sleep but it does not go on late. It was very quiet where we were away from the pool and entertainment area.    Couple of small things that could be improved:    There is no air conditioning in the main bar. We liked to duck into the bar with the boys for drinks and a few rounds of cards during the hottest part of the day and it was always a bit stuffy in there.    There is a terrible culture of sun lounger reserving around the main pool. The rules expressly forbid it but it would be good to see the staff doing something to enforce it.",Date of stay: August 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z6665PFmatthews
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,pompeytoffee22 wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great Holiday,This is going to be quite long and I’ll get my moans out of the way first and then the holiday was fantastic.    We arrived on the 20th August welcomed with a cool drinks and happy reception staff. Room was ready 2121. This room had 3 triple beds even though I’d booked a double room. Room is quite dated furniture handles not fixed properly and shower didn’t work. We went to reception and were shown a few other rooms the first one smelt of damp (ground floor) the next one was up a floor but the view was of a roof with rubbish all over it. We were promised a new shower and a bigger bed would be sorted the next day and it was. Before we arrived I had emailed to say we were both celebrating our birthdays whilst there and nothing was done not even a basket of fruit. All other resorts we’ve been to we’ve had either champagne cakes or fruit left in room with a lovely note from the resort team. So was very disappointed that our birthdays weren’t recognised. Also the WiFi is practically non existent    The positives are that the resort has 3 pools one for children 1 for the games and music and 1 over 16’s quiet pool. We spent all our time at the quiet pool and had plenty of sun-beds. If your going to the family fun pool you’ll need to get up early to reserve your beds. We witnessed people reserving in big blocks of 17 and people moaning that their usual spot had been taken. We loved the quiet pool and Salah who was friendly every day a little tip goes along way and he will bring you drinks around the pool when he gets a chance as he’s very busy. We tipped 20 dirham most days and the drinks never stopped flowing at all bars. The evening staff are fantastic at the main bar and they will know what your drinking. They work so hard so please make sure you tip them and if you do you’ll know about it as service is even better.    The hotel is very clean and the food has so much choice whole joints of meat being carved fresh every night. This is one of the best buffets we’ve had over all holidays. The noise is like a canteen though.    The bus that takes you into town is fab and always had spaces if and when we wanted to go into town. There is a great bistro opposite the drop off and collection point in Marrakech. Nice to cool down with a pint of cold flag especialle after the exhilaration of the square. We also tipped the driver who was hilarious but got you there and back safely.    We were lucky to have good weather every day for the 12 days we were there. We had booked this holiday through British airways so had a tax to pay which I did know about and that was £37.44 equivalent to 435.60 Moroccan dirham. There is also a cash machine (when it’s working) that you can get your dirhams and reception will break the bigger notes down into smaller ones.    We are looking to come back but it won’t be our birthday week. Can’t fault the food weather cleanliness and of course the fantastic staff. If I hadn’t had the beginning negatives id have given this hotel a full five stars.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Gosport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pompeytoffee22
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,kehumff wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Wonderful,So let's start from the arrival.  The airport in Marrakech is clean and surprisingly modern.  There are landing cards to be completed on arrival and would be a good idea to complete prior to going to passport control to avoid queues.  Just a note in the Airport you also need to complete leaving cards when departing too which would be a good idea to avoid the chaos we walked into when you're leaving.    Okay to the Hotel i will start with a slight negative as everything after this is absolute positive.  We arrived at 2am by private transfer and i think we took the hotel by surprise. There was no welcome at all. We checked into our room which had no safe no water in the fridge (Which we could really have done with) and the patio door was not lockable.  To be fair they did address the safe/door in the morning.  However we had to search the hotel in the early morning to get a drink as we were dehydrated we resorted to getting a couple of water bottles that was in the deserted eating area.    Now all positive from here on in.  The staff are super friendly and can not do enough for you.  The service is really attentive especially the chap who got us endless drinks from the pool bar (converted van)    The food is really good quality and tasty especially when you think they have to produce this on mass. I can highly recommend the Moroccan Restaurant this is a lovely evening but you need to book this at reception.    The rooms are spacious and extremely clean and tidy and the cleaning ladies do a superb job. Our view wasn't the best but we didn't go their to stay in the room.    The pool is large and their are plenty of sunbeams that are not supposed to be reserved but of course they were. There was one lady that insisted on getting up early and reserving 17 beds yep 17 you know who you are! (i did get up early and people watch) but none the less we never struggled for beds.    The bar areas are really comfy for an afternoon lounge and the bars are well stocked.    The entertainment was great and the star friends wrk really hard as do all the staff. We didn't partake in many activities as we wanted to totally relax but there was always something going on.    The evening shows were really well put together and it was nice to see that they genuinely had fun entertaining us all.    We did one excursion to Marrakech centre and this was fabulous what a fantastic experience we did a half day tour through the hotel as it can be daunting and easy to get lost. Plus the guide showed us the palace mosques (you can't go inside) but nice all the same. Its is respectful for ladies to cover shoulders in the toenailed although we did see plenty who did not. Be prepared to get a certain about of mither from people wanting to draw henna on you or sell you sunglasses even if you are wearing them you just have to be stern and say no. Be careful about taking photos in the main square as they will want money from you if you take a pic of a snake/monkeys etc. The markets themselves are a good experience and again be aware of narrow walkways and dodging mopeds horse and carts and people dragging trailers. If your guide wants to take you to a pharmacy (they get a drop from them) you will get a presentation and end up buying Argon Oil or eyebag removal rose oil etc if you want it or not. When buying goods in the markets then of course you can barter although we went in one shop and we paid everything he asked for as it was so cheap that it felt wrong to barter over bits and bobs you have to remember they have nowhere near what most of us have.  Although our guide took us to the pharmacy and a shop he wanted us to go to (Which was obscenely expensive compared to others) it was well worth having him around.  We did have time to go it alone for 30 mins or so whilst we waiting for collection which was also good to find your feet should you want to return on the local shuttle bus which is free.    So all in all a wonderful experience in Marrakech the hotel was great the place was great. If i have forgotten anything and i am sure i have then please feel free to message me.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,JamesBlackman1992 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Lovely mid week break,Visited this beautiful place back in December last year for a mini mid week break with a friend before Christmas.    So glad we both chose this place as it’s really nice. Upon arrival the staff at front desk were very welcoming. Offered us a refreshing mock tail whilst we filled in some paperwork. Our luggage was carried to our room despite saying it’s fine and that we could carry our cases ourselves they insisted.    Our room was a twin room which was nicely decorated and modern and we had a lovely small balcony with a slight view of the main pool. The room was spotlessly clean. The air con worked a dream during the day but not needed at night in December as it was cold. Hoody recommend in the evening.    The buffet restaurant was fab! Ate there for lunch and evening meal. Plenty of choice to cater for all they even had fresh oysters being served not that I like them but I’m sure others love them. Restaurant was always clean and is very bright and modern. Can’t comment on the breakfast as we both always laid in too long due to drinking to much the day/night before.    The A la Carte restaurant was not to my liking as the majority of the food wasn’t to my liking then finding out it was a Moroccan inspired restaurant. But that’s just my personal option. I was happy to eat at the buffet.    The food van at the main pool was brilliant if you wanted a snack e.g. burger crepes and they also served soft drinks and beer. A lot of wasps but it’s to be expected when there is sweet stuff being served.    The two pools are beautiful. We didn’t use the heated pool but we did use the main pool and at that time of year the main pool is freezing. It isn’t heated so be prepared. It’s literally like jumping into an iced bath although very refreshing when the temperature was between 25-28 degrees.    The gardens around the hotel are lovely and green and you can clearly see they are maintained regularly.    The evening entertainment was good at times and it was nice to actually have a proper theatre room with tables chairs and a proper stage for performers to perform.    The on-site nightclub is okay for adults after the evening entertainment has finished but it was quiet at that time of year but we both still enjoyed and met a few people. Drinks are still all inclusive in the club.    All in all this hotel/resort is really nice and is worth a visit whether as a family couple or friends.    And if your visiting make sure you pop in a taxi down to the Medina in Marrakech and experience some culture. An eye opener but so worth it. Be warned it’s very very busy with tourists and locals as well and many vehicles driving and rooting around.    Last of all if you like nightlife Vegas style head to the new part of Marrakech and visit Theatro Nightclub. Beautiful quite glamorous nightclub with great dance music played by top dj’s. Bare in mind it’s expensive to get in can’t quite remember how much and the drinks inside are not cheap. We found the people there were quite wealthy and we were lucky to be invited to the VIP section where we met Moroccan celebrities partying however no idea who they were. But honestly a fab night.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Zayn Bham wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"First ride on a plane, best holiday ever",We went left home on the 30th of July and flew with BA. We arrived in the evening just in time for dinner.    When one of our family members had a fever they sent out the coach driver (Yes they have a free coach to the city which only needs pre-booking) to get the medicine.  The staff were all kind and helpful.    Food was all halal (حلال) and they had so many options. Every other night they would have a themed night ( Moroccan Japanese etc.) at dinner. They would also have a weekly cocktail party where everyone was invited.    At the bar you could order mock-tails cocktails bottled water and snacks. All inclusive was only around £2 extra a day pp.    Overall this hotel should be five stars and I would definitely recommend coming here.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Breaking-Dawn22 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Excellent hotel,Just returned from another fantastic holiday at Iberostar Club Palmeraie. We visited here last August it was so good we returned.  The manager Walid is a lovely man nothing was too much trouble. His staff are extremely nice and all are very hardworking from cleaners through to management ... well done sir!    We travelled with two teenage children and had an interlocking rooms on the ground floor near the zen pool ... could not have had better rooms.  We mainly stayed around the Zen pool which is adult only or age 16+ ... the life guard (I can’t remember his name) was so friendly as was Salah who attended the bar there both worked very hard.  Also need to mention one of the bar men I think his nick name was scooby? I could be wrong ... he was so attentive in the evenings he came round with refills ... great guy I have attached a photo!  The food is lovely always presented well and very fresh tables are cleaned quickly staff very efficient with making sure you have drinks.  The entertainment is of good standard we enjoyed the ‘white party’ and the ‘neon party’.  The main pool had a foam party midday .. I think this as replaced the evening ‘pool party’.  Football is played afternoons at 4:30pm theirs various sports available ... even a spin class.  There is a lovely children’s area with splash pool and slides also a play area fenced off for safety. The animation team are very friendly and approachable.  There is a nightclub on site that opens 11pm - 1am closed on Sundays.  The hotel offer a free coach to the centre ... we didn’t go to the centre this year but I know the coach stops in between the old and new centres either way it is a 20 min walk ... I believe a taxi cost for 2 return was £25 ... obvs in their currency. There is a McDonald’s and kfc in the new shopping centre not that you would need to venture out for food.  Overall this hotel is reasonably priced and offers excellent accommodation food and facilities.  I did miss Imad the guest relation manager he went above and beyond last year.  Thank you to Walid the manager for giving us a courtesy room on our last day ... it was very much appreciated. This manager is constantly around ensuring everything is ok.  The only negatives are ... 1. Wifi ... very poor and 2. mosquitos and wasps ... so do take medications from home incase you are unfortunate to get attacked by them like I was ...,Date of stay: August 2019,,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breaking-Dawn22

I do advise to have a hamman never had one before and I felt fantastic afterwards. There is plenty to see and do on the complex and free bus shuttle to Marrakesh. This must be booked in advance.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mstickland1 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Excellent Family Holiday,We have just returned from ten days staying at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie and would echo what others have said. This was the second time we have stayed in Iberostar hotels (the first being in Fueteventura) and we have been really impressed on both occasions.    The hotel is kept very clean and while a little dated is clearly maintained well. The booking in process was painless and the reception staff were very helpful and friendly.    The bedrooms are spacious clean and on the whole well looked after. The beds mattresses were quite hard - so much so that my wife had to fold up the spare duvet and put that under her side of the bed. But that’s quite an individual thing. Our room was however on a few occasions a little smelly.....of the toilet drains kind. Not entirely sure where it was coming from but we think it was the aircon. We did report it and the room was swiftly aired and air freshener / drain in locker stuff was used.    The food was plentiful and of a good quality in my view. There was always a good selection of local dishes salads desserts etc....but also chips pizza pasta etc for those who aren’t quite as adventurous.    The Zen pool for those without children was an absolute god send! I’m not sure we’ve stayed somewhere before that has three pools - one for young children one for older children and adults who want to listen to music and be entertained during the day....and then the Zen pool for those who just want to relax! While like any other hotel I’ve ever been to there are those who ignore the rules and put out there towels nice and early finding some where to lay down was never a problem....even though there was four of us. A special mention also to Salah at the Zen bar who was always very attentive.    The free shuttle bus in to Marrakesh was very useful but be aware when you get off in Marrakesh some local ‘taxi’ drivers and ‘guides’ are there to meet you. The one time we used them we just got a ride to the Bahia Palace but we’re dropped off close’ish to where we wanted to be but outside the drivers mates shop who tried to sell us all sorts!! Although he wasn’t pushy and we certainly didn’t feel threatened etc.    Now while on holiday this really shouldn’t matter it is fair to say the WiFi is rubbish and SO frustrating. It is generally ok for checking up on social media etc (although you constantly have to refresh the WiFi on your phone) but for accessing most websites / phone apps it was awful. I know I shouldn’t care as we were on holiday but actually towards the end of our stay I needed to access the internet and / or use apps on my phone but they just wouldn’t load. Nowadays I think it’s fair to expect WiFi (when staying in a hotel) not to be the issue it was.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"East Meon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstickland1
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ReviewsByYaa wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Lovely gem,Stayed at the Iberostar Palmaraie in March 2019.    The property is s but curved out but if you haggle a good fare price for taxi  you can get back into the city centre within 10-15 mins.    As soon as you get to the property you realise how immaculate everything is the grounds are beautiful and very well kept. You see the staff especially gardeners water and keep the grounds clean.    The resort is medium sized which is lovely as you don’t have to walk to far around. The pools are kept clean and I will say the entertainment team try their very best. I liked though it’s not an adult only  they added activities specifically for adults eg cocktail making classes .    The rooms are a decent size and love the Moroccan theme within the room especially the bathroom. The minibar is empty to be aware but you could find drinks around the property.    The Food was lovely  the flavours and rotation of different themed foods everyday was wonderful. I always looked forward to dinner. Breakfast was also lovely typical English / American choices n Arab choices too.    The staff really made this hotel very welcoming  I had a quad bike incident and as soon as I got back to the hotel. The grounds nurse came to assist me and checked up on me daily .    I would not hesitate to come back here again . If you would like to see what rooms look like I have a walkthrough on YouTube .

The grounds are well kept and the facilities excellent. Food is buffet style with a huge range on offer and generally of good quality. There are a range of places to eat around the resort. Rooms are clean well kept and reasonably sized although balconies are small.    Service is generally friendly swift and excellent.    The only complaint would be that the rooms can be a little noisy - there is very little soundproofing between storeys.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,247mercedes247 . wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Amazing Family 5* Holiday Experience,I have literally just landed back in the UK. We arrived at the hotel a day later than expected due to flight issues and the double interconnecting room we initially booked was no longer available due to us not arriving on our designated date. They gave us two rooms but as a family of four 2 adults one 14 year old and a 1 year old that wasn’t suitable. The Manager assured me that by the next day he would sort out our room and I shouldn’t worry. The next day he had upgraded us to a family suite. An what started out as a holiday from hell with missed flights and issues with our booked room turned into the best Holiday we have ever had. We had to depart three days early again due to issues mistakes that was made when booking. The staff was shocked at our early check out and wouldn’t let us check out without finding out why we were leaving early. An amazing hotel with a 5* experience and customer service and we will definitely be coming back!!!!!!!  PS If your considering upgrading do it !

The staff are all friendly and so helpful . There are a lot of activities during the day and yes the staff ask you to join in but if you don’t want to you don’t have to and leave you alone . Can not fault the hotel the food is amazing lots of variety. Visited the a la carte which we had to book and the beef tagine was so beautiful cooked would recommend.  There are 2 shops on the premises one has some amazing pottery and we did spend some money on the pots . The other shop is your usual basic stuff and they do sell some lovely intricate dresses and tops . We wanted to go to the Majorelle gardens which is not far away and you can book the hotels courtesy bus to drop you off but unfortunately we went on holiday when it was their festival time and everything is closed for 3 days so check your dates when booking your holiday we will be more aware next time.  If you do have any Dirham left over make sure you change them when you just go into the airport as when you pass through security you won’t be able to . We were told by our rep we could use them in duty free but when we tried to do this in duty free told would not accept them only euros and you cannot use them on the plane back so be warned .  Would definitely go back,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,Bromborough,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EileenS53

This hotel is amazing and all the staff make the stay so enjoyable the manager visits round the pool to check you are happy with your stay.  The food is fantastic the choice is great you cannot get bored ! We did use hotel bus to visit Marjorelle jardins and the main square also arranged a camel ride with the hotel. I would definitely visit this hotel again in the future.  Highlights the White Party and aqua aerobics dance.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,jesstravelsuk wrote a review Aug 2019,30,"Not bad, not great either",We had high hopes of the hotel after reading other reviews but felt the hotel didn't reach these expectations.    Positives:  - The White party. A lot of effort goes into the white party and is by far the best night of the week.  - The food is okay. We always found something to eat and there were lots of choice for desserts. (Negative for food is that there is often flies in the restaurant and we have all had a bad stomach since leaving the hotel!)  - The pools are large the zen pool is very quiet and relaxing and there are lifeguards on duty.  - Aqua aerobics was a lot of fun    Negatives  - The evening entertainment (other than the white party) is very repetitive. The entertainment staff pester to join in and dance etc won't take no for an answer even dragging us up by our wrists after being told no multiple times. We spent most nights in the quieter lobby bar to avoid this unfortunately.  - There is a huge wasp/bee problem. It is impossible to sit near the food truck as the truck is swarmed in wasps. We had to move sunbeds a few times because the wasps were becoming a real issue.  - The wifi. There may as well be no wifi so don't expect to be able to use it for anything at all.  - The shop is also pretty non existent and is never open.  - The hotel really is in the middle of nowhere (we didn't mind this as it felt safe but if you are hoping to venture out this may be a negative).    Overall it is okay. We wouldn't return because we did not like being hassled by staff they even pestered us at dinner time and even came and sat with us while we were trying to eat. My daughter who is 25 but looks quite young got a lot of grief from the male staff members and it made her very uncomfortable to keep telling them no. We saw this happen an awful lot to all the girls.,Date of stay: July 2019,,England,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesstravelsuk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sarahjl wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Can't wait to return!!,Spent 4 nights here with my partner from the second we arrived in the hotel we were greeted by the porter who took our bags and got us a glass of fruit juice while we filled in paperwork. The rooms are spacious and so so clean with a lovely fresh scent we had a room overlooking the gardens which were so peaceful. Everything about the hotel is 5star (apart from the wifi) the food was just absolutely amazing every night their was something new to try beer and alcoholic drinks are good also and there's a choice of wines to have with lunch and dinner.  The hotel grounds are beautifully maintained and there's so much to do to keep you occupied. We preferred the zen pool as it was peaceful and always plenty of sun loungers.  All the staff work so hard to make everything perfect for your staythey are absolutely brilliant. SALAH ABDEL and JAMES stood out to us the most.  They have a free shuttle bus that takes you to the markets it does need to be booked at reception and please keep the small slip of paper they give you as you need this to get on the bus(we had chucked it away)  There was a tour guide when we got off the bussure his name was Najim totally recommend looking out for him (especially if you dont speak French) his English is very good and he kept all the locals at arms length.  As stated previouslythe Wi-Fi is not the bestunless you're in the main reception/indoor seating areas. But all in all we cant wait to return next year with the family.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Laura B wrote a review Aug 2019,40,Great hotel,Just returned from one week in this great hotel. As others have said there are so many positives about this hotel. The staff are a real credit to the hotel so friendly and could not do enough for you. The ladies in the kids club work so hard and run a fab kids disco. The food is fab and there are so many activities to do. The grounds are beautiful and very well kept. For a real get away and a looked after experience I really recommend this hotel.  A few negatives (hence not 5 stars) which are probably personal preference:  1. Lack of ice creams/lolly’s during the day for kids. I don’t mind paying extra for these but the shop is not open very often.  2. The entertainment could be a little more varied. It’s 90% one dance troop. They are very good and it’s professional but the occasional singer/ local artist would be a good mix. They only have this one night of the week - a belly dancer. She was fab.  3. As others have said the WiFi is terrible. Really it’s non existent. This didn’t bother me (more time to read books) but it did make online check in a challenge and my (almost) teenager found it difficult to deal with.  Overall these are more minor issues (probably easily fixed) and this is a hotel I would recommend to friends and family.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C4238LGlaurab

All the staff were friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble especially Zakaria he knew what we wanted before we did!  There is plenty to do for both adults and children my daughter and her friend especially enjoyed Archery. The pool is a decent size and there is enough sun beds to go round.  The food is out of this world and there is plenty of choice.  The rooms are spacious and clean and there is plenty of wardrobe space. There is a safe and a fridge in the room.  There is a shuttle bus that you can get that takes you to Marrakech this is booked through reception.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,nhardy wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Attentive Staff and Wonderful Setting,We stayed as a family of four two adultstwo children (16yrs and 13yrs) We arrived on an early flight and were met by really friendly and helpful staff upon check in. Our two adjoining rooms were not quite ready and we took an opportunity to walk around the complex to get our bearings. We were stopped by the very friendly hotel manager to welcome us to the hotel and he advised us that he would check with reception to see if we could access our rooms any quicker. Several minutes earlier we were approached by a member of staff to advise us that we could go to our rooms.Excellent service!  Our rooms were clean and spacious and were always kept to a high standard by the fantastic cleaners during our 11 night stay.  All the staff were attentive and we tipped them daily which was rewarded by extra special service with waiters bringing drinks to our sun loungers.  The restaurant staff were polite and helpful and the food was varied with a great barbecue available at lunch times.  A special mention to all the animation team who were so passionate about their job and always had time to come and have a chat and try and get you to join in with the entertainment.  During our stay I took ill with tonsillitis and headed up to reception to see whether there was a medic on site the manager immediately got on the phone to the Doctor and described my symptoms and provided advice on how to remedy my symptoms providing again excellent customer service.  WiFi is an issue but you just have to be prepared to pay the daily roaming charges with your provider if you want to use the internet all the timein some ways it was good to have a break from staring at your mobile all day!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Tracey and Sean wrote a review Aug 2019,50,"""Fabulous holiday, one of the best hotels we have stayed in""","We (my husband and I) travelled to this hotel arriving 20th July and stayed for two weeks. On arrival we were greeted and given good service and shown to our room very quickly. This was late afternoon so I cannot comment on people arriving at any other time. Our room was exactly as shown on the website (onthebeach) so we were pleased. Comfortable clean and good air conditioning. Our room was on the first floor near the pool bathroom as expected and everything in good order and very clean. The hotel has three pools the first id for the babies and is really nice it is shallow clean and has water guns and other amusements and slides. The middle pool is a family pool and this is where most of the entertainment took place. Lastly the zen pool which is based back from the main part of the hotel. This is where we spent most of our time pool for 16 and over and a bar quiet and lots of sunshine. It was great to go there and spend time relaxing during the day. It is also good that there is a pool for everyone.  The food was amazing so much choice I know this is normally the case with all inclusive but it was good something for everyone including kids. There is a wide range of authentic food and all of that was really nice too. Loads of desserts and very attentive staff. Breakfast for Brits; there is actually bacon which surprised us it sometimes looks underdone but it isn't and it is alright. Loads of bread and continental breakfast including a varied selection of gluten free. Now for the one thing I always miss ""tea"" they do gold label tea which is fine and so is the milk. I forgot to take a mug as the cups are small there is no reason why you cant have as many as you want. Themed nights and barbeque every lunch time was also good.  Water this is given to you on arrival but you need to ask at the bar if you want more but it is free and readily available so no problems obtaining it. During the day there is a food truck near the pool with drinks hot dogs burgers waffles and these are all really nice.  Drinks the beer is lovely slightly sweet and crisp very refreshing. Coke zero and sprite (proper stuff) is available but coke zero is the only sugar free. Other drinks all nice. I drink mojitos so fine for me but I guess it is what every suits.  Entertainment was good the team are brilliant kids clubs good evening entertainment is different shows. These are good a bit cheesy however in terms of entertainment abroad this is the best so far. During the day they really encourage you to get involved and happily stop and chat if you want. Evenings also have a short quiz but all very accessible. There is a night club but we never saw it and by the time we thought about it we were going home! There are a couple of shops on site but they are expensive but okay if you want the odd thing.  People there are of many nationalities and i would say French and English are the two main languages however this does not make any difference to the mood or enjoyment of the experience.  Excursions - Speak to Andrea from Thomas Cook she is great and really helpful. We went into Marrakech using the shuttle it picks you up form outside. On arrival we had a guide and he gave us a really good show around the old market. There is the usual banter but if you do not like it don't go this is their culture. If you do go out only take the amount you want to spend and leave your card behind IF you do not want to spend too much money.  We also went to the Atlas Mountains great views and day out this was quite cheap as well and included lunch.  Heat - It is very hot I used factor 50 for the whole time it is hotter in the afternoon than midday. Use the cream you will burn I took two big bottles and needed more. It is £20 to buy in the shop so very expensive so make sure you take enough.  Bites - I did have a couple and some people had loads so it depends on who you are and if you have the blood they like! I took aftersun with insect repellent and this was very effective.  Money - you will need money for tips and how you do this is up to you. If you like tipping we gave our barman 20D a day (about £2) cleaners bar staff etc they do work exceptionally hard and i think it it good to tip. Other money well if you want to have a spend up just make sure you get your head around the currency calculations.  Overall - We both loved this hotel this is our second stay with Iberostar and we have been very happy. We want to go back next year and take our family as we loved it so much. I didn't want to go home and had a very relaxing and amazing time. The whole hotel want you to have a good experience and it is exactly what we got.  Only downside is my personal preference - I am a bit of an ocean rescue freak they need to ask if people want straws rather than assume they do they would use less. All the barman knew I felt very strongly about not having one. I'm not sure if they recycle the water bottles but by the end of the holiday i was feeling very uncomfortable about the amount of bottles I alone had used times that by guests across countries worldwide and it is frightening!    Recycle sun cream if people want to leave it for others it would be good loads of kids had inflatables recycle them as well would be good as they are plastic after all.    A bin and a clock in reception and a clock in the dining room little things!    That's all really it is a lovely place and if you want five star in a four star than try this hotel it is everything they say it is.    Thank you to all those who made our holiday well worth the money the experience and memories have all been worth it.    Oh one other thing Managers are always on site everyday checking everything and very friendly if you go and something is wrong don't moan let them know as they will be very happy to help.",Date of stay: July 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1stClassGuests

The hotel is really lovely the rooms are excellent and the whole place is kept extremely clean. The staff throughout the hotel from reception to animation team bar staff and cleaners are exceptional! The pool life guards are without doubt the most helpful people I have ever met!!! They fetch sun beds umbrellas for you tidy up constantly and always with a smile!    We didn’t really think the food was amazing as others have said. It was ok. We didn’t think the choice was as good as other all inclusive’s we’ve been to but that said it was extremely good value for money. The Moroccan food was always superb but we didn’t want it every night. The other choices were quite samey paella pizza salads.    This was an excellent value for money family holiday.

From when we arrived the staff were welcoming helpful and flexible to all our requirements. The standard of rooms was as good as it gets in the UK i would equate to Crown Plaza. The facilities in the hotel the swimming pool sports facilities and leisure were of a very high standard. The classes Aqua Aerobics spinning and stretching were enjoyed by us all. The kids pool the mixed pool and adults only pool with bars/foods on sight meant everyone could enjoy fun swims as well as more workout based.  The food was of the highest level the choice taste and quality of staff was something we will never forget. There was no request too much and the atmosphere among the staff was exceptional.

Arrived with around lunch time to find that our rooms where ready. Views of Atlas Mountain from balcony. Pool food and entertainment were all fantastic. My husband complained that there wasnt enough 'english food' to eat!!! The amount of food on offer even the pickiest of people could eat well.    Internet is hit and miss. I kept having to log back on but this wasn't an issue for me of 46 but was for my 18yr old who couldn't speak to her boyfriend at times.    We tried the Moroccan restaurant on site but other members of the party did not enjoy the food.    We went to the Medina 2 days into our holiday via the coach from the hotel but be careful as there are tourist guides waiting to take you to the medina saying that they work for the hotel they do not and charge you. Just walk straight up the road cross opostie the mosque and you are at the start of the medina. Make sure you haggle and be careful of pickpockets scooters within the medina and the beggars.    We went to the medina of a night also and although still hot it was a lot cooler but is busier.    My daughter got her photo taken with the snakes only to be told that the photo taken on her phone would cost her 200diram. Luckily I was next to her so they didnt get anywhere near that price.    I would definately come back to this hotel even though it wasnt in the town. It was very nice that it was a little out of the way.    One more thing if you have any diram left over please make sure you change them at the airport before you go through check as once through passport control there is no facility and only certain shops will take diram.,Date of stay: August 2019,,Wirral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princessfionawirral

We booked the airport transfer separately and this went smoothly with assistance from both the driver and staff with our luggage and wheelchair on arrival. Welcome drinks came and a relaxing check in followed (quick lunch too as we arrived around 2:15) and off to our rooms with luggage coming shortly afterwards with a porter. The rooms (one with garden view at the back peaceful and relaxed one with pool view so lots of buzzing activity) spacious and well equipped with good AC the porter explaining how to operate the lights AC and TV etc. The site is vast and has everything you want for a relaxing holiday and plenty of activities too. We found our ""secret garden"" behind the bar but our daughter preferred hanging out around the pool and the evening entertainment more to her taste. There is everything for everyone. All the staff were helpful and friendly; rooms kept impeccable reception always going the extra mile bar staff always smiling the Star Club staff beaming all day long. The handy shuttle into Marrakech was used on occasions to visit the souks and do some local shopping. Food was very good and even being buffet style there was plenty of new dishes created each day so you didn't need to eat the same thing constantly. The seafood was especially good as was the serrano ham. I mentioned the wheelchair earlier; this was not a problem as there is accessibility almost everywhere though steep in places and assistance always offered if needed. A thoroughly enjoyable week spent relaxed and in great surroundings. We even had birds nesting in a tree outside our window and they hatched!

Sara was always around asking if everything was ok the animation team had so much energy and the evening entertainment was great fun. Choices of food is excellent. We took the bus into town a few times be warned you’ll be hounded as soon as you step of the bus but a polite ‘no thank you’ does the trick. A trip to the night market in the square is an experience I’d recommend you try! We also managed to haggle a deal for quad biking and camel rides for just £35 per person down from £60. We found out later that the company were in fact right next door to the hotel so it might be worth just going there and asking.

The check in process was long as there was a lot to do leaving a deposit for pool towels paying up front for rooms changing up money/currency and completing a form. We had three rooms booked and as we booked months ago and asked for rooms next to each other this wasn’t to be the case our rooms were along the corridor from each other; also one of the rooms wasn’t ready on time had to wait until 5.30pm to get into it; however by the end of our stay these gripes were a distant memory. As it was a great hotel. The room/bathroom were clean spacious and nicely decorated. The buffet at breakfast lunch and dinner were amazing loads to choose from (Moroccan food available too) and good quality; the Moroccan themed restaurant was ok but I preferred the buffet to be honest. Great swimming pools and lots of good family/sporting activities (the music around the pool was a bit loud at times though). The staff were friendly and helpful; the general manager was very helpful arranging a taxi for us to go into Marrakech centre and back again; and a late check out room to say sorry for our late check in; All in all a great hotel.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaronEdw
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Vladimir L wrote a review Jul 2019,40,"Nice hotel for a family vacations, although service providers leave a bad aftertaste","The Palmerai Iberostar is located a bit outside of the city center away from the city husstle approx. 30 min by car from the center.    The hotel offers a lot of activities (pool sports animation) which made it very attractive for my family vacations.    Also we enjoyed the food which is very good and there is a lot of variety. Even the pickiest eaters will find something tasty.    The rooms are nice and tidy. Although few things I found that can be improved. The WiFi signal was weak I dont know if it was due to overload due to the guest numbers or the routers were far away. I would invest some money there in order to have a better experience. The other thing is that I was located near the Zen pool and in the evening I sensed a sewers like smell coming from the outside so we had to turn on the AC which I tend to avoid. Could be also that the Camel farm on the other side of road is the culprit but that is something worth investigating.    The service is very friendly nice and genuinely were always trying to help. I enjoyed talking to the them.    Now comes the problem I experienced. I booked an airport transfer via the Iberostar webpage. The price of one way transfer was 33 €. The regular taxi will take you for about 20€. I anyhow chose the official transfer not to have any problems and to be sure I make it back to the airport on time.  My transfer was supposed to pick me up at 6:50 but nobody was there so around 7:00h I spoke with the recepcionist and as he saw there was nobody waiting for us he called the transfer company office but nobody was picking up. At the end we took a regular taxi at 7:05h that was luckily in front of the hotel.    After coming back home I complained to the transfer company and they ""investigated"". Which means they just asked their local partner if they picked me up. According to the local partner he was there at 6:50h and waited until 7:30h. According to them I was a no-show and the one to blame. That is not the Customer Service you would expect.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jordan Mirallegro wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Exactly what a holiday should be!,This was my second time at the Iberostar Marrakesh I am a solo traveller and genuinely cannot put into words the holidays I keep having here! The staff service is exceptional it doesn’t matter what request you may have they will do what they can to accommodate. The hotel is beautiful set in beautiful gardens and the accommodation is spotless the rooms don’t have tea and coffee making facilities however you can request a kettle. The food is great plenty of choice so something for everyone you will not go hungry in this place! The drinks are average all inclusive drinks can’t complain. My advice is come to this hotel experience Marrakesh fall in love with it like I did! The shuttle that runs to the markets is brilliant! The souks are not for everyone and please have your wits about you you will need to be resilient and vigilant and I strongly advise against taking children. It’s true the hotel is in the middle of nowhere don’t let that distract you it’s impossible to be bored at this hotel! If you work hard and want to book a holiday that you can rely on then I can not recommend this place highly enough! I will be back in November :),Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mirallegro
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Iamthedancingqueen wrote a review Jul 2019,50,An amazing week of relaxation,Travelled with 2 teenagers (18 & 16) so had 2 rooms next to each other.  Easy check in and rooms were ready ahead of the 3pm time. Rooms: Very spacious and comfy room. We overlooked the side gardens (glad we did as the main gardens would have been a lot noisier). Great shower I the room and lots of storage. Spacious safe to keep your valuables. Room tip: if you can’t find anything to watch on TV retune it and a lot more channels appear.  Food: Good selection of food at all mealtimes. Remember to check on the BBQ area outside otherwise you might miss out on some fab food. There are a few queues for the popular items but overall we were happy with the food we had.  WiFi: Don’t rely on it it’s very hit and miss. If you’re in a high populated area (eg around the pool) it can be hard to get anything. Try to think of it as an extra rather than an essential while you are on holiday.  Staff: Always happy and ready to help. Youness in the restaurant was lovely always ready to top up your glass. We didn’t really experience the entertainment staff much it the evening ‘shows’ we saw were ok. I’m sure they have a little more energy in the peak season. They were always happy to say hello around the grounds though.  Pools: Day 1 we ventured into the main pool very busy with people of all ages. After checking the hotel map we found the Zen Pool.........heaven! A full 6 days of peace and quiet never more than about 10 people in the pool at any one time and plenty of sun beds available throughout the day. There are 6 shaded booths with comfy sofas but you need to get them early or wait until late when someone leaves!    Overall this was an amazing hotel. Great for chilling without ever having to leave the complex. I’d go back again and recommend it to others.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ashford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iamthedancingqueen
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jaime B wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Fabulous holiday,We have just come back from this wonderful all inclusive hotel and cannot praise it enough. We went with our 8 year old daughter and we all had an amazing time. The hotel is lovely and clean and the food is really nice. The animation is fantastic and the staff are all really friendly and helpful and really look after you.  There is so much to do throughout the day from trapeze to archery stretching and aqua gym to name a few. The pools are lovely and clean and the kids are constantly being entertained. Every night there is a different theme and a lot of effort is put into each evening to entertain all guests of all ages. Our little girl would go off to the kids disco every night between 8.45 and 9.30pm and then we would join for the main show of the evening. The restaurants are really nice (both the a la carte and the buffet one)  really cannot fault this hotel and are already planning to return,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/979jaimeb

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,russd77 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,This place should be 5 star,I wasn't sure what to expect from this trip. Two weeks in Morocco all inclusive with 2 kids. Well there was nothing to worry about. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were treated brilliantly by the Iberostar staff.    We arrived just before lunch after a flight from Manchester and were greeted with drinks in the reception before showing us through for lunch and then onto our adjoining rooms. First impressions of the hotel was of great service and quality through out the hotel. This continued throughout our stay.    The room(s) itself was spacious and comfortable with great air-con which is a must for a pale Scottish family in the summer heat of Marrakech. The bathroom was large with a great walk in shower and all beautifully tiled.    After 2 weeks i thought that I would grow tired of the all inclusive food offerings but this wasn't the case. There was a great selection and variation every day. Even the kids (12 and 10) tried some of the different foods. The bar was also very nice with a variety of drink.    The pools and surroundings are also great and this place has a great animation team that work day and night to keep everyone entertained. They will try and get you to join in but its not forced upon you. We did take part in some activities and my daughter especially loved the trapeze with Mourad.    We used the free bus into town a few times which took about 20 minutes. The bus has air-con and is a pleasant ride. One downside is that you need to book the bus to and from town. Not a huge problem but it means you need to be organised and know when you are returning. I spoke to a few guests that used a local taxi back and they said that it wasn't overly expensive so if you do miss the bus this is another option.    Although this is a fabulous hotel do visit the town. Its a special place and has some great places to visit. We also did a trip into the Atlas mountains with Thomas Cook. This was a great trip with some spectacular views and well worth the cost.    One last thing for me is to mention some of the great staff that we met. Hamza Mourad and Khalil were the stands outs in the animation team and Ouirgane and Jihane were fabulous in looking after us in the restaurant. Our absolute favourite was Abdou in the bar area. A more pleasant man you will not fine. A true gent and star for Iberostar.    We loved this place so much that we are considering it for next year as well.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russd77

The hotel on entry is beautiful the lobby/reception is stunning and very very clean. The staff are very welcoming and took care of all administration swiftly bags were also taken to rooms straight away our all inclusive bands were worn and we arrived jus in time for lunch so that’s where we went. Immediately a big group table was put together for us and the food was very good lots of options means there was plenty to eat.    The hotel grounds are huge and well kept lots of activities if you’re not a pool person you can play tennis basket ball do archery.    Staff are very friendly and cannot do enough. Overall this hotel is amazing but be warned the location is far from the main city area. They have compensated for this but having a free bus/coach that takes residents to the main town area.    Over all a very pleasant stay excellent accommodation amazing staff and beautiful weather.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797humayuna
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,shaheen2015 wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Super super amazing!!!!!,Where do I start - I was travelling with my daughter and from the moment we arrived to the moment we left we had a truly wonderful experience. The hotel is amazing with the most caring and attentive staff. After a terrible time on the airport the staff at check in were hugely sympathetic and immediately did everything they could to make me feel at ease. The General Manager Mr Walid Rakez took it upon himself to personally help us and take us to our upgraded room ensuring that we were comfortable and happy. Throughout the entire stay Mr Walid was always making sure that myself and my daughter were happy. My daughter had her 22nd birthday at the hotel and Mr Walid together with the catering staff made it so special. They provided a lovely cake and sang songs and danced with my daughter. It was a wonderful and kind gesture which my daughter really appreciated. Thank you so much to Mr Walid and his team. Upon leaving Mr Walid even arranged my transfer back to the airport as the company that I had arranged my transfers with were a complete and utter let down. Mr Walid and Sara at Guest Relations promised they would sort the transfer for me and they did. Such nice people.    The room was spacious and very comfortable. Cleaned and arranged daily with petals on the bed.    The food was simply brilliant with such a huge array of starters mains and desserts. The all inclusive package is really worth having as there is something to eat and drink throughout the entire day. All restaurant staff are so helpful and polite. Always smiling and happy to serve.    The entertainment is amazing. Different activities happening all the time by the poolside and in the evenings. For those who prefer a quiter poolside their is the 'zen' pool for total relaxation. My daughter and I preferred the main pool with all the entertainment - a true holiday vibe. Thank you to Hamza who would come along and chat to us and make sure we were OK.    The evening entertainment was amazing too. On our last night there was a 'white cocktail party' with dancers trapeze artists and fire jugglers - totally brilliant! Rony is an amazing dancer and danced with me. A big big thank you to Ayoub who is the most sweetest and helpful man around. He was so kind with everything and is a brilliant part of the entertainment team. A big thank you to curly haired Muss too. Such an awesome friendly guy who does a really funny Birmingham accent.    Overall I would totally recommend the Iberostar.

Upon arrival to the hotel we were welcomed and our cases taken straight to our rooms. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. Our rooms were spacious and well decorated. a cleaner came everyday to make the beds and check the towels and made lovely shapes with flowers and linen which made us feel welcomed and looked after.  The food is excellent there is always a great choice.  The entertainment is brilliant the team work very hard to make sure there is something for everyone. Toni is very entertaining with his fantastic dancing keeping us all fit at the aqua gym.  We visited the old city of Marrakesh with a guide and found this to be a very interesting tour and really helped to understand the culture.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Saima H wrote a review Jul 2019,40,A family bargain hotel,We arrived on the 9th there was 9 of us including a autistic child this hotel is 100% worth the price the staff are ever so lovely they greet you every time they see you one thing there is a massive language barrier not in the hotel but when your out an about ie taxi drivers or restaurants.if your going with kids this is your best choice night entrainment is just wow my little girl loved it we also celebrated her 2nd birthday there and the staff made such an effort by bringing in musicians ect. The food was amazing and and most of it was halal.  Swimming pools were also really good burkin/ modest swimwear is allowed. There was a few disappointing factors firstly we paid £140 English pounds for a facial an a hamman massage when I booked my facial I was advised it was a full hydration facial and it wasn't. The spa is not worth the money so stay away England is cheaper!! The day we was leaving we got breakfast early and the staff that was in the breakfast hall were lost soals they couldn't even understand it was like getting blood out a rockthey couldn't even understand I want milk for my baby so you can imagine how frustrating that was.  On our last day at 5.30am we was told to pay tourist tax which was a shocker and for 9 of us it was around £110 I advise the hotel to ask for this at the check in on first day and not to ask when checking out as it just messes up your experience!!  Staff were really good however we did get weird looks from other tourist that were in the hotel which made us feel very uncomfortable.  We visited many places done a lot of excrusins which were quite expensive... If you will be going too jema Al fina I would advice you too go with a guide as it's really scary people there practically jump on you and beg you too buy stuff snake charmers come up to you and follow you. Over all experience was good an will be going again here as a budget holiday.  Would highly recommend the hotel to have some sheesha/hooka for adults in the hotel maybe in a designated area when parents want to have a bit of chill time away from the kiddies :).,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965saimah
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MinnesotaPat wrote a review Jul 2019,20,Strange Place,This is an odd place. The resort caters to families. However as we were walking to the pool we were greeted by Snoop Dogg's - Smoke Weed Everyday. I guess that's okay but it was a little bizarre watching kids and families with this song in the background.    The food was at best mediocre. Also the room was very noisy until about 11:00 pm. I think if you could get a room for about $100 USD per day it would be reasonable. Anything more than that - no thanks.,Date of stay: July 2019,,Minnesota,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinnesotaPat
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kaaatyaaa wrote a review Jul 2019,50,amazing stay,Spent a week here with my friend to visit Morocco and can't recommend enough! Firstly the food selection was amazing. There was always a huge choice and each day it was something different the waiters and chefs were always so helpful and ensured that everything was topped up at all times! The service was incredible and they remember each guest by name and remember the usual drinks you order. Tables were always cleared fast too which was also a nice change compared to other hotels! Each waiter went above and beyond and made you feel at home particularly the older waiter with sleeve garters who worked at Oasis Restaurant and the 2 working in the evening at Arganier Bar and always brought our 2 mojitos!  Next the facilities at the hotel were brilliant. There's the usual pool tennis courts but also a petting zoo for young kids and a trapeze as well as activities like archery! However what made the stay particularly memorable was the animation team huge credit to them! Always friendly and chatting with everyone they truly are the biggest asset to the hotel particularly Hamza Mus and Walid who always came over to joke around with me and my friend and get to know us personally. Going to really miss everyone at Iberostar Marrakech and will definitely come again!,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/241katyabb

Special mention for Fatim (nurse) who looked after me when I had a silly accident while walking in the mountains Manager Hassan Salah at the Zen pool the always cheerful and funny man in reception (whose name we don't know) the staff in the restaurant and many others - we found most people lovely.  The hotel had everything we wanted - relaxing pool nice rooms pretty well-kept gardens activities if we wanted them shuttle bus into town enjoyable and varied food.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kiri G wrote a review Jul 2019,40,Great family 10 day stay (4 adults x 2 toddlers),Morocco has been on my bucket list for a while and although I had always planned to stay in a Riad now having an 18 month old toddler an all inclusive was the best option! Iberostar was perfect for us and our friends who have a 2 year old as the facilities for our little ones were great. This is the first time I've stayed at an all inclusive so I have little to compare it to in that respect but from the moment we arrived and received our welcome drinks all of our needs were met. We went straight to lunch after checking in and throughout our stay the food always had plenty of variety as expected they were mostly Moroccan based dishes but also great salads pizzas and pastas etc too (admittedly though I was craving some Indian or Caribbean spice by the end of the week - a lot of the food was quite sweet) but the BBQ at lunch time was so tasty. My son lived on fruit chips cucumber pizza and chicken nuggets for most meals but also enjoyed some of the beef tagines and he loved the hot dogs from the food truck in the day so I'd say there was a decent selection for fussy kids/eaters. For dinner Adraoui the waiter always had our table ready with high chairs and everyones usual drinks and both the boys loved playing with him giving hi-fives etc. The Moroccan restaurant you can book for one evening (saved for our last night) was lovely but not ideal for us with toddlers who didn't want to sit still so we apologetically left before our dessert course arrived.  The toddlers absolutely loved the kids pool and were playing confidently in it after a few days as it was only waist height for them so ideal for them to cool in the 37degree heat and perfect for us adults to lay down in! There was a little petting zoo lake with Geese and also a play park right next to the kids pool however by midday it was far too hot for them to play on any it as it wasn't shaded which was a little disappointing as my son wanted to be in it and would stand at the fence hoping to play longer.  The entertainment/dance team were always smiling and visible engaging with people although we kept a quiet spot of sun loungers at the kids pool and were never disturbed there. The kids lifeguard was great she was constantly keeping the area clean and always happy and friendly. The gardeners and cleaners did an exceptional job at creating a lovely environment. Our son smashed a glass in our room and reception sent someone to clean it up within minutes and were reassuring/understanding every time our kids got a little too rowdy or excited running around making mess.  For me the free coach to the market was a bonus and a 15 minute straight walk after drop off was fine. We enjoyed two trips and I managed to get a little of my 'culture' fix that I needed. I did a camel trip on my own which is literally across the road from the hotel which was nice but not as enjoyable as when I've done one in the past in India purely because the ground is dry soil rather than sand but still an experience I would recommend.  There was a foam party an all white party (wed nights) and themed nights which could get a little cheesy for my taste but the kids loved it.  There was a club that our partners went to one night and had a good laugh but said it was more of an 'underground bar/room' (I can't comment). The spa 'relaxing massage' was amazing and I would have had one a day if I could have! All in all it was great for what we needed and had a bit of something for everyone. I've never returned to the same hotel in the past purely as I like discovering new places but I would happily return here again and would love to try other Iberostar destinations after the service we received.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kph0enix

Facilities was catered for must families and couples. Entertainment for the kids and adults.  Nightclub which is downstairs just beyond the bar inside the hotel heads up tho it isnt advertised.  Food was good but with all inclusive holidays can get repetitive. For lunch they usually have the BBQ on.  Free coach ride to the centre of Marrakesh but book at reception.

Not sure why you need to start blasting music at 8:00 am. The music continued until 11:00 pm and then the talking and yelling outside our door continued way into the night. The breakfast buffet although extensive had many dishes that were inedible. The eggs were cold as were several other dishes that should have been hot. We ended up wasting a lot of food. We felt smothered by the staff from the minute we entered the premises. We really just wanted a comfortable place to stay- not a frat party. This hotel could have been anywhere in the world.

The grounds are well looked after the rooms have all you need and the staff genuinely care that you have a good time. The food is of a high standard and even though some dishes are repeated there is always something delicious to eat. The general manager Walid and assistant manager Hussain are always close by ensuring you happy and comfortable. We had an issue with our air con and shower and they were both fixed within an hour of reporting the problem. We enjoyed the use of the spa having 3 massages! There is something for everyone here. They have a trapeze a petting zoo a pond spin bikes as well as the usual facilities like French boules table tennis and volleyball. Tontpp everything off they have THE best animation team and dancers. They kept everyone involved in the activities. Again even though their program is repeated each week they try and make some changes so every show is different. Hamza Khalid Walid James Muss Amin and Rony and the others all work hard and do a fantastic job along with the dancers. The bar staff are fantastic too they keep you glasses full day and night and the restaurant staff always welcome you with open arms and cup of coffee. There is only one thing that we found not up to scratch and that was the on site shop. It was supposed to be open 10am to 6pm but seemed to open whenever someone could be bothered to open it. All in all this was definitely the best holiday we have had in a long time and will 100% be returning.

Holiday was fantastic the staff could not do enough for you  the food was fantastic there was something for everyone.  We celebrated my husbands birthday here and I ordered a birthday cake which I was given free usually hotels charge a fee for this service.  There is loads to do during the day the entertainment team do ask you to join in the events however you do not get pestered to join in if you don’t want to.  The entertainment at night was fantastic.  I feel I need to give a big shout out to Hamza and Khalil as they made our holiday even more enjoyable we laughed non stop at these two they are lovely lads and always had a smile on their faces.  The only negatives I would say are you do feel isolated due to the location however the hotel has its own bus that takes you into Marrakech markets there are no tea and coffee facilities in the rooms they charge 100 MAD per person for your towels at the pool this is refundable when you leave.,Date of stay: June 2019,,"Paisley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N821VEdonnad

Firstly when we arrived we where welcomed with drinks and some biscuits from the manager who explained to us how everything worked at the hotel and where we would find things. From there we checked in changed money over and we where taken to our room with bags.    The room was perfect we where in the zen zone near the adult pool which was perfect for us. The room was spotless towels where changed and room cleaned daily.    We spent most of our time round the adult pool and the zen bar. We were served by Sallah who was fantastic with us he made a massive effort and made our week very enjoyable. The service at the other bars was also fantastic with everyone remembering our drinks. It felt like the staff just couldn't do enough for us. Staff where always keeping busy the grounds where we'll maintained.    Whilst we didn't get involved in a lot an dspent most of the week relaxing there was always something going on in the day and at night if you wanted to get involved. You can tell a lot of effort went into the events especially the white party. The entertainment guys always made an effort with us too while walking round the hotel. We did make a trip to the markets on the hotel coach and enjoyed some time relaxing in the spa.    We where able to change our towels daily at the towel hut and also where able to get equipment for sports activities.    Finally we will go onto the food at first we weren't sure but by the end of the week got into the swing of things and loved it and enjoyed an evening in the morrocan restaurant.

We visited the Souks one evening which i would recommend it was an amazing experience.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Lauren Lowde wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Amazing week which ended very badly.,My husband and I have just returned from a week at this hotel we couldn't fault a single thing all week the hotel was spotless the food was delicious fresh & plenty of choice. The staff couldn't do enough for you there were activities on all the time (and the option to relax if its not your thing).    So all in all a fab week.... until we returned to our room on the last evening to get ready & pack our case I realised the outfit I had got out to wear wasn't there & upon further inspection a clutch bag wasn't either. We called reception and 2 managers came to our room instantly they took details photos & asked lots of questions seeming to be really concerned and wanting to help. they then called the cleaning manager to our room who was arrogant and rude he asked if he could check our bags.. (not sure why we would make this up) and rifled through our case & bags of washing which I found very upsetting and asked I if they would stop when 3 men are going through your dirty underwear it becomes very uncomfortable.    They asked us to leave it with them and whilst we were having dinner the manager came over to us and showed us a screenshot of who had accessed our room that day being only the cleaner and ourselves he said he'd contacted the cleaner and she hadn't taken anything so the only assumption could be that we'd left our room unlocked.. which is complete rubbish.    I was so upset that this happened and all the hotel offered us was a free upgrade on our next visit we won't be going back which is a huge shame because until this point it was a faultless holiday! :(,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenLowde

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Liberty S wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Can't fault the staff,A group of 7 of us stayed here in July 2019.  Firstly when we arrived we received the warmest of welcomes accompanied by drinks  The hotel grounds look lovely and the rooms were clean and spacious. Walls not thin so you didn't hear all the noise from neighboring rooms.  Lots of facilities such as 2 main pools plus a little kids pool lovely spa fitness room (which could have been cleaner and better maintained)  All the staff were super friendly even the ones that could not speak English  It may help to acquaint yourself with a little french should you deal with the cleaners or locals in Morocco  Food was good  I would advise not to drink tap water but have bottled instead (all the bars serve bottles)  Free shuttle service into town is a bonus  Haggle as much as you can. We thought we did a good job at this until we went on an excursion and saw Kaftans for 1/4,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/916libertys
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sara S wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Excellent hotel for families, friends or groups",Just back after five amazing days at this wonderful hotel. Nothing was too much for the staff and all were welcoming and friendly.    Hotel facilities were spot on something for everyone. Food was excellent with extensive choice for adults and kids every day. For those who don’t like Moroccan food when in Morocco and are usually in the ‘moaners camp’ you can have burgers pizza pasta and chips every day.    Adults and kids are entertained by a very good animation team with all ages able to join in games and aqua sports or just sit watch and laugh.    We went as a group of adults but I would love to return next year with my two children.    One thing to note is that there was a late night disco off site that we could hear twice out of six nights but mainly the hotel is quiet at night with the bar closing at 12ish and the on-site disco at 1am which is tucked away from the accommodation.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Twickenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swinners1967

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mayonews wrote a review Jul 2019,50,"Shukran, Merci, Thank you, go raith maith Agatha...",Back home and reflecting on a second fantastic visit to Iberostar Club Palmerie Marrakech.  We were a large mixed group of family and friends of all ages and without exception we all had a fabulous time.  The hotel is lovely with comfortable rooms beautiful well tended gardens and loads of facilities to use...or not..  Food at the hotel is varied and beautifully presented though it veered towards the sweet tooth especially at breakfast but I was always happy with the choice and flavour make sure to try some of the dishes at the Moroccan corner...I particularly liked the potatoes with turmeric and coriander.  The entertainment team lead during our stay by James ( I think) were fantastic..a big shout out to Khalid and Hamza who really made our holiday and are a credit to the hotel I hope they are still there when (not if..) we return. We partook in all activities and enjoyed them all thanks to the good humour and patience of the team. I also want to mention the person on the trapise who remembered everyone's name and was so encouraging that I nearly...nearly gave it a go!! I did the gentle sport of stretching every morning which was a great start to the day and had the pleasure of admiring William's grace and poise and lyrical routine...lovely to try to emulate..all be it without success...  All staff were friendly and kind..our friend who greeted us in the bar with a smile and fed our young adults with the fabulous cocktails and made sure my husband had something suitable when he was feeling under the weather..our waiter on the outside terrace who kept our glasses topped up and the Chris De Burg fan in the food truck.  Management is omnipresent and interested in feedback. Both the general manager and duty managers are everywhere and it shows.  This is a very well run operation with lots of treats and surprises from freshly made doughnuts fab white party professional dance shows a great aqua aerobics performance not to be missed and more more more..I could go on ..

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Ade C wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,Sat in reception waiting to return home after a thoroughly enjoyable time. The staff (mostly) couldn’t do enough for you and were very friendly. Animation team work hard although our kids are a bit older now.  Food is very good for an all inclusive hotel and varied enough. Always a good pizza to fall back on if you need to !! Rashida and Adrouai in the restaurant are very nice and couldn’t do enough for you. Sallah in the Zen pool bar was also very good.  Can get busy in the main bar but they work hard to get you served quick.  Staff always cleaning and most of the time everywhere is spotless.  Interconnecting rooms are perfect for a bit of privacy within the family. Watch out for a few ants on ground floor rooms - we always take ant powder and it sorted them no problem.  Shuttle bus to Marrakesh is good and very efficient. Drops you off about 20 minute walk from the souks and picks up on time from the same place. Watch for guides trying to show you the way - you just need to follow the very tall mosque building.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,sunshine2020_10 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Lovely Hotel with amazing staff,Stayed here for a week recently and had an amazing holiday. There was very little to fault about the hotel. Nearly all the staff were very friendly and helpful all the way up to management but with special thanks to Mohamed in the bar James and Hamza. The grounds around the pool were amazing and looked after by a team of dedicated people. The food was great plenty of choice at every meal staff were very attentive keeping everything topped up. The animation and entertainment teams gave 110% every day. The hotel had lots of things going on cocktail party master chef class cocktail making food demonstrations I could go on but I would just be repeating what most people say about this hotel Amazing.  The camel ride was a great experience but it was very hot the day we went.  The only negative we had was when we took the hotel bus into Marrakesh. We were met by a man who was very well dressed and knowledgeable about the area giving us safety tips as well but we were taken in by him and he took us to a shop where they sell argon oil and my friend felt the need to buy to get out what she got was very expensive we assumed he must be on commission. If approached by anyone as you get off the bus saying they work for Iberostar don't be taken in by them like we were. Also the women who do henna tattoos in the market don't let them take your hand or they will draw on them and charge you. These incidents have nothing to do with the hotel.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Newcastle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshine2020_10
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,TheFosters112014 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,"A wonderful, relaxing holiday in this patch of paradise!! Wish there was a rating above 5*, as this is at least 10*!","We have just come back from a wonderful week of being pampered in this wonderful hotel and had to write a review to say how lovely it really is.    The hospitality started the minute we arrived at 11.30 at night after our flight was delayed. Our cases were whisked away and we we ushered into the dining room where a buffet awaited us. The kind staff had known we were late and had kept the restaurant open even though it should have closed an hour previously. After a bite to eat and a very welcome drink we were shown to a spotlessly clean room and settled for the night.    The next day we began to explore this wonderland and realised what a huge site the hotel covers. Firstly there are so many sports and activities on offer both as organised events and that you can just ""do your own thing"". If we had one criticism it is that the hotel is ""off the beaten track"" so there is nothing outside of the complex but there is so much to see and do on the grounds this is very minor point indeed. Opting for rest and relaxation we got our pool towels and found a suitable spot by the main pool. There is a deposit charge for the towels but this is paid to reception in local currency (Dirham) and we got it back without issue.    There are three pools on the complex the main pool (where everything happens!) a children's splash pool and a quieter adults only pool away from the main area of the hotel. The entertainment staff (the Star Friends) had the right level of encouraging people to get up and enjoy the activities on offer ( from Masterchef cookery by the pool to water polo aqua aerobics to a foam party!) but would also accept that some people just wanted to relax so did not push. Their enthusiasm was so infectious however that even seasoned couch potatoes like us were soon joining in!!!    The trips into Marrakech each day are great especially as they are free but the coach drops you between the ""old"" and the ""new"" parts of town. If like us you have not previously been it is a bit confusing. This is where the ""guide"" stepped in. It seems that there is a trend in Marrakech to ""guide"" tourists however they like to guide them away from where they want to be then charge them for the correct directions!. We were walking along the road before we realised what was happening but managed to ""dissuade"" our guide before we were in position where we would have been lost. This was not an issue for us but it could have been a bit worrying.    This incident aside Marrakech is well worth visit but take your travel sickness pills as the drivers are completely crazy. The souks are a sight to see but if you are buying haggle hard as the locals really over-inflate prices and we managed to get things at least 60% LESS than the first price quoted. Have a price in mind and stick to it and you should be okay. Also prepare yourself for some sights from live animals for sale including lizards and tortoise and even a chap making dentures on an open table in the middle of the square out of real teeth!    A word of advice there are lots of sellers peddling fruit and smoothies this was my mistake and I spent two days regretting my decision to have a smoothie!    This was however where there kind and supportive nature of the hotel really showed itself especially via one of the waiters Adraoui who after leaning that I was unwell went and got me tonic water gave me some good advice of how to settle my stomach and was generally keeping an eye on me. He then appeared with some plain rice and a small plate of spices giving me advice on the right mix to help settle me down. His advice worked perfectly and I was back to my normal self within the day. The whole staff team are amazing and could not be more attentive but this man went above and beyond for us and without his help our holiday may have been spoiled by being unwell for longer. We later found out that another guest had got some nasty sunburn and one of the staff went into the city to the pharmacy and got some special cream on his day off so that the lad did not suffer.    This sums up the ethos of the hotel. When you stay here you are not guests you are family and everyone wants you to be happy and to enjoy yourself but they also want you to return and return we shall.",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFosters112014
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,RAJ wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Great place to spend holidays with family and kids,We spend a week with family with 2 kids. The experience is great.    The Food: very fresh and change every day. You will always find something you like. We enjoyed the dessert after each meal. The staff is lovely and explain what they offer. During pick hours you may queue for few minutes to get some special food. What I did to avoid that: just come 5 min later and the queue will be gone. Food do not end!    Activities: they offer many activities for family. There is kids club with activities but require 4 years olds. Too bad since our kids is only 3 so couldn’t enjoy that.    Rooms: they are quite Ok. The all hotel is twin bed. But they could arrange it for couple if you ask. The rooms were refreshed recently so no complaints at all.    Outside: you can walk around and enjoy the green areas. There is a small area with many animals for kids: very nice. Walking at night is great.    Night Show: great outdoor show and staff. We enjoy every night till 23:00. We enjoy watching the dancers and talk to staff.    What I find it a bit disturbing is the noise till 23:00. You hear the music in almost all gardens. So I could not enjoy quite walk over night. However after 23:00 all is quite.    The director/Staff walk around every day and ask if all is good and query feedbacks. Very good point that I appreciate.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Yasmin wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Need to come back!!,I visited this hotel on a girls holiday for 4 nights and genuinely had one of the best trips i've ever had. I've never written a review before but knew I had to write one to share how lovely this hotel is.    The rooms are beautiful and clean also I'd like to give a special shoutout to the cleaner Zineb who was so sweet every morning and cleaned our rooms very well. The food was great although repetitive with some variations day to day (such as a chicken shawarma or crepe station) it was great quality and the options were so broad you wouldn't get bored. Also there was a BBQ every lunch time which was delicious. The pools were great and we never had an issue with not finding sunbeds at anytime. I also visited the spa which was an added bonus as I had a lovely Moroccan bath and argan oil massage followed by time to relax in the peaceful indoor pool area with chamomile tea.    The staff truly made the trip special every employee was so friendly smiley and accomodating. Special mention to Ronnie and Hamza who were such lovely and happy people who honestly made our visit so enjoyable The entertainment was great fun (especially with the all inclusive bar right next to the stage). The dancers were amazing especially Monique who is such an amazing dancer we were in awe. There is also a club in the hotel (which was completely empty maybe due to lack of awareness) but we had a great time regardless with James willing to take requests and be our personal DJ.    The shuttle bus to the Medina is a handy option and stops at a reasonable distance from the centre. Also there is a camel/quad biking centre literally across the road from the hotel which was PERFECT. Yet the hotel catered to our every needs and with such beautiful and well kept grounds we found it extremely hard to leave. While the hotel is outside of the centre it is at a decent distance so that cabs elsewhere are not very expensive. Only negative was the WIFI in which we all faced some problems with but nothing we couldn't deal with.    All in all 4 nights wasn't enough and I wish we stayed longer!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yasminsab

Food can be repetitive after the first 2 days. The entertainment programs were good but very late in the night that we could only enjoy half way most days. Only complaint we had was the drinks at the bar were very diluted and not very good. Spa was overpriced and can be ignored. Gym was too small and almost no equipment. We used the daily shuttle 2 days to the Medina that for some reason does not go all the way to the Medina and stops a good long distance from it that you are left to take a taxi to get to the Medina - this is a good service by the hotel but can be a complete service if it goes all the way to Medina.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gainesville, Georgia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodytravel

The food was great with a fair amount of options for vegetarians which is rare! It was an ideal place to relax ideally more frequent busses to Marrakesh city centre would have been ideal but it’s only about a £10 taxi so it’s not too bad. Would definitely stay again.

There is a choice of pools and we were particularly impressed with the Zen pool as it is adults only and we found the main pool quite loud.    The food is very good and there is a great choice (my criticism would be that the food could have done with being warmer but I understand that this isn't an easy task). I would also be reluctant to call the a la carte restaurant 'a la carte' as there is no choice apart from whether you would like beef or fish tagine - the rest of the courses are served with no choice at all. We were however very impressed that most of the cocktails are included within the all inclusive drinks.    The grounds are beautifully maintained and the entertainment in the evening is a good effort (if a little cringe-worthy sometimes).    The free bus to Marrakech is great and we took advantage of this - I would advise taking a map from the hotel with you though as the bus drops you off at a random point and we then had to get a taxi to the Majorelle Gardens.    The best thing about this hotel is definitely the staff - they are polite helpful cheerful and just generally lovely people.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katewV6746KX

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Nabz07 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Amazing hotel. Great value for money,"Firstly I stayed with my wife and 2 year old son just to put into perspective.    For a small family like ours (including a little fussy one) the team here made our visit to Marrakech very memorable.    There was a time where my wife and I were discussing; had we not booked this hotel or similar... we would really have been stuck. The central part of the city where ""all the action is"" can be harsh for parents and kids due to the constant heat haggling and trying to communicate with locals.    Despite the apparent challenges we actually ventured for few hours almost every day via the free shuttle. Which kept our trip adventurous. The shuttle always on time and safe (6 round trips a day)    The attention to detail and service is excellent. I have visited hotels all over the world and the level is even similar to some 5 stars in Dubai!    I cannot agree with some previous criticisms on TripAdvisor like; the wifi signal was great (although I did go off peak). Although they repeated some favourites (pizza and chips etc) they did try to vary the food - including themed nights. The rooms were also cleaned every day with no hesitation.    The entertainment was great (this was needed as you are far away from the centre) especially in the evening where they put on a show in the stage area.    I would like to name a few people who personally we made a connection with; Sara (excellent customer relation skills who made our 5th anniversary special with a surprise) Hamza (entertainment and sports side - who always made us laugh) Walid (in the restaurant who took great care of us) Hassan (who we had a few insightful tips through). To be honest you can form great relationships with anyone as staff have been trained and taken care of themselves really well.    In all if you want a stress free entertaining hotel specifically made for families - look no further.",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nabz07

The deal was promoted by British Airways and we're so glad we booked it no regrets at all might be small improvements nothing major.    Checking in-the porter took our luggage to one side whilst we helped ourselves to ice cold drinks in the reception although it would of been nice to have been greeted with these drinks.  It was straight forward we completed the paperwork and was taken to our room.    Room - we were comfortable well kept and cleaned each day with TV and fridge. No iron in the room but I had a small travel iron and no tea/coffee facility in the room and was slightly disappointed but we coped.    Buffet-absolute gorgeous array of food each day breakfast lunch and dinner and they have a Moroccan cuisine restaurant that was nice too and lovely ambience.    Animation team led by Rony were awesome Hamza Khalid James all made sure their guests were enjoying themselves and got them to participate each evening. Well done Rony you had a good way of organising each evening.    Hamza nothing was too hard for him and his energy was on point great potential! James was also the DJ and kids and adults enjoyed although some nights were quiet and could be better promoted.    Hassan and Sara the guests managers did a terrific job and often sat with guests and had a friendly chat and noted any issues.    Grounds are well kept lots to do but with the weather so hot you might just choose to relax by the pool. But make sure you visit the crepe and waffle van...    We would definitely visit again some improvements could include Wi-Fi variety of music at disco.

My birthday celebration was joined by the customer relations manager & restaurant staff who baked and presented me with a birthday cake singing & cheering when we went for dinner that day. The evening entertainment by the team was also enjoyable as I was called up on stage to join in the dancing to celebrate my special day. The rooms were clean & chambermaids were polite. We had a lovely rapport with all the staff from the manager to the bar & kitchen staff who went beyond the call of duty to make sure we were all happy & comfortable. Entertainment staff like Hamza & James made sure we had a lot of fun by the pool & at the club in the evenings. Special mention of the restaurant staff Leila Bouchra Jihane & Rashid who waited on us each time we came for a meal. No request was a problem as they made sure we were satisfied. Our group enjoyed the various activities available at the hotel throughout the day. Some played tennis others were in the pool for aqua aerobics in the mornings whilst some went to play golf. The coach service from the hotel to the town centre at various times of the day was an added bonus..

The room was nice we asked for a pool view but had to lean right over the balcony for a glimpse of the pool. Not a big deal but could have been disappointing. Also the rooms on this side can be noisy as it's opposite the stage evening entertainment goes on until around 11:30 so request a room the other side of the hotel if you prefer quiet. The rooms were cleaned to a good standard every day we called down to reception a couple of times for extra pillows and sheets and these were delivered no problem. The shuttle bus to the centre was useful but be aware that you are dropped off about a 10 minute walk away from the markets. Walk in a straight line for about 10 minutes then cross the road at the big junction where you can see the horse and carts on your left and leave yourself plenty of time to get out of the labyrinth of markets and get back to the pickup point for the designated time. Also be aware that the reception staff are reluctant to order a taxi for you to go into the centre you have to go out to the main road and get one there. We managed this OK but it could be off putting for some. We used a third party airport shuttle for to and from the airport so didn't struggle with that. Food was good there are inside and outside cooking stations and an option to sit outside on the terrace. We ate in the a la carte restaurant one night and this was lovely. Entertainment was good at the main pool if a bit full on we spent most of our time at the zen pool this was much quieter and the bar staff brought drinks to us. We ate at the food cart once and this was nice. We visited the spa for hot stone massages which were nice but as someone else commented in an earlier review they rush you in and out The massage was good but they started changing the beds in the rooms while we were still getting changed afterwards I think they could have given us 5 minutes to get out. I found it good value for money though. Overall I would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Liverpool, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyM603

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sue M wrote a review Jun 2019,30,A little disappointing returning client,Seventh visit I requested to go into block 5 or 4. The request could not be accommodated ... no loyalty to returning guests. Disappointing after closing for three months refurbishments nothing that I saw improved the experience for the guests. They have removed the coffee making facilities from the rooms & have cut cost further on the food the provided. Cheese was gone last trip now the roast carvery / or fish they used to offer is gone. They have put a number of sofas into the dinning room ... it does help to reduce the canteen feel & noise but the are uncomfortable as there is no back support. This was my first visit in very hot weather & the air conditioning in the room was poor. The last but most disappointing change was the free bus to the souk. It no-longer goes to the entrance but drops you on a back road about 15 minutes walk away .... no notification of the change & no direction on how to get to the market from where you are left so if you are anyway unfamiliar with the area .... well best of luck. The staff are very good but constant tips required if you want excellent service. I would still highly recommend this hotel but you can see the corporate company behind every change reducing costs.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSL

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Rachalcookie wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Excellent hotel with exceptional service,I went to Iberostar Marrakech with three of my girl friends for a short break which we booked through Love Holidays arriving Friday and leaving Tuesday morning. It was all our first experiences of Morocco and it really is a uch an amazing place to visit.    Let me talk about the hotel IBEROSTAR first. After about a 30min transfer to the hotel from the very modern looking airport Ménara (fyi even though we had paid for transfers as part of our package - the driver “cheekily” asked for a “tip for the driver”. Having still not properly sussed out the currency conversion I gave him 20 MAD which he seemed ok with so be prepared to have some cash) we arrived as Iberostar to be greeted by a very friendly gentleman who got us some refreshments whilst we completed some paperwork. Both of our twin rooms weren’t quite ready so we went along to the bar to have some drinks. After the suggested 20mins we returned to find that only one room was ready so a porter kindly took all our luggage there - I did have a note ready to tip him but he didn’t seem to loiter for anything - I like the previous driver! Our second room was ready after we finished lunch.    Rooms were spacious clean and bright. We asked for pool view and you could just see it from our rooms. Bathroom was again spacious with a very large walk in wardrobe.    The main eating area had such an overwhelming choice of food and you could feel your waist band expand without eating anything. At lunch time they also had a bbq going outside - all the food is very tasty and well presented.    The grounds of the hotel were immaculately kept. And we always saw grounds men preening and trimming the beautiful plants and greenery. There are three pools. A fab splash pool for children the main central pool where music played and different activities took place. Or if you want something quieter you walked to the left of the main pool following the hotel around on your left and you then come to the Zen pool. A tranquil pool for over 16’s only. No music no children. Very peaceful with plenty of sun loungers and relaxing covered daybed chilled areas. It also had a convenient bar and toilets close by. We spent a lot of our time here. On the Monday it was an exceptional lovey day as the barman seemed to know what we were drinking and brought over refills and we had an ice cream trolley come round and other cakes and fruit. Not sure if this was just a Monday occurrence as we weren’t at the pool all day on the Saturday and Sunday as we had a spa treatment (see later) and visited the old town Médina (see later). But it was a lovely special treat and well received.    In the evenings you ate at the same main restaurant or if you book at reception you could eat in the traditional Morocco’s restaurant Jawhara - which we did on the Monday evening. Again the selection in the main restaurant was wide ranging from paella’s to freshly made pasta dishes to seafood bar to a wide salad bars. As three of us where vegetarians we never struggled to find something to eat - providing it was well labelled. Though be careful with some dishes especially on the salad bar as it seemed to suggest vegetarian but when you look at it and saw tuna or strips of ham clearly it is not.    The food in the Jawhara is a set menu with the choice of beef fish or vegetable tagine. It was a nice restaurant with traditional live Morocco’s music being played and lovely lighting.    Breakfast again is from the main restaurant with everything on offer- fresh omelettes made to order variety of juices fresh pancakes cereals fruit continental etc. It is mind blowing of the choice on offer.    The evenings were spent sitting on the terrace listening to the piano man playing to watching the music performance - which was cheesy but got you in the party spirit and kids would love i. And then if you wanted to party and dance for longer there was the “discotheque” below ground which you could go to. We went there on the Saturday evening and it was excellent. The DJ played a brilliant set and mixed the songs seamlessly and it was difficult to stop dancing. However unfortunately the DJ that played on the Monday night didn’t seem to have quite the same experience of mixing and it sounded like a car crash with songs being cut off accidentally it seemed and very clearly hearing the next song “attempted” to be mixed in. Despite really wanting a good boogie on our last night we had to leave after 15mins as it was hurting my ears and was becoming very frustrating dancing to something which was then cut off 30seconds into it. This was the only down part of the weekend so I think it was just bad timing.    All the staff at Iberostar were so friendly and helpful and made you feel at ease. Some particular members really stood out to us. Roni from the entertainment team was an absolutely gem. He was so friendly and such a good dancer too. Malek was also very friendly and Rahlid our barman was really sweet. The guy from the spa (who’s name escapes me) was also really friendly and informative too. Even though I have only named a few people here like I said all the staff from the reception to the restaurants to the groundsmen to the photographer were all so welcoming and friendly. I haven’t been to many hotels overseas and it was only my second time for all inclusive holiday but all four of us said the staff really made the holiday 5stars and we would all love to go back again.    Re the spa three of us had the 2hour treatment which included a traditional Hamman experience (girls prepare to be topless as you are covered in black soap exfoliated rubbed and body brushed) and then you have a relax in a lit pool areas before being taken to a room for your 1 hour massage treatment - which you get to choose from several different types. It was a beautiful experience but was it was surprised that there was no “pre treatment” form to complete like you would do in the UK.    Now you might have seen from the website that they have a trapeze as an activity. I did wonder what exactly this was but it truly is a real flying trapeze. We spent the first few days watching people attempt this and on the last day myself and two of my friends thought we would give it a go. I am not brilliant at heights and it took me a lot of courage to climb the ladder but the guy who ran it was so calming and reassuring. I am not as small as my two friends. Size 16 vs my slender size 10 friends but this still didn’t stop me. It was such an adrenaline rush that I did it again - absolutely crazy and I didn’t half feel my muscles for days after- but what a thing to say that you have been on a circus trapeze. Again the only strange thing about it was there was no “disclaimer” form to complete which could be a reassurance in that they don’t have issues? Still I would recommend doing it for anyone who is brave.    Re other activities there is a running track/path - about 600m and a “mini farm” and play area for kids. There are also tennis courts basketball court beach volley ball table tennis and pétanque and a golfing range. So much on offer if you choose to be active.    There was also a management cocktail party on the Monday night which we completely underestimated as we didn’t expect such a “do” and ended up arriving still in our pool outfits as we wanted to make the most of our last day. But all the staff made us feel welcome and encouraged us to join in the celebrations.    When we went to the old Médina town we got a shuttle bus from the hotel which I think was free. After recommendations from some of the staff we got the 4:30pm shuttle as the evenings are more lively than other times of they day. And they were so right. It was a wonderful experience and as 4 women we felt very safe and not threatened or pestered or overly touched as some people warned me. They suggest to cover up which I did with a pashmina but three of my friends were fine in short sleeve tops. It was also fun bartering and trying to get a good bargain and if you don’t get the price you are willing to pay then just move on as you will find the same thing you want on another stall or the owner will give in to your price. The sights sounds and different aromas were such an experience in itself and I mean this in a positive way not a sarcastic way. I really recommend this trip to everyone to do at least once.    There was a camel ride opposite the hotel and there were other trips available but we literally ran out of time which is such a shame as I feel we only scratched the surface.    IBEROSTAR and Marrakech met all our expectations and much more and we wished we booked for longer. Maybe next time we will book for at least a week.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachalcookie

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Leila E wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Cannot rate this place enough!!!,Came here for the first time with my best friend. We wanted a relaxing holiday where we didn't have to do much as we have such pressuring jobs. This place is absolutely perfect for that!  We came for a week in April and had the best time.  On arrival we we're welcomed with drinks and such friendly staff members. The main lobby is absolutely stunning! We were in awe of how amazing it is.  We booked in for the second day for a massage in the spa it was amazing! More than we had bargained for and left feeling so relaxed.    The food is fantastic there is so much choice and it tastes amazing! They change the food everyday so there is different foods to try.    There is so many activities to do such as; bowls ping pong volleyball tennis trapeze etc. The main pool is fantastic for people with kids and the staff do activities and fun things around there.    We spent most of our holiday at the Zen pool.  It's fantastic! The only downside is there are only 6 cabana's and even though it says they can't be reserved every morning we went in there were towels reserved on them and noone appeared there for ages due to having breakfast. So didn't get a chance to try one. Which we felt was slightly unfair.  The best part was the drinks service. We cannot thank Salah from the Zen Bar enough! We didn't even need to move and he was bringing different drinks to us. He tailors the drinks to your needs  He quickly learnt that we didn't drink alcohol and would bring us different virgin cocktails or fizzy drinks. Always bringing water to keep us hydrated. He was so friendly smiley and welcoming. He really made our holiday! Thank you Salah!    The rooms were gorgeous clean and comfortable. Each day house keeping would come in and replace our towels soaps etc.  You didn't hear any noise from any other guests it was so quiet and peaceful.    In the evenings after dinner we would go for a walk around the perimeter which was lit by lanterns. There are guards around the perimeter who are friendly and keep an eye on you to make sure you're ok. We found pens of animals such as sheep goats hens and even a peacock! The walk was so peaceful and felt like we were in paradise.    Overall we were so sad to leave here to go home! We are going next week to book to come again next year! This holiday is 10/10! Thomas cook were fantastic Andrea the rep was amazing! She gave us the best information for shopping trips and was super friendly!

The range of activities and three swimming pools mean you can have whatever holiday you wish here from a quiet adult only break to the full family holiday experience. The food is excellent with a varied daily menu which also included local cuisine. The rooms are clean spacious and well furnished (I found the beds very comfortable). The hotel is located about 20 mins from Marrakech but there is a daily free shuttle bus to the city. All in all we all had an excellent week’s stay and felt thoroughly pampered.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,JoLondon20 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,May half term,Recently returned from a week here with our 2 boys aged 13 and 10. We were really impressed with the hotel. We have 2 interconnecting rooms which provided so much space and the bonus of 2 bathrooms. We were on the ground floor at the back so no balcony just a chair table and hanging space so if a balcony is important to you then ask for an upper floor or a front facing room.    It was very hot when we were there (40°) and the staff all work so hard even with it being Ramadan. The entertainment team were excellent providing daytime activities and the trapeze sessions most days. The evening entertainment was in a really nice outside space and we watched it most nights. Did think there could have been more for children in the evenings (eg magicians comedy etc) as all the shows we saw were dance based but that is a minor criticism. The staff who did some break dancing at the white party were fantastic and it's a shame they don't have their own show! (James and 2 others who's names I can't remember). One tip.. take a white outfit as I think they have the white party every week.    The food was very good with the option of sitting inside or outside and a snack bar during the day.    We used the free bus once to go to Marrakech and made the mistake of getting into a taxi when we were dropped off after believing the taxi driver that he was affiliated to iberostar. He then took us to several shops (presumably his friends!) before dropping us back off where we started... we should have heeded the warnings on here!    The pool was lovely and never too crowded. We used the main pool but there is also the children's pool and the adult only pool and there always seemed to be loungers available.    The hotel has 2 shops. One thing to note is that there are no balls or inflatables for sale at the hotel so bring them with you if you want them for the pool. The shop just sold a few essentials toiletries etc and a few items of clothing and footwear.    Overall we had a great stay and would definitely return.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoLondon20

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,IKMagin wrote a review Jun 2019,50,Great Place ☀️,Stayed here for a week with my husband room 1026. We wanted a relaxing chilled out holiday in a nice hotel with lovely food and all inclusive drinks....and we certainly got that!    The hotel is about 30 minutes drive away from the walls of Marrakech 150 dirhams in a taxi (about £12)  Nothing around the hotel but we knew that before arriving.    The hotel is clean well kept well maintained and the workers cannot do enough for you. They are always cleaning buffing wiping and cooking. Good air con in the rooms spacious and well decorated.    Adult pool is lovely a chilled vibe with mixture of day beds and plenty of sunloungers. Pool toilets very clean.  Pool bar is perfect a special mention to Salah...he is a hard worker who makes time to chat while collecting glasses handing out bottles of water on extremely hot days was a godsend ☀️☀️    All inclusive food ...not a bad word to say about that  Lunch and Dinner ....  Everything you could wish for soups salad bars pasta rice dishes meat and fish paella traditional Moroccan food the basic pizzas chips and burgers for the kids then you have the chefs that cook anything from fish beef chicken while you wait plus outside BBQ during the day.  Breakfast is as you would expect...cereals meat cheeses eggs omelettes pastries croissants etc.  During the day there is a snack van that does sandwiches and burgers but we didn’t eat there due to the choice in the main restaurant.  We had one reservation in the on-site restaurant and it was beautiful traditional food served with wine.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,David H wrote a review Jun 2019,50,An amazing hotel,Stayed here with family in May 2019. Saw the reviews and thought for the price they surely couldn’t be accurate could it really be this good? - but i was mistaken it really is a great place. I’ve stayed at top hotels across the world including Dubai/Langkawi and I have to say this is one of my new favourites it’s easily the best all inclusive I have stayed at.    The hotel is really clean rooms are well equipped and beds really comfortable. The hotel has three pools a big main pool with entertainment all day a splash park for kids and an adult only. It was so easy to find a sun bed no reserving beds at 6am needed.    The food was fantastic especially at lunch with a bbq every day with different meats. The salad selections were amazing and I really enjoyed every meal in the restaurant. Again no issue finding a seat.    In the evening there was always music by the bar then evening shows. My absolute favourite was the cocktail welcome party on Monday and the white party on Wednesday. Fantastic acts drink on tap and great music. It’s like something is always happening and in different places - keeps it interesting.    The alcohol was actually strong and never queued for more than a minute for a drink. They have this great little food truck by the main pool that does burgers waffles beer and wine during the day. You can get spirits in the bar inside/outside at night and inside during the day. There is a big screen for football matches.    But what absolutely makes this place is the staff. They work long hours but always smiling always friendly. I have to say special mentions to Abdul and Zyad in the bars who were so quick to serve people. However I want to say a special thanks to Khalil. Khalil is an asset to this hotel he is professional intelligent kind and has a good heart. He really made our holiday taking time to see us each day help our son with activities and chat to us at dinner. He deserves a promotion and I will really miss him (picture attached!). The hotel is lucky to have him.    Only negative I can think of is WiFi not great and dogs barking some nights outside.    Overall I would come back here no doubt about it. I am reluctant to write this review as I don’t want it to sell out next year! But the staff deserve it.

When we arrived we were welcomed with fresh juice from staff who were great with the kids while we checked in. Our room was a joining room and was lovely on ground floor.  The food was great and lots to choose from everyday I have a fuzzy eater and he managed to eat pizza and meatballs.  The deserts were so yummy kids loved choosing different things. At lunch time there was a bbq outside and always something different being cooked.  We stayed at the baby pool everyday and just went over to the other pool due to having a 3 year old he loved the pool with water slide. The only issue we had was the sun brollys there is not enough at this pool with no shade here we had to keep asking for one and some days not getting one which was not good as it was so hot and needed shade. The snack can was great kids loved going here to get own drinks and snacks especially the donuts in the afternoon.  The evening entertainment was ok the kids loved mini disco. One evening we went to the nightclub with the kids and hey loved dancing the night away.

The hotel was spotlessly clean our room was great and clean. Small shampoo and shower gel are provided...take your own conditioner if you use it! They are doing their bit for the environment too by washing your towels if you leave them in the shower and only giving plastic straws if asked for which I really liked! Some of the staff who were particularly good were Hamza (animation) and Zak (on brown bus bar) Top Lads!  What is nice at this hotel is that there is different events through the day and evening too.white party cocktail party cooking by the pool fresh donuts and drinks...a bit of variety! Great!  The main pool can get a bit loud but there are sunbeds further away and also the baby pool and Zen adult pool which is deadly silent!!  Great value for money..will be back!!,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Doncaster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephd597
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,bethquad wrote a review May 2019,50,AMAZING!,My brother my sister and I stayed here for the half term week in May and we had the best time ever! From the moment we walked into the compound of the hotel the service was up there! They had welcome drinks you could help yourself too and also staff who brought them over to you as well. The hotel was well kept as well very clean! The all inclusive side of it is amazing because the food is amazing and will leave you wanting seconds. They had a food truck for snacks and drinks during the day also. There is sooo much to do around the hotel especially if you have children there are kids clubs. They have a tennis court table tennis balls trapeze volleyball etc. Enough to keep you entertained throughout your time there. The staff there who are day time entertainers are brilliant and really make you feel like you’ve known them forever. I have to shout out Hamza Khalil Raf Rony and James for their hospitality skills and just making our experience there enjoyable and worth the money. The evening entertain by the Brazilians is also not one to miss!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kim T wrote a review May 2019,50,Just perfect and great value,Travelled as a group of eight for a birthday celebration rooms were all ready upon arrival except 1 which was fab as we were early and meant we could get all our stuff in the rooms and head to the pool. It was clean and tidy and there were plenty of sun beds and umbrellas we didn’t use the zen or children’s pool but both did what they offered. The food was faultless with plenty of choice at every meal. Only negative there were a lot of mosquitoes which we were not prepared for but guess must be time of year as not experienced when travelled to Morocco before. If got any dare in you try the trapeze the guys were great.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Charlotte J wrote a review May 2019,50,"Brilliant Hotel, fabulous holiday",We have just spent a fantastic week at this hotel. We would not hesitate to go back and probably will do very soon. There is very little to be critical of really.    The hotel itself is large but spotlessly clean throughout with large beautifully maintained gardens.Reception is impressive and offers a quiet place or two away from the sun if it gets too hot throughout the day. Our room was a great size for two adults and a teenage child with a very large double bed and additional single. Ample wardrobe/cupboard space free safe and Moroccan style bathroom. It was spotless. My only complaint about the room was that we were on the ground floor our 'balcony' was nothing more than a small square with a table and chairs on. We used it to dry clothes but if you like a balcony to spend time on it might be worth asking for a more specific room when booking. We were also positioned at the back of the theatre. It was noisy till about 11 pm not the end of the world for us though but may be for some.    The food was really good. In the restaurant there was plenty of variety and something for everyone. It was well cooked. Two of our party were fussy eaters but even they managed every night. During the day it was just limitless. There are burgers hot dogs panninis crepes waffles pizza. Fresh doughnuts were made at the side of the pool nearly everyday. It was just impossible to starve. On top of that there was no limit of drinks. You can have as much as you want.    We didn't try the traditional Moroccan restaurant - because of our fussy eaters - so cannot feed back on that.    We stayed round the main 'fun' pool but there was a good kids pool and the adults Zen pool. The animation team worked so hard none stop. There's sports in and out of the pool dancing singing chef challenges cooking demonstrations etc. You could join in or you could stay on your lounger - really was up to you. They do want you to join in though and they will ask you everyday (but not relentless) as they feel they are doing their job if you are up with them joining in. It is their job after all.    Night time entertainment was good. A quiz in the bar around 7 ish and then a theatre production from about 9.30. There is also a nightclub from 11 am till 1 am. We had several parties put on whilst we were there. A white party which was drinks and dancing round the Zen pool and a Champagne party with canapes and cocktails. They really did want to make your holiday special.    The staff were fabulous and worked so hard. A couple of barman looked after us and we rewarded them at the end of our stay with a tip. We know some tip up front. It didn't seem to matter they were fabulous and we were never without a drink. Our trip was during Ramadan. It didn't seem to make a difference to either what was served to us or the staff's attitude. You just couldn't fault them.    We did take advantage of the free bus into Marrakesh to visit the Medina. It is certainly an amazing slightly crazy place to visit and something to be seen.    If I had to try and mention negative points about this hotel we would probably say that you are very much stuck in one location. You can't really go out for a stroll if you get a bit bored round the pool there's no beach for a quick walk on etc or bars to go for a wander round. The shop on the hotel is extortionate. Yes you can go into Marrakesh but that is at least 20 mins away by taxi. If you are the type to get twitchy sitting by a pool all day perhaps bear that in mind.    Overall our holiday was amazing and we will hopefully be returning to this hotel again next year. If you want a fantastic clean hotel with a great all inclusive package and stuff for the kids to do then this is the place.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charnic74

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Andi H wrote a review May 2019,40,Family trip with our baby boy - All inclusive,As you’ll see I generally don’t bother putting reviews on but this was worth getting my iPad out for. Beautiful hotel very clean ace staff great food with mountains of choice so you never need to eat the same food twice. Staff were excellent except for one grumpy porter (because I was unable to tip him for taking the bags to our room). Pools are ace with plenty of sun loungers and a poolside bar/cafe. Seperate kiddie’s pool with loads of play stuff. Adult only pool tuck out of the way if you wanted total piece. Shuttle bus that runs in to town frequently is a good service too and free.  So what’s not so good about this place honestly I’m struggling but if pushed I’d say the grumpy porter and the on site Moroccan restaurant could be better but as the buffet restaurant is so good I soon forgot about this.  They also do weekly champagne and cocktail evenings by the pool (all free) which is a lovely touch.  Tip - to get looked after even more so tip porters/bar staff and waiters a little each day they don’t forget your face then.  Would I go back - definitely.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Budapest, Hungary",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scotie2019

The weather was fantastic and the hotel grounds are very well maintained. The staff are all friendly and helpful and all work very hard to cater for your every need. Although mainly French speaking we had no problem speaking in English with them.The animation team work 24/7 and try to get everyone involved in something. Several welcome cocktail parties were laid on which was a nice surprise. There is unlimited food and drink available from many sources throughout the day and evening. The rooms were cleaned daily and Ramadan did not have any effect on how things ran at the hotel. We would definitely return.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,kist_10 wrote a review May 2019,50,Very good value!,Visited this hotel for the 4. time. You can see and feel that small improvements are being made all the time. Very clean hotel and rooms even the paint will be refreshed when its a bit dirty. Food is of a very good quality. Personally we do not like the big restaurant too big too white so we are happy to have breakfast lunch and diner on the beautiful terrace near the garden. The staff is great at the bars on the terrace and at the foodtruck. Only the WIFI needs some improvement. In the lobby its ok but in the rooms often no WIFI at all especially at busy moments. The late check out policy is not nice you have to ask for it several times have to pay for it and than still have to move your stuff to another room. Can't there be a possibility to book this in advance you know long before that you'll be having a late flight. Our agency tried to inform this before we went but they did not even get a reply to their email. Don't hesitate book this hotel you'll have a great time.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Leila K wrote a review May 2019,30,"Ok, but just ok..",Coming towards the end of a 5 night stay at the Iberostar. We have stayed at quite a few Iberostar hotels in Spain and have always been really pleased with the cleanliness and quality of food and entertainment on offer. The hotel in Marrakech is of a reasonable standard but some things do disappoint particularly the food which becomes highly repetitive when staying more than a couple of nights. There were no themed food nights and little in the way of 'cooked to order' food stations as per the Spanish hotels. Lovely big pool which is very cold and not climatised but as it was boiling hot during our stay this didn't matter. Biggest disappointment was the spa. Booked a massage as a treat and it wasn't worth the cost. There was no pre or post spa service which would be expected at a hotel - being marched straight into the massage room when you haven't even gotten changed and rushed back out at the end without so much of a drink of water isn't very relaxing! If you're keen on enjoying some treatments whilst in Marrakech save your money for Les Bain instead which is a dedicated spa in the Medina.    Overall we would definitely return to Marrakech but would probably not stay at the Iberostar.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeilaBHK

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,RexGeo wrote a review May 2019,40,Two Splendid Weeks,I recently had the pleasure of spending two weeks (Dec 8-24) at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie. As one who is used to the resort offerings in the Caribbean and Latin America it was quite a shift to experience this particular Iberostar location as well as Marrakech itself.    The Iberostar Club Palmeraie (it is apparently known by a handful of names) is located approximately thirty minutes from the Marrakech Menara airport. There are some unpleasant stories one reads about passport control there but I must have been an outlier: our wait was not long at all. But this is beyond the scope of this review. I made my own reservations for a car to take my party to the resort and I am happy that I did so as this helped us to escape the taxi gauntlet that otherwise greets those who leave the airport.    The trip from the airport to the resort will reveal one thing you’ll need to remember: the resort isn’t near anything. Across the street is a place offering quad vehicle and camel rides. Similar places are located further down the road. That’s it. There is nothing else and you’ll want to make use of the free shuttle bus (mentioned later) if you ever want to leave.    Check In:    The check-in was efficient enough. We were given cold drinks and our passports were needed to fill out a form with our general information. After this we were given a fairly extensive orientation as to the features of the resort the restaurant hours and so forth. We met several staff members all of whom seemed invested in our enjoyment of our stay.    One thing to note is the need to pay local and resort taxes upon your arrival. This kind of thing should be included in the price one pays when they book but in our case it was not. The amount isn’t large but it is a small nuisance worth noting.    Shuttle Bus:    The resort runs a free bus that travels to Marrakech dropping you off near the Place de la Liberté. There are six departures per day and six return times. The earliest departure from the resort is 9:00 with the final return trip leaving Marrakech at 22:30. This is an invaluable perk and anyone wishing to visit Marrakech (and you really should!) would be advised to take advantage of it. The buses are punctual too which is great.    The Room:    We had a double twin bed room. This is an interesting arrangement because it is what it sounds like: two beds pushed together. The beds are made separately each having their own linens. If you’re traveling as a couple take note. The beds are a little on the stiff side but I never had issues sleeping on them.    Your room key card is required in order to turn on the electricity to the room. The plugs are the standard European variety. North Americans will require an adapter here.    The bathroom featured two opaque doors that pulled shut. The toilet shares the same room with the sink and shower. The toilet was stocked with two small rolls of toilet paper. This works - until you have a bit of a bad day in which case you will likely be paying reception a visit to request more toilet paper.    There is one bottle of mineral water provided in the room upon arrival. However despite the presence of a mini-fridge it is not stocked. Even other Iberostar resorts would normally have a stocked minibar so this omission does seem a little strange. Thus if the restaurants and bars are closed you have no food or drink. Hopefully you are never faced with this situation.    There is a television with channels available in a number of languages. There are around 4 English channels with the remainder being mostly Arabic French German and Italian (roughly in this order). The English channels were: CNN International CNBC Europe Bloomberg Europe and BBC World (the BBC channel never actually worked when we were there).    There is a heater at your disposal if you need it. Having visited in December we did need it as the nights saw temperatures in the single digits. The heater worked quite well in our experience.    Ours was a second floor room so we had a balcony. The view was nothing special because we didn’t pay for a view. The balcony had a small table two chairs and a place to hang clothes. The sliding door would often be covered in condensation after taking a shower. The high humidity level in the room may have contributed to the very notable presence of mold behind the room’s couch.    The rooms do not insulate well against noise. If your upstairs neighbour likes to walk around or move their furniture you’ll feel as if you’re in the room with them. Also at around 1 am when the last of the bars are closed you’re going to know it as the drunks make their way back to their rooms.    The Pools:    There are three pools at this resort.    The main pool has many loungers and umbrellas and is a very short walk to the food truck (or even the main bar if you prefer). It is however not heated. Given that we stayed during December and Marrakech is not as warm as the tropics during this time it was understandable to see few people swimming in the unheated pools.    There is a child-oriented splash pool but we never spent any time there so I won’t comment other than to mention it exists.    The heated ‘Zen’ pool is where most of the action seemed to be during our stay. It saw a fairly regular number of swimmers though even this pool was a bit on the cool side unless the temperatures were reaching around 23 or above. This pool has its own bar and Youssef always remembered our usual drinks. There were plenty of loungers and umbrellas though we were not there at high season. I would note that smoking is allowed here and you will encounter people doing it. Prepare to move a few times if this bothers you. Also the umbrellas cannot be opened without a small rod that only staff members seem to have in their possession.    We were fortunate in that we never experienced a day where the high temperature was below 20. I would say that it reached around 25 on most days making the pool a good place to be. However you’d need to wait until close to 10:30 or 11:00 for the air to heat up.    The resort’s towel policy was perplexing not only to us but to other guests with whom we spoke. One was required to pay 100 dirham for a towel card - it was not included in the “all-inclusive” package! This is actually a deposit and you receive it back at the end of your stay. That policy was a first for us at any resort.    Tipping:    There does not seem to be a tipping culture here certainly nothing on the level of what one gets used to in the Caribbean. Staff at this resort were always helpful and pleasant without any expectation of anything extra. This is not to state that you cannot tip at all but it isn’t ubiquitous.    Activities:    There was no shortage in the way of daytime activities at the resort. There were tennis and badminton courts pétanque (not really a North American thing but this is for the French crowd) archery trapeze and a basketball court (albeit with bent hoops). In a bit of a hidden feature one could find a pen filled with animals at the rear of the resort: sheep goats peacocks rabbits turkeys chickens pigeons and pheasants were all present. You could also find a group of tempestuous geese roaming around and they sometimes became aggressive if you got too close.    We didn’t partake much of the evening activities but the resort does have a discotheque and a theatre where one can watch shows. We did check out the Moroccan show which had belly dancers and some talented gymnasts.    Fitness Room:    The resort fitness room is equipped with a few treadmills exercise bikes and stepping machines for cardio. They all seemed to work when we were there. There was also a chest machine and a shoulder machine that seemed to work well enough and each offered a wide range of resistance levels.    A weight bench is present but without a lot of actual weight. The bar may weigh around 10 kilos and there were around 40 kilos of plates (so 20 per side) to be had.    There were a lot of dumbells. The problem? Nearly all of them were 0.5kg or 1.0kg. A set of heavier dumbbells (up to at least 20 kilos if not more) would have been nice.    There were a few other machines that offered resistance training. One was broken. One seemed to train abs and another may have been for chest. They had levels ranging from 1 to 6 with 6 not being particularly challenging for a fit person.    A refrigerator was present in the fitness room and sometimes it was stocked with bottled water. A mirror was set up at the far end although this was nowhere near the weights.    The fitness room hours were a mystery. Depending upon who you asked it seemed to change. Sometimes it would be open at 7 am (probably because it wasn’t locked the night before). Sometimes it wouldn’t open until 10 am.    The Food:    There are two restaurants the Moroccan and the buffet. In keeping with Iberostar practice seen elsewhere you can book the Moroccan once per stay. We skipped it entirely and stuck with the buffet. We have no regrets about that.    The buffet proved to be quite good for our needs. We received excellent service from Rachida and Naima (one of the chefs) was very helpful. I should add that you’ll be benefited by speaking French. If you have questions about the food French will likely get you a bit further than English.    Vegans should take solace in knowing that there is plenty here for you to eat with the catch that you’re going to be eating a lot of tagine. If you don’t mind this then there will be vegan options for both lunch and dinner from that section. My vegan partner was very satisfied overall. Breakfast will be more difficult for you but you won't starve    Non-vegans may enjoy the tagines as well as some did contain meat.    The rest of the buffet (the vast majority) was more or less the kind of food that would appeal to Europeans and North Americans. There was a salad bar (which had selections of cheeses as well). One could always find pizza for lunch and dinner if that was your thing or pasta. There was always a large selection of bread.    There were theme nights. Some nights that might include even more Moroccan fare (complete with musicians) or things like sushi.    Drink selection at the buffet included red white and rose wines as well as the local beer on tap (Casablanca) as well as pop. For breakfast there were coffee machines as well Moroccan tea.    The dessert table always had fresh fruit and a huge array of cakes and pastries. Chocolate fondue (not at the same table) was a common feature.    Near the main pool you can also find the Food Truck. This is where one can find what I’d term snacks and lunch-type fare throughout the day. I rarely made use of this truck but among the things you can find here include crepes waffles and sandwiches.    The Bars:    I’ve already mentioned the bar at the Zen Pool. The hours of that bar are roughly 10:00 to 17:00. After that there is the main bar located near the restaurants. This bar opens in the morning and closes at around 23:00. This bar serves the best drinks in the resort and they’ll remember your order if you’re a regular.    I should note that not all drinks are included in the “all-inclusive” package. For instance if you’re a scotch drinker you’ll be getting King Charles in your drinks. If you want something else you’re expected to pay for it. There aren’t any truly high end spirits to be had so you won’t be paying for anything exceptional. But I never had a complaint with the drinks I got.    Note that the theatre and disco also have bars but I did not personally make use of them.    On the whole the resort offered a pleasant stay and the experience would have satisfied most who are familiar with all-inclusive experiences in places like the Caribbean.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Gatineau, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RexGeo

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,juliedavid2015 wrote a review May 2019,50,Exceeded our expectations and we WILL be going back!,We came to the iberostar as a family of 3 girls. My sister in law Paula who is Downs Syndrome being one of our group. I was a bit apprehensive about bringing her to Marrakesh but I needn’t have worried at all. I couldn’t have wished for a better holiday destination or hotel. From arrival until departure we were treated with such kindness and utmost respect. People went out of their way to smile compliment and talk to Paula and she felt like royalty throughout our stay. All the hotel staff at the Iberostar were nothing less than fabulous. Everyone and I mean everyone were so friendly and welcoming. Paula got so much attention and was spoilt by the staff with lots of love and affection. Unfortunately I cannot remember everyone’s names but the 2 staff who made our holiday were definitely Rony and Hamza. They were so attentive and went out of their way to come over and make a fuss of Paula and to also check we were all ok. They were so kind and so much fun too. Considering it is Ramadan and they were fasting all day they were always upbeat and full of energy. They were so full of high spirits you never would have known. They literally made our holiday due to the constant smiles they put on all our faces. THANK YOU Rony and Hamza..... you are very special guys and a real credit to the hotel because of you we will be back again this year and will be recommending the Iberostar to all our friends and family. You are 10 out of 10! Our hotel room was big and kept immaculately clean. The food was 5 star and catered for every taste. The pools were great (one adult one family and one children’s). Please feel free to message me with any questions. A last shout out to the lovely entertainment manager (sorry I forgot your name) the lovely Khalil James and barman Soufian who remembered my drink every night and not forgetting to mention the front of house manager Mohammed Ali who I will be contacting soon to let him know when we are coming again.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,StuInSutton wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Minor headache on arrival but brilliant,Here now and would highly recommend.    We did have a hiccup with our rooms but that got sorted.    Place is spotlessly clean. Food is good with plenty of choice. Staff are superbly friendly and always keen to help.    Two particular members of staff who have stuck out are Medhi and Khalu on the entertainment staff. Very friendly chats with the children.    If you are coming as a brit be aware that it is mostly French speaking and most stuff is in French. Not a problem as all staff do speak English if you can't do French.    Things that I would suggest can be a bit off:    There is Wifi throughout the hotel it is hopeless. They could do with getting that sorted. Connection is intermittent and hopelessly unreliable.    There are three pools. Only one is heated. At least they claim it is heated. It is still distinctly cold. Other guests told us the other two are too cold at the moment to even consider using. This would not be an issue but it is badged as a 'quiet pool for adults'. This is a family friendly hotel. People with kids want to take them to the pool. When the only really usable one is supposed to be adults only this is not great. I do think this needs a rethink. Especially as they will let children in and then complain when they act like children and make a bit of noise. They really should get the main pool heated to a usable temperature.    We are in the second block of rooms away from the main building. Plus for this it is reasonably quiet. Downside is that I am guessing the water system needs an upgrade. Pick the wrong time for your shower and it can be a little lacking.    In spite of my moans I would go back and I would recommend this hotel,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,Sutton Coldfield UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuInSutton

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,TH06MAY wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Long weekend break,We stayed here for a three night break with another couple. The staff were really friendly and despite being full the tables in the restaurant were always available - the guys work really hard to clean replenish the cutlery remove dirty plates and top up the drinks. Although it was all inclusive we tipped the staff a couple of £ each time in local currency which they seemed to appreciate. Facilities were good and bed was comfortable. Only downsides for us were that the Moroccan restaurant was hyped up to be an experience but the food was dreadful if my opinion. The beef tagines were totally tasteless... the tagines in the buffet were far better. The unbranded alcohol wasn’t too nice - I tried the gin and whiskey but stuck to red wine after that. Would I return? Yes it was nice for a short break and the complimentary coach into town was a bonus.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Rachel Hills wrote a review Apr 2019,50,"Fantastic holiday, would love to return!",We have just returned from an amazing 2 week holiday at Iberostar Club Palmeraie There were 6 in our party grandparents parents and two boys aged 14 and 8. We all agreed that it was one of the most fun and relaxing holidays we have had together.  The hotel is in the middle of nowhere so you can’t walk out from the gates really but they pull out all the stops to ensure you have everything you need in the grounds (there are plenty of great trips to take and a hotel shuttle bus to Marrakesh centre if you want to get out and about).  The gardens are immaculate and beautiful the hotel is constantly being cleaned to a high standard and food and drink is plentiful as mentioned in other reviews the fab bar staff will remember your order and just keep bringing you drinks over (Salah is a star bar man)    I have to say all the staff work so hard and are very friendly they never stop smiling (which must be hard when it can get so hot!) I felt they all wanted us to have the best time.    My youngest son William my mum Lola and I would like to give a special mention to the entertainment team especially Khalil James Amine Ronny and the very funny Mahin these young guys all worked constantly to keep everyone entertained and kept motivated even when working 18 hour days! They can all speak multiple languages and constantly check that everyone French Dutch German Arabic and English are having a good time. We’d like to say thank you to them for helping us have such a fun holiday.    Also the stand out waitress fro me was Jehanne she was so pleasant and attentive she came across as really wanting you to have the best time possible.    The only down side for me is that when I’ve gone to book again for next Easter - Thomas Cook have almost doubled the price for a family of 4? Not sure why they’ve done that - we hope to be back if I can find another deal!    Thanks again Iberostar Club Palmeraie lots of fun memories and quality family time had by all.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Charlotte wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Wonderful destination for all!,Once we had booked our family holiday to Morocco it is fair to say that I was not quite sure what to expect considering I had never stayed at an Iberostar nor had I stayed in Morocco however I am so happy to say that my family and I could not have asked for a better short break over the Easter Holidays. Upon arrival we were taken to the hotel by a very efficient taxi company and it was lovely to see the streets of Morocco which are so very different than what we are used to seeing in the UK! The exterior of the hotel is absolutely beautiful with flowers surrounding the whole of the building we were welcomed by lovely staff who were very accommodating and helpful. The lobby always smelt wonderful and stayed clean throughout the whole of the trip! Each of us were asked to fill in a slip whilst we were given welcome drinks which meant a very relaxed quick check in! The rooms were absolutely lovely and extremely clean which is always very important to us as a family we paid extra for a pool view (one room had a much better view than the other) so it was always nice to be able to see the action even if we wanted to rest in the room in the afternoon. At lunch and dinner the food was typically the same as each other however there was so much option that you could never get bored! There are meal options for everyone such as pizza pasta and chips as well as some traditional Moroccan dishes. There are two pools at the hotel the Zen Pool and The slightly larger one which is the centre point of the property. The Zen pool was typically a lot busier due to the fact that the pool is heated however I found that once in and moving in the larger pool you were warmed up quickly! There are plenty of seats and umbrellas around each pool as well as having places to grab a drink/snack to go (which is great because it is all inclusive therefore it saves a lot of money compared to other hotels) The staff typically walked around the pool trying to get people to join in with activities (they are not compulsory!) they were always extremely friendly they all spoke excellent English and by the end of the trip you got to the stage where we had inside jokes and regulars that would come up to us! In the evening there are shows that start at 9:30 which are always fun to watch as some light entertainment. There are tennis courts basket ball courts goals etc if you want to play something during the day which was a lovely bonus as you could hire a ball rackets for free! My only complaint would be the noise level of music throughout the night although you can request a quiet room to avoid this issue which I would recommend if you have young children therefore if you are looking for some peace and quiet I wouldn't suggest requesting a pool view! Thank you so much to the Iberostar for such a wonderful holiday!,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottetravels123
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,SpinningSpider1 wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Lovely resort for some winter sunshine,Stayed here during the Easter school holidays 31st March - 14th April. First week it was very quiet as not many children however the second week exploded with large arrivals every day so there was quite a contrast between the two weeks.  Overall we had a lovely holiday plenty of activities should you wish to partake the staff go beyond to ensure you are well looked after you can see the interaction with the guests throughout the resort. Big shout out to the guys on the trapeze team great with the kids and adults plus the young chap Salah at the Zen Pool Bar who single handed looked after the bar from 10 - 6 once he got to know your favourite drink he would bring it round on a tray for you without asking... sure he has a sixth sense!    There was some policies they don't adhere to such as men wearing shorts in the restaurant at night (my husband took long trousers as specified) and the Zen pool (advertised as adult only) was full of kids on our second week the main pool was so cold everyone headed to the adult zen pool as it was heated. The signs are confusing about the age policy one states no kids under 16 years and the other kids under 12 years can be accompanied with an adult the lifeguard tried to control the noise but some afternoons it was rather noisy it spoiled the ambiance. Really felt those adults who booked this hotel based on the adult pool feature. Another pet hate is the reserving of sun loungers especially during the second week around the Zen Pool it is against the hotel policy but there is no policing some have towels placed on but not used for a few hours seemed to get earlier each morning.    You can read all other reviews however my tips would be    Rooms - ask for a room away from the reception area it can become rather noisy at night also ask for one on the top floor we had one on the 2nd floor and you can hear noise from the floor above due to the tiled floor.    Hairdryer - ladies if you have long or thick hair I would take your own there is one in fixed to wall in the bathroom but its so slow and cuts out after a few minutes.    Currency Exchange - offer a great exchange rate however unable to change back to GBP on departure can only do this at the airport or in the souks.    For a different side of Morocco take a day trip to the Atlas Mountains and the Berbier Villages stunning scenery and fascinating insight.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpinningSpider1

Others played golf on external courses or took tours . The Atlas Mountain trip was very worthwhile.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Lachelle Ebanks wrote a review Apr 2019,20,WIFI WAS DREADFUL!,Stayed here for 7 nights with my teenage brother and dad. Overall I would rate the hotel 5/10 and here’s why...    In my opinion it didn’t feel like a four star hotel. The staff at reception are welcoming upon approach and drinks available as you arrive. You have to pay city fees which you are not pre-warned about before you check in to your room.    LOCATION: Hotel is located in the middle of no where and you are forced to take a dusty hot coach on a 15 minute drive every time you want to get to the town. There are no shops or restaurants that are walking distance. This made us feel restricted as we constantly had to rely on the coach facilities and couldn’t just go out when we wanted.    SURROUNDINGS: The madina of Marrakech is definitely A stressful experience. The locals attempt to sell you everything you can possible think of from every angle. The fumes are so bad from the hustle and bustle and it’s hard to breathe. Also very dangerous as there are loads of motorcycles/bikes riding in and out of traffic. No one seems to care about pedestrians. If your buying anything don’t except the first price! Did manage to haggle some nice souvenirs nevertheless.    FOOD: There is a lot of choice and variation if you are someone that enjoys eating meat and salads. The hotel put on themed evenings for dinner.    If you are a vegan or vegetarian like us there isn’t much choice at all. Ate the same food for the week I spent here which often gave me a stomach ache. This consisted off chickpeas chips rice bread lentils and aubergine curry! The food isn’t labelled very well and we often had to guess what things were. The staff in the dining hall are very friendly and welcoming! They clean the tables promptly and always have a smile on their faces.    FACILITIES IN THE HOTEL: The hotel has a spa facility the staff in there were quite hostile. We booked to have a session in the steam room and wasn’t told we had to pay for the service. Arrived there and had to be turned away as we didn’t take money out with us. Was so frustrating and such a lack of basic customer service! The hotel has a small gym which serves its purpose but nothing special. The hotel reps are very lively and often put on shows in the hotel bar. This is definitely not everyone’s cup of tea and became very annoying constantly listening to French music and karaoke.    BE WARNED: The WiFi connection is terrible your unable to make any phone calls or watch any videos. Internet constantly buffers and disconnects. I was forced to use my mobile data and which meant I was charged from my network provider. The hotel really needs to address this for a four star hotel there should be decent internet connection through out.    ON THE PLUS SIDE: the hotel is very beautifully designed gardens well kept and furniture clean and tidy! rooms are maintained well very clean and beds comfortable. The hotel puts on a lot of sporting activities and facilities for children and families. Lots of space to sunbathe and 2 massive pools sports ground as well as a children’s play area. The hotel has a food truck which serves drinks burgers and waffles etc through out the day which was a nice touch! However again no options for vegans or vegetarians!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lachelleebanks

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,makoshr wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Brilliant week in a fabulous hotel,My friend and I have just enjoyed a brilliant week at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie. The hotel far exceeded our expectations and having constantly read in other reviews how good the staff are we totally agree. The staff made such a difference to our holiday. We met some lovely people on holiday and the animation team really went out of their way to ensure guests engaged with each other (if they wanted to) and all had a great time. There is a huge animation team and they are all lovely people. Also there is a dance troupe who put on shows every night which is nice to watch.  The management from the General Manager to the Customer Relations Manager were constantly walking around the resort ensuring everyone was happy.  The grounds are huge and there are lovely walks around the tree and flower filled gardens. I loved these in the early morning the birdsong was so nice to hear.  My friend is 79 years old and really enjoyed the archery golf and boulles with lessons from the golf pro which she loved. I did not do a great deal of the organised games and sports of which there were more than I have ever seen in other hotels. I did however swim throughout each day. There is a heated adults only pool (the Zen pool) but I felt it was a bit small and enclosed for my taste. I used the main pool which is unheated and is definitely cold - even feeling icy in the mornings. However I don't mind cold water and enjoyed swimming in this lovely pool. The Zen pool only has ladders going into it but there are steps into the main pool for easier access. There is also a children's pool and area which looked excellent and the team looking after the kids club seemed to be doing an really good job - again the best I have seen. Special mention to the lifeguard Zacariah who along with his colleague do a brilliant job looking after the pool and guests. You only have to touch a pool umbrella and one of them is round to put it up for you!  Pool towels are to be had a deposit of 100 drihams each which you get back when you return your towels at the end of your holiday (handy for tips). You can change your towels as often as you want to at the Animation booth beside the exercise area midway between the pools.  We enjoyed the food and restaurant very much and the variety was excellent. There is always Moroccan food on offer which we loved along with International food and a food station that changed each day - sometimes it was paninis sometimes specialising in chocolate! The winner for my friend as a veggie was the variety of veg and salad which we both enjoyed. The desserts are to die for with much better taste than you often find in an All Inclusive hotel. Meat and fish were also available at each meal in a variety of types. The chefs were really good at helping my veggie friend find food better labelling would help a great deal here I think. Thanks to Mamadou the chef who made our holiday special. Also the restaurant staff are so nice thank you Taki and the ladies for looking after us so well. BTW the red wine was lovely!  We didn't eat at the bus food station beside the pool but the food looked very nice with huge crepes and nice looking burgers etc.  The room we had was ground floor and I requested this in advance due to walking difficulties. It suited us really well and was a lovely room with comfortable clean beds and a fab walk in shower. The chambermaids were very nice and helpful. However we did struggle to get another pillow. Eventually we asked Hassan the Customer Service Manager and the pillow appeared immediately. (Thank you Hassan). Toiletries contain Argan Oil and are nice to use. Fridge has a bottle of water in it on arrival which is not replenished but you can pick up as much as you want from all the different bars.  A special mention to Ytab (I think) the tall barman with the braces who made special low calorie mojitos for me. Yum they were fab and along with the wine I really enjoyed the alcohol in this hotel.  We used the free coach into the centre of Marrakech which runs throughout the day and evening. It does stop quite far from the square tho but we only paid 20 dirhams for a taxi into the centre. They do pass the Jardin Marjorelle on the way to their drop off point and the driver asks if anybody wants to get off there.  So all in all and excellent holiday that would suit all ages. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anybody.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Thornton Cleveleys, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/makoshr
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Emily W wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Fabulous stay with our 1 year old,Had a fab five nights all inclusive here with my husband and one year old. The staff are so welcoming and warm they make lots of effort to great a lovely atmosphere and were very warm and friendly to the children. This was especially apparent when there was a rainy day and the staff seemed to go to lots of effort to make it a fun day all the same. There is a very large buffet for lunch and dinner the food was lovely - Moroccan Italian bbq paella amongst other things. It’s fairly similar each day but that works fine as there’s so much to choose from.  The splash pool is awesome for little ones to play in and there’s tons of loungers around it so you can try to combine chilling and playing / supervising :). There’s also a little play area which we used a lot. There is a really busy timetable of sporty activities available to dip into if you fancy (I wasn’t aware of this beforehand it was a great bonus).  We treated ourselves to a ‘suite’ room so we had space for the toddler to run about and it was lovely really big sitting room area and two bathrooms.  The shuttle bus into the city was really reliable and a frequent timetable which made the location (outside the city) totally workable.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilywR5367QQ
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Martin A wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Four stars because of the staff,We travelled to Marrakech for some sun and a little culture. The hotel is much as we expected having read the previous reviews. It was very clean and the staff were very helpful and pleasant hence the 4 stars. The food was much as expected for an all inclusive buffet with more local dishes than average.  The weather was not great during our stay which left a limited number of options within the hotel although the staff did their best to provide some entertainment. The wi-fi is okay in the communal areas but was very poor in our room.  The main problem was the noise in the room. Noise came from the stairs corridors upstairs and next door. The communal areas also tended to be loud unpleasantly so at times.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Buckingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MartinA857
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,suzeb55 wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Wonderful place for relaxing and chilling,I stayed here at the of March 2019 it was just perfect from start to finish. We were greeted at the gates by a porter who took our bags then directed to a wonderful seating area with iced drinks basically check in comes to you.. this was the first time of all inclusive and after reading some of the reviews on here I was a little sceptical about the whole package. I should not of worried.  There are bars eateries and coffee virtually everywhere in the grounds and hotel. The grounds were absolutely amazing and so much space for a wonderful walk or just to have a different view. The pool (adults only) was amazing it was quiet the staff were discreet the only disturbance was the water aerobics that’s if you wanted to be disturbed for 30 minutes(no music just spoken instructions and did not disturb me reading ).  Now for the food.. I cannot understand the reviews about the food offering I was there 7 full days and not once was the main dishes the same. There are plenty of things that are “favourites” but you can quite easily have different food at every meal everything is fresh the dishes are replaced and not topped up with a barbecue station at lunchtime.  Salad fruit cold meats and cheese are always there to mix and match if you want something lighter before tackling the patisserie counter!! An absolute work of art and as delicious. If you are looking for fish and chips or a full English then I think you will be disappointed..  There are many places for leisure activities such as excellent fitness classes there is entertainment every evening in the bar and the theatre where everyone of all nationalities will mix together “No Brexit here”.  Free bus service to and from Marrakesh itself which we made full use of and picked up the Red Bus Tour opposite the drop off  However the unique selling point of the hotel has to be the staff informed helpful discreet and most of all happy the perfect combination for a great working environment.  My only issue or gripe would be I would of liked to have seen maybe more leaflets for trips out/bus tours etc for those who are not with a travel company however this may well be a corporate issue rather than the hotel but WiFi is free so you can source all independent trips on line.  There is a Spa here but run by an outside company you need to pay in cash when you book. The haman and body scrub is a must I plumped for a massage package including pedicure and facial however not sure that pedicure and facial are the same as we get at home. But after the superb massage those things paled into the background.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Wembley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzeb55
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Frankieandcharl wrote a review Apr 2019,50,An excellent all-rounder,Truth being told we were not sure what to expect from our stay at the Iberostar.    We spent 5 days there following a shorter cultural stay in the Medina and were looking forward to a bit of pool/sun/easy food/fun.    The weather was a little disappointing but the hotel management did very well to impress us.    The grounds are impeccable and the pools are extremely clean (a must for us)    Our kids found a lot to do there and felt welcome all the way through the stay. A clever separation of pools/rooms quarters will discreetly park families with children away from some couples looking for peace and quiet.    The rooms are actually quite simple (lay-out design but we thought many little things worked out well such as the good beds an excellent choice of TV programs and easy access to the grounds from our room.    The food standards are high and the choice of dishes is totally acceptable for a four-star. The house wine is also perfectly fine and you can eat both inside and outside.    (And yes as many fellow TA writers say the coffee is not so good so you will just have to walk 50 meters to the well catered bar to bring some nice coffee back to your room or to your table)    Lastly we thought most of the staff looked happy to work there and tried hard to communicate with all the guests in an informal and friendly way.    Our older child loved the evening entertainment too!    We would usually stay in 5-star resorts but this one is incomparable value for money and a true four star with bags of character and a nice mixed crowd including many locals.    Rooms with pool and atlas mountain views are probably pricier but better...but just for the view. Every room looks otherwise the same.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frankieandcharl
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,TimJoandHenry wrote a review Apr 2019,30,"Beautiful hotel, but SO Noisy!",This is a beautiful hotel. The grounds are vast and perfectly manicured. The staff couldn’t be more helpful and are always on hand. The food is varied and there is plenty on offer for all tastes.    But it is just so noisy. You can’t escape it. The pool has music playing all day (the Zen pool doesn’t but with a 12 year old you are not allowed there. Something that is NOT made clear on any web page. Also this is the only heated pool. So kids and adults with kids have to slowly freeze in the main pool). So back to the noise. The bar area has constant music inside and out and live entertainment in the evening. Too loud to hold a conversation.    All of this would be forgiven if you could actually go back to your room for some peace and quiet. Every night woken multiple times by people coming and going from rooms and shouting in corridors. On top of that staff start cleaning very early so trolleys being dragged around and doors slammed doesn’t help. Add to this the most hard uncomfortable beds I have ever slept in mean I’m going home for a rest.    Maybe I’m a grump and people like constant noise and entertainment a hard bed and sleep deprivation but not me    But as I said the hotel grounds and staff are great,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimJoandHenry

The restaurant has a wonderful spread and choice of buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner. The chefs are really imaginative! There is also a special Morrocan restaurant that you need to book in advance - but well worth it! There are sports and animations each day for those who wish to participate and children of all ages are well catered for. There are also many evening events so if you are not a night-bird it would be wise to ask for a quiet room!

The Moroccan restaurant very slow service took 1 hour to get main course and portions very small we had to leave early and go into main buffet as we was all so hungry.    And ants in our room we didnt have food in the room just bottles of water but there were many ants maybe dont ask for garden view.

The food was delicious- especially on Moroccan night. The entertainment team was superb- they worked very hard to include everyone and make sure everyone was having a good time. A special thank you to: Khalid Hamid Morad and Rory. They were always so friendly and ensured we had a great time! Archery was lots of fun as was trapeze and 'Master Chef'. The zen pool was nice and relaxing. The food truck burgers and hot dogs were delicious! The shows at night and the dancers were so much fun to watch.

The animation team are also good fun - they try and get you involved but certainly aren't pushy!    All in all a great hotel for a good price with beautiful weather. What more can you ask for!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,murad m wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Average,"The hotel in general is very clean the pools and hotel grounds are also very well looked after but the rooms are average. No tea or coffee facilities completly empty mini bar although we where staying ""ALL INCLUSIVE"". No slippers or robes and we had two single beds pushed next to each other as a double bed.    Food choices plenty in the main open buffet restaurant but dinning facilities are limited.    Onlly one main buffet restaurant serving breakfast lunch and dinner and one A la cart only open in the evenings. There are no smoking restrictions in any outside spaces which is not very comfortable when dinning if you are a no smoker.    Snacks in between just a van by the pool for hotdogs crepes and burgers not many choices and nothing available after evening dinner if you want a late night nibble...    The gym was the major let down for me no dumbles running machines out of order one bar and and no clips for the 4 * 7.5 kg plates no water in the fridge no towels but there is not much you can sweat on anyway... Steam room only available with reservation and no sauna it does have a hamam but all comes with extra cost although we were staying ""ALL INCLUSIVE"".    Bars and entertainment limited. House wine and beer on tap no limit but spirits; Gordons gin smirnoff vodka Jack Daniels Bacardi all come with extra cost although we were staying ""ALL INCLUSIVE."" and no nuts or crisps or anything to nibble on with your drinks. Local spirits are available in the package.    They have a range of cocktails but I didnt see the barmen using a shaker at all so not sure how good the cocktails where.    Entertainment mainly loud and funky as it should be during the day but not during the evening dinner next to the restaurant when you want to have a quite dinner and enjoy your wine and food.    Internet available but very bad connection more or less only connectable in the lobby area...    The best thing about this resort is the staff most of them friendly but English language is limited.    Abdel could not have done more for us when dinning he looked after us very well again Leyla extremly friendly and helpful...    Momo a member of the kitchen by coincidence noticed us walking in town and asked if we needed any help. When we told him we was looking to buy Argan oil he changed his way and took us to the cooperative where we could find the original oil for the best price....say no more!!    All Inclusive board is not really the correct definition for the package they offer and for the same price many other alternatives with nothing extra to pay with plenty more dinning and drinking facilities are available..to my experiance not good for the value.    .    .",Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836muradm

It is not long haul and this was my first experience of all inclusive. We have travelled in many areas of the world. We both thought this was a fantastic place and can with hand on heart say we enjoyed every minute of it. The staff were charming and helpful in the extreme ( not according to some folks on here!!) - believe us from the cleaning staff to the kitchen staff to the desk staff bar staff entertainment staff and of course the management staff - they were attentive caring and were intent on giving you a great time. The grounds are well kept and the bedrooms clean and well appointed. A small suggestion to put a hand rail in the shower would be a help ?  The buffet food is well cooked and well presented. The choice is excellent. The a la carte restaurant is simply beautiful and atmospheric with live traditional music.  There is entertainment of all sorts in the theatre and you can join in or watch as much as you like. There is also daily aquarobics / activities including archery trapeze / football fitness equipment - the list is endless. It is all very well organised and supervised.  The hotel is situated outside the bedlam of Marrakesh but there is the shuttle bus.  The proof of the pudding as they say is in the eating??? Would you return to Iberostar and we can quite categorically say we most certainly would. It met all our needs and more. In fact we would go for longer than the 7 days it was that good.  We cannot mention all the staff who made our stay so enjoyable but Youness . Youssef / Hadiki ( sorry the young girl in the bar) and the many waiters in the outside areas who were just great added to what was a superb holiday.

When I arrived there it felt as if I never left the place and if I have to be completely honest it's even better. The weather was beautiful and hot. The marquee was still there if you want to eat outside however in the terrace outside the restaurant is really nice to eat because you can see the sun going down and the sky beautifully red. The days are now getting longer over there  When I arrived at the hotel that night after 10pm the Porter said something about eating before I go to my room. As I was feeling tired I declined and said thank you for the offer and he took my luggage to my room. To my surprise there was a plated selection of fruits and cakes and various drinks in the fridge and a robe and slippers.  Members of staff as ever polite kind and helpful and friendly truly look after you.In the restaurant again you are spoilt for choice.  They have a new""guest relation manager ""who is very pleasant indeed and making sure that you are comfortable.  Everything in the hotel is just how it should be. One thing that you will always notice is the presence of the management team around which I find excellent.  I also like the cocktail party once a week get together.  At the end of my stay I was given a bouquet of flowers with roses carnations and iris so so beautiful.

The reception team the management the entertainment team excellent.  I travel to Marrakech every year and this is the best hotel I ve stayed in. The hotel is kept immaculate at all times the staff are on hand all the time and fantastic customer service. The room was spacious and clean fantastic shower room . All inclusive was awesome and plentiful a great variety for everyone. Staff once again always on hand cater to your every need .  Beautiful surroundings and views even there own lake .  Stunning views with lots of activities and a tv room  relaxing bar lobby had entertainment hall.  They have a spa in the hotel where I had a hammam massage unbelievably relaxing and staff once again great!  Im struggling to find a fault! A special thank you to Mohamed in the reception team  the managers who took there time to make sure everything is faultless and making every single person staying at the hotel feel welcome and at home.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Marrakech as a top class rating you will not be disappointed.  Looking forward to coming back !

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Elizabeth O wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Almost perfect,My husband and I have just spent 5 nights at the Iberostar Palmeraie - our first visit to Marrakesh. We were amazed at the excellent level of customer service that was offered to us by every member of staff without exception. The cleanliness of the hotel was second to none and staff worked tirelessly to ensure everywhere was spotlessly clean. The food was of a high quality - fresh ingredients beautifully presented and plenty of choice. Good standard of local drinks.  Gardens and grounds - an oasis of peace and tranquility.  The only downside was the Zen pool- our experience was spoilt by children being allowed to  use the pool - despite there being 2 others which they could use. Children should be allowed to laugh have fun and make noise - not in the Zen pool. Nor should adults be allowed to shout swear and generally disrupt the peace - as witnessed by a hen party . There were 2 other pools where people could make as much noise as they wanted -not in the Zen pool. If the Zen pool was not meant to offer peace and tranquility it should not be advertised as such.  My review would have offered 5 stars but fir the issues with the Zen pool,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabetho470
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Tony from Surrey wrote a review Mar 2019,50,winter sun,We had 2 weeks here from 26 Feb this year. Lovely hotel set in its own grounds about 20 mins from the city all rooms are the same with comfortable beds and walk in shower dining room nice and comfy where you will find all the staff very friendly and helpful wide range of food on the buffet plentiful salad bar so much choice and fresh some times the hot food was not what I call hot deserts good to many cake type nothing hot well worth looking at wine we thought was very drinkable we enjoyed them we found the coffee machine not too good from the bar was so much better and hot. nice play area and pool for the little ones two swimming pools and lots of loungers  plenty to do and nice walk around the grounds. shame reception got our booking wrong. We will go back to this friendly clean and comfortable hotel.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Effingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyC3226

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Pound50 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Great week,Having never been to Marrakech before we really didn’t know what to expect. The Iberostar was lovely from start to finish. It’s a way out of the main area but supplies a shuttle service several times a day. The staff couldn’t do enough for you. Bahir welcomed us with all the details of our room and helped us through our stay right up to the last day. Room was very spacious and had a mini fridge and we had opted for an Atlas Mountain view. Our only complaint would be no availability of irons and ironing boards there is a laundry service which we did make use of but availability of an iron would have been better. As we arrived in the middle of the day we made use of the spa and had the Hamman to get our bodies ready for the sun and then later in the week we went back for a full body massage would recommend both. The food is very varied buffet at each meal time and a different theme each night on one section. There is also a separate restaurant where you can experience a more intimate dinner we did this once as we were advised that the menu is the same each night it was a lovely change from a very busy atmosphere at the buffet. Most of the time we spent at the Zen pool and were looked after at the bar Salah it gets busy and they say not to reserve beds but lots of people do only one bad experience here which was nothing to do with the hotel we encountered a very rude French women who decided she was going to use the canopied are we were in without even asking. At breakfast and lunch Rachida looked after us lovely lady always helpful and smiling. This is one place we would definitely recommend and hope to return to in the future. Thank you to all the staff for making this a great holiday for us,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Southampton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pound50

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Karen S wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Totally amazing,This is our 5th trip to Marrakesh and we decided to stay on a complex as opposed to a hotel this time. I can honestly say we were not disappointed in any way the place was secure and spotless the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful the food was superb and although it is located away from the town a shuttle bus was on offer to visit the medina. We will definitely be returning and would recommend to couples and families and also lone travellers. We used the spa and massage centre within the complex and it was a truly lovely experience.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Adnan P wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Excellent family friendly hotel- clean,We had a lovely time during our stay. The staff were amazing great customer service. Special thanks to Rony and star friends who made our stay even better. The kids loved them. Rony was great he really knew how to get everyone involved in all the activities fun and enthusiastic. Hey Rony- “Hassan high five”!    There was lots of activities to do and plenty of swimming areas.    Hotel & room was clean and had all the facilities we needed. Beautiful gardens around the hotel and they even had a little farm area with a few animals.    If I was to pick something negative I would say that food labelling should have been better. I eat halal but had no idea that some deserts were not suitable and the pork was being cooked and served next to the vegetarian options. Also the admin side was not great we had payment problems down to the machines they were using which took 2 days to sort out after the involvement of the guest manager who was very helpful in sorting out the problem.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adnanp2019
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,nayrshire wrote a review Mar 2019,50,A wonderful place,We have just returned from an 11 day stay and can truly say that we have never before experienced such a high level of service together with genuine warmth and friendliness. All the staff are amazing but special mention must go to Rasheda Layla and Adranoui in the dining room and Zdan in the bar - they are amazing. The hotel is lovely and the grounds are beautiful. We couldn't believe the food something for everyone. It was upsetting to see so much food going to waste - it was a buffet and so many people piled their plates high and then left half of it! The only negative we found was that we were disappointed in the Moroccan Restaurant. The main dining area served tastier tagines in our opinion. It is really hard coming from 25C to 2C and snow back here in Scotland.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nayrshire
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Rupi wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Very comfortable stay,We booked via the BA website with a great deal for March 2019. The stay overall was really good. Staff were amazing very friendly. We arrived on the 4th March in the evening and staff were accommodating as food was still being served. Only downfall was that we were a group of 4 and had booked two rooms which were on either side of the hotel. We were a good 5 minutes walk from each other. Other than that everything was amazing. Facilities were good. It was nice as not in season for kids so it was not too busy. It was a shame as we had 2 really warm days and then the weather turned and it got cold. But the hotel had more than enough to keep us busy during the day and evening. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The only thing I would say is that the food would be very repetitive for breakfast lunch and dinner. But there was always something nice to eat. Thank you Iberostar!,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malhi89
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MayaHafiz wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Good for kids,We were there for 7 nights during Feb half term 2 adults and 2 kids (6 & 3).    Generally this is a very good family hotel great for kids with splash area petting zoo and kids club. There were so many activities for them to do.    Staff were amazing couldn’t have been friendlier. Animation team worked really hard to get everyone involved and they even have their theme song. After a while you will remember the dance steps.    Grounds and areas kept clean and immaculate by staff. We were allocated 2 rooms with a connecting door both were kept really clean and spotless. There were only a pillow per bed extras had to be requested. However some of the furnitures have shown their age.    Shows at night are generally really good. Our daughters loved the mini disco. However we found certain shows to be provocative and not suitable for children and the dancers wore very skimpy outfits. Our favourite shows were the Moroccan Karaoke and White Party.    I found the food good but not excellent generally the same thing every night. I was hoping for a tasty tagine the one served at the hotel is ok not great. Don’t get me wrong the food wasn’t bad but I have been to other hotels with better choice and taste. The hotel also serves  pork and bacon so muslims need to be aware that not everything is halal although the hotel is in Morocco.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaHafiz
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Tracy P wrote a review Mar 2019,30,Not a 4 star,We booked this holiday as we wanted a cheap get a way in the sun. The reviews if I'm honest sold it to us but if I`m honest I am not sure what others have seen that we did not. I was a little diappointed on arrival if I`m honest. It was Just nice nothing special.  The staff make this hotel they treat you like family. Bashir Who gave us a fab welcome when we arrived and Laila in the morning Who couldn't do enough for you at breakfast.  The grounds are kept immaculate rooms are clean but the smallest balcóny we have ever had. Ladies if you have long hair take your own hairdryer takes a long time to dry your hair. Also no tea/Coffee facilites in your room. If you ask reception they will give you a kettle and you take up all the cups teabags milk to your room. We also found the food very repetative even after a few days same for breakfast and Lunch. We did however have a few themed nights but over all we found the choice not to be that great. After being their 5 nights we had not had our bedding changed we rang reception twice before someone came up to change it not good enough for a 4 star hotel also the middle cubicle in the ladies toilets by the pool has no working light and can't be used and the hand dryer has not worked either all week.  We also noticed some of the animation team get a little to friendly with some of the younger guests..We also booked this hotel as it had a zen pool (quite pool for adults) I work with children every day and was looking forward to this. It clearly stated no children under 16 but actually every day we were there that wasn't the case and children were being allowed to use it. (Not the quiet zen área we thought we would be using)  This hotel caters for families and is very much a French holiday resort. There is nothing to do outside of the hotel as in walking etc. If you go to the Medina have your wits about you most are not being friendly they want to rip you off.  Overall if you are looking for some winter sun that wont break the bank then this could be your hotel. We have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels but there was Just something missing for me.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177tracyp
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,DeeganLancashire wrote a review Mar 2019,30,In the middle of nowhere,I booked this holiday through Saga and as a previous post had said it is not a typical Saga hotel. There is absolutely nothing nearby you cannot go for a walk down the road which has a high wall on either side and is more or less a dirt track until it reaches the dual carriageway.There is nowhere to sit and read outside in the gardens in peace away from the constant music. The food is quite repetitive after a week no themed evenings and the Moroccan restaurant which you can book once in your stay had only a choice of fish or meat tagineit was not a good experience and did not feel like a an a la cart  experience. The hotel is in two large blocks and I had to walk out of the hotel at night along a covered pathway with steps in the middle to my roomit was lit but not very well.    I can see that this would be a very good hotel if you are a family with children and teenagers but it was not my type of hotel  too big and too much noise.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,Lancashire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeganLancashire
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Alexandra W wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Fabulous stay,Really great hotel. It is beautifully decorated and spotless. The staff go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. It was my husband's birthday and we had two cakes! The grounds are well maintained and there is a good choice of food including vegetarian. Loved seeing all the wildlife especially the frogs geese and hotel cats! I don't normally like petting zoos but the animals looked very well cared for and were lovely to visit. There is a lot of effort made here - it was international women's Day while we were here and every woman was given a rose and a glass of fizz.

The atmosphere the venue the staff all great.    Something to improve is the rotation of the menu. The food is very good but very repetitive if you stay for a week.    Another point to pay attention is about the animation team a couple of the men were a bit “too friendly”and we found some lack of respect in some actitudes. The rest of the team were really polite ehnthusiastics and very helpful!,Date of stay: March 2019,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221mariadelmarm

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Rebecca wrote a review Mar 2019,40,Family hotel with a real family feel,We visited in February 2019 my family of four with children age 7 and 10 plus our extended family to celebrate a 70th birthday.    Having visited Marrakech previously this time we wanted to stay out of the city enjoy some winter sun and have a base to suit us all. I have to say this hotel ticked every box.    Set in the Palmeraie area it is around 15 minutes away from the city set in a remote area with other hotels dotted around it. The grounds are huge with stunning well kept gardens and paths it's very pretty and a pleasure to wander.    The rooms are simple modern and comfortable however the balconies are tiny so don't expect to be sunbathing out there. If you have young children the ground floor rooms are perfect for them to run around outside the terrace.    There are 3 pools the main pool looks lovely but it was too cold for anyone when we were there kids splash pool kept children of all ages occupied - it's knee deep and heated to just warmer than freezing - really good kept clean and has a lifeguard watching over. The Zen pool is for adults again slightly heated and during quieter times well behaved older children are fine to use this. All pools have loads of sun loungers plus the Zen and main pools have bali beds/cabana's around too - perfect!    This hotel caters for almost every sport with pitches/courts for everything from tennis to trapeze petanque to football. We loved it cue beach volleyball battles tennis tournaments and marathon football matches. Together with the kids club and mini disco this hotel really caters well for children.    As with all Iberostar hotels the food was very good a little repetitive if you are All Inclusive but always fresh and with a good amount to choose from. The burgers by the pool in the afternoon go lovely with a beer too...........    We had a couple of issues while we were there that were very quickly resolved so I don't want them to spoil my review or put anyone off but that's the only reason its not a full 5 star review.    This bring me on to the main highlight of this lovely hotel - every member of staff. I have a list of names Abdel in the restaurant Halima in the bar Ayoub and James from the animation team .... I could go on. They are honestly some of the best we've come across on our travels especially with the children. So warm and genuine greeting you around every corner always stopping to chat. Special mention also to Hassan a credit to the hotel and seemed to appear out of nowhere to make sure we were well looked after. We were celebrating my mum's birthday so they made a cake and all sang to her in a few different languages it was perfect!    There is a lot to say about this hotel I haven't even mentioned the great spa or the handy shuttle into the city - all adds up to a great holiday.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Greater Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beckyatsea

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Aaron wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Awesome staff and amazing hotel experience!,Stayed here in February and the weather was still hot. The hotel was very clean spacious well organised. The room (double pool view) was immaculate with a great view and all we needed.    What made this experience so good was the hard working staff. From the people on reception to the manager and cleaners they were so helpful and kind. They all smiled and were there to help whenever we needed. The entertainment staff were top class and did everything from the cookery demonstrations to the zumba and pool exercises.  There are so many activities to take part in and the shows in the evening very entertaining. The dancers were awesome all of them!    There is a good balance between relaxing and joining in the many activities if you want. The staff are not pushy but inclusive and make you feel comfortable always saying hi and asking about the day etc.    A special compliment to Rony who was always smiling always chatting and helpful. His kind nature and positive attitude was much appreciated. Thank you.    The food was awesome. So much choice and something for everyone for breakfast lunch and dinner.    There were no negatives. Perhaps clearer information on the tours and excursions available but there are regular free coaches to the city centre.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronken777
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ADMacC wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Perfect family stay with exceptional staff,Stayed here with the family at the start of February and had a wonderful time.  Excellent hotel set in lovely grounds with numerous bar and restaurants.  The restaurant is amazing so much choice and the food is so fresh and delicious.  Our room was a good size garden room located close to the pool and clean and comfortable.  There was a choice of pools all with plenty sun loungers along with lots of sporting activities located throughout the gardens.  Found all the staff really friendly and helpful. The whole team really went out of their way to make sure every guest had a great time.  Evening entertainment very good appealing to all age groups a special mention to Rony and the rest of the team for keeping us all thoroughly entertained each night.  Excellent cocktail reception and stunning Valentine’s evening it was obvious a lot of time and effort was put into the decorations and evening.  Free hotel shuttle bus into Marrakech several times daily which was well worth a visit  We would definitely choose this hotel if we ever come back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edinburgh, Scotland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADMacC
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Ian G wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Some welcome February sunshine...,We booked our trip to Morocco during the BA January Sale to find some sun in February.  The weather didn’t disappoint and neither did the Iberostar Club Marrakech resort.    The service provided by both staff and management was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The facilities were extensive well maintained and the restaurants were remarkably clean. The Zen swimming pool was our location of choice and where we spent a lot of time winding down after our house move just before Christmas.    I was so relaxed my automatic watch ceased winding and the mechanism stopped.    The restaurant staff could not do enough to look after us always with a smile. The food was excellent which meant we looked forward to our meal times. The drinks included in the all-inclusive deal were excellent and locally produced.    Our room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the gardens & pool and the housekeeping was of a high standard.    There was a courtesy coach to & from the city of Marrakech several times a day up until 22.30h and so you can experience the night market at Djemaa el Fna Square and make it back without taking a taxi. We got dropped off by the coach at the Jardin Majorelle and then walked into the Medina for the night market which shouldn’t be missed.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wimborne Minster, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanG238

The all inclusive resort had everything we wanted. Without exception the staff were welcoming and friendly. The accommodation was very comfortable and clean. The food was excellent and the facilities well maintained and organised. We used the regular shuttle bus into the centre to enjoy the 'chaos' and fun of the main square and souks.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Martin C wrote a review Feb 2019,50,"Amazing food, great stay","First of all I would recommend arranging transport from the airport to the hotel. As a single person who hadn't been to Marrakesh before I found the whole taxi thing very intimidating and if they can rip you off they will. Rather frustrated that the hotel did not reply to an email I sent via the Iberostar website a few days before about transport options.    Anyway once at the hotel I was welcomed and asked to sit and complete a registration form. The guest relations manager I think his name was Hassam came and sat down with me and explained fully about the facitilies and the food and drink etc. He then escorted me to my room. He was charming and a credit to the hotel. I had to pay 100 dirhams at reception for the pool towel which is refunded on departure when you hand over the pool card.    My room with a pool/garden view was very well furnished with a lovely walk in power shower in the bathroom. The TV was large but had limited English speaking channels so there was a lot of Brexit on Sky News! Lol.    I've never done an all inclusive before but the standard of food here at the buffet was exceptional. The best hotel buffet food I'd ever had. There are several chefs preparing food live and the choice is simply amazing. The presentation of the food is also fantastic. During your stay you have an option to eat on one evening in the hotels Moroccan restaurant which looked small and you needed to book a table. However the food in the buffet was just so amazing that I ate there on the 3 nights I stayed. Breakfast was also excellent and varied choices. I didn't eat lunch even though it was included.    Drinks coffees etc are all included all day long and there is cute food truck by the main pool for daytime snacks hot dogs burgers etc. It was here that I met a member of staff who was simply wonderful named Zakaria. He always had the most welcoming smile always happy and after the first few times asking for a beer when he saw me coming he'd get one ready or he'd bring me a beer round the pool even though I hadn't asked for another. What fantastic service he gave!    There are 3 pools a childrens one which looked superb and would definately keep the kids happy a very large main unheated pool with lots and lots of sunbeds and a quiet heated adults only pool.    I'm not a fan of hotel entertainment so I observed guests having great fun round the main pool with a fantastic team from the Star sports. They also provided night time entertainment in the bars.    The hotel arranged a car to take me back to the hotel for 230 dirhams which was a fair price its about 30 minutes from the airport.    I didn't use the free hotel shuttle into town but maybe when I have more time I will.    On my last day the hotel very kindly provide a courtesy room allowing you to shower and change later in the day after you've checked out at 12 noon. This is a lovely jesture. My bags had been taken on check out and stored in the luggage room .    So until leaving the hotel everything was fine. It went downhill rapidly when trying to retrieve my bags and checkout.    The bellman looked at my luggage tag as though I'd given him a barbecued Chicken and as he hardly spoke any english it was difficult to get him to understand that I wanted to collect my bags. Surely if you give a bellman the luggage tag and you're in reception clearly dressed to depart that you simply want your bag. It took several attempts to get my bag back.    Then I needed to get my 100 dirhams back for the pool card. There were 5 or 6 staff behind the desk all seemingly busy chatting and possibly working but not one person looked up to ask if I needed any help despite going to both parts of the counter. It was sometime before anyone acknowledged me and when they did I was told to go to the next position where the cashier was. As he was in the process of counting out large sums of money he ignored me until he was finished. Whatever happened to ""I'll be with you in a moment Sir"". When I got the money back I waited at the desk to ask about the car i'd booked and again the staff never looked up or at me and continued their conversations.    I would like to say that after 3 wonderful nights I left the hotel in a rage. I work in customer service and I know you always acknowledge guests if you're busy or at best stop what your'e doing and help. It actually looked like organised chaos behind the desk at 3.30pm. Thankfully I calmed down and I'd love to visit the hotel again but the management need to train the staff behind the reception better. For this reason and this reason only i have given a 3 star for service when I would have left 5 stars had I not have encountered such bad service on check out.",Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S942LXmartinc
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Liam F wrote a review Feb 2019,50,A great hotel,Only our 3rd day here but feel I had to take time out to write something as we have been overwhelmed with the hospitality. We have done all inclusive a few times but this is thw best experience to date as it includes some cocktails a good selection of spirits but more importantly crepes waffles and far more for the kids.  Huge selection of food it may not vary as much as other places but that's because the huge selection is available at all meals. Some of our kids are fussy but they are still doing fine with the choices.  What really makes this hotel though is the staff.  They are fantastic a good laugh very friendly and a credit to the hotel.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,traveller wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Excellent and well managed hotel,We stayed for a week at the start of February and were sorry to leave. The secret of the hotel I think is the excellent management - Hassam and his team are constantly walking around the hotel talking with guests and asking for feedback. The hotel is spotlessly clean the staff are excellent and can't do enough for you and meals are both varied and very good quality. I was less impressed with the Moroccan Restaurant and thought the excellent tagines available everyday in the restaurant were far better but that's a personal view - it's very popular and needs to be booked a few days in advance. Beer wine and cocktails were also very good. The gardens and pools are well maintained and as ever only spoilt by idiots leaving towels and clothes on their preferred spots. We had a standard Garden Room and I was surprised at the quality of both the room and the shower - cleaned everyday and spotless. There is an excellent free coach into Marrakech 6 times a day which can be booked in advance and this was a rare hotel holiday when I couldn't even make up a complaint! The only small frustration was the vagaries of broadband away from the reception area but that's no problem. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Suffolk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentJ512

Many thanks to all the other brilliant staff.    We went for a winter break but didn't expect such lovely weather and also were a little sceptical on what types of facilities may be available due to visiting out of season how ever we were shocked by the amount of gym classes and activities on offer. There was always something to do! Even the snack van was open all day every day something which we thought would be closed out of the summer months.    Food was great so much choice every night and we never felt like it was the same thing over and over. Good choice of wines cocktails and spirits. The seafood night was brilliant and again so much to choose from.    Multiple daily busses into and returning from marrakech that were free of charge and comfortable which made it so easy to go and explore.    We will definitely be returning to this hotel as it has everything we wanted and more.    Thanks again club palmarie for making our holiday so perfect!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Neil A wrote a review Feb 2019,30,"Lovely hotel, shame about the noise",Visited Marrakech for a break from the cold British weather and we weren’t let down by the Moroccan weather.  Hotel set in lovely grounds and 2 good sized pools for adults (one heated but still on the cool side).  Staff were exceptionally friendly and catered to all of our needs in the restaurant (affectionately nicknamed the canteen for the week).  Good choice of food though hot food was often cold. Excellent seafood choice on one of the nights and food generally very tasty.    Entertainment during the winter months appeared to be in the main internal bar which lacked character and atmosphere due to the bright ceiling lights that were constantly on...easy to remedy by dimming down the lights.  The big downside for us was the noise from neighbouring rooms and corridors outside the rooms. Rooms very comfortable in general but the walls/ceilings must be paper thin!    All in all a very good hotel and excellent value for money. Maybe more signage around the hotel asking people to be respectful of others would help with the noise issues?

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left I have nothing but praise for this hotel and it's incredibly hardworking staff! And you will see from my other reviews I say what I see.    Upon arrival we were checked in promptly. Given a welcome drink and had the amenities and facilities of the hotel provided to by the hotel manager ( very hospitable and friendly).    The rooms were spotless - every day. The hotel and grounds are immaculate. The staff take great pride in their work and I could not fault the cleanliness of the hotel.    The food - vast choice hot and very tasty. The waiting on staff - including one lady who I believe  was called Flores ( I may have misunderstood) were fantastic. Plates cleaned away quickly drinks replenished promptly and tables cleared and repaid with care. The whole dinning experience is a delight and that is a credit to the hard work of the staff and chefs.    The animation team are excellent. The perfect balance by offering a range of activities without being pushy. I personally loved the spin classes/ dance classes and aqua gym but there is something for everyone ( if you want to give it a go). Very friendly and polite.    The gym is great - one of the better ones I've had. There are treadmills crosstrainers fitness balls weights etc. Lovely and spacious.    The pools- there are 3 pools however as we went early Feb the warmer of the 3 was the zen pool which was a fair temperature. There were several bars throughout and the staff in the food truck were brilliant. Serving food and drinks and again working tirelessly. There were also plenty of sunbeds throughout our stay.    The food relaxation and general experience of this iberostar were first class. The staff are an absolute credit to this hotel. Everyone was extremely attentive polite and helpful. Nothing was too much and that shone through. It was lovely to see the hotel hold *Management Cocktails* one evening to celebrate the success of all staff and the contribution they make to the hotel. The hotel also asks it's staff for feedback on its hotel and evidently puts this into practice.

Happy smiling helpful friendly very hard working but always well presented. The food had a very good choice every night & I’m a fussy eater. I wasn’t overly impressed by the themed restaurant I felt it lacked atmosphere - but that’s just personal taste.  The room we had was nice the walls are maybe a little thin& I can imagine in the height of summer when it’s full it may be noisy. But when we were there it was fine. Housekeeping were great. Clean towels every day & the room kept very clean.  They also have resident cats which were very friendly & all the guests seemed to like them. One looked like she was losing her fur & needed a bit of help but I’m sure the hotel management take into account how popular they are with guests & make sure they get whatever vet help they need to keep them healthy.

The room was spacious and luxurious especially for the price paid. The food was also great lots of choice for an all inclusive and there was a good mix of different types of food. The pool area was very nice too it never felt crowded or busy and food and snacks were available all day.  My only criticism of this hotel was the noise - I would absolutely stay here again however I would request a food in the block further away from reception. One of the bars downstairs played music outside very late into the night which isn’t ideal when travelling as a family as it was very loud from our room. I did have to make various calls to reception during our stay to ask them to turn it off (seemed a bit pointless too as when we went in December it was too cold to be sat outside late at night so no one was even listening to the music) I got a range of responses when calling reception some were very helpful and got it turned off immediately whilst others were less proactive.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,KatM wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Great if you like all inclusive,We stayed here for 4 nights in November 2018 after having spent 3 nights in a Riad in central Marrakech. We decided we didn’t want to spend a whole week in Marrakech and thought we’d come here to relax after a few days.  The hotel is great for drinks and for relaxing by the pool doing the occasional activity (which there are plenty of) if that’s your type of thing. Unfortunately we didn’t realise this was not what we wanted from a holiday until we experienced it. As the hotel is a way out from town we felt restricted in our movements and had to go out on excursions only. This is just our experience though and nothing the hotel has done.  Generally the hotel is amazing and put a lot of thought into everything for its guests! We are not a fan of all inclusive dining as it was just too busy however there was plenty of choice for everyone from Moroccan food to fish to pasta to cheese (Mmm the cheese) and I loved the different food stations each night (sushi night...yes!). The choice of drinks were amazing. The cocktails actually some of the best I’ve ever had at a hotel (and we went through them all in one night)!  The bedrooms were a decent size and the pools were amazing! The only thing that could be better is the gym (yes we are those people) as there just wasn’t the equipment.  We very much loved the welcome food/drinks on our first night it was a lovely touch! Oh and the guy who plays keyboard in the bar is amazing!  I’d definitely recommend if you love all inclusive holidays!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BatKick
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,John R wrote a review Feb 2019,40,"Friendly staff, good all round hotel with very good grounds and leisure facilities",Visited with a group of 10 golfers so spent most days away from hotel until late afternoon. The hotel is probably 20 years old but refurbished by Iberostar 2 years ago and clean and more than adequate. Comfortable rooms with large bathroom and excellent shower. TV with usual channels and small balcony with table and 2 chairs at least in 1205. Three pools one main by hotel one for kids and a quieter heated pool ideal for winter sunbathing. Kiddies playground table tennis golf practice net (plans for a mini course) 3 x pétanque bays fitness centre which didn't use and dancercise sessions. Food is buffet style and they ring the changes with quite a good variety and good quality. A moroccan restaurant is available with booking and usable once on an all inclusive week. Bars were well stocked and service excellent. Dancing some evenings and a tv room showing sport. They set up English premiership on request.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jessica R wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Perfect 4 night stay,Stayed here with my partner for 4 nights at the end of January and had a wonderful time. Cannot think of any way in which the hotel could be improved for the price we paid.  Our room was clean comfy and a good size with a really nice view of the pool right outside.  Both of the main pools were beautiful and very clean with loads of sun loungers and extremely comfortable beds to relax on. Even though the zen pool is quieter and intended for adults we preferred the atmosphere and music around the main pool.  The restaurant is amazing so much choice and the food is so fresh and delicious.  Found all the staff really friendly and helpful; in general the whole team really go out of their way to make sure every guest has a great time.  The weather was beautiful during the day but chilly at night. We would definitely choose this hotel if we ever come back to Marrakech.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Watford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1857MBjessicar
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,nivek3333 wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Not for us,We don't normally do 'all inclusive' but decided to go with friends who had already booked and asked us to join them. The hotel has 318 rooms set out amongst nice gardens clean and well kept. Our room was very nice big bed flat screen TV a safe wardrobe although not enough hangers provided two round pin sockets. We took a travel kettle as there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Mini fridge provided - empty except for one bottle of water on arrival. Bathroom big with very good walk-in shower hairdryer shaving mirror nice toiletries. Bedding and towels changed each day and lovely and clean. This hotel is wheelchair accessible. Exchange rate at reception was 12.2 dirhams to the £ which was a better rate than in town. Pool towels are provided but you have to pay a refundable deposit of 100 dirham per towel. Plenty of activities available table tennis darts archery tennis football volleyball and French bowls and a high trapeze. Childrens pool was heated and had slides etc. Main pool unheated steps leading into it and it was 1.4m deep. Zen pool (adults only) was heated and is 1.4m throughout. A few guests had complaints as children were using the pool. The Manager was aware of this but apparently its still happening. There are many wasps around the pool and food truck which serves hamburgers waffles and hotdogs. The main dining area was very busy and felt like a works canteen. As said in previous reviews the food was cold doesn't help when chefs are adding cold milk to scrambled egg they have just put out. Fresh chips added to cold ones already in serving dishes. Children unsupervised when getting food for example helping themselves to ice cream and then licking the spoon and returning it to be used by an unsuspecting guest. Bit of a language barrier when asking for food at chef stations. At busy times its a free for all when queuing for your food many people trying to jump the queue. As if it isn't chaotic enough you have the animation team leading kids around tables in the dining area in a conga! The hotel caters mainly for French guests and those with children.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,mansfield,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nivek3333

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,fishandchips90210 wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Excellent resort but we were robbed!!,I travelled from Liverpool to Marrakech on 25th January 2019. We were a group of nine men travelling for a guys’ weekend of rest and relaxation. When we reached our hotel/resort Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech it was about 12.45 pm.    We were given only one room on the ground floor to put our bags in and informed that two other rooms were still being cleaned/readied. We were asked to have lunch as we had booked an all-inclusive holiday. The staff were very kind and helped us with the check in formalities. We proceeded to put all our bags in the room we were given.    When we tried to put all our passports in a locker we discovered that the safe/locker in the room we were given was broken. We therefore kept the passports with ourselves. We then had lunch got the keys for two more rooms and occupied them. Two of my friends and I decided to stay in the room we were first given. The others therefore occupied the two other rooms.    Three friends and I decided to have a massage and the others decided to go for a walk and play some sports on Friday. I therefore put my gold necklace and my clothes in my suitcase in my room and my friend put his wallet in his bag in the same room which was locked. The massage was good and we then went straight to dinner and the nightclub within the resort.    On Saturday morning we discovered that my gold necklace and my friend’s cash (in British pounds) was missing. We complained to the manager who immediately visited the room. It was then that we discovered that the patio sliding doors leading to the garden in the back were damaged and not lockable at all!! This was however repaired immediately.    The manager then arranged for the codes of our key cards to be read and compared it to the codes used to open the electronic lock on the door to the room. He discovered that the door had not been opened by any staff other than the person who came in to the room for housekeeping only after the theft had been discovered. The manager offered to book us a tour to Atlas mountains or any such for the Sunday to compensate our loss but I refused this and decided to complain to the police.    On Sunday evening the deputy manager Mr H arranged for a car and a driver to escort me (who had my gold necklace stolen) and my friend (who had had his cash stolen) to the local police station. We reached there at 7 pm.    We entered the police station and the driver informed the police officer that we were there to make a complaint. The police officer (who appeared to be) in charge immediately started shouting quite loudly at the driver seemingly telling him off in the local language (?Arabic). This police officer refused to speak to me or my friend saying he did not understand English initially. The driver then called Mr H and the officer spoke to him. He then told us in clear English that we had to get Mr H from the hotel and our passports/hotel booking documents etc!!    We returned to the hotel and Mr H then accompanied us back to the police station with all the documents. The officer who had shouted at the driver was missing but another officer was present. He spoke to Mr H and it was agreed that they would register our complaint. We were requested to write down the sequence of events and what we had lost in English on a A4 piece of paper which we did.    We then had to wait for another policeman to come in and translate what we had written into Arabic and write it down in (what appeared to be) the official complaints register. Both policemen appeared to go out of their way to ensure they worked at what seemed to us as the slowest pace possible. We were then asked to sign below what he had written in Arabic (although we did not have a single clue what had been written down!!). We were finally given the reference number at 9.45 pm and we returned to the resort.    The questions now is:    Was the resort itself involved in the theft?    Reasons for: We were given only one room although we had booked three rooms in advance for the nine of us. This room did not have a working safe/locker (which we discovered straightaway) and the locks on the back/patio doors were broken which we weren’t aware of until after the theft. The room could therefore be viewed as a trap which we walked into unknowingly. The manager seemed to not take our concerns seriously although he did take appropriate steps to investigate what had happened. His demeanour changed when I said I was going to the police.    Mr H the deputy manager was however genuinely concerned and went considerably above and beyond his duty to ensure we registered a complaint with the police.    The resort facilities are actually excellent. There are two pools and one of them is heated. The food served is excellent and the range of both vegetarian and meat options is fantastic. The staff are very friendly and courteous. The rooms are of good size and well maintained. The towels and toiletries are very good. There are a number of activities within the resort from the spa the gym sports theatre and nightclub to entertain people of all ages cultures and tastes.    However the fact remains that we lost our belongings when it was in the hotel in a private room with locked doors. The only person/persons who could have stolen this would have to be hotel staff. It is unacceptable that we should be exposed to this risk when we should be safe. This entirely spoilt our holiday experience and we also lost the 6-7 hours on Saturday and Sunday we had to deal with this rather than relaxing.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishandchips90210
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Alexandra Travels wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Great Vacation,We stayed here for 8 days in January and had an excellent stay. There are only two restaurants: a buffet and a Moroccan restaurant (which you can only go to once during your reservation). The buffet was fine. Food was sometimes not hot but I think that was because of the low-season as the resort wasn't busy at all. Lots to choose from and changed the theme every night. A couple mornings we missed breakfast (ended at 10am) and had to wait until lunch was served (1230). A continental breakfast was advertised but only a few light pastries were provided. We didn't make our reservation for the Moroccan restaurant but I'm sure it was good.    The staff couldn't do enough for us...everyone was fantastic and helpful when we had an issue with a tour company (not affiliated with the hotel). Entertainment was scheduled every evening before and after dinner. The team obviously worked hard and they put on fun evenings. There is a nightclub at the resort but there was never anyone there (again January is definitely low season).    Rooms were spacious and were adequately stocked. Beds are pretty hard and move a lot. Sound also tends to carry in the halls. However we didn't find issue with either of these. We also found parts of the hotel were quite cold and kept the heat in our room high to compensate for this.    Lots to do on the grounds. We were told only one pool was heated (Zen) but the water was still really cold. The kids pool seemed closed and the main pool is open to lounge around but I think the water would be even colder than the Zen pool. We were very lucky with the weather as it was just warm enough to lay out by the pool (on the sunny side). We also tried the spa (Hammam Experience) one morning which was lovely and VERY reasonably priced.    The hotel is a 20-minute coach bus ride to town and you're dropped off and picked up at Place de la Liberte. We were told to book a day ahead but it wasn't really necessary - we usually booked the morning we were leaving without issue. The shuttle schedule could be more frequent - if you miss the 10am bus the next one isn't until 2pm. Also if you miss the 630pm return shuttle you're stuck in town until 1030pm (unless you take a taxi). They have a currency exchange at the front desk which was very convenient/secure.    All in all I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to friends/family.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hamilton, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexandraTravels

It was a different experience for us as the hotel is quite distant from the city centre and means that the all inclusive element becomes important. The restaurant is buffet style with a wide selection of foods and cuisine types and it was all perfectly fine. Standard drinks were included and the staff were all very friendly.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,LizTony2018 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,CAN’T BE BEATEN ON VALUE FOR MONEY,On arriving at 9 pm at the Club Palmeraie we couldn’t have been made more welcome by the staff and were immediately escorted into the restaurant for dinner before we checked in. We had e-mailed beforehand and requested a ground-floor garden room – a wise choice as it was convenient for the main restaurant bar terrace and main pool with other facilities/activities close by. There are connecting rooms for families.    This was the second week in January and we were prepared for the cold morning and evening temperatures – coats and jumpers a necessity – but by 11-ish the sun shone brilliantly - it was shorts and T-shirts time plus sun-screen for the sun worshippers. The very large unheated main pool was naturally empty but with plenty of sun loungers around it was fine for just relaxing. The smaller heated ‘adults only’ pool was more popular with a few guests taking the plunge. There is an adjacent bar for the all-important G&T or beer etc. The nearby “food truck” (10 am – 6 pm) is a brilliant idea – also fun when the geese appear at the end of the day for the left-overs!    Children are particularly well catered for with clubs for different ages: there is also a separate heated ‘fun’ children’s pool with novelty water cascades. The animation team are always around providing well-organised entertainment during the day for everyone. Activities include tennis archery practice golf petanque badminton and for the high-flyers a trapeze! Basketball and volleyball courts are ready for the warmer weather.    The Oasis buffet-style restaurant was exceptional with an extensive range of salads and accompaniments for lunch and dinner. Unlike many hotel buffets where hot food is presented in covered tureens there were several ‘live’ cooking stations for meat fish chicken pizzas paella pasta etc - it was definitely a case of being spoilt for choice (not forgetting the desserts). ‘Themed’ evenings were a pleasant surprise including sushi speciality seafood (even spider crabs were on offer) and Moroccan dishes being served. Red white and rosé wines are offered – all very palatable - with a seemingly endless supply!! Breakfast was equally inviting with hot food cooked to order alongside the usual salads yoghurts meats and cheeses etc. We thought the quality of food and wine easily matched (and sometimes exceeded) what we have eaten in some 5-star all-inclusive hotels. The range of local drinks offered at the bars is good but if you want premium brands there is a supplement.    We dined in the small Jawhara restaurant for a Moroccan evening but be aware that this is not really à la carte – a fixed four-course menu is offered (although there is a choice of meat or fish tagine); however the ambience and musicians make it a change from the Oasis restaurant.    It’s worth noting that Saturday and Sunday was busier with many Moroccan families taking a long weekend break. The grounds are extensive with footpaths all round and the gardens are particularly well tended.    A free time-tabled shuttle bus (actually it’s a coach!) operates to and from the centre of Marrakech but this must be pre-booked. Having visited five years ago and ‘seen the sights’ we visited the Yves St Laurent museum (opened two months ago) - a must if you are a fashionista and remember the 1960s! We didn’t manage it last time so a trip to the Atlas Mountains was on the agenda – an enlightening day out especially when we were invited to a Berber family home in the afternoon.    Without exception all the staff were efficient friendly and courteous making every guest (from us two septuagenarians to the youngest children) feel important and welcome. Management were always around and happy to talk to the guests. This is a busy hotel with lots going on: as a destination to escape the British weather (and Brexit!) this was definitely the right choice for quality value and hospitality.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizTony2018
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,DiscoverDworld wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Winter sun,Spent a week late January. Overall a worthy stay at the Iberostar.    Room: Bigger than expected and comfortable. We had a twin room although told we could request a double if required we didn't. Only thing is the beds move alot. There are no coffee/tea making facilities in the room a shame because it would have been nice to enjoy a coffee on the balcony with a lovely view of the garden.    Bathroom: Big bathroom with usual amenities. Fresh towels everyday and spotless.    Bar: A lot of drink options not as strong as you'd get in UK but still very drinkable.    Food: Breakfast lunch and dinner are served buffet style. Good selection of different foods. Sometimes amazing sometimes bland but cater to the masses. The Morrocan (Jewara) restaurant was a bit of a let down. We went to 2 others (1 in Medina and 1 high brow) which really set the bar very high. The staff seemed a bit nonchalant and that didn't set the right tone for the meal. Tables also seemed not to be cleared as much as they would be in the main restaurant.    Pool: There are 3 pools we spent most of our time by the adult (zen) pool. Supposed to be heated-its not but the afternoon sun made the pool refreshing.    Spa: Professional team they explained every treatment really well. We had a couples hamman and massage. A very relaxing (easy) option for those who don't have the energy for the old town.    STAFF: The staff are truly the lifeblood of this resort. From the manager to the staff clearing your plates they really go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,NeilSaraJas wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Shame about cold family pool!!,Visited this hotel over the October half term with our 12 year old daughter. Much of this review was ‘clouded’ by the mixed weather we had which I appreciate is hard for most hotels to manage.    The biggest influence on my review was the lack of a heated family outdoor pool or an indoor pool when weather is inclement. Swimming is always a big part of our holiday and it was a shame that our daughter could only swim occasionally in main pool which quite frankly was very cold for the whole holiday there was never more than 2 or 3 people in the pool and the lifeguards often outnumbered the swimmers! I suspect this would be the case for several months of the year having stayed at other hotels in Marrakech in February.    Frustratingly there is a heated pool exclusive to adults and over 16s. My daughter was asked to leave the pool but fair play to one or two French families who just ignored the age restriction which my daughter wouldn’t!    Hotel needs to sort this and I said as much to the Deputy Manager during my stay.    When the weather is good there is s fantastic selection of outdoor activities and a majority of the staff particularly the entertainment staff work really hard. Also had no complaints about Our room which was kept clean.    There was a decent enough selection of food however a lot of the effort was spoilt by the lack of warm plate racks which meant that as other reviews have highlighted the food was invariably cold by the time you got to your table. During our stay everyone had to eat indoors so the main restaurant felt more like a large canteen- although they did open up a couple of large gazebos with outdoor heaters during the week which provided a much better atmosphere.    We enjoyed the Halloween event in the theatre but other than that we stayed in the main bar area in the evenings - this definitely lacked atmosphere with the same man with a pre- programmed keyboard every night - this entertainment should be varied and more inspiring!    I accept that we didn’t see hotel at its best but in summary the hotel needs needs to look at the heated pool situation during low season/winter time school holidays given its description as family hotel!,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Honley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilSaraR

Having arrived at the hotel from stepping out of the transfer taxi the service we received was beyond our expectations they made us feel at home and couldn't do enough for us to ensure we where comfortable and our baby was ok. It was quite late but we where still taken to the resturant to get some dinner before doing any of the check in formalities.  All the staff are VERY baby friendly and people friendly the service is amazing and you are made to feel at home everyday. All the staff always have a smile on their face and would do anything for us and our baby.  The hotel is clean and tidy and could not be faulted on hygiene. The food quality and taste was excellent but at the end of 7 days it did feel a bit repetitive would be nice to have a more variety of traditional morrocan foods.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,livingloved54 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Great Little Oasis,We loved our 10 days at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie. We were looking for a bit of Winter sun and were not disappointed (despite the cold mornings!). From the warm welcome right through to the warm send off the service was the best I've seen anywhere. Whether or not it was a management policy or that the staff were just so pleasant - either way the staff were all just excellent. We really the rooms which were tastefully decorated and a good size. The balcony was quite small (narrow) but this was more than compensated by the wonderful shower - so important to me! We're pretty easily pleased with the food side of things so we found what was on offer very much to our tastes. My only small gripe was that the soup was always tasteless (needed a lot of seasoning) but I still had it every lunch and dinner time. We enjoyed the quiet atmosphere of the adult heated pool. The gardens are very extensive and the sports on offer were really good. We didn't try the trapeze but it's still pretty impressive. A mini golf course would have been nice but there's plenty of other things to keep you occupied. All of the staff were extremely pleasant so it's hard to single out individuals however we must say a thank you to Khalid for his sense of fun Jihane (hope the spelling is okay) for her excellent service in the evening and Soufiane for his service at the pool bar. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. Would heartily recommend this excellent hotel.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dunfermline, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livingloved54
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Lauren wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Best family holiday yet!,I have just returned from iberostar club palmeraie after a 5 day visit with 5 adults. My mother had a 50th birthday during our stay and the hotel went out of their way to make sure that she had the best day ever! From a welcoming happy birthday chant as we entered breakfast to a birthday cake at dinner time my mum continued to proudly tell us all that this was her best birthday yet and this was thanks to the wonderful staff and arrangements made by the hotel. The manager was always present and extremely friendly and informative and the staff that work here are amazing beyond belief. A special recognition goes to ‘Bob’ who made our stay so so special by making a fuss of all of us every time we would see him having dinner with us and joining us in activities. Bob really is a credit to this hotel and his kindness and fun manner did not go unnoticed by other guests who would also make a fuss of him every time they would see him. The training of your staff shines through the whole hotel and made our stay so much more enjoyable because of this. The food was astonishing particularly lunch and the Moroccan restaurant was a beautiful experience however the service could do with a boost just by explaining what foods we were eating but other than that everything was splendid. The all inclusive option was fantastic my only critique would be that late night snacks should be an option as an hour or so after dinner I was feeling extremely peckish with no room service or snacking option. That is my only slight critique but this in no way hindered my wonderful experience! I also feel that the hotel could benefit from an inside pool as well as the outside ones. However overall my stay was magnificent and this truly is a fantastic hotel with even better staff!! Thank you for making our time in Marrakech the best ever.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurenjadeforrest

To get to the Entertainments Room with Stage one has to walk outside and walk along an open archway in the cold this room is in basement with no lift plus if one has difficulty with walking then going up and down the stairs is difficult although there are handrails.Dance area is carpeted so very difficult to dance no professional singer for the shows.No local village near hotel or walking areas.My biggest concern was that when I arrived for 4 weeks the animal farm was free to most of the animals to roam in the farm area and that was great but by the end of my time most animals were caged which was very sad. The area that was closed in all the time was the area for the sheep lamb and and one goat. The area was 18 foot square approx. I felt very sorry for the sheeplamb and the goat. I hope hotel management would put it back as it was. It felt like most animals were in prison which for me was very distressing. I hope this feedback is helpful.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Griff R wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Christmas and new year,Visited this hotel for Christmas and new year had never been to Morocco before so was unsure what to expect but it was excellent. The staff from management down were so polite and helpful the place was spotlessly clean the rooms the public areas and the gardens and pools were always neat and tidy and in the restaurant they were constantly picking up and mopping up any spilt food. Both the Christmas eve and New years eve gala dinners were exceptional .Management were so concerned when I had an upset tummy and were constantly asking if I needed anything. The Thomas Cook rep was excellent and any queries were sorted straight away This was our first time in an Iberostar hotel and it will not be our last in fact we have already booked for next Christmas and are looking forward to going back to this wonderful hotel. Our daughter works for Thomas Cook (selling holidays) and she is passing on all our positive feedback to customers who are interested in this hotel as it deserves all the good reviews it gets. One of the management team said to us we are his family now and that's exactly how it felt all the time we were there.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tourist576177

There were lights christmas trees and even a Santa who arrived on a camel with gifts for all the children. The food was well cooked - the chef went out of his way to ensure my gluten-free diet was adhered to - and my waitress Rashida ensured the toaster tray was cleaned of any gluten-y crumbs as she toasted my roll - the chef even cooked me a special pizza.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Bumblebee082008 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Excellent hotel,We have just returned from a weeks holiday staying at the Iberostar over New Year and what a brilliant time we had! The hotel staff couldn’t do enough for you - the food was amazing!! Be prepared to put on a few extra pounds!!  The only negative was the large pool wasn’t heated and was too cold to swim in at this time of year. We ended up using the “adult  Only pool” even though we had 2 children with us (both age 10) as other families were doing the same thing - it just meant we had to limit the noise that the children made whilst in the pool. Great entertainment on New Year’s Eve - will definitely be going back again.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumblebee082008
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jackwt wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Exceptional hotel and staff,We just returned from a four day stay at the hotel and it was absolutely brilliant!    Firstly I would make a note about staying at the hotel with an allergy as this was something we couldn’t find much information on ahead of our visit (aside from another TripAdvisor review) and hopefully we can reassure others with allergies. My partner has a severe allergy to nuts and we were worried that this would be an issue in being able to eat the food at the hotel (given the language barrier and local cuisine). This was a concern and we were wondering what processes were in place regarding allergens. On arrival the allergy was mentioned and the staff immediately proceeded to fill out a form with all of the details with the hospitality manager speaking with my partner and even taking a picture for staff recognition - this was far more than we expected. At every meal the waiting staff and head chef were extremely attentive and completed a tour of the buffet explaining which items were safe and which to avoid. Do not feel afraid to tell the staff about your allergy - they were so friendly and I accompanied my partner on the walk round the buffet to make sure all was ok. This meant we could truly relax and enjoy the full all inclusive experience in confidence - including breakfast lunch dinner snacks from the food truck and drinks. If you have an allergy do not let this put you off coming to the hotel - they dealt with it better than some restaurants at home! Although the food he ate was relatively safe (pasta pizza burgers etc.) the staff were keen to assure us that there were plenty of options even checking up on us when we were eating meals.    Much like how they dealt with the allergies the hotel experience was amazing. The food was exceptional everything was spotless the room was spacious and would be clean by the time we came back from breakfast. The staff at the hotel really make it what it is - they are so friendly and attentive and the entertainment team are brilliant. We did the archery went on the reliable shuttle bus into the Medina and spent plenty of time relaxing at the pool in the sun (whilst the mornings were cold by lunchtime the weather is perfect!). The only minor issues we could come up with are that the heated zen pool could be slightly warmer (although it is January!) and perhaps some more snacks available in the evenings after dinner. It would also be good to have larger measures of drink rather than small glasses that you have to keep refilling - but these are relatively minor things.    We would definitely recommend this hotel including to those with allergies and I’m sure we will return again! Thank you so much to all of the staff for making it a great stay.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackwt

I am sure we weren’t lucky the staff are wonderful from checking in to having our luggage taken to the room and dining nothing is too much trouble and everything explained in full. The room was spotless and well looked after as was everything around this complex. The gardens are absolutlely beautiful with lovely walks through them they are maintained daily. The young staff encouraging you to take part in activities were lovely not pushy but making sure you didn’t get left out. The food was plentiful and good with lots of choice. Halima in the bar was delightful and often brought fresh tea to our table she gave good service with a smile. We would have to mention Mohamed the luggage porter who went out of his way to make sure we could find our way around the complex and he is also very knowledgeable about Marrakech and the surrounding area we really appreciated his advise and time and wish him well.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Davina wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Excellent,So this was our second visit this year to this resort. I felt it was better second time around. The efforts of the staff to ensure that guests enjoy themselves is quite remarkable. A special mention to Laila in the dining room who is so warm and kind especially to my baby daughter. There was another lady (who welcomes people to the dining room) who also helped me and was very kind when my baby was unwell one of the days. I didn’t catch her name but she is an asset to the hotel. Virtually all the staff knew my baby by name and all genuinely cared we had everything we needed throughout our stay. The bar staff are great too. The guy who says “cheers big ears” always tried to make us laugh and have a chat with us. The cleaning staff do an excellent job and our room was spotless.    The work that went into organising the New Year’s Eve party was so impressive. The food was excellent and the entertainment was fab. The two managers were in stage all night really getting the crowd going and singing along with the band and the dancers. There was a great variety and the Brazilian dancers were a cut above your average hotel entertainment.    The activities on the resort are varied and available to be booked. Even though the hotel was full it still felt spacious and there were always activities to get involved with.    The Moroccan restaurant was actually really really nice and made a change from the buffet-style dining. We didn’t manage to go there on our first visit and some of the reviews didn’t seem to sell it to us but it was actually excellent.    Overall I would certainly recommend the resort.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,SOLANKIII wrote a review Jan 2019,40,ONLY criticism is the food!,The staff at this hotel are absolutely INCREDIBLE! So full of energy and they all make an effort to get to know you! They are respectable polite friendly and so much fun to interact with! They even remember your name and greet you every single time they see you!    The hotel itself is spotless. My room was clean and well maintained. Only thing I didn't like about the room is that the bathroom door does not have a lock! Not great when you're staying with two other people in one room.    My only real criticism is the food and this is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. It's very hard for someone who has allergies or restrictions in their diet to eat here. The management did make a tremendous effort to ensure kitchen staff knew we were vegan. However we still felt like a burden and it was difficult communicating with staff who didn't know English to ask what was suitable for us.    It would be SOOO much easier if ALL the food was labelled correctly with a V sign for vegetarian and VE for vegan food. In the end we just stuck to pasta for all meals because we got tired of asking. I would really like to request the change in your labelling because I cannot wait to return again.    Also another thing that concerned me was cross contamination. I witnessed on several occasions staff members using spoons from meat dishes into vegetarian dishes. This is NOT okay and staff members should be educated. There should be dedicated spoons for each dish.    It would have also been nice if the hotel did more traditional Moroccan things such as pomegranate juice and cactus fruits.

Beautiful inside and out.    The animation team worked so hard and yet didn’t pressure us too much to join in when we just wanted to chill.    Christmas Eve gala was fantastic yet again.    Food was very good and although some dishes could have been hotter a quick blast in the microwave soon put that right.    The only improvement I would make is to provide a kettle in the rooms for people like myself who are early risers. A small point and I will make sure I pack a travel kettle next time.

The shuttle into Marrakech was really useful and took you into the heart of the city.    Nothing was too much trouble. Everyday all the staff would greet you with a warming smile and their attention to your stay was second to none. From the top down everyone went out of their way to ensure you had a good holiday.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sue M wrote a review Dec 2018,40,"Very Good, hope to return soon",Rooms and balcony small but perfectly adequate. In our case three adults shared a room one on a couch bed and we were all comfortable. Clean and well looked after with lovely bathrooms. All the rooms in the hotel are exactly the same size so the only choice that one needs to make is the location in the resort. If you book a room very close to the main hotel there is noise at night. Personally I would not recommend a pool view as in most cases you can only see it in the distance.  Having stayed in numerous all-inclusive hotels I would rate the food here as four out of five for this star rating. This hotel is not expensive and superb value for money. There was one coeliac in our party and she was treated well in the dining room though there was at wait as she had food freshly prepared for her upon request generally pasta or pizza but as an adult if you requested any special food I believe your requirements would be met.  Activities are endless and there is something for everyone. I lovely children’s pool the main entertainment pool and the Zen pool which is heated. The Zen pool is supposed to be for adults only and No booking spaces .... these rules are not followed closely over the Christmas break but understandably as it was the only heated pool and it was still very pleasant. Daily events included archery boules soccer football badminton table tennis there is also a trapeze and a small gym. I have not listed all of the activities promise you won’t be bored if you are looking for entertainment. There is a small zoo at the back of the hotel which is makes is very pleasant to visit a goat turkey geese doves and chickens. The daily wanderings of the geese was a sight to behold. There were no kids in our party but I would say they would find it paradise not only due to all the activities but the entertainment staff …. Actually all the staff were enormously attentive helpful and available to meet every request. Excellent management guest relations and reception will mind all requirements.  Negatives (these will not stop me returning) - the shuttle bus does not go the whole way into marrakech old medina but leaves you about a 15 minute walk away. I left my bag unattended in a quite reading area and it was taken money and iPod removed and the bag was left back on the floor a couple of hours later ☹ my own fault and I am not blaming the hotel.,Date of stay: December 2018,,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SSL

Though take a cardigan for evenings and early mornings otherwise we spent many happy hours at the pool in our swimwear!    Pros. Excellent service comfortable sunbeds (no need to reserve) brilliant service in to Marrakesh. Be warned the roads are dodgy and not for the faint of heart amazed we only saw one fatality. Food amazing different every lunchtime/evening. Seafood evening was to die for. Entertainment staff really made an effort (thank you). Heated pool great and warm considering it was winter!    Negative. No coffee making facility. This is a serious issue for my partner! The nearest coffee was 8 mins walk away this created a lot of anxiety as without a caffeine fix she cannot go out ;) Please ibersostar address this and let us know so we can plan our next trip?? Beds...we had to push them together. Though the maid did thereafter make up the beds as one. Thank you.    Summary; A first class hotel. In every way. We wanted to give 5 or maybe 4.5 stars but felt the kettle/coffee was an issue...sorry. Lastly a word about the manager. The chap with glasses wondering around everywhere. Where did you find him? What a gem of a manager. Constantly everywhere in the restaurant the bar at breakfast... his attention to detail surely cascades down to all the staff. We had to leave a day early and crumbs he only sought us out at the hotel front most concerned there was an issue? Real and GENUINE concern....A great advocate of Iberostar worldwide....thanks again.,Date of stay: December 2018,,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danb146
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Vik Patel wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Fantastic!,We decided to spend our Christmas abroad this year and I am glad we did. Fantastic hotel! The hotel is well maintained and very clean! I cannot recommend this hotel enough building and facilities are excellent 3 pools to choose from buffet meals are exceptional with lots of choice everyday. The staff cannot do enough for you and you can tell they are like a big family. It is definitely the staff that make this hotel brilliant. I must say that James one of the event staff and Laila in the resteraunt were particularly excellent in making our daughter feel welcome as I said before all the staff were brilliant but I cannot remember all the names sorry!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,jayw1991 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Excellent Resort,We visited this as a party of 4 in November with Thomas Cook and could not recommend the hotel and staff enough with the hotel being very modern clean and well-presented throughout and our rooms were very comfortable and including a balcony and mini fridge too.    The hotel has a main buffet style restaurant which had a wide variety of high quality foods from across the world from Moroccan and Spanish dishes to pizza and salad. The restaurant also has themed nights and the food was so varied and good that we were never bored by our meals. The hotel also has a burger van by the pool which serves burgers beer and pastries during the summer months and a Moroccan restaurant which you can visit during your time at the hotel which was also very high quality and we enjoyed a 3 course meal and drinks were we enjoyed some of the nicest beef tagine we had ever tried.    The hotel has 1 main bar and 1 pool bar both serving a variety of cocktails draught beer spirits and hot drinks which both served great quality drinks to us during our visit. The hotel also has a mini nightclub between 11PM-1AM which has it's own DJ and dance floor. The hotel also has a large entertainment hall which hosted a show each night for guests. The hotel also has a variety of activities for guests to enjoy from archery and a trapeze to football and ping pong each day so there has plenty to do.    We also had a lot of fun on several excursions to dune buggies quad bikes and camel riding which we're all very enjoyable lengthy and well worth the money. Whilst a visit to the markets in Marrakech was a great experience I would highly recommend going with a group or guide as it is very easy to get lost in the centre of Marrakech.    The staff at the hotel were brilliant everyone we encountered was friendly helpful and fun to be around helping to make our visit great. During our visit my friend also proposed to his partner and was all setup and made so much better thanks to the help of the staff and manager making the experience so much better and personal.    Overall I could not recommend the Iberostar Palmeraie enough the hotel was flawless and so was the food drink and entertainment the staff were all fantastic and there was a range of activities and excursions to go on. I would highly recommend this hotel if visiting Marrakech and would definitely return in future. Thank you for a fantastic holiday and experience.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayw1991
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Heli05 wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Pleasant Winter Break,Being a veteran of Marrakech this was my first resort based trip and I'm glad I visited.    Pros:  The hotel is big on hospitality. The staff make a point of conversing and genuinely care if you're having a good time and are happy. I have to thank Imad the hotel manager for ensuring we felt welcome and comfortable at all times he understands what is required to run a hotel in a warm professional and customer focused manner. Hassan the deputy manager was also equally hospitable.    Entertainment & Clubs - The animation team were jolly young and lively. Sousou and Hala were superb in ensuring the children were entertained at the kids club. The evening entertainment was surprisingly enjoyable as it’s not usually something I attend.    Facilities are excellent. Lots of activities for all ages. No tea or coffee machines but these can be ordered at the bar.    Food is varied enough to keep people content even Vegetarians.    Environment - The grounds are lush and well maintained. It's an Oasis manicured out in the desert.    Security - I was glad to see the presence of security around the hotel borders especially given the recent terrorist related incident with those two poor Scandinavian girls.    For obvious reasons the main language spoken is French as were most of the guests when we stayed. As a Londoner this could potentially be disconcerting for some but it wasn't at all. Guests were polite to each other and the majority of staff all spoke English so we had no problems whatsoever.    Free hotel bus throughout the day which can be pre-booked for rides to the city centre which is convenient but we chose not to take this up given our short stay.    Cons:    All relatively minor so can be improved upon easily.    It would have been nice to have our suitcases picked up upon arrival as for security reasons drivers aren't allowed up to the hotel lobby. You get dropped off a few yards outside so we had to wheel them in ourselves albeit we did arrive late evening.    It would be efficient to have replacement cutlery or an area where cutlery can be picked up in the restaurant as every time your plate is taken so is your cutlery sometimes the tables didn't have the full range of cutlery which I guess is probably down to people taking it off other tables.  Again this is minor as the staff will always oblige in fetching replacements for you.    Rooms are a little dated given the age of the hotel and what I'm usually accustomed to but importantly they were clean and spacious.    The English TV channels are sparse. However why would anyone really want to spend time indoors with so much Sun and activities anyway?    Mattresses were firm which I prefer but if your OH suffers from princess and the pea syndrome you may struggle.    AI booze is local and cocktail juices are premixed which is the first time I've experienced this. On other trips it’s always been freshly mixed but I guess this is to be more efficient to crank out orders quickly. Alcohol can be upgraded to top shelf western brands for an additional supplement. The local beer actually was decent the rum was potent.    Other:    Marrakech airport can be a nightmare forget Jemaa el Fnaa the airport is madder than the market when more than one plane arrives at the same time. The queue was huge upon arrival and it's not nice for kids who are tired hungry and grumpy. The security are even grumpier. Airport staff don't properly enforce a queue system for passport control (you'll see people jumping across lines with no supervision) or have enough people in the stamping boothes which doesn't make a pleasant welcome to a tourism based city.    Upon return even for short haul you need to have tickets stamped despite being already checked in. Airport staff aren't clear with directions and security have no sense of urgency they'll happily chat and pour tea from thermoses when a ton of people are queued up to have passports checked.    Arrival and departure slips must be filled in which is fine if they provided them for filling in on the flight which they don't bizarrely they didn't have enough available upon arrival at the airport for all the passengers on the plane! Why not make them electronic for online prefill? This all equates to airport madness in this day and age...    Transfers - my advice is DO NOT use Monzio Carressa or Skyscanner for pre-booked transfers. We almost missed our flight due them having an admin error and the pre-booked transfer having a pickup time that was our flight departure time! Luckily calls by hotel management and Ryanair's lack of punctuation resulted in a positive outcome for once given the aforementioned latent security and passport checks. Also the transfer was late to pick us up upon arrival again not nice when you're hungry and tired from a budget flight and the chaotic airport experience. The stress with the airport and transfer warrants another holiday bearing in mind we didn't face such stress on previous visits.    I’m eager to return but the main concern which is echoed by many other tourists I spoke to are the press reports of radicalised Moroccan men who have returned from Syria fighting for ISIS which has manifested in attacks on tourists on the outskirts. Hopefully the authorities can contain the situation to avoid incidents like those of April 2011 and the recent atrocities involving the Hikers.    All in all Marrakech is a very interesting place with lovely hospitable people. Just keep your wits about you and build in shedloads of time in case of transfer cock ups or airport inefficiencies.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,Londonium,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heli05
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,robertjamessaunders wrote a review Dec 2018,50,"Good four star hotel, five star staff",This is a very decent four star hotel in a good location (far enough from the centre for peace and quiet close enough for easy access) with extensive and beautifully-maintained gardens.    The facilities are perfectly decent if not luxurious and there's some good cooking going on especially of Moroccan food. Good value on an all-inclusive package with cocktails house wines (Moroccan) and beers as well.    But what makes the place really special is the uniformly utterly lovely staff. We were even rescued by a couple of them when we were lost in town and being mildly hassled; they saw us shooed off the pest and put us in a cab. Nothing was ever too much trouble and there appears to be a really good culture in the hotel.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertjamessaunders
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,alexearley wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Great hotel,We travelled as a group of 9 girls and we can’t complain at all. The staff will go out of their way to help you and make sure you’re well looked after the entertainment staff work hard all day everyday to make sure there is always something for you to do. The evening entertainment is good there is a show every night and karaoke on a Sunday and the night club is massive which I was very surprised at. The pool areas and the gardens are well kept just watch out for the pesky stray cats they leave you alone majority of the time but they can creep up on you. The restaurant is clean and tidied up very quickly and the food cannot be complained about at all! The day we were leaving on a 5.30am transfer the hotel guest relations manager went out of his way to make sure we had breakfast ready for us and others who were also leaving.    I never left the hotel as we were only there for 3 nights and just wanted to chill so I can’t comment on Marrakesh itself and the area around the hotel but from what I briefly seen there wasn’t much to do but as I say I can’t comment on it.    Overall a very clean well managed hotel and I would definitely recommended it to couples groups and families.,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexearley

A lovely touch.  The food was incredible. Fresh plentiful and a good variety.  Drinks although all inclusive were very good wine from bottles and cocktails made with fresh ingredients.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mrs L wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Just great....,My husband and I booked this hotel for a week to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. What a wonderful week it was! The hotel is just beautiful. The grounds are well kept and the areas are clean and tidy. We spent the week pretty much at the Zen pool which is the adult relaxation pool and pure relaxation is available in abundance! No music no children and after being given a small tip at the start of the week Salah the pool bar waiter brought us fresh drinks without being asked throughout the day. He could not have been more attentive or polite. The food is good and I am an extremely fussy eater. Restaurant tables cleared immediately and the staff work tirelessly throughout the sittings to ensure everything runs smoothly. My only slight criticism would be the only evening bar that was open is far too small and the staff there will serve French guests before English but this is not apparent anywhere else in the hotel.    Didn’t like Marrakech at all it’s dirty smelly and somewhat disappointing and there is nothing in the immediate area either to walk to but nevertheless absolutely loved this hotel and would wholly recommend it for a week or two of complete self indulgence.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Joester wrote a review Dec 2018,50,You won't be disappointed,"Visited here in Nov 2018 for a friends birthday bash. I was a bit dubious at first having stayed at apparently 4 star all inclusive hotels in Egypt. However I could not have been more wrong. A lovely place with great facilities and friendly staff. Above all the place was spotless.    The standard of the food was very high and the drinks very goodThe spirits were good and the wine excellent for an all-inclusive.I drank the water in the restaurant and ate the saladshad ice in my drinks and didn't have any stomach upsets (unlike Egypt!)    The animation staff are always around and run a number of activities during the day as well as show at night. There is also a ""nightclub"" from 11pm to 1am. Couldn't really advise for kids as we were there out of school holiday season but the kids pool looked fun and there were signs for a couple of clubs.    There were three pools - one for kids (heated when need be) adults only (also heated) plus a huge one for kids and adults (although unheated and a bit fresh when we went!).    The hotel is about 30 minutes form the airport and 15 minutes from the centre of Marrakesh (the medina). However the hotel operates a shuttle-bus (needs to be booked) and taxis are not expensive (about £9 each way) - although confirm the price before you get in as they are not metered and try it on sometimes (price should be 100 dirhams in the daytime and 150 at night).    Security was excellent at the hotel and the guards are on the ball. I did have a walk around outside and through the local village and felt safe. There isn't much else around the hotel except scrub and quad-bike/camel safari places. I did see a water park under construction nearby. But there is so much going on at hotel you don't need to go out really - just my curiosity.    Only downsides - balcony small bed a little hard and wifi in room not very good (but okay in common areas).

Rooms are cleaned daily with fresh towels food is of good quality and varied for different tastes the hotel is set between the lovely gardens which are nice to walk around and kept to a good standard by the staff  There is a adult zen pool which is heated which gets quite busy as it is a bit of a sun trap.  One larger pool which is not heated with soft music played in the background.  Star entertainment staff are always around if you wish to join in well that's OK but if not interested there's no problem they will not pester you they appreciate you are on holiday to relax which is good.  If you wish to venture into the centre of marrakech you can pre book the free shuttle bus from the hotel the day before you wish to go with return trips available. Marrakech Centre can be very busy and be careful of the mopeds which share the pavements with you so keep your eyes open but once you get used to them it's alright just be aware.

Check in was fast and friendly. We were late arriving due to the lengthy immigration procedures at the airport so We were checked in and ushered into the restaurant for a late dinner. Our room was spacious and very clean plenty of room for cases and clothes. The beds were good if a little too hard for our taste but we slept well until the morning chorus first thing which was very loud. Breakfast was great a good choice if prepared foods and cooked to order the service in the restaurant was very efficient and friendly. We booked in at the Moroccan restaurant but although the surroundings were lovely we preferred the main restaurant for the variety.  It was too cold to sit out but we explored the complex and were very impressed by the facilities. The animation team were great fun and in the poor weather they organised indoor activities James was especially enthusiastic and made a point of seeking us out each day to chat. We used the bar for drinks before and after dinner and again there was a reasonable choice and the staff were very obliging. We also had a tour of the spa but sadly did not have the chance to use the great facilities. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would definitely visit again in the future.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolW705

The rooms are clean and spacious but corridors very noisy at night best to bring earplugs. We enjoyed the heated Zen pool but some mornings the bar wasn't open I had to chase staff to open up one day it was well after 12. Food was rather disappointing. Great if you like garlic most everything seems to be covered in it. I lived off salad soup pizza and chicken and chips and the best thing of all were the freshly made doughnuts at breakfast. Not everyone likes garlic! All the veg were smothered in it making a proper meal impossible for me. I didn't starve but compared to other Iberostar hotels I stayed in it was a let down. There is absolutely nothing to walk to outside of the hotel but there is a shuttle bus and you can get a taxi to the Medina or new town. We didn't bother with entertainment but did watch football in the TV room and the bar and lounges were very nice and James one of the entertainment team was good fun.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,will t wrote a review Nov 2018,40,"Great Staff, Good Food...Entertainment..maybe not so.",We returned yesterday from the hotel. As the title says we could not be happier with the staff. From the minute we arrived at the gate and were helped to get our cases into reception. Fatima in reception immediately made us feel at ease and the whole check in process was seamless. The reception area is stunning. Your eyes are drawn up the amazing painted ceiling and huge chandelier all in a beautiful Moroccan style. All the while the scent of Fleur D' Orange fills the air. You feel so relaxed after your manic drive from the airport.    We went to our room and our cases were brought to the room so no heavy lugging of your luggage. The room was a standard room which was kept spotlessly clean but unfortunately didn't over look the stunning gardens of the hotel. Instead as you can see by the photos we had a rather unsightly view of the delivery yard and roof. The distant view was lovely with mountains and palms. We also had to suffer the noise of the quad bikes being tested and run from the camel and quad bike centre opposite the road.  However it might be that as we booked through British Airways it was quite cheap so maybe certain rooms are allocated to certain airlines. Anyway it wan't something that was going to ruin someones holiday. It's not as if you spend too much time in the room. Why would you want to when the hotel has so many lovely public spaces and gardens.    The all inclusive drinks are obviously not premium spirits but they are OK. The bar staff are all very helpful and friendly and you are always greeted with a smile. One of the bar waitresses Helima made a very special effort to get to know us. Most people spoke French which we don't but her English was certainly better than our French. Nothing was too much trouble for her. Always a smile for everyone. A real asset to this hotel.    The all inclusive food.The food selection must cover something for everyone. From your usual pizza chips etc to a huge range of salads traditional Moroccan foods Spanish lots of freshly cooked meats and fish. If you have any dietary requirements they are only too happy to accommodate. I have read a few reviews saying how fabulous it is. I wouldn't say fabulous. It was good and there was a nice bit of variation and neither of us suffered any stomach issues lol. but once again the staff are just so eager to help. The chefs will explain what the dishes are if you don't know. The waiters and waitresses again make the experience of this hotel well worth while. The first day we met Youseff who made sure we had everything we needed for our lunch and dinner. A few days later we met Lailae (sorry if I have your name wrong) for breakfast. What a bundle of energy. Someone who must love her work and it shows in everything she does.    Entertainment or maybe not... I say that because there is a full programme of things to do and the choice is there for you. The activity team were always asking for you to participate but not to the point of being annoying like some animation teams. My only issue and it's not only related to this hotel. The shows are not very good. I don't who thinks up the ideas but have they actually looked at what people might want to see. We are in our early fifties and the shows were laughable to be honest. I did participate in the karaoke one night but even that gets stretched out to fill the night.  We even went to the disco one night. This was my biggest let down. I have DJ'd in the UK for ten years and it wasn't even the music that was the issue although your DJ wasn't the best at holding a crowd. It was the lack of lighting. There were TWO par36 lights flashing on and off most of the night. You could see from the lighting rig that there had been more lights. I did notice a few in the dining room as we ate our dinner under UV/Pink light one night for some reason. Why has the lighting rig been stripped it's a great space and could be busy. Or is it the intention that it's not busy so the drinks bill is kept low. If your going to have a show people expect a bit more and if you want people to have a late night then get your lighting rig sorted out.    Well we had a relaxing break and the staff really make such a difference to this hotel. I may not likely return but that is not because of the hotel it's because it's rather out the way from anything. There's not even anything local. Sometimes the centre of Marrakesh is too much and there was a bus to take your there and pick you up for free but sometimes it's nice just to wander round where you are but I wouldn't have felt comfortable doing that.    Great Place great staff good food entertainment team need to think again.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billi65

The staff are superb and can't do enough to make sure you have the best possible time. The bedrooms are well appointed and like the rest of the hotel are spotless. The hotel sits in huge beautiful gardens that are lovingly tendered by a small army of staff. There's a huge choice of excellent quality food in the airy restaurant there's a dedicated Morrocan hot table with lots of delicious local delicacies which we really enjoyed. You would be very hard pushed not to find something on the menu at breakfast lunch or evening meal. Remember to make use of the shuttle bus and don't be afraid to explore the city. A sense of humour and a smile goes a long way here. The square at night is a real feast for the eyes ears and nose! There's plenty of police around and we never felt intimidated or hassled.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,battisonr wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Would highly recommend this amazing resort,Stayed here with my husband all inclusive for a ten night getaway. What can I say - the resort is amazing - beautiful gardens immaculately clean. The adult quiet heated swimming pool was lovely we used it lots ( even in November ). The food was great - and yes it was a buffet but there was always plenty to choose from and the menu was varied on a daily basis. The food truck was great for an afternoon snack. The staff were friendly welcoming and enthusiastic from morning to night. Lots of sports activities throughout the day and a show every night to ensure that we were entertained. I would highly recommend this little oasis in Marrakech.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Naz313 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Great Value with the All Inclusive Option,This resort is a really great value with the all inclusive option. They offer many amenities and activities. The food was generally good for a buffet. Many food choices and they consistently changed the selections the whole time we were there (5 days). The customer service was excellent. Really friendly staff. They also offer a shuttle to and from town (near Jemaa al Fna and the entrance to the souks. You have to book the shuttle the day before. Be very careful when at the souks or anywhere within the Médina. This is the only place I’ve been where I was really concerned for our safety. It is sad that this place has turned into a haven for organized scammers and gangs. Just google scams in Marrakech. We saw it first hand multiple times. It is sad that the shop owners tolerate this. You should never bite the hand that feeds you. Aside from that I would recommend the hotel to anyone.,Date of stay: November 2018,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naz313
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Zoe C wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Best holiday in a while!,We stayed for 2 weeks at the end of October and it was brilliant. As soon as we walked in we were looked after. They sorted our rooms whilst we went for lunch so there was no waiting round at reception. Throughout our stay the managers were always around talking to the customers and making sure everything was okay.    We chose to go to the zen pool when sunbathing as it was a child free zone and a great pool to relax by. Salah the barman was absolutely brilliant. Couldn’t do more for us! Never had a gin missing from my hand...    The entertainment team were just brilliant. Even though there days are incredibly long they were always full of energy. There were activities each day which the entertainment team got you involved in. Ayoub Yousef and Morad were just brilliant with us getting us to try new things (trapezing!!!!). The shows were okay maybe some better choreography would be needed to have more of an audience but some were lots of fun.    There was a good range of food on offer. The waiters and waitress’ were helpful and always smiling. Always quick to clear your table and to see if you needed a drink. The barman in reception were always super friendly and again couldn’t do more for you.    The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the centre which is good to get to the souks and surrounding areas. The atlas mountains are not far from the hotel either so planning trips can be very easy.    A really relaxing holiday. The staff are incredible and the hotel is just gorgeous.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Carol W wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Short break with friends,We booked Club Palmaraie for a break with friends on arrival we loved the hotel and the reception area. Check in was fast and friendly. We were late arriving due to the lengthy immigration procedures at the airport so We were checked in and ushered into the restaurant for a late dinner. Our room was spacious and very clean plenty of room for cases and clothes. The beds were good if a little too hard for our taste but we slept well until the morning chorus first thing which was very loud. Breakfast was great a good choice if prepared foods and cooked to order the service in the restaurant was very efficient and friendly. We booked in at the Moroccan restaurant but although the surroundings were lovely we preferred the main restaurant for the variety.  It was too cold to sit out but we explored the complex and were very impressed by the facilities. The animation team were great fun and in the poor weather they organised indoor activities James was especially enthusiastic and made a point of seeking us out each day to chat. We used the bar for drinks before and after dinner and again there was a reasonable choice and the staff were very obliging. We also had a tour of the spa but sadly did not have the chance to use the great facilities. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would definitely visit again in the future.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolW705
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MCR4BORO wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Nice hotel but a few improvements needed,Overall we had a lovely holiday and I must say that check in was effortless and the staff were mostly very efficient and helpful. The rooms are clean and spacious but corridors very noisy at night best to bring earplugs. We enjoyed the heated Zen pool but some mornings the bar wasn't open I had to chase staff to open up one day it was well after 12. Food was rather disappointing. Great if you like garlic most everything seems to be covered in it. I lived off salad soup pizza and chicken and chips and the best thing of all were the freshly made doughnuts at breakfast. Not everyone likes garlic! All the veg were smothered in it making a proper meal impossible for me. I didn't starve but compared to other Iberostar hotels I stayed in it was a let down. There is absolutely nothing to walk to outside of the hotel but there is a shuttle bus and you can get a taxi to the Medina or new town. We didn't bother with entertainment but did watch football in the TV room and the bar and lounges were very nice and James one of the entertainment team was good fun. Would I return? probably not.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Easington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahsP8859TH
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,will t wrote a review Nov 2018,40,"Great Staff, Good Food...Entertainment..maybe not so.",We returned yesterday from the hotel. As the title says we could not be happier with the staff. From the minute we arrived at the gate and were helped to get our cases into reception. Fatima in reception immediately made us feel at ease and the whole check in process was seamless. The reception area is stunning. Your eyes are drawn up the amazing painted ceiling and huge chandelier all in a beautiful Moroccan style. All the while the scent of Fleur D' Orange fills the air. You feel so relaxed after your manic drive from the airport.    We went to our room and our cases were brought to the room so no heavy lugging of your luggage. The room was a standard room which was kept spotlessly clean but unfortunately didn't over look the stunning gardens of the hotel. Instead as you can see by the photos we had a rather unsightly view of the delivery yard and roof. The distant view was lovely with mountains and palms. We also had to suffer the noise of the quad bikes being tested and run from the camel and quad bike centre opposite the road.  However it might be that as we booked through British Airways it was quite cheap so maybe certain rooms are allocated to certain airlines. Anyway it wan't something that was going to ruin someones holiday. It's not as if you spend too much time in the room. Why would you want to when the hotel has so many lovely public spaces and gardens.    The all inclusive drinks are obviously not premium spirits but they are OK. The bar staff are all very helpful and friendly and you are always greeted with a smile. One of the bar waitresses Helima made a very special effort to get to know us. Most people spoke French which we don't but her English was certainly better than our French. Nothing was too much trouble for her. Always a smile for everyone. A real asset to this hotel.    The all inclusive food.The food selection must cover something for everyone. From your usual pizza chips etc to a huge range of salads traditional Moroccan foods Spanish lots of freshly cooked meats and fish. If you have any dietary requirements they are only too happy to accommodate. I have read a few reviews saying how fabulous it is. I wouldn't say fabulous. It was good and there was a nice bit of variation and neither of us suffered any stomach issues lol. but once again the staff are just so eager to help. The chefs will explain what the dishes are if you don't know. The waiters and waitresses again make the experience of this hotel well worth while. The first day we met Youseff who made sure we had everything we needed for our lunch and dinner. A few days later we met Lailae (sorry if I have your name wrong) for breakfast. What a bundle of energy. Someone who must love her work and it shows in everything she does.    Entertainment or maybe not... I say that because there is a full programme of things to do and the choice is there for you. The activity team were always asking for you to participate but not to the point of being annoying like some animation teams. My only issue and it's not only related to this hotel. The shows are not very good. I don't who thinks up the ideas but have they actually looked at what people might want to see. We are in our early fifties and the shows were laughable to be honest. I did participate in the karaoke one night but even that gets stretched out to fill the night.  We even went to the disco one night. This was my biggest let down. I have DJ'd in the UK for ten years and it wasn't even the music that was the issue although your DJ wasn't the best at holding a crowd. It was the lack of lighting. There were TWO par36 lights flashing on and off most of the night. You could see from the lighting rig that there had been more lights. I did notice a few in the dining room as we ate our dinner under UV/Pink light one night for some reason. Why has the lighting rig been stripped it's a great space and could be busy. Or is it the intention that it's not busy so the drinks bill is kept low. If your going to have a show people expect a bit more and if you want people to have a late night then get your lighting rig sorted out.    Well we had a relaxing break and the staff really make such a difference to this hotel. I may not likely return but that is not because of the hotel it's because it's rather out the way from anything. There's not even anything local. Sometimes the centre of Marrakesh is too much and there was a bus to take your there and pick you up for free but sometimes it's nice just to wander round where you are but I wouldn't have felt comfortable doing that.    Great Place great staff good food entertainment team need to think again.,Date of stay: November 2018,,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billi65
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,eastonite wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Superb customer service,Stayed on an all inclusive package through Thomas Cook and loved everything about this fantastic hotel. The staff are superb and can't do enough to make sure you have the best possible time. The bedrooms are well appointed and like the rest of the hotel are spotless. The hotel sits in huge beautiful gardens that are lovingly tendered by a small army of staff. There's a huge choice of excellent quality food in the airy restaurant there's a dedicated Morrocan hot table with lots of delicious local delicacies which we really enjoyed. You would be very hard pushed not to find something on the menu at breakfast lunch or evening meal. Remember to make use of the shuttle bus and don't be afraid to explore the city. A sense of humour and a smile goes a long way here. The square at night is a real feast for the eyes ears and nose! There's plenty of police around and we never felt intimidated or hassled.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Happie Avocado wrote a review Nov 2018,50,We loved it!,Firstly we cannot recommend this hotel enough. We spent ages reading all the TripAdvisor reviews for this and other nearby hotels and we definitely made the right choice.    For ease we've broken things down into bullet points.    ** Food and drink    The food generally is excellent. The buffet breakfast lunch and dinner offer a good variety with several options cooked fresh to order and while some options are always available there are enough new things offered each day.    Definitely try the Moroccan themed restaurant which offers a tasting menu.    At lunch remember to check outside for the barbecue as this is often good but sometimes we forgot because it's out of the way.    Between breakfast and lunch the snack van by the main pool offers burgers and hotdogs. Both are good though include a lot of bread. Between lunch and dinner you can get sandwiches crêpes and waffles which are fantastic.    The all-inclusive drink service ran until midnight in the lobby bar. The drinks were nice but limited and repetitive. The wine and beer are both good but the cocktails unfortunately are the weak point.    You can have drinks by the zen pool and sometimes table service was offered.    ** Rooms    Our room was nice featuring a view over the extensive gardens and basic amenities such as air-con.    The bathroom was lovely spacious and clean.    A safe with a PIN code is provided without need of a deposit.    The bed was massive and comfortable and we both slept well all week.    ** Entertainment / Activities    There is an event each night after dinner in the theatre by the main pool including dances karaoke and a Moroccan night. Each event is only on once per week.    During the day the range of activities is extensive. We highly recommend the trapeze as this was something neither of us had seen in a hotel and was great fun.    The animation team stays at the main and the kids' pools so if you're at the adults-only zen pool they won't bother you and you can't hear the music from there.    There is a board by the lobby bar outlining the events schedule but this was subject to change a few times and while the events were fun we felt they could be communicated better.    ** Amenities    We only used the aforementioned zen pool so cannot comment on the others. It was very relaxed with its own bar sun loungers and comfortable day beds.    The staff are very quick to enforce the 'no kids' rule here which we appreciated as it is meant to offer a more relaxing experience.    ** Location    The transfer from the airport is no more than half an hour.    While there is nothing within walking distance the hotel provides a free shuttle bus to Marrakech. This leaves several times a day and drops you off mid-way between the old and new towns. It returns from the same place.    It departs from outside the front gate and takes about 20 minutes.    The last return is 10pm.    We were advised a taxi would cost about 100 dirhams (£10).    ** Other    There are cats and geese wandering the gardens around the hotel. They are well-behaved and a unique attraction.    The lobby smells amazing.    There is a gift shop if you don't make it to the markets in the city but it's definitely worth the trip as it is so close.    The hotel should be proud of its staff. They are helpful and welcoming. We only had one small issue during our stay and it was rectified almost immediately.    ** Conclusion    This is a wonderful hotel. We spent a thoroughly relaxing and enjoyable week here and were generally very happy with every part of the service. The zen pool is without question the highlight of this hotel if you are a couple like us.    We would happily look at other Iberostar hotels in future.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happieavocado
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Carolyn M wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Carolyn Hallsworth,We have stayed at this hotel before and it is a beautiful hotel. Everything is included the safe. WiFi in rooms and hotel. 2 litres of water free everyday. Free pool towels. There are plenty of first class loungers by pool.  The room is very good we had a ground floor room with walk in shower close to everything. We did email them to request a room like that. There is good hairdryer in room  However we were there last week of October and first week November. The first week of October is Morrocan half term. The hotel was inundated with kids running round at high speed the hotel corridors. Some using segways screaming and shouting.and young boys hiding in ladies toilets and while there pissing on the walls so it pooled on the floor. Loads of people complained at the desk. Eventually some managers waited in corridors and took children back to their “lovely” parents. So folks don’t go to this hotel last week October. Our second week in November was much better and quieter. I would just mention the Morrocan immigration and leaving takes hours at least three coming in and leaving people were almost late for their flight and had to run for it. This part of looking at the form and your passport needs sorting.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3827TIcarolynm
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,JollyHol wrote a review Nov 2018,50,"This hotel ""made"" the holiday!",I am currently staying at this hotel leaving tomorrow and everything about the hotel has made my weeks' holiday to Marrakech an enjoyable stay. The staff are very helpful and friendly the hotel is spotless grounds very nice food excellent and every choice possible there are three pools and plenty of activities if you want them but everything is calm and relaxed. As the grounds around the hotel are vast plus a small farm in a top corner for children (consisting of a peacock swans chickens and a sheep) nothing is on top of each other. The hotel is very secure with a security man on the gate. Whilst this hotel is about half an hours' drive in traffic from the centre of Marrakech there is a free and regular full size coach running there and back throughout the day including one which leaves Marrakech at 10.30 pm. We caught this bus to enjoy the evening in Marrakech and it turned up bang on time to collect four of us. Whilst enjoying the buzz of Marrakech I prefer to stay outside the City; albeit I have never been to Marrakech before and so this was pure luck. Some of the hotels we have seen whilst heard very nice do not look to be in locations I would choose....other than the Royal Manso but then a completely different price range! Whilst staying at the Iberostar you can relax take a trip which will pick you up at the hotel or catch the courtesy bus into Marrakech. There are taxis outside the hotel but there is nothing else around other than camels! Today Imman the Guest Manager kindly let me do my BA check in as you can only check-in 24 hours before and I don't have a printer. Nothing is too much trouble and so this hotel and the staff deserve a good rating.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sweden, Maine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JollyHol
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,JCMalvern wrote a review Nov 2018,40,"Really good, but could easily be better!",The hotel is excellent and the inclusive food was terrific with lots of choice there are loads of facilities and they're good I love all inclusive and nothing about this hotel is mean we ate well and drank well.    Things I think might be improved breakfast food could be hotter and frying eggs is a simple skill but still requires care and some interest in the result. Although I asked them to flip the egg (over easy) I never got an egg where the white was cooked. I asked for a pancake from the hot plate to be heated up and was told it was hot no it was just very slightly warm. An unusual lapse where customer service was really impressive here. (By the way hotel some plate warmers would help too).    Noise. I guess this is inevitable with tiles and concrete but the people upstairs seemed obsessed with moving the furniture amplified like a sound box for me below and it was hard to have a good conversation at dinner the noise of chatter being very loud. Both these issues are due to design and furnishing but as others have said the amazing amount of cleaning is assisted by avoiding sound deadening carpet and drapes I guess we all prefer clean.    Don't let anything I've said stop you booking it's mainly for the hotel to know we will be back I'm sure. Positives - big rooms - good air conditioning - absolute cleanliness - great staff - lots to do.    This is my third visit to Morocco the first two as an independant traveller. Being absolutely honest I will be happy never to visit another souk carpet shop or leather tannery. My advice is come for the sun and the golf if you play just forget being a tourist and enjoy these enclaves of luxury.    And if Iberostar have any pull with authority they will try to do something about the appalling lack of customer service which spoils the beautiful new airport pensioners (or anyone else for that matter) should not have to spend 90 minutes standing in a queue for passport control.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Great Malvern,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCMalvern
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,andyhart21 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Fantastic hotel with unbelievable staff!,We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakesh at the beginning of November 2018. From the moment we arrived we were made so welcome by the staff they were all so friendly and helpful. The kids animation team (Starfriends) were incredible with our kids and a special mention has to go to Chicken Legs who my daughter took a particular shine to! We never felt that the attention we received was anything but genuine the people are all so nice from the grounds maintenance staff to the manager. I have never seen a hotel where the staff were cleaning as much as this one the corridor outside our room was mopped 4-5 times every day! The food was great we have been to all inclusive hotels before where the choice became repetitive but not here. I would be amazed if anyone could not find something they liked to eat.  The choice of drinks was also good the red wine was very drinkable and the cocktails went down very well.  The choice of activities was great for everyone young and old. The trapeze went down very well with the kids even my 4 year old had a go!  The pool areas were good but I have to say that the main pool needs to be heated particularly at this time of year. It spoke volumes that there was literally no one in the huge main pool most of the time. The adults only pool is heated and so is the splash pool but this isn’t big enough for older kids to play in. This is my only negative for the whole holiday but it would have made a big difference.  We would definitely come back to this hotel it has been one of our best holidays but what really made it was the staff.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,LindaGve wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Well looked after during our stay,This was my second visit to this hotel and don't think it will be the last.    My sister and I were very well looked after I had a minor accident on day one which involved the hotel calling out a doctor to me after I fell. Everything was dealt with very professionally and I just needed a couple of stiches. The staff were extremely caring and concerned for my welfare I felt they did the best they could for me. The only thing I would add to this comment was that the swing doors to the ladies toilet in the pool area need oiling/loosening off so that they're not as stiff to open.    Our arrival on day one was marred somewhat by the very long delay at passport control at the airport - approximately 2 hours. Not the hotel's fault of course but please do put pressure on the authorities as this looked to be a staffing issue with not all of the booths fully manned i.e. 1 person in some booths 3 in others. It could have been prevented. Going out of the country also involved about a one hour queue.    On the day we left the clocks had not gone back as expected - the Moroccan government had decided not to do this two days prior (not the fault of the hotel again although we could have been warned) but the Thomas Cook rep was not proactive in warning departing guests about this which meant some were phoned at the last minute as they'd slept in - all phones had gone back an hour so the alarms didn't go off. Fortunately we'd asked the hotel to phone us at 6.00 a.m. - the rep should have been advising guests to set this up rather than leaving it until too late in the morning.    The WIFI could be better tends to drop out frequently meaning you have to keep logging in and we couldn't get a signal around the pool.    Having cash is a problem as the machine in the hotel wasn't working. You shouldn't have to bring cash for the deposit for the towels in a top hotel fortunately we had our own with us.    That's enough negative comments. On the positive side we enjoyed the food very much it can be a bit the same but there's usually a theme each day for specials of the day and we found there was so much choice that it's easy enough to find something new every lunch and dinner.    And the staff are fantastic special mention to Salah the waiter in the Zen pool he looked after us very well friendly and always smiling. And to Imad in the reception area I think his official title was public relations he made sure I was treated very well after my accident.    Last year and this I had some golf lessons with Hassan. Very nice man and a good and patient teacher I thoroughly enjoyed this part of the holiday. I would repeat though my comments from last year that he needs some new golf clubs! Please get him some new equipment. He also needs some small clubs for children to play with all of the golf clubs are for adults but this is an ideal time for children to be introduced to the game.    A big thumbs up from me and my sister I recommend you go to this hotel if you're looking for a relaxing hotel with a bit of culture in Marrakech thrown in.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaGve

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,trumpton2015 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Wow what a trip!,We as a family  my wife our daughter son in law  and 3 grandchildren age from 7- 1 year have just returned from a really fabulous 7 days at this hotel.  The service we received was exceptional . The hotel facilities were wide and varied. The restaurant provided a good range of food to suit all. They provided a beautiful and delicious 1 st birthday cake for our granddaughter . The waiting staff were always happy and on hand ( perhaps just a little too keen to clear plates! - but that  Is a minuscule complaint ) Our grandchildren and indeed other children were made to feel so welcome.  The hotel and grounds were imaculately kept and  Bedrooms were spotless with fresh towels bed linen every day ! All In all a brilliant experience.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Ian D wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Brilliant Hotel with excellent staff,Simply put we loved this hotel. It was so clean and well maintained with huge comfortable beds and lovely surroundings.  The facilities on offer including spa gym 3 pools nightclub kids club and various outdoor sports were also impressive.    What made this holiday even better were the staff. I cannot praise them enough for making us so welcome and comfortable.    We were welcomed by Imad the Customer Relations Manager on our arrival and throughout our week he constantly ensured our needs were taken care of.  When the shuttle bus broke down he organised for paid taxis for over 20 guests to be taken into Marrakech called our transfer company to confirm our pick up time and made a point of asking us if everything was ok every time he saw us. Customer Service which i can only describe as second to none.    The Animation team were a joy to be around constantly entertaining us from early morning till late at night and going the extra mile to make us feel welcome. Especially when it came to my 9 year old daughter who they were always high fiving and joking with which she loved.    I'd like to mention the following Animation team members Malaa Bob Jimmy and James all of whom were fun and entertaining along with Younas Abdel and the chef with the blue hat (did the Paella demonstration) in the restaurant who were always friendly and helpful.    I'd also like to make an extra special mention for Mohammed and Amen (aka Chicken Legs) from the Animation Team both of which went the extra mile making us laugh had dinner with us and genuinely gave heartfelt service.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Blackpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534iand
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jenny1973 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,An amazing hotel with incredibly friendly staff and service,From the moment we arrived after hours spent in customs at the airport nothing was too much for the staff at the Iberostar. The manager immediately got us all our “all inclusive” bands and allowed us to eat our much needed lunch and allowed us to check in at our leisure afterwards.    The entertainment Staff made everyone feel welcome without being pushy for the activities. Although there was no need to be pushy as the activities were all ones that our family loved taking part in - there is even a trapeze you can have a go at.    The weather was a bit rainy and unusually cold when we first arrived but games were all laid out in the common rooms and we had a lovely afternoon playing games and eating donuts pancakes and drinks.    There are 3 large pools (one adult only and one kids only) monitored by life guards.    The restaurant staff again were also so helpful. It’s all too common in these places for certain drinks to be excluded or staff to ignore you a bit in a place so busy or large but not so here. The staff were there for your every need.    We couldn’t work our safe in the room and someone was there immediately to resolve it.    There is a shuttle into Marrakech but beware you have to book in advance but can only book 24 hours in advance so you can’t plan ahead too much.    The hotel was in beautiful grounds and it was lovely to walk around.    There was entertainment for the children every evening and a different show per night.    We had a great week and would love to return either here or to another Iberostar!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenny1973
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,barryshevill wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Autumn sunshine,On the outskirts of Marrakesh but with a free shuttle bus into the city although the time table in the afternoon/evening could be a bit more flexible.. The hotel is a garden hotel and they are wonderful all the rooms seem to have some view to these beautiful gardens. Our room was excellent very clean really huge bed! and a nice size . The leisure facilities are very good they even have a trapeze set up although I thought the gym was a bit poorly fitted out. We didn’t need the kids facilities but they looked fantastic. We also didn’t use the main poolinstead we went to the Zen pool which was really relaxing until they seemed to ignore their rule of no children at times there were more children wearing green child bands than adults only when we and others complained did they react. There was a nice bar by the Zen pool and special mention to Sallah the barman he really looked after us. The quality and choice of food at this hotel was excellent at breakfastlunch and dinner we couldn’t fault the food. At times the main buffet restaurant in the evening was spoilt by little kids running about ( where are the parents they’re to blame) so we ate outside which was lovely and Rashida our waitress was lovely and always looked after us  One thing we did notice was the bar was very busy at timeswith no waiter table service it created a queue as the lobby bar is the only one to serve all areas they need another bar maybe outside in the garden. But don’t let these small criticism put you off this hotel we would go back again and thoroughly recommend a stay here.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryshevill
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MEAKINFAMILY wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Quality hotel with amazing grounds,Hi all    Stayed at this hotel from the 24th October for 1 week.    GOOD POINTS    Gorgeous grounds  Spotlessly clean  3 nice pools  Nice rooms  Staff amazingly friendly  Staff generally can’t enough for you  Beer good  Red wine isn’t bad as all inclusive Red wine is normally shocking  Lots of choice with all meals throughout the day although eating at the hotel everyday can be a bit repetitive  Really Nice to sit outside in restaurant seating area if weather is good.  Free shuttle bus to get to Marrakech centre  Tennis courts  Table tennis  Boules  Trapeze  Badminton  Thomas cook rep really nice and friendly    NEGATIVE POINTS    Predominantly French orientated  Most entertainment in French  Inside the restaurant did have a canteen feel about it although restaurant outside seating area is really nice  Bar and area did feel like a proper bar  Only one bar inside and not a lot of seating area if weather is poor  If weather is bad no where in walking distance to have a change of scenery.  No pool table  No table tennis inside hotel  Minimal activity’s to do inside hotel if weather is poor although the entertainment team do their best to try and entertain people but do seem to lean towards the French guests but this may be down to French being their second language and they are not as comfortable with the English language.    Note! A lot of the negatives above will not be an issue if the weather is good.    MARRAKECH OLD TOWN    15-20 mins away on free shuttle bus  100 dirhams £10 taxi each way. Do not pay anymore    Most shops in souks sold poor quality products  Lots of poor quality fake goods  A majority of restaurants or bars do not sell alcohol although you can find some that do.    Monkeys and snakes in square not treated well    Area does smell in places.    Not very picturesque but we expected this.    TRIPS    Atlas mountain trip with camel ride booked via trip advisor was amazing.  Minibus driver really nice and drove safely  First stop off at Aragon oil place of produce had bread with oil and Moroccan tea  Then moved on to camel ride place for 20 min camel ride  Then onwards to the Atlas Mountains get dropped off to meet new guide Rachid who took us on a 2 hr walk and around the mountain area telling us all the interesting facts about the mountains and Berber way of life  Finished off the trip with a meal at a restaurant roof top with the most amazing view.  Rachid was a lovely guy who did a great job showing us the area he lived.  Cost of trip was around £42 each and was well worth the money  Highlight of our trip.    Meals outside the hotel in Marrakech    Amaia  ItalianAsianEuropean food  Had a great meal Thai chicken salad followed by fillet steak with wine. Highly recommended  Cost  £18 fillet steak with chips sauce veg  Thai chicken salad £9  Bottle of nice house red £16    Kech Burger    The best burgers we have ever had £6 for fries  Burgers and soft drink    Restaurants wanted to try but booked up  These seems to be the best in Marrakech    L’Annexe  Barometer    If you want to doing it cheap I heard of people eating really street food for £1.50 but I didn’t want to run the risk of being ill    BEER AND POOL    Try Compton Arms  Good beer although not Cheap £4.50 to £5 pint  The best English speaking French man I have ever heard.  He is a really nice chap  I believe the food was good but never got chance to try it.    OVERALL TRIP  Loved the holiday  Book the trip with tripadvisor. Trip with Thomas cook was £60 without camel ride  Hotel was good  Weather was mixed one day scorching 28 degrees next day 16 degrees with rain  If you want winter sun I would recommend going September or early October,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEAKINFAMILY
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mike S wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Good value,"This hotel complex is a little oasis in Morocco. The grounds are extensive buildings and rooms palatial and gardens lovely and well kept. Whatever small problems people have mentioned in their reviews they should bear in mind how reasonably priced it is too and all the excellent things you get for your money. Good points include staff that are keen to make your stay as wonderful as possible; rooms that are well maintained very clean and beautiful to look at; lots of lovely food; heated swimming pools. Okay so a pedantic person could find fault and maybe some of their findings are important to them but in my opinion there was nothing seriously wrong. French is the main language written and spoken there but it is a ""foreign"" country and the staff do their very best to understand and speak English mostly very well so I did not find it a problem. One swimming pool is set aside for adults and it is not well sign-posted as such but there are 2 other swimming pools children can use. Most of the food is Moroccan-based and repetitive but there is an enormous choice many daily changes and Moroccan food is very tasty. Food can sometimes be just warm - but there is a microwave there for people who like their food piping hot. The entertainment was a bit naff and repetitive but there is always the TV - it had English-speaking films on every night (station No 53). The wifi could be a bit hit and miss but I always got there in the end. What did spoil it for me was that the weather was cold and wet most of the week I was there. When the sun did come out it was hot (though still cold in the shade). You take a chance going on holiday there in October and if sun is essential to your holiday I'd suggest you go before then. There are lots of outdoor activities throughout the day eg archery darts volleyball etc but these are cancelled when it rains. The other problem for me was that my room (1160) was very noisy most of the night - but this was the cost of the otherwise welcome convenience of being in the main building next to reception the restaurant and the main bar.",Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Witham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freddyminster
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,DAVID G wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Fabulous,Beautiful hotel lovely grounds and gardens to walk round which are kept clean and tidy. Fantastic pools. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good variety of food and very tasty. Could only fault that the food was sometimes only warm and not piping hot. Gorgeous cakes though. Plenty of activities to do through the day. shame the golf is just like a driving range and not a crazy golf course as this could be beautifully intergrated into the gardens and would be a great addition for families kids and adults to enjoy. Room was excellent and always clean. Hotel about 20-25 mins away from the city but free shuttle bus fairly regular. Taxi's are a fixed price at 100 dirhams into the city and 150 from city to hotel so you know the cost and are not ripped off. Entertainment on an evening wasn't the best we have experienced in our eyes but we spent most evenings playing cards etc as a family. Me and my partner tried the Spa and had an amazing experience and would definitely recommend this.Will definitely be returning next year.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Carlisle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgX5584MD
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,natasha R wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Nice hotel but disappointing,Lovely hotel but I wouldn’t advise staying if food is a important part of your holiday.    The food - the food genuinely ruined our holiday experience. It was very repetitive with the same food being served everyday across both lunch and dinner. This wouldn’t have been so bad if the quality of the food had been better but we found it to be mediocre at best. It was also even more limiting for vegetarians as there was no labelling of vegetarian options and little choice. We hoped to have some change when we booked the morrocan restaurant and was very disappointed to find this was the exact same food as served in the buffet.    Thomas Cook - not entirely their fault but the Moroccan government decided 2 days in advance not to put the clocks back. However despite being aware the Thomas Cook rep made no attempt to communicate this to the guests. This led to the majority of guests being late for the bus pick up back to the airport. This included a frantic last minute attempt to call all late guests. Despite having a second hotel pick up they didn’t even call ahead to this hotel despite suggestions to the rep to do so. This again led to lengthy delays at the second hotel. Very poor customer service and no apologies given.    Airport - Be aware of lengthy waits in immigration it was just over two hours on the way out and about an hour on the way back.    Rooms - good size and very clean. However not what we booked as we had two separate single beds pushed together to make a double.    Hotel - lovely grounds very clean and well maintained. We spent a lot of time at the adults only zen pool. This pool was heated  with a bar and big beds to relax by the pool. We always had access to a sun bed as very few guests reserved them. Good variety of drinks. The cocktails taste watered down but the spirits wines and beer are decent.    Cash machine - this was broken for our entire stay so don’t rely on this. Bring some cash with you as you need 200 for towel deposit which we didn’t have until we went into Marrakech. Paying for towels is not expected from a 4* hotel.    Marrakech - hotel runs regular shuttles you just need to book the day before. We often got a taxi back for around 100 it’s worth bartering to get this price.    Spa - lovely facilities reasonably priced and enjoyable treatments. However be wary of the deals as they seem like you get a lot more for your money. We got the 1200 hammam and massage which seemed to include a pedicure and facial in reality this was just some scrub briefly applied to the face and feet. They insist on paying cash rather than card.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/708natashar
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,YaniL wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Not good not bad,"The hotel itself was really nice. Very nice welcoming and the staff very attentive at first. As we arrived quite early in the morning our room was not ready but we could enjoy the hotel facilities in the meantime.  However once we did the check-in everything was downhill. The staff did not show us where the room was either escorted us to the room or informed us about the restaurant times and bookings. So we were lost almost 15 min trying to figure in which direction the room was. Once we got it there was made as a twin instead of double bed - so calling to reception to ask for what we have paid. The man at reception was kind of rude and sharp but he sorted out :) which was OK.  The second day we put the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door but guess what? The maids cleaned the room. That day was OK - we were on holidays so just let it go! BUT the third day we put the sign again as we did not want any cleaning and again the housekeeping went into our room and made as clean. That was so frustrating as we did not put any of our belongings in the safe box.  Went down to reception to complain about it but no one at the desk. Why do you put ""do not disturb"" sign if you just ignore it? That does not make any sense.  On that night we wanted to go to the Moroccan restaurant so we went there and the waiting staff told us we needed to book a table so we tried to do it but they told us it should be done upon checking-in. (?)  Then we booked and prepaid a taxi at the desk to go to the airport the next day early in the morning. Apparently it was fine until we saw the only taxi driver had picked other guests up and not us. We talked to reception and promised us another taxi in 10 min - which never arrived. (?) Why do I need to wait half an hour waiting for a taxi that I booked the previous night?  After complaining to reception they gave us the refund for the taxi and we could get another one just in front of the hotel.    The stay was quite frustrating especially when we expected such a nice holidays. Apart from those things the facilities and the food are nice.  On the time we went all the staff spoke in French but it was not a big deal for us :)",Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yanileme
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,london86 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Good hotel; outstanding service,I stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie for 8 nights with my mum back in July/August 2018. This will be pretty long so I have split into sections for ease.    Arrival/check-in:    We were greeted with a cold refreshing juice drink which we sipped while completing the paperwork. We were given a map and some basic info re meal times and then taken to our room.    Room:    On opening the door we were greeted with an awful smell of sewage/stagnant water. It was really quite horrible and so the porter phoned down to reception to ask about changing. Cue some back-and-forth phone calls between the porter myself and reception where I was finally able to establish that no other rooms were available. Air freshener was suggested but I'm asthmatic and my mum has a chronic lung condition so that was a no go. Eventually we agreed to go for dinner while they cleaned the floors. On returning it appeared that they had used chemicals which did trigger my asthma but the smell had gone and the chemical smell soon abated. After that it was fine so I have no idea what had caused it; perhaps they use stagnant water to mop the floors? I don't know.    Otherwise the room was a decent size with a good sized TV some some English/American channels fridge decent hairdryer large shower sofa and small balcony. The bed was large and comfortable with a proper duvet.    They were very stingy with pillows and towels (one pillow each; one medium towel each plus one hand towel) so we asked for extra. The pillows remained but they kept taking the extra towels which was frustrating. I have been to very few places that only supply 1 pillow and 1 towel pp and certainly no 4* rated hotels that are this stingy.    The room was cleaned daily to a good standard and the AC was effective. It was also fairly quiet. The water pressure and temperature in the shower were both good and a decent selection of toiletries are also provided which is useful.    Decor was fresh and neutral and very pleasant.    Pools:    There are 3 pools: a quiet smaller (approx. 25m) adults only pool with bar which we used daily; a larger (approx. 35m) 'activity' pool with various events like aqua Zumba on throughout the day and music; and a children's splash pool. Loungers were readily available as were parasols. Life guards very on the ball. The pools were also very clean and the temperature was pleasant (cool enough to be refreshing without being cold).    Grounds:    Immaculate. Lovely plants and layout and spotlessly clean.    Activities:    They offer a wealth of activities: really great choice from archery and the trapeze to a number of exercise classes (Zumba; yoga; spin; aqua Zumba/aerobics; ballroom dancing; etc) to a varied evening entertainment programme.    The animation team worked tirelessly and were really lovely. Some of the evening entertainment was a little amateur=ish but still good fun. My favourite nights were the white party (everyone dresses in white and there is music dancing and cocktails at the adult only pool) and the Moroccan night (entertainers came in from outside and were superb).    Bars:    There are several bars: the pool bar open during the day; the theatre bar (open during shows); and the lobby bar. There is also a nightclub.    Two criticisms: they could really do with AC in the lobby bar. It was VERY hot when we were there and could get a bit sticky/uncomfortable in there even in the evening. More atmospheric lighting would also be good; the lights were very bright and glaring even later on in the evening.    Food:    Most meals are buffet style and served in the main restaurant. There is also a snack truck at the main pool open until 6pm (serving basic snacks like hot dogs/burgers/pizza/waffles and soft drinks) and a Moroccan a la carte (one reservation per week; nice to be served and the ambience was nice but the food was the same as that in the restaurant).    The buffet restaurant was excellent IMO. I mostly went for the Moroccan dishes which were very very tasty and also pretty healthy but there were a wealth of choices and they did vary which was good as I didn't find it got repetitive. The food was all at the correct temperate and was replaced or replenished frequently.    Typical choices were as follows:    Breakfast: eggs cooked to order; other hot items inc turkey sausage and usually some type of potato; cheeses; cold meats; cereals; yoghurts; jams/honey; fresh fruits; hot drinks (coffee selection of teas hot chocolate) cold drinks (fresh juices plus sodas)    Lunch and dinner: meat and fish cooked to order; meat or fish tagine; vegetable tagine; variety of hot vegetable dishes; pizza; pasta with a variety of sauces; cold meats and fishes (eg whole salmon or tuna); cheeses; salads (pre-made and also make your own); pastries; ice-cream; fruit.    There really was something for everyone even fussy eaters.    Service:    The service was almost without exception excellent particularly in the lobby bar and the main restaurant. Servers remembered us and our drinks orders and were always smiley. The service was also quick and drinks would be topped up/replaced without us having to ask. We found a small tip went a long way (but is certainly not necessary) as did being pleasant and friendly. Seriously 10/10 for this area.    Shuttle:    The shuttle service is a real bonus. The coach is large and has AC and drops people off on the outskirts of Gueliz an approx. 10 minute walk from Jemma el Fna. The shuttles are frequent and run until late in the evening; I think the last one back was around 10.30pm. Try to book 24 hours before but places may still be available on the day.    Summary:    We had a lovely relaxing stay and would stay again. I had come prepared to be disappointed as the all inclusives I am used to are the large extremely luxurious mega-resorts in Mexico/Punta Cana but I was really pleasantly surprised particularly by the food and service.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/london86

It's a shame that people smoke right outside the restaurant so if you don't smoke you can't eat outdoors. The mattresses were quite hard. But the rooms are well arranged so that they are quiet even during the day. The free hotel bus which runs to Marrakech every hour does drop you a good 10 minute walk outside the town center.

The rooms were spacious and had lots of wardrobe space beds were very hard but didn't seem to affect my sleep or back.    It is worth noting if you go onto the balcony don't close the door to keep the air con running otherwise you will be locked out. I saw a few people calling passers by to let them back into their rooms.    The food was a very good standard albeit a little repetitive. The meats were cooked well and there was enough to please everyone.    The pools were kept very well and there seemed to be no shortage of chairs although there are three pools to choose from.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Theo K wrote a review Oct 2018,30,Not a 4-star hotel,We stayed at the Iberostar Palmeraie for 4 nights in mid-October.    The hotel grounds and common areas are all nice and well tended. Sadly I cannot say the same for the room which was in serious need of repair and nothing like the photos on the hotel's website. The furniture and fittings were old and worn out in places. We had to regulate our use of provided toiletries (shampoo and shower gel) as they were not replenished daily. Obtaining pool towels required a trip to the reception and a 100 dirham per-towel deposit. I have never had to pay a deposit for pool towels in any other all inclusive hotel I've stayed. Overall this was not a 4-star hotel experience.    Food selection as other reviewers have mentioned is broad but becomes repetitive quickly. Drinks felt watered down and we quickly limited ourselves to bottled water.    When I booked the room online a few months earlier I was quoted a price in Euros. When we checked-in we were asked to pay the full amount upon arrival and was quoted a higher price (in addition to the tourist tax we were aware of). I assume it was due to the differences in exchange rate with dirhams but on the other hand if a price is quoted in a particular currency and paid in that same currency there shouldn't be any deviations. The receptionist didn't provide an explanation and I was unwilling to begin my stay with an argument over a 20 euro difference.    Positives: The hotel provides a free coach service to the medina and back which is great. The staff was polite and courteous.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128theok

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Marchell wrote a review Oct 2018,40,4 deserved stars...yet the food was sadly disappointing,I agree with much of the review from Archer1129 below.  We have just returned having stayed for 3 nights as a couple. Our teenage sons ventured off to Center Parcs with the grandparents and we joined them for their final day upon our return to the UK.  This hotel has so many admirable qualities and that is down to the fabulous staff and management team. The staff appear very engaged and motivated and that’s a credit to everyone. They work hard are always proactive in speaking to their guests and want us to have a memorable holiday. Well done to every single member of the hotel team.  The swimming pools are terrific. We opted to stay around the Zen (adults only) pool which was tranquil and as heated was a lovely temperature in October. The facilities within the stunning grounds were magnificent. Including a trapeze no less alongside multiple sports courts for tennis badminton and 3 table tennis tables. It’s clear immense pride is taken in keeping the grounds looking stunning by the gardeners.  The hotel was spotlessly clean at all times. There were always staff around tidying and cleaning up.  The outside courtyard area close to the main bar was a delightful place to sit and enjoy a few drinks during the evening. And to have a chap playing a few tunes on this organ and singing a few tracks was really terrific too.  Our room was spacious and well appointed and again the cleaners did a great job daily. Top marks again.  The free shuttle bus into Marrakech was excellent. We ventured into the medina and souks on two occasions. What an experience! And you very quickly realise that it’s important to be on your ‘guard’. Is the medina and souks beautiful to visit? God no....an experience not to be missed yet we are not in any rush to return to that part of Marrakech.  Prior to our arrival I’d read multiple reviews saying that the food truck and Moroccan restaurant was pretty poor and so chose to steer clear of those. Yet we’d also read that the main restaurant food was very good. We both disagreed with that. This for us is the hotel’s weak area (alongside the woefully weak cocktails!!). The food at first glance looks lovely. Yet tasted bland and we came away thinking that it’s either a case of insufficient budget being set aside for the chefs to work with or that the chefs themselves are just very mediocre with a lack of variety too on offer to enjoy. Conversely our final evening when an array of seafood was on offer meant our final trip to the restaurant was at least an improvement. There is an abundance of (deserving) staff on the payroll and a lot of money has been spent on the grounds and facilities. Yet the food is very average indeed. If the hotel can sort this it will turn be a great hotel.  In summary we enjoyed our stay immensely and would despite the average food recommend a stay here.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marchell
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Archer1129 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Very Good Hotel - Few alterations and could be an excellent hotel,Recently just came back from a weeks holiday here booked through Thomas cook and found out they have only just started coming here.  We have previously been to Marrakesh around 4 years ago but stayed at a different hotel it is a really lovely country and would recommend.  Positives:-  The Iberostar hotel is spotlessly clean and has the absolute nicest hotel staff! They truly work so hard really friendly and nothing is too much trouble!  Hotel rooms are perfect for a weeks holiday spacious comfy beds (all twins) fridge hairdryer safe great air con small balcony good wardrobe space.  With it being October the hotel wasn’t to full capacity (apparently only 500-600 guests when they have 1000 in July/August even though the weather was stunningly hot and sunny of 30 degrees plus every day!) so absolutely no trouble getting a sun bed at anytime of day. Three pool areas quieter zen pool main pool which was nice to have some music few activities during the day but never forced to participate and a children’s pool.  They have a tv room does show premiership football games and with English commentary.  Did tip the staff throughout our stay they deserve it and really appreciate it.  They put on a managers cocktail party one evening which was nice to invite the new hotel guests along too nice to have some sparkling wine!  Free shuttle bus into Marrakech provided by the hotel just be careful as some hotel guests had their phones pickpocketed whilst out.  Negatives:-  Only one main bar in the evening resulting in queues for drinks.  The truck outside by the main pool really doesn’t work they try and serve food and drinks but it doesn’t do either well it’s the only place to get a drink when sunbathing and only serve soft drinks beer and wine in tiny plastic throwaway cups and awful burgers and hotdogs please just think about setting up a decent bar outside with a better variety inc cocktails and spirits and use hard plastic reusable glasses. The food attracts many wasps which you have to battle through to get to the truck.  Also we have to add that unfortunately the drinks appear to be watered down and/or of a really low quality we drink regularly and not once did we ever feel like we had had an alcoholic drink it’s such a shame that they did this.  A negative on the food front is that it is very much the same food every day and unfortunately lacked any flavour the same food is in the same place each day they just switched meats some days. The restaurant was spotlessly clean and never had any illnesses.  Evening entertainment is really terrible they try their very best however.  If they addressed these few negatives then it would be an excellent hotel and we would return in a heartbeat!    Thank you for a really lovely week overall 😊,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hawarden, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Archer1129

Three pools one is a zen pool and very relaxed  Kids pool with slides and family pool all really clean.  It's mainly a French hotel but Thomas cook has just took over so more English going now.  Taxis outside the hotel £10 to get into marrakesh.    The free shuttle bus drops you off a good 20min walk from the madina it's very hard to find your way and you run the risk of being harassed or robbed.

The food was good with plenty of choice but unfortunately being ill made the experience less enjoyable. We had a trip into town to the markets which I have to say was not to my taste we were harrassed as soon as we stepped off the bus with so called guides although this did not bother my husband. The hotel was very accommodating with us having a late flight on our last day and gave us a complimentary room for half an hour in order to have a shower ready for our flight. All staff were lovely and very friendly and would bend over backwards to help with anything. I was a bit disappointed with the spa treatment I booked as it was supposed to be for an hour and a half and after an hour and five minutes I was done and being shown the way out all felt a bit rushed.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Heath D wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Great Moroccan Retreat That Has It All!,We have just returned from a one week visit to this amazing resort in Marrakech.  On arrival we were greeted with roses and fizz. No queuing at reception our wristbands were put on and our cases were taken straight to our room. We noticed as the week went on the different welcomes provided by the hotel to different nationalities which we thought was very slick and a really nice touch.  Our room was lovely and special mention had to go to the cleaning staff for always doing a great job. We had clean towels and the room was made up every day. You’ll see from the images the lovely towel arrangement left on the bed for us on our final day. Such a lovely gesture.  On our stay we booked an excursion via Thomas Cook. When we returned to the resort later that day there was fruit and biscuits waiting in our room for us.  The reception staff were always warm and welcoming helpful reception attentive bar staff and kitchen / restaurant teams.  It’s not often we return to places but we would have no hesitation to return here and we would recommend this resort to anyone. It has everything to offer for families kids clubs and dedicated kids pool. The Zen pool was great for us as it provided a much needed quiet area to relax and unwind. Zen pool bar staff once again very warm and welcoming.  The Moroccan restaurant was a lovely change and the atmosphere was very warm. The food was also great. We loved it!  It’s not often I leave reviews. I work in retail so I know what customer service is all about. These guys delivered but not only that it was great value for money.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,sallychad wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Friendly and efficient staff,My husband and I went to this hotel for 4 nights last week. We did not know what to expect as we had not seen anything about it. To our delight the hotel was clean friendly efficient staff and also activities you could join in if you wished. We were a bit disappointed that our Atlas Mountain view was limited to our balcony stretching your neck to see it and not from the bedroom as expected. The food was very good and we took advantage of meals provided. Hotel staff kept the hotel spotless and were always on hand in the restaurant. Taxi's were right outside the hotel so you could go into Marrakech very easily about 30 mins away. We had a wonderful taxi driver who assisted us all afternoon for a very reasonable charge. The pools were not heated so a little cool. We would recommend this hotel for couples and families. If you want something a little quieter then I suggest a riad.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Holywell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallychad
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,prattttt2000 wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Shining Example of an Iberostar,This hotel is a fantastic example of a reasonably priced all-inclusive experience.    Every night the food buffet was stocked with plenty of options and the rotating options (although a bit sparse) were also delicious. Throughout the day other snacks were available so we never went hungry    The staff were very (and sincerely) friendly and always happy to help. They weren't too invasive and the grounds were always very clean and tidy.    Being only 30 minutes away from the city centre meant it was quiet and the hotel provided regular inclusive shuttle buses throughout the day so it's no burden being away from the hustle of the main city.    Only negative aspect was that stereotypically of an all-inclusive the drinks and cocktails felt a bit watered down.    Would definitely recommend!,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bedfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prattttt2000
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,meatfleece wrote a review Oct 2018,50,The Geese 😀,We normally stay in the medina area or Gueliz area but as our granddaughter was joining us we looked for more of a family hotel. We weren’t sure about being so far away from centre but my goodness we were thrilled with our choice.    We had watched a helpful video on YouTube presented by a previous guest to give us some idea of what to expect. In reality we were delighted with our choice.    There really is something for everyone including zen pool for peace large pool for activities and fun and children’s fun pool. Different activities all day.    Then we have the geese 😀 firstly we we afraid of them as they rush towards you if the spot you making a very loud noise. We thought they were going to attack us but no they are just after something to eat. I fell in love with them and they gave me great entertainment.    The food in main restaurant is of a very good standard although a bit samey plenty of choice though. Impressive for all inclusive.    Staff are very friendly indeed although the animation team upset my three year old granddaughter by pretending to take her toys and this lead to her panicking if she spotted one of them. Tried explaining they were just playing with her but it didn’t work. They are good fun though and walk around pool welcoming everyone and ask if you need anything. My only gripe is about the ladies on the egg station-they do not pay attention to you chat to each other while you are placing order and no eye contact is made. Then they just slop the eggs on your plate leaving the yolk to run over side of plate. A little training needed here. We felt very well looked after by all other staff.    Don’t see why a deposit is needed for each pool towel only had a small amount of dirhams with us as all inclusive so this pretty much used it up. Do people really steel towels? Why not just charge you if you don’t hand them back!    Can’t comment on evening entertainment as we had to get a little girl into bed but it seems a great effort was being made.    Oh and the room was very clean and spacious with a smart large bathroom.    We would definitely come back to this hotel if travelling with family,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Horsham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meatfleece
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,TR1209 wrote a review Oct 2018,30,"Nice hotel, strange customer service from staff.",Stayed for four nights last week. The hotel rooms are modern and clean with a great Moroccan style bathroom. The main pool is large bigger than it looks on the pictures and looks onto the hotel grounds which are stunning. The architecture of the hotel is great. Drinks/snacks available around the pool all day but they do attract the wasps. Restaurant food was nice good standard but was the same each night. Lots of variety though. Delicious cakes. Great cocktails. Hotel have a free shuttle bus to the Médina but beware when catching this back to the hotel it does not wait. We caught the 18:30 bus and by 18:31 the bus was on the move.    Negatives were: staff have a very silly sense of humour which was irritating when they are playing around not giving you the drink you ordered. The staff in the restaurant at night are just desperate to get everyone out. Get up to go and get a dessert come back and the table has been cleared and drinks gone. This happened every night and one night we were eating and the waiter actually took the table cloth from under our plates and blew the candle out. Very rude this lack of customer service really lets the hotel down. In general when going to the town we found Moroccans to be very rude and untrustworthy. Reception staff were nice though.    Also for pool towels they require 200 Dirham deposit. They will only accept Dirham for the deposit and will change Pounds Sterling when you arrive but at the end of your stay they won’t exchange the Dirham back into pounds. Even though you know they have it in the till. This is because the Dirham money is worthless. Shops at the airport don’t even take it. Had I have known this before I’d have taken my own towels.

But from now on it will definitely be our first when we want to go to Marrakech to relax. This is a great resort believe me.  Nice cared grounds with lots of green and wild crazy ducks and lots of birds all over great two pools being the Zen Pool our main choice because we wanted to rest and you really can rest for its super quiet great Restaurant Buffet with lots of Morrocan tasty I mean really tasty Morrocan food awesome theme Restaurant Jawhara with food that will make you drool and get an explosion of flavors in you head.  The resort facilities are beautiful with lots of trees and flowers well decorated Morrocan style which makes it very welcoming and cozy. The rooms are so comfortable and very well cleaned everyday. We got no complaints whatsoever.  Is there room for improvement? Yes there is. The food truck is something that could get better if someone would take care of it because the food is not good for this kind of Resort. You can skip the food truck for sure and you will not get your vacations ruined. The food truck is definitely disappointing but I thing that they can change it if they want. The animation is a bit weak when it comes to providing a good show at night but I got to give it to them: they really make an excellent effort with what they got and it works somewhat. Can they get better? Yes for sure but you will enjoy some of it. The three musicians playing Morrocan Music at the lobby bar are really great and should be there more often.  The general staff makes this hotel great. Always smiling helpful kind and fast and very close to the guests. The city shuttle that takes you everyday for free to the city center is a nice plus. Yes you have to walk ten minutes to the Medina but if get very bored because you have to walk ten minutes during you holidays my advise is stay in the room. This ten minutes walking spree will make you live the city in a different way among the locals so enjoy and wear confortable shoes. And the driver I guess ""Bubu"" is a must... Always happy a messing with you... It's great!  Would I go back again to this Resort? Yes! Definitely would in a heart beat!!!  Would appreciate that the General Manager would kindly make this message visible to the following people:  Salah from the Zen Pool Bar - thank you so much for what you are I promise when our child is born we will visit you at the hotel as soon as we can. Salah is an amazing human being! Do not fire this guy ever!!!  Yousef from the Zen Pool Grounds - what a fast and kind worker always making our stay at the pool very cozy and no Yousef I am not Antonio Banderas :) but thanks anyway... Keep Yousef in this resort please  Khaoula from the reception desk - this is what a reception desk worker should be everywhere so fast so helpful always smiling great to have her there. A real must at the reception!  Adraoui and Hajji from the buffet restaurant - the Flash Gordon of servers always very helpful super fast and kind and the Morrocan Hawk always cruising the restaurants making sure everyone is happy and always with a smile and addressing the staff with the most respectful manners we have ever seen. Spot on this two guys!  The Lady that took care of our 2224 room between 23rd and 30th September I guess her name is Amina but not really sure (I am so sorry I dont remember your name) but thank you so much for taking care of our room the way you did always so tidy and spot on clean.  This were some of the staff we brought with us back home in our memory and believe me they are the best I have seen in a Resort. And we have been to the Caribbean sometimes.

Food is good although a little repetitive. Wouldn’t want to be here for two weeks. Located 20 minutes from markets etc and hotel offers free shuttle bus.

We were not originally booked into this hotel but due to poor reviews on our planned hotel last minute we decided to swap to the Iberostar. I can genuinely say it was the best decision we made. The hotel was lovely clean and very well maintained. We were greeted personally when we got to the hotel with a drink and an overview of the hotel by the receptionist. It made a nice change from standing in a queue to check in! The manger introduced himself to us and everyone that arrived and the staff were very attentive and welcoming. It was my birthday when we were there and they manager and the staff could not do enough to help me in celebrate. It made my day even more special. We did not want for anything.  The food was good with lots of variety and the Moroccan dishes available each day were delicious.  The shuttle bus into the Souks from the hotel was free and went throughout the day so we were able to do a day and evening trip during our stay. The only thing I would say was they do not drop you right by the Souks so make sure you ask where you need to go when you get off the bus. It’s easy to get lost!  I would highly recommend this hotel if you don’t want to be in the thick of Marrakech. It has lots to offer and being a short bus ride away you won’t miss out on the real craziness of Marrakech.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sazzle00123
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,KellyLW80 wrote a review Oct 2018,50,Great hotel and location,We can hardly fault anything about this place. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived but they took our cases gave us drinks while we waited and directed us to the restaurant until we could go up.    The whole place is spotless and the room plenty big enough with a huge bathroom. The only gripe we had is that we were on our honeymoon and were given twin beds. When we questioned this we were told that out of 300 rooms they only had 3 with double beds in! However we went down to the pool and by the time we had returned they had turned our bed into a double for us.    The staff were all friendly loads of free sunbeds no matter what time you went down to the pool and the food was plentiful and varied including plain choices of pizza and chips if you didn’t want anything a bit more Moroccan!    We took advantage of the free shuttle into Marrakech which was great but regret not going into the city in the evening as well as apparently it really comes alive at night.    We would definitely return but would probably spend more time exploring the city rather than lounging at the pool (easy to say when you’re home and not in 31 degree heat!).,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Trowbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyLW80

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Shirley D wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Almost perfect,Firstly a huge mention to General Manager Imad who is is rightly very proud of the beautiful hotel he runs and his hard working staff team. He remembered our names from day 1 and always took time to stop for a chat when he saw us - a very nice personal touch indeed.    We thought the hotel was immaculately clean and the facilities fabulous. The maids worked so hard and even decorated the bed one day with beautiful flower petals.    The cocktail bar was great for a chilled out drink and there were always plenty of available chairs and tables in all the public areas.    The food in the main restaurant was delicious freshly cooked and varied. The Moroccan restaurant was however a different experience and although beautiful and cosy inside the food on offer was poor with no choice other than meat or fish tagine and service was way too slow - we asked 3 or 4 times for a glass of coke and the poor waiting staff seemed very harassed trying to serve everyone - for us the main restaurant experience was far superior.    The main pool and zen pool were both great but the main pool had a more lively atmosphere with activities throughout the day which was our preference. The animation team worked hard and were on the whole great fun but on the last 2 days of our holidays some of the scheduled water activities didn’t go ahead as planned which was disappointing - we asked the 2 members of the team about this and they said they would check it out but neither came back to us ☹️    We used the Spa and had a lovely hot stone massage there.    Unfortunately a group of drunken older women did spoil the ambience at the latter end of our holiday and many guests noted that they felt their overwhelming loudness and swearing around the pool (whilst children were present) should have been addressed by the hotel staff. The same group disturbed guests facing the swimming pool at 1.20am one morning due to them being drunk and jumping in the pool followed by them knocking on anyone and everyone’s bedroom door in an attempt to find their own rooms with a total lack of respect for others.    Don’t be put off though because this was the only loutish behaviour we saw all holiday and the positives surrounding the hotel far outweigh this negative.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sam-Lesbirel wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Lovely Hotel,"Spent a week all inclusive (unsure whether other board options are available as booked through on the beach not direct - as a tip this might be worth checking as it worked out about £300 cheaper than Thomson).    The hotel was really nice and clean with modern touches throughout and the staff were extremely friendly and polite.    The food had a good variety and was all nicely cooked and the free drinks included were great! If you wanted international brands these were available at a cost but the local spirits/beer was nice enough.    Plenty of entertainment throughout the day (although not really my thing) but they did a variety of sports and games encouraging those who were interested to join in but equally not pestering those like myself who just wanted to relax with a book.    The evening entertainment was limited to the ""night club"" which was the one area of the hotel I didn't really like to me its quite old fashioned and looked like a really cheap wedding hall. All of the entertainment from the themed nights take place here and so we missed out on this. However there is a nice terraced area and plenty of people enjoy their drinks out here with a pack of cards (I'd really recommend taking cards or similar if you stay for a week).    The rooms were all really nice cleaned frequently big and spacious the only down-side I experienced with this was that instead of a double bed we received two single beds made up together. I thought this was the norm until I spotted one of the other rooms while walking past did have a legit double but it was towards the end of our week and didn't want to make a fuss. Also the TV has a few English channels (I think numbers 48-52) which played movies and modern tv series for those wanting to escape the sun. Also If you are having a late return flight late check out is available (200dh until 3pm or 400dh until 6pm) However unless you book this in advance its done on availability on the day of check-out so maybe worth pre-booking!    The hotel is about 40 minutes from the airport and about 25 minutes from the city centre. There is a regular shuttle bus service from the hotel free of charge which was really helpful and it drops you in the middle of the madness about 10-15 minutes walk from Jemma El Fna / Souqs and about the same away from Jardin Majorelle.",Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam-Lesbirel

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,crickie61 wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Enjoyable stay,Returned yesterday from our week at this hotel:  Read reviews regarding security queues at airport prior to departure so wasn't surprised about the wait but overall it wasn't too bad. However on return flight this took longer.    We arrived at hotel about 12.30. Was greeted with a welcome cool drink and very welcoming reception staff. We knew check in was not till 3pm. However reception manager Mostapha Jabry assured us our room would be ready within an hour and kettle would be in the room as requested via email. We were in our room by 2pm unpacked changed and grabbed a bite of lunch.    Room: nice big and modern with comfy beds and very clean. Bathroom lovely and roomy with a great waterfall shower also very clean.    Pools: we spent our time when in hotel at the zen pool which was lovely. Saalha the barman very good always polite and life guard (sorry don't know name) made sure the rules of no under 16's was abided.    Entertainment: enjoyed the morroccan night acrobatic night shame the white party got washed out. Can't comment on entertainment during day being by the zen pool.    Food: always found something to eat although did find it reptitive for lunch and dinner. Loved the array of small cake choices. We did try the Moroccan ala carte but was very surprised not to have cous cous with the tagine. Was asked did we want beef or fish tagine when booking. Neither me or my partner eat fish so ordered the beef. However when the starter arrived the waiter explained it was a salad and what looked like a samosa I asked what was inside I couldn't quite understand what he said but thought he said fish when I said no fish he said there was no fish inside. The manager came over I asked him what was inside he said calamari!!!!! So be aware .  Food truck: really hardly saw anyone use thisone day we did decide to go there for lunch as they advertised paninis sandwiches burgers waffles crepes however when I asked for a sandwich the guy promptly put two burgers on the hotplate so we decided ok we will have a burger. Big mistake when we bit into them the burgers were cold and very pink not cooked.  Trips: We organised two trips prior to departure via Viator. Ouzoud waterfall and a half day guided trip of Marrakech well worth the money especially the waterfall. I went through a total knee replacement carried out in December and with the help of my partner and the fantastic guide I managed it.  We caught the hotel bus into marrakech one evening to experience the atmosphere of the souks and square. Very good sevice provided by hotel.    Overall we had an excellent stay everyone was very friendly and hotel kept very clean grounds always kept tidy  Would we return most definitely keep up the good work.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crickie61
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Amy H wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Nice hotel but needs some little touches to make it 4*,Nice hotel and very clean. The cleaners and gardeners work all day everyday to keep the place spotless and they do a fantastic job. The grounds of the hotel are nice and there is lots of activities to do throughout the day to keep you busy (as it is not near the main town - but that is only a bus ride away and the hotel provide this). The animation team are great and do not hassle you if you do not wish to join in.    I do think this hotel could do with a few extras to make it 4* as advertised and these are:    - Kettle & iron in the room.    - Waiters to serve drinks in the restaurant instead of self service. Day time I agree with self service but not the evenings.    - The pool bar only serves beer wine water and fizzy drinks but no other alcohol. Yes you can get this from the Zen Bar by the quiet pool but we did not want the quiet pool?    - Fridge to be restocked with water.    Having said this the hotel was nice and we would return.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Welsh Tony wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Great hotel but needs a little something,Firstly the hotel is set in lovely groundsthere are plenty of things to do rooms are large clean modern with great bathrooms entertainment staff are really good hard workers that try to get everyone to enjoy themselves on holidayI enjoyed my time there. The food in the Main buffet restaurant was good plenty-full and varied.  We booked this hotel independently for 5 nights all inclusive not everyone is on all inclusive but it seems nearly all are. It seems like the hotel caters mainly for 2 week package holidays booked by Thomson and various other European agents they arrive as groups together and get a tour of the hotel by a rep. We did not and therefore had to work things out for ourselves which was a bit annoying. Check in was confusing and they forgot to book us into the Moroccan restaurant (Don't bother) they also didn't explain we needed to pay 200 MAD deposit to receive 2 cards for the pool towel use.  The hotel seems to have an accidental bias towards French customers this is mainly because most of the staff speak Arabic and French as a second language there are many staff that speak English but some are not so good. Many French customers around both pools were able to get drinks and sometimes snacks brought to them regularly whereas i had to either virtually grab the waiter or go to the bar myself. Most of what happens in the hotel is mainly spoken in French with small sections in English but it was not always easy to understand what was being said. If you join in in any of the games be aware there may be only 1 or 2 English speaking people playing.,Date of stay: September 2018,,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Wanderlust
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Shirley D wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Almost perfect,Firstly a huge mention to General Manager Imad who is is rightly very proud of the beautiful hotel he runs and his hard working staff team. He remembered our names from day 1 and always took time to stop for a chat when he saw us - a very nice personal touch indeed.    We thought the hotel was immaculately clean and the facilities fabulous. The maids worked so hard and even decorated the bed one day with beautiful flower petals.    The cocktail bar was great for a chilled out drink and there were always plenty of available chairs and tables in all the public areas.    The food in the main restaurant was delicious freshly cooked and varied. The Moroccan restaurant was however a different experience and although beautiful and cosy inside the food on offer was poor with no choice other than meat or fish tagine and service was way too slow - we asked 3 or 4 times for a glass of coke and the poor waiting staff seemed very harassed trying to serve everyone - for us the main restaurant experience was far superior.    The main pool and zen pool were both great but the main pool had a more lively atmosphere with activities throughout the day which was our preference. The animation team worked hard and were on the whole great fun but on the last 2 days of our holidays some of the scheduled water activities didn’t go ahead as planned which was disappointing - we asked the 2 members of the team about this and they said they would check it out but neither came back to us ☹️    We used the Spa and had a lovely hot stone massage there.    Unfortunately a group of drunken older women did spoil the ambience at the latter end of our holiday and many guests noted that they felt their overwhelming loudness and swearing around the pool (whilst children were present) should have been addressed by the hotel staff. The same group disturbed guests facing the swimming pool at 1.20am one morning due to them being drunk and jumping in the pool followed by them knocking on anyone and everyone’s bedroom door in an attempt to find their own rooms with a total lack of respect for others.    Don’t be put off though because this was the only loutish behaviour we saw all holiday and the positives surrounding the hotel far outweigh this negative.    Well done Imad and your fabulous team 😃,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Coupar Angus, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirleyD991

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sam-Lesbirel wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Lovely Hotel,"Spent a week all inclusive (unsure whether other board options are available as booked through on the beach not direct - as a tip this might be worth checking as it worked out about £300 cheaper than Thomson).    The hotel was really nice and clean with modern touches throughout and the staff were extremely friendly and polite.    The food had a good variety and was all nicely cooked and the free drinks included were great! If you wanted international brands these were available at a cost but the local spirits/beer was nice enough.    Plenty of entertainment throughout the day (although not really my thing) but they did a variety of sports and games encouraging those who were interested to join in but equally not pestering those like myself who just wanted to relax with a book.    The evening entertainment was limited to the ""night club"" which was the one area of the hotel I didn't really like to me its quite old fashioned and looked like a really cheap wedding hall.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,kaluhagirl101 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,3.5/5,My partner and I returned a couple of days ago from this hotel on first impressions it seemed good very clean reception staff very polite and attentive nice touch to have fresh juice in reception at all times. The rep was helpful however I’d reccomend shopping around for prices of excursions as with everything in Morocco these are negotiable! Our room was very clean and a good size. The whole resort was kept beautifully clean we constantly saw maids/cleaners etc keeping everything under control. The food was good plenty of variety and always something for everyone - a nice touch to have the Moroccan restaurant definitely reccomend this the food was delicious!! There was a good selection of alcohol and cocktails too most things included! It was nice to have multiple pools we personally chose the zen pool which was lovely to be able to relax in peace but we always had the option of the main pool where there was music and entertainment throughout the day. There seemed to be a good selection of activities that you could partake in dancing trapeze archery etc nice that these are all included. Overall we had a positive experience of this hotel.    Unfortunately there is a major thing that drastically let’s this hotel down and is why we were only able to give the hotel a 3/5 as it did not live up to previous stays at other hotels. This was due to the unequal treatment of guests which was quite frankly alarming and upsetting at times. We first noticed it at the bar in the zen pool where the bar tender gave me a much larger and more fancy cocktail than my partner despite him being right next to me. This happened on several occasions at first it was a good joke but after a while my partner found it tiresome as you can imagine. We then noticed that other people were constantly having drinks taken to them at the poolside - a service that we had never been offered. If you’re not that kind of place that is fine I am happy to get my own drink however if you are going to do that it needs to be for all guests! We also experienced this segregation during dinner specifically in the outside seating area. The waiter that was in charge of this area was borderline rude he barely acknowledged us. All the tables outside were candle lit however he didn’t light our candle once however we saw other couples sit down after us and get their candle lit. I know it’s only a candle and it’s not a big deal but when you go on holiday it is not nice to be made to feel unwelcome by a specific member of the team especially when everyone else was so welcoming. The candle-gate happened on two occasions both with the same waiter with other couples seeming to get preferential treatment.    Overall this hotel was nice and I would reccomend the manager even came to speak to everyone to ensure they were having a good time and 99% of the staff were lovely. It really was such a shame that the odd 2 members of staff made us feel unwelcome and like outcasts and that’s why we’ve been unable to award this hotel 4/5 as the staff are such a big part of how your holiday goes!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaluhagirl101

The rooms are exceptionally clean and modern with air con an electronic safe flat screen Tv and mini fridge (empty) their was a bottle of water and 2 glasses on the unit above the fridge this was replaced daily if used. ... bathrooms were complete with rainwater shower and toiletries again these were replenished daily if used.  The restaurant was exceptionally good and Chefs catered for all tastes ... waitering staff worked very hard and were very friendly.  The animation team work extremely hard and are a great asset to the hotel ... again so friendly they made so much effort to come and speak with us they try to involve you in all the fun activities however if you don’t want to join in they are not overly pushy.  The assistant Manager Jorde ... this man is everywhere wherever you look he is there ... again he is so nice and very approachable.  Imad is the guest relations manager and he is a great guy ... constantly asking if you are ok etc remembering our names ... I was bitten by mosquitos and he was great ... he got some cream from their on site ‘infirmary’ (medical room) which helped take the swelling and the itch away!!  Reception staff cleaning staff bar staff were all fantastic and they all do a great job.  The main pool was lively throughout the day ... the Zen pool is really great if you haven’t got young children ... and it has its own bar!! When the bar tender Salah gets to know your face and what you drink he starts to bring your drinks!!! Their is a pool guard there called Yousef he is really nice and if he sees families with children he does approach them and lets them know it’s adults only (or over 16) ...  Some afternoons they cooked sugar doughnuts by the main pool ... they went down well with a lot of guest especially children!! Their is a snack van that provide burgers hot dogs waffles beer pop and water however it’s surrounded by wasps ... that put me off having anything from there.  Cocktails are free and very nice and are served at the main indoor bar and Zen pool bar. I was disappointed they did not serve Baileys or their equivalent!!    We have stayed in numerous ‘all inclusive hotels’ ... this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in ... the food was excellent service was excellent ... staff fabulous entertainment good ... we would definitely recommend this hotel and yes we are seriously looking at returning next year!!  Well done Iberostar ... fantastic !!    Ps the only downside to this holiday was Marrakesh Airport ... it took 1.5 hrs getting through immigration on the way in and 2.5 hours getting through the airport coming home!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breaking-Dawn22
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,andrewaP1353EP wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Consistent Iberostar Standard,This is our 2nd visit to an Iberostar hotel and our 1st time in Marrakech.  The hotel itself is kept clean and is well presented the staff in the hotel work their hardest to be of service from dawn to dusk - a credit to the management and the Iberostar name. The hotel manager ensured he spoke with us daily to make sure the holiday was all we expected it to be. He also took on board any constructive feedback in relation to our stay.  My wife and I enjoyed the evening pianist/bar singer though it is a shame his sessions had to end at 2245 due to ?noise - especially as you could still hear the fun/music from the entertainment area well after 2345.  The animation team worked hard daily to encourage even the most reluctant participants to the endless daily activities.  Food and drink from all the outlets was of good quality with plenty of variety. This could have been improved by ensuring hot food was served HOT as most of the time unless it was cooked in front of you it was cold even at the start of service times. The chefs however would heat things up on request (but should not need to!). It would also be an idea to have tea choices at both beverage stations at breakfast as well as milk?  The wasp/bee issue - only seems to be a problem around the pool area in the early afternoon. Obviously attracted to the sweet soft drinks/food etc however at no point did they seem aggressive or did I hear of anyone actually being stung.    I think a special mention to Abdo a member of the bar team - what an outstanding young man attentive polite and a true credit to the hotel.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Markham03 wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Exceeded our expectations !,We are a family of two mum and teenage daughter who have just returned from a 7 night stay at this hotel. We had the most fantastic holiday and are already looking to book again next year. We were very sad to leave.    Whilst the hotel is immaculate set in beautiful grounds with spacious rooms what stood out for me was the hotel staff and the Animation team.... these are what made our holiday so special. They honestly cannot do enough for you and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and enjoy your stay.    Early in my stay through general conversation at dinner one of the hotel managers picked up that I was a vegetarian (dont eat meat or fish) and whilst I found that I had plenty of selection already to choose from the next evening he pointed me to a vegetarian risotto that had been specially prepared for me. Amazing ! The manager went on to introduce me to the Head Chef who was happy to take me through the restaurant at dinner times and point out all the vegetarian dishes that I could eat. They also offerred to make me something special if there was something I really fancied. Honestly i was soo impressed.    What can I say about the Animation team? They are just fantastic and the hotel must be very proud of their team. They work so hard to keep the hotel guests entertained and you can see how much they enjoy it. We had such fun with them from activities during the day to the all of the evening shows.    We sat round the Zen pool for our entire stay and did not have to put towels down to reserve our beds which was a great relief !    We even did the Trapeze .. twice ...and a big thanks to the Trapeze guys for helping me conquer my fear of heights ! It was an amazing experience and am so glad I did it ! We looked forward to 4pm every day so we could watch it from the Zen pool .. so entertaining to watch !    We ventured out on the free hotel bus to the Medina. We got the 10am bus and returned at 12:30 to miss the hottest part of the day. For us that was plenty of time to browse and soak up the atmosphere. We did not feel the need to get a guide and managed very well without one. Infact it was the guides that hasselled us most when we got off the bus more than the people in the Medina ! The Moroccons are very polite will leave you alone if you say 'no thank you' to them .. and were very funny infact making jokes with us. You do have to barter with them to get a good price but that is part of the fun and the experience. It was no different than our experience in Turkey.    Thank you again to the hotel staff and Animation team for a truly wonderful stay and we look forward to seeing you again next year !,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markham03

Spent a week here with my teenage sons and we had a lovely time. the hotel is lovely helpful staff clean room etc. internet was a hit and miss but this didn't seem to be a hotel issue but improvements would be helpful. I wasn't very impressed with the food however and some improvements here would be good. But the hotel is lovey and the grounds beautiful and well kept.Great swimming pool. I booked thro LoveHolidays which was fine but I strongly recommend not to book a private airport transfer as it it much too overpriced and the driver actually never collected us from the hotel on the way back to the airport which was a disaster! best just to grab a taxi when you arrive and nae sure to negotiate a good price. I also had probs with City Guide and recommend not to book thro them.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Poochbrother wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Not for everyone but was perfect for my family - staff were amazing,We are a family of five and have just returned after our 10 days stay at this hotel. Before the trip I was quite apprehensive after reading so many mixed reviews - most were positive however I was concerned with some of the comments people had made about issues such as wasps food language etc.    I have to say my fears disappeared from the moment I walked into the hotel. The staff and receptionist were so welcoming and there were drinks available to us if we needed it. We had adjoining rooms which were immaculate and clean.    As we arrived at around 8pm we went into the restaurant which is an all inclusive buffet. The restaurant is huge and the choice of food was really impressive. My only slight disappointment was that we were not shown around when we went in for the first time as we were unsure what to do ie whether to wait to be seated. Fortunately the Assistant General Manager was around and explained - he is constantly present and always cheerful throughout the stay and can be approached to ask questions about anything relating to the hotel.    I would echo all the positive comments about this hotel. It may not be for everyone as there are activities throughout the day and evening however given there are so many guests the staff constantly do their best to clean feed entertain and look after everyone of all ages which they all do exceptionally well.    The negative comments I've read all seem to be out of the control of the hotel or down to personal preference. Ie.    Wasps: these are not in fact stinging wasps - I don't know of anyone who was stung. Yes they are a menace but they are manageable and only appear during the day. They are specifically after sugary foods - so the best advice is either eat indoors or avoid exposing sweet food and drinks. There is an outdoor seating area which use a fine spray of water during the day for lunch which seem to deter the wasps - and keeps the area cool.    French language - Yes this is a predominately French speaking resort- that is because 60-70% of guests are French speaking. Actually this didn't affect us in the slightest. All staff speak excellent English to respond to whatever needs you have. As we are visitors of a French speaking country I feel it is us who should put in more effort.    Guest behaviour: The Hotel is not responsible for the behaviour of guests and yes some were rude and didn't follow etiquette. This happens everywhere so I just ignored it so it didn't spoil our holiday.    Food: I didn't feel it was repetitive - there is such a huge variety of food that you can select something different almost every day. Any food that I had chosen again was purely because it was so tasty.    Overall we had an absolutely fantastic holiday. It is great value for money - without compromising on service and quality. As all the reviews tell you the staff were amazing and I have experienced that first had and confirm the reviews are absolutely correct - without exception.    We don't normally return to a holiday destination again but I would easily go back to the Iberostar Marrakesh. If we find the right price we will be returning again next August. It offers everything we look for from a holiday.    I would be happy to answer any questions or doubts if anybody is hesitating about booking this hotel.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Watford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poochbrother
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sticker04 wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Pretty perfect!,We have absolutely loved our stay at the Iberostar Marrakech. This was our first experience of an all inclusive hotel and we were a bit nervous but we had a fabulous time there.    Whilst the hotel is relatively big it never feels like it is probably because of the spacious immaculate gardens (do explore there is a path taking you around) the 2 pools and the layout of the hotel (low structure) with rooms spread between 2 buildings.  Lunch and dinner were smooth affairs too and we were always able to find a table in our preferred spot.    Please note the hotel is 15mn away from the town centre. For us it was a godsend as we were able to dip our toes into the wonderful & charming chaos for a few hours and then go back to the peaceful oasis that is the hotel!    Now about the hotel in more details:  Let's start with the staff: everyone is going out of their way to make you feel welcome and ensure you have a great time. There is a fabulous personable approach from all staff.  Management remembered our names and language through our stay.  All the lovely waiters were working hard and really fast but would always have time for a smile and a few words. Abdel in the outside section has the nicest smile manners and conversation but everyone really deserves praise for their hard work warmth welcoming manners and kindness (so many kind faces of waiters/waitresses we did not know the name of).  The entertainment team is working tirelessly through the day & evening gently trying to coerce you in joining in but never pestering.    During our last few days we spotted a new manager (not Moroccan) overseeing things. His much colder demeanour was totally noticeable against the warmth of the usual managers and teams. We hope he has not been brought in to change things as the various teams really have achieved in our opinion the best balance and it's hard to achieve such a perfect welcoming environment.    The rooms are pleasant and clean. Aircon was super silent and effective.  We asked to change room and were accommodated without any issue.  We had a room very close to reception the main pool and all the entertainment. Whilst initially a bit worried about the possible noise it actually worked really well for us to have a room that we could quickly pop back to during the day and so close to my morning coffee and the bar for early evening aperitif!  Watch out for the bathroom doors in the room though. Does not allow for much privacy!    The food is really good with a lot of variety on offer.  Moroccan food is available every day. And delicious. And beyond this so much choice: a great BBQ at lunch on top of all the grilled meats and fish available inside. Large salad bar (where you can make your own salad if you do not fancy the pre-prepared one) lots of vegs in many different forms on offer. And also chips pasta and pizza for those who fancied it.  Desserts offering is plentiful (some are great some less so) with fresh fruits and simple ice creams also available.    There is a snack van by the main swimming pool for drinks and other snacks. Works well enough for those who need to fill a hole or have missed lunch (hard to!) with savoury and sweet (average) snacks and to get water bottles sodas and even beer and wine (though this remains discreet which I appreciated).    Overall there is a sense of a continental approach to balancing food & drinks intake. It’s not pushed at you. It’s available but you can also easily forget about it which means you can enjoy lunch & dinner more than if you had been grazing all day.  I really enjoyed this (& not to have to play the food police with my child all day long!).    Fear not though there is nothing lacking. Everything really is available if you look for it or ask for it.    We mostly stayed by the main pool as the zen pool was probably a bit too quiet with a teen in toe. The music plays all day long with activities through the day. At times I could have done with gentler music and fewer announcements but understand the choices that were made.    I think the hotel should actively discourage sunbed bookings.  It’s unnecessary (there are ample sunbeds available) and actually quite stressful when people place towels as early as 6.30/7am on sunbeds around the swimming pool (often not showing up until much later if not at all).  I saw a sign around the zen pool to that effect. I do not know if it works. But it spoilt it a bit for me. We always found a spot regardless of what time we arrived.  There are a few spots under trees which provide much cooler shade & a bit of respite from the noise around the pool which we found very pleasant. Most people seem to be sun worshippers though (August it was really hot!).    I totally enjoyed some of the many activities on offer. My favourite being stretch aqua aerobics and spinning in the open air (I have never done either of the last two). Saamadi the instructor for aqua aerobics and spinning is absolutely ace (I actually think I became fitter during my all inclusive holiday!). Another girl from the animation team sometimes handled stretch and aqua aerobics but really looked like she would rather be somewhere else (she was amazing when she danced during the evening entertainment).  There is definitely a demand for extra spinning sessions. The class was always full.  Did not try the gym room but it seems relatively well appointed.  To clarify I did not intend on doing so much if anything at all during my holiday but it was so good that I looked forward to my little exercise windows.    The evening animation (spilling out through the day) is quite something. Boundless energy from a team that never stops. We really do not know how they sustain it!  It was not really to our taste but we were never pushed to take part and it was hugely popular. So even if this was not for us it was lovely to see so many people joyfully taking part and enjoying the dance routines etc. There was a big effort to vary the themes too.  There seem to be a screen on the main entertainment area maybe it would be an idea to do film nights sometimes?    There are only a couple of things that I could add as constructive criticism.  The first one would be for the hotel to take a more responsible approach to using less plastic and being greener in general.  Why not use the reusable plastic glasses around the pool rather than distribute drinks in single use ones? And replace straws with paper ones? Encourage people to refill their plastic bottles a few times (it’s possible but only during lunch and dinner where there is still and sparkling water available).  There was also no option in the room to keep towels so they were replaced everyday.    The second one a bit of a pet hate for me would be to have designated smokers areas. I have issues with taking my breakfast alongside someone smoking (& pretty much any other meals or drinks at the terrace). As a family hotel I think it would be beneficial for children too to not be exposed to secondary smoke so much.  Hopefully this will come as attitude to smoking change.    Wifi is not super reliable unless you are in the lobby (cue the kids on their devices lounging on the great sofas of the lobby) but I actually class this as a positive! It's there if you need it but it not being so great in some area has allowed me to disconnect more easily.    Free shuttle to town is super useful (especially given how variable the quality of driving is when you take taxis). Just make sure you know where you go from the dropping point in town. And do not fall in the trap of people taking you to the square or telling you they are working in the hotel etc...    This has been a fantastic break for us “all inclusive” newbies.  We are really thankful to the team for making our holiday such a lovely one. We have grown very fond of the place.  We have thoroughly enjoyed the cultural breath of fresh air both with magical Marrakech and at the hotel with such a diverse customer base (a lot of French lots of Moroccans on the second half of the stay some Spanish Italians and English - all announcements and signs in French & English).    We'll definitely recommend the hotel to our friends and family and will hopefully be back!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sticker04

There was more than enough sunbeds at the time we visited although it was just before school holidays it may get busier at peak times!  We spent most of our time around the zen pool which was adults only the barman at this pool was great we had a laugh with him and he kept bringing us cocktails all day every day we didn’t even have to ask for them!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,kaluhagirl101 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,3.5/5,My partner and I returned a couple of days ago from this hotel on first impressions it seemed good very clean reception staff very polite and attentive nice touch to have fresh juice in reception at all times. The rep was helpful however I’d reccomend shopping around for prices of excursions as with everything in Morocco these are negotiable! Our room was very clean and a good size. The whole resort was kept beautifully clean we constantly saw maids/cleaners etc keeping everything under control. The food was good plenty of variety and always something for everyone - a nice touch to have the Moroccan restaurant definitely reccomend this the food was delicious!! There was a good selection of alcohol and cocktails too most things included! It was nice to have multiple pools we personally chose the zen pool which was lovely to be able to relax in peace but we always had the option of the main pool where there was music and entertainment throughout the day. There seemed to be a good selection of activities that you could partake in dancing trapeze archery etc nice that these are all included. Overall we had a positive experience of this hotel.    Unfortunately there is a major thing that drastically let’s this hotel down and is why we were only able to give the hotel a 3/5 as it did not live up to previous stays at other hotels. This was due to the unequal treatment of guests which was quite frankly alarming and upsetting at times. We first noticed it at the bar in the zen pool where the bar tender gave me a much larger and more fancy cocktail than my partner despite him being right next to me. This happened on several occasions at first it was a good joke but after a while my partner found it tiresome as you can imagine. We then noticed that other people were constantly having drinks taken to them at the poolside - a service that we had never been offered. If you’re not that kind of place that is fine I am happy to get my own drink however if you are going to do that it needs to be for all guests! We also experienced this segregation during dinner specifically in the outside seating area. The waiter that was in charge of this area was borderline rude he barely acknowledged us. All the tables outside were candle lit however he didn’t light our candle once however we saw other couples sit down after us and get their candle lit. I know it’s only a candle and it’s not a big deal but when you go on holiday it is not nice to be made to feel unwelcome by a specific member of the team especially when everyone else was so welcoming. The candle-gate happened on two occasions both with the same waiter with other couples seeming to get preferential treatment.    Overall this hotel was nice and I would reccomend the manager even came to speak to everyone to ensure they were having a good time and 99% of the staff were lovely. It really was such a shame that the odd 2 members of staff made us feel unwelcome and like outcasts and that’s why we’ve been unable to award this hotel 4/5 as the staff are such a big part of how your holiday goes!,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaluhagirl101
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Breaking-Dawn22 wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Beautiful Hotel with Excellent Staff and Facilities,We arrived at this hotel around noon check in was very relaxed and straight forward due to arriving earlier than check in time we were offered and shown to a room were we could change and refresh after our travels ... this was very much appreciated we were told to have lunch and return to the reception around 2pm ...  we were taken to our room(s) which we were delighted with these were on the ground floor and had a lovely garden view towards the Zen pool ... we had 2 ‘mirrored’ double rooms with interlocking doors ... great for us and our 2 young teenagers.  The rooms are exceptionally clean and modern with air con an electronic safe flat screen Tv and mini fridge (empty) their was a bottle of water and 2 glasses on the unit above the fridge this was replaced daily if used. ... bathrooms were complete with rainwater shower and toiletries again these were replenished daily if used.  The restaurant was exceptionally good and Chefs catered for all tastes ... waitering staff worked very hard and were very friendly.  The animation team work extremely hard and are a great asset to the hotel ... again so friendly they made so much effort to come and speak with us they try to involve you in all the fun activities however if you don’t want to join in they are not overly pushy.  The assistant Manager Jorde ... this man is everywhere wherever you look he is there ... again he is so nice and very approachable.  Imad is the guest relations manager and he is a great guy ... constantly asking if you are ok etc remembering our names ... I was bitten by mosquitos and he was great ... he got some cream from their on site ‘infirmary’ (medical room) which helped take the swelling and the itch away!!  Reception staff cleaning staff bar staff were all fantastic and they all do a great job.  The main pool was lively throughout the day ... the Zen pool is really great if you haven’t got young children ... and it has its own bar!! When the bar tender Salah gets to know your face and what you drink he starts to bring your drinks!!! Their is a pool guard there called Yousef he is really nice and if he sees families with children he does approach them and lets them know it’s adults only (or over 16) ...  Some afternoons they cooked sugar doughnuts by the main pool ... they went down well with a lot of guest especially children!! Their is a snack van that provide burgers hot dogs waffles beer pop and water however it’s surrounded by wasps ... that put me off having anything from there.  Cocktails are free and very nice and are served at the main indoor bar and Zen pool bar. I was disappointed they did not serve Baileys or their equivalent!!    We have stayed in numerous ‘all inclusive hotels’ ... this is by far the best hotel we have stayed in ... the food was excellent service was excellent ... staff fabulous entertainment good ... we would definitely recommend this hotel and yes we are seriously looking at returning next year!!  Well done Iberostar ... fantastic !!    Ps the only downside to this holiday was Marrakesh Airport ... it took 1.5 hrs getting through immigration on the way in and 2.5 hours getting through the airport coming home!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bolton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breaking-Dawn22
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,andrewaP1353EP wrote a review Sep 2018,40,Consistent Iberostar Standard,This is our 2nd visit to an Iberostar hotel and our 1st time in Marrakech.  The hotel itself is kept clean and is well presented the staff in the hotel work their hardest to be of service from dawn to dusk - a credit to the management and the Iberostar name. The hotel manager ensured he spoke with us daily to make sure the holiday was all we expected it to be. He also took on board any constructive feedback in relation to our stay.  My wife and I enjoyed the evening pianist/bar singer though it is a shame his sessions had to end at 2245 due to ?noise - especially as you could still hear the fun/music from the entertainment area well after 2345.  The animation team worked hard daily to encourage even the most reluctant participants to the endless daily activities.  Food and drink from all the outlets was of good quality with plenty of variety. This could have been improved by ensuring hot food was served HOT as most of the time unless it was cooked in front of you it was cold even at the start of service times. The chefs however would heat things up on request (but should not need to!). It would also be an idea to have tea choices at both beverage stations at breakfast as well as milk?  The wasp/bee issue - only seems to be a problem around the pool area in the early afternoon. Obviously attracted to the sweet soft drinks/food etc however at no point did they seem aggressive or did I hear of anyone actually being stung.    I think a special mention to Abdo a member of the bar team - what an outstanding young man attentive polite and a true credit to the hotel.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Markham03 wrote a review Sep 2018,50,Exceeded our expectations !,We are a family of two mum and teenage daughter who have just returned from a 7 night stay at this hotel. We had the most fantastic holiday and are already looking to book again next year. We were very sad to leave.    Whilst the hotel is immaculate set in beautiful grounds with spacious rooms what stood out for me was the hotel staff and the Animation team.... these are what made our holiday so special. They honestly cannot do enough for you and go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and enjoy your stay.    Early in my stay through general conversation at dinner one of the hotel managers picked up that I was a vegetarian (dont eat meat or fish) and whilst I found that I had plenty of selection already to choose from the next evening he pointed me to a vegetarian risotto that had been specially prepared for me. Amazing ! The manager went on to introduce me to the Head Chef who was happy to take me through the restaurant at dinner times and point out all the vegetarian dishes that I could eat. They also offerred to make me something special if there was something I really fancied. Honestly i was soo impressed.    What can I say about the Animation team? They are just fantastic and the hotel must be very proud of their team. They work so hard to keep the hotel guests entertained and you can see how much they enjoy it. We had such fun with them from activities during the day to the all of the evening shows.    We sat round the Zen pool for our entire stay and did not have to put towels down to reserve our beds which was a great relief !    We even did the Trapeze .. twice ...and a big thanks to the Trapeze guys for helping me conquer my fear of heights ! It was an amazing experience and am so glad I did it ! We looked forward to 4pm every day so we could watch it from the Zen pool .. so entertaining to watch !    We ventured out on the free hotel bus to the Medina. We got the 10am bus and returned at 12:30 to miss the hottest part of the day. For us that was plenty of time to browse and soak up the atmosphere.

Whilst the hotel is relatively big it never feels like it is probably because of the spacious immaculate gardens (do explore there is a path taking you around) the 2 pools and the layout of the hotel (low structure) with rooms spread between 2 buildings.  Lunch and dinner were smooth affairs too and we were always able to find a table in our preferred spot.    Please note the hotel is 15mn away from the town centre. For us it was a godsend as we were able to dip our toes into the wonderful & charming chaos for a few hours and then go back to the peaceful oasis that is the hotel!    Now about the hotel in more details:  Let's start with the staff: everyone is going out of their way to make you feel welcome and ensure you have a great time. There is a fabulous personable approach from all staff.  Management remembered our names and language through our stay.  All the lovely waiters were working hard and really fast but would always have time for a smile and a few words. Abdel in the outside section has the nicest smile manners and conversation but everyone really deserves praise for their hard work warmth welcoming manners and kindness (so many kind faces of waiters/waitresses we did not know the name of).  The entertainment team is working tirelessly through the day & evening gently trying to coerce you in joining in but never pestering.    During our last few days we spotted a new manager (not Moroccan) overseeing things. His much colder demeanour was totally noticeable against the warmth of the usual managers and teams. We hope he has not been brought in to change things as the various teams really have achieved in our opinion the best balance and it's hard to achieve such a perfect welcoming environment.    The rooms are pleasant and clean. Aircon was super silent and effective.  We asked to change room and were accommodated without any issue.  We had a room very close to reception the main pool and all the entertainment. Whilst initially a bit worried about the possible noise it actually worked really well for us to have a room that we could quickly pop back to during the day and so close to my morning coffee and the bar for early evening aperitif!  Watch out for the bathroom doors in the room though. Does not allow for much privacy!    The food is really good with a lot of variety on offer.  Moroccan food is available every day. And delicious. And beyond this so much choice: a great BBQ at lunch on top of all the grilled meats and fish available inside. Large salad bar (where you can make your own salad if you do not fancy the pre-prepared one) lots of vegs in many different forms on offer. And also chips pasta and pizza for those who fancied it.  Desserts offering is plentiful (some are great some less so) with fresh fruits and simple ice creams also available.    There is a snack van by the main swimming pool for drinks and other snacks. Works well enough for those who need to fill a hole or have missed lunch (hard to!) with savoury and sweet (average) snacks and to get water bottles sodas and even beer and wine (though this remains discreet which I appreciated).    Overall there is a sense of a continental approach to balancing food & drinks intake. It’s not pushed at you. It’s available but you can also easily forget about it which means you can enjoy lunch & dinner more than if you had been grazing all day.  I really enjoyed this (& not to have to play the food police with my child all day long!).    Fear not though there is nothing lacking. Everything really is available if you look for it or ask for it.    We mostly stayed by the main pool as the zen pool was probably a bit too quiet with a teen in toe. The music plays all day long with activities through the day. At times I could have done with gentler music and fewer announcements but understand the choices that were made.    I think the hotel should actively discourage sunbed bookings.  It’s unnecessary (there are ample sunbeds available) and actually quite stressful when people place towels as early as 6.30/7am on sunbeds around the swimming pool (often not showing up until much later if not at all).  I saw a sign around the zen pool to that effect. I do not know if it works. But it spoilt it a bit for me. We always found a spot regardless of what time we arrived.  There are a few spots under trees which provide much cooler shade & a bit of respite from the noise around the pool which we found very pleasant. Most people seem to be sun worshippers though (August it was really hot!).    I totally enjoyed some of the many activities on offer. My favourite being stretch aqua aerobics and spinning in the open air (I have never done either of the last two). Saamadi the instructor for aqua aerobics and spinning is absolutely ace (I actually think I became fitter during my all inclusive holiday!). Another girl from the animation team sometimes handled stretch and aqua aerobics but really looked like she would rather be somewhere else (she was amazing when she danced during the evening entertainment).  There is definitely a demand for extra spinning sessions. The class was always full.  Did not try the gym room but it seems relatively well appointed.  To clarify I did not intend on doing so much if anything at all during my holiday but it was so good that I looked forward to my little exercise windows.    The evening animation (spilling out through the day) is quite something. Boundless energy from a team that never stops. We really do not know how they sustain it!  It was not really to our taste but we were never pushed to take part and it was hugely popular. So even if this was not for us it was lovely to see so many people joyfully taking part and enjoying the dance routines etc. There was a big effort to vary the themes too.  There seem to be a screen on the main entertainment area maybe it would be an idea to do film nights sometimes?    There are only a couple of things that I could add as constructive criticism.  The first one would be for the hotel to take a more responsible approach to using less plastic and being greener in general.  Why not use the reusable plastic glasses around the pool rather than distribute drinks in single use ones? And replace straws with paper ones? Encourage people to refill their plastic bottles a few times (it’s possible but only during lunch and dinner where there is still and sparkling water available).  There was also no option in the room to keep towels so they were replaced everyday.    The second one a bit of a pet hate for me would be to have designated smokers areas. I have issues with taking my breakfast alongside someone smoking (& pretty much any other meals or drinks at the terrace). As a family hotel I think it would be beneficial for children too to not be exposed to secondary smoke so much.  Hopefully this will come as attitude to smoking change.    Wifi is not super reliable unless you are in the lobby (cue the kids on their devices lounging on the great sofas of the lobby) but I actually class this as a positive! It's there if you need it but it not being so great in some area has allowed me to disconnect more easily.    Free shuttle to town is super useful (especially given how variable the quality of driving is when you take taxis). Just make sure you know where you go from the dropping point in town. And do not fall in the trap of people taking you to the square or telling you they are working in the hotel etc...    This has been a fantastic break for us “all inclusive” newbies.  We are really thankful to the team for making our holiday such a lovely one. We have grown very fond of the place.  We have thoroughly enjoyed the cultural breath of fresh air both with magical Marrakech and at the hotel with such a diverse customer base (a lot of French lots of Moroccans on the second half of the stay some Spanish Italians and English - all announcements and signs in French & English).    We'll definitely recommend the hotel to our friends and family and will hopefully be back!,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sticker04

The food choice was amazing everything was so fresh and delicious and there was something different every day!  Every single member of staff was extremely friendly and helpful the manager couldn’t do enough for us we we really well looked after throughout our whole 10 days!  The hotel and grounds were very clean and extremely well maintained!  There was more than enough sunbeds at the time we visited although it was just before school holidays it may get busier at peak times!  We spent most of our time around the zen pool which was adults only the barman at this pool was great we had a laugh with him and he kept bringing us cocktails all day every day we didn’t even have to ask for them!  The animation team were great!  We didn’t want to leave it was an amazing holiday and the weather was just perfect we will 100% be back to this hotel!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,simon l wrote a review Aug 2018,50,Iberostar Marrakesh,Walking into reception we were greeted by Iman who instantly welcomed all 9 of us talked to us about the facilities and remembered our names. When ever we saw him around the resort he made sure we were having a good time and were comfortable with our stay as did all of the staff.. you can not fail to be bored where else could you have a go on a trapeze.  The food is plentiful I found the meat cooked on the bbq each day to be stunning.  Marrakesh is a wonderful visit and everyone we met was friendly and spoke English. I would come back to Marrakesh and to Iberostar and recommend you try it if you are looking for somewhere just outside Europe... you have to visit the Madina day or night to experience true Marrakesh and a tour guide was a good idea ( do not worry one will find you ) walking around Marrakesh felt as safe as London except for crossing the road organised chaos !,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Milford on Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonl234
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,norfolkanbooze wrote a review Aug 2018,40,Family holiday,Recently returned from a family holiday where the age range was 19-91 years!    You have to put down a deposit for the pool towels which was a bit disappointing especially as the cash machine was out of order all of our holiday.    The star friends entertainment team were fantastic you were so lucky Yousef that our last day was your day off in the pool you would have gone.  The team provided entertainment during the day and in the evening and were always happy and cheerful. If your by the main pool be prepared to be pushed in.    The main pool does get very busy and sun loungers get reserved very quickly.    The food truck will keep you going with snacks and drinks.    The food in the restaurant was good but definitely ready for a change after a week.    The Morocco restaurant is a good experience and worth doing.    The own brands of spirits were drinkable and quiet pleasant. All of the bar staff were really great. It would of been nice if the bar was air conditioned as there was no where to cool off in the evening heat.    The hotel is not wheel chair friendly however a big thank you to everyone at the hotel who helped and assisted my 91 year old grandad enjoy his holiday. He had a fab time and especially enjoyed the foam party!    The rooms were clean and replenished daily. The only thing missing was tea and coffee facilities.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norfolkanbooze
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Ben C wrote a review Aug 2018,40,"Very Good, Highly Reccomed Worth a Visit",Iberostar Palmerie    I write this review whilst here on my final evening at the hotel. Firstly I want to thank everyone who has already reviewed this hotel as it was the deciding factor to choose this hotel for me and my family. As you can imagine it’s always hard to pick a holiday which will cater for a family with 3 kids (6 years 5 years and 1 year old) it was reassuring reading the reviews for this hotel.    We booked direct with British Airways as a package holiday and glad we flew with BA as it made it easy to settle with the kids on the plane. I will give my review on the hotel and at the end will give you my Top Tips which I hope will help.    The hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport. I booked my return transfer from recommendation on tripadvisor a company called marrakech airport transfer  Highly recommended very professional cheap reliable and AC Mini Vans with lots of room thank you Paul you can contact them via their website or WhatsApp all info on their web page.    Clearing custom in Marrakech is a pain in the rear end and will take ages possibly over an hour but if you have kids and smile then you’ll be fast tracked right to the front of the queue. Make sure you have filled out your landing cards if you don’t get it on the plane then you’ll get it when you land it takes 5 min to fill out. This is why I recommend the above transfer service as they will wait for you regardless of how long it takes. As for getting Moroccan Currency DO NOT BUY from UK it’s a rip off at 8 MAD to £1  When you land in Marrakech and have cleared customs there are two money exchange stands and you will get 11 MAD to £1 and commission free do not buy any Buy Back tell them you just want currency to be honest you will end up spending it as you don’t want to take it back. To go one step further get yourself a Monzo PrePaid Master Card from UK it’s free and you get the market rate on currency in Europe so when I used my Monzo card in Marrakech I was getting 12.5 MAD to £1 great to use in hotel to pay for spa treatments and settling your room bill.    When you arrive at the hotel don’t be alarmed when your driver is not allowed into the hotel premises it’s a security thing with the hotel where all taxis are not allowed into the grounds and have to wait outside the gate. When you get here get out of the car and the security at the gate will take your luggage to reception or call a bell boy. Make sure you check you have all your bags before going to the hotel reception. The driver will come with you into the hotel reception if you want. Once you’ve checked in make sure you give your hotel voucher to the staff and you will have to fill out some forms before you get your room keys you will not have to surrender your passports that will stay with you. There are drinks in reception for guests to have while you complete the paperwork. You’ll get a welcome pack with info but it’s all very vague and not detailed. I would strongly suggest that you spend some time walking around the hotel and find out where everything is and know where you’re going. You’ll get a wrist band to wear to show you are all inclusive. I’m not one for wristbands on holiday so it came straight off but I kept it in my pocket if anyone did ask to see it but I never did and got served everywhere I went.    We had 2 rooms interconnected which was brilliant the rooms are very big and the interconnecting rooms makes it like a massive suite really helps when you have kids as they have their own space and own bathroom. The rooms are very clean and come with Safe Fridge hair dryer and very good AC but you DO NOT GET an Iron or board. The hotel does not provide this to anyone. They want you to use their laundry service so we had 5 kids clothes and 7 adult clothes ironed and it cost me £17 (Monzo Card) which is not bad.  The beds we found to be a little on the hard side but that’s individual preference the beds are massive and pillows very fluffy. You’ll have a little balcony attached to your room with a table and 2 chairs which is nice if you want to sit outside. The rooms are cleaned daily and always topped up with shampoo toilet roll etc.    We were all inclusive which means the diet goes out the window I have to say the selection of food was absolutely amazing and a huge variety something for everyone. Drinks beers wine and cocktails all included obviously local spirits if you want premium you can pay for it but it’s not worth it stick to the local stuff. For breakfast you have to try the ring donuts they are the best you will have ever tried only if you have them at breakfast fresh and hot. Majority of the meat will be beef chicken and fish but they do have lamb on some nights. The variety of fish available is excellent and very tasty. Do pace yourself as you will be eating 3 times a day so don’t eat everything on the first day. The cocktails are nice but I found them to be watered down I guess it’s expected at an all inclusive but there is no limit so drink as much as you want. What worked for me was from day one I got to know one guy for breakfast lunch and dinner gave a little tip everyday and this got me... every time me and my family entered we got a table within a couple of minutes all set up a high chair on the ready and cleaned 5 glasses of water and beer wine or fresh juice at the table. This is how I like to work on holiday and it works especially when travelling with kids. But be generous with your tips and keep it discreet don’t show off.    The children’s pool is very good and you’ll always get a sun bed. The kids will love the water slide and dump bucket you will not get pool service at the kids pool only at the adult pools. There are 2 adult pools one which has all the entertainment and other which is the quiet adult pool. The towels are 100MAD deposit which you get back at the end when you return your towel if you lose your towel it’s your loss.    The evening entertainment is ok. Every night there is something different. Generally all the staff at the hotel are very polite and will always say hello when walking past you.    It was a pleasure to meet the hotel manager deputy hotel manager and reservation manager. All 3 are gentleman and very polite true to their words and took my feedback. What really impressed me was everyday at every meal time there was one of them in the restaurant making sure everyone was ok and everything was working like clock work. You rarely see this in hotels.    My Top Tips    • take a bath mat if you have kids for the shower (no bath tub) and shower tray is quite hazardous  • Tip generously and treat everyone with respect  • Get a Monzo Card  • Get your currency from Marrakech airport  • Take some cheap pool towels save on paying deposit  • Take some white clothing for White Night  • Download loads of stuff on iPad for kids as TV in room has 2 English news channels everything else is in another language. No kids channels  • No shade at the kids pool so for kids bring sun safe suits as opposed to swim trunks or costumes    All in all the hotel Management is very good and they take pride in the hotel and making sure their guests are having a good time. My family and I enjoyed our stay and I would highly recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benc0007

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,xktxs wrote a review Jul 2018,40,"Lovely staff, beautiful grounds",I just want to say this is a lovely hotel BUT DON'T BOOK WITH THE THOMAS COOK REP IN RECEPTION FOR THE MOUNTING TRIP ITS A RIP OFF. The Zen pool is fab and so are all the staff not one staff member unwilling to help the hotel has so much to offer if you have children (we don't).  The food all was cook very well and lots of choice but was very much the same for breakfast lunch and dinners always lots if fresh bread and the fresh orange juice at breakfast was so good they should serve this all day ! The grounds at the hotel are kept green and pretty no litter or cups left lying around.  My only problem is you would have expected to have an iron & kettle in the room this was not the case we asked and get told there was an ironing service between £1 & £4 per item. I did ask again and received an iron and ironing board also a kettle the management are very nice and always around if you have any questions or concerns.    THE SHUTTLE DOES NOT DROP YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO BE FOR THE MARKET IT'S A BIT OF A TREAK I WOULD SAY EVENING IS BEST AS IT'S A LONG WALK IN THE HEAT.

We had a fab time with lots of lovely fresh food and staff. We did buy our holiday through love holidays and they sold it to us saying it had 5 restaurants. When we arrived there was only one which is ‘buffet’ style. I was slightly worried about our stay after that but the food in the restaurant is fresh and there was lots of variety.    We had a pool side room which was loud up until 11pm but was really convenient for getting to the pool.    There are 3 pools the best one for us being zen as it was quiet and lots of space.    I wouldn’t say I’m going back as for me once you have done it once anywhere that’s enough but we did really enjoy our stay.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Portsmouth, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachaelj772

The staff really make this hotel from imail the guest relations manager who remembers everyone's name to the cleaners who work tirelessly through the day. Okay there were some minor things but overall I can overlook them due to the team effort in this place. The food was plentiful and varied we were there for 11 nights and didn't get tired of the food the entertainment was excellent and something for every age. We will definitely return to this hotel.  Just a small note to the team doing the music at the pool cardi b and Kanye have radio edits of their music these would be more age appropriate for the main pool.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Nicola B wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Best weeks holiday,We have just returned from the most amazing week at this hotel.  Even before we arrived the staff especially the guest relations manger couldn’t of been more helpful or friendly.  We requested a double instead of twin beds and indeed our request was granted.  Upon arrival the reception staff checked us in quickly and without any hassle and bags were taken to our room which was beautiful and spacious. The bathroom was immaculate and large with a walk in shower which was heaven. The whole hotel is kept immaculate and all the staff work so hard to keep it that way.  There are two main pools and a children’s splash pool all of which are amazing. We chose to spend every day by the Zen pool which was adults only and so peaceful the perfect way to spend our days.  The entertainment staff were excellent around the main pool area and we watched from a distance all the children and adults having great funbee would definitely take our children to this hotel.  The main restaurant was lovely always lots of choice and variety from pizza paella fish roast meats salads and a bbq with delicious steak and burgers. The desserts were gorgeous we especially enjoyed the meringues.  We honestly couldn’t of asked for a better or more relaxed week and indeed had booked again before we even left.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Gillian wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Amazing 😊,Just returned from a 10 night stay with my husband and teenage daughter. Our room was a ‘family room’ which consisted of 2 single beds pushed together and a day bed. Enough storage space for clothing. The bathroom was spacious with limited hotel toiletries and your towels are replaced daily. The hotel reception looks impressive very Moroccan with scattered colourful cushions and couches at every turn. The rest of the hotel has an abundance of seating areas to relax in. The dining room is large with plenty of tables and chairs to accommodate guests with air conditioning. There is also seating outdoors. The staff at this hotel cannot do enough for you. The food is sensational lots of choices to cater for all taste buds you won’t be disappointed - bbq outside on occasions too. There is also a food truck by the pool which we only used once due to huge amount of wasps. The hotel has spa facilities which we didn’t use but did look lovely and again the staff were lovely. There is a free shuttle bus into Marrakech which you need to book the day before as it gets busy.    Our daughter suffered some sunburn a couple of days in and the staff couldn’t have been more helpful and caring. A huge thank you.    The pools are lovely we used the larger pool which has an abundance of sun loungers and parasols. There are also some cabanas. The lifeguards are exceptional and will assist you if you require your parasol put up. There is also a team of entertainment staff who are clearly hardworking incredible people. They don’t stop constantly striving to make your holiday a good one. The entertainment they put on at night is also very good from acrobats to belly dancers. On the nights they don’t have any acts on the lovely man on the keyboard however is a bit cheesy!!!    I do have a couple of personal niggles sadly. Our room was part of an adjoining room which was noisy we could hear EVERYTHING!!!!! On booking unless you require this facility request not to have an adjoining room. There is a small shop within the hotel the items are lovely but the lady who works there not so much (sorry) compared to the hotel staff she is the opposite. On our day of leaving reception were kind enough to offer us a room to shower as we were not being picked up till 6pm and you need to be out your room at 12pm. The room was a normal room but on entering the room had clearly been used before with 4 clearly used dirty bath towels thrown on the floor with no hotel toiletries (shower gel or toilet roll). Reception give you a time to use this room so they should check the room prior to using - this was disappointing!    On a positive note the Guest Relations Manager was exceptionally friendly and helpful a huge credit to the hotel.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,1stchoicelastchoice wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Fabulous!!,I was going to wait to write this review but after chatting with people at the airport I feel I should write it ASAP!    I have just returned from a 10 day stay with my 2 children. I can’t fault this hotel at all. It was immaculate the food was lovely and there was always something to do.    The staff were helpful and friendly without being over intrusive or making you feel like they’re being degraded by serving you (I hate this in some countries).    The kids clubs are great if you choose to use them there is a variety of activities for adults too if you want but if you just want to relax they have an adult pool. It has its own bar which is nice.    For the more adventurous holiday makers they have a trapeze which I think is amazing - didn’t manage to pluck up the courage but my son loved it and did it loads of times!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Paul B wrote a review Jul 2018,50,"Great value, nice rest",We've just returned from a 10 night stay in this lovely colonial style hotel. The rooms are well equipped the rooms on the far left hand side opposite the zen pool are the quiet rooms we faced the perimeter wall not much of a view but it didn't matter as we weren't in the room other than to sleep etc. The zen pool is adult only and was quiet it has its own bar and 6 cabana style beds and plenty of sunbeds. If the barman finds time  he will bring you drinks to your sunbeds.  A short walk through the beautiful gardens takes you to the main pool and seperate splash pool. A chuck wagon provides snacks throughout the day. The main restaurant supplies sufficient well cooked dishes to delight even the fussiest eaters including beautiful suchi morrocan dishes plus all the usual salads and cooked dishes fruit and sweet dishes.  Wine and beer together with soft drinks are self service.  Further along is the main bar with good waiter service and bar service.  The great animation team will try and persuade you to join in with all the daytime activities and evening entertainment will involve your participation.  Reception is a large cool and fairly quiet place however this is where you can seek advice regarding what the hotel offers plus where you can book a visit to the delightful Moroccan restaurant where a four course meal can be a relaxing time away from the main restaurant.  We booked a free coach trip into the centre of Marakech beware you are dropped off opposite a small hotel called the Jasmine where where it takes about 20 minutes to walk into the main square to experience Moroccan life in the raw. The roads are quite dangerous to cross as nobody gives way and it is best to cross as a group rather than a couple as even the pushbikes don't stop.  At night this makes it even more dangerous as the majority of drivers don't bother with lights.  We went during the day to see the square with its many horse drawn coaches and taxi's attempting to take you for a tour excellent value if you wish to haggle. You will be met by many men trying to be your guide they are all harmless and will eventually give up should you wish to see the sights on your own. A large tower just outside the square is a good site to keep you from getting lost.  The coach returns to the hotel at 12.30 from the same spot as it dropped you.  The coach also returns in the afternoon and also in the evening returning to the hotel at 10.30.  If you miss it taxis will take you back to the hotel for about 200 dh haggle the price but don't pay anymore.  As you will experience entry into Marakech airport does take a good hour and half getting through passport control is not a good experience pick up your visa card and complete it as you queue. Once you collect your bags all suitcase will be scanned before you leave the airport.  When you end your stay expect a similar experience after checking in complete your exit cards while you queue as security at passport control is a bit of a hold up.  The restaurants in the hotel are a good place to spend your last money as it's not worth taking it home.  At the boarding gate expect for your luggage and your pockets hands and shoes to be checked again before you get on your plane.  Hope you have a great holiday we did.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89PaulB
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Nicola K wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Beautiful,Enjoyed a 4 night break without the kids but they would have loved it too. Brilliant for couples singles and families alike. The food is excellent staff friendly and the hotel is beautiful. Our room was located just off the lobby and was noisey so we asked to move and they moved us straight away to a beautiful block just near the adult pool. There is a large lively pool which has music and games but no bar. A kids pool with splash park and slides. An adult only pool where we spent our time as it was large quiet and had a bar!! Salah the barman was very friendly and helpful. The pools had lifeguards who also kept the areas clean. The entertainment staff are great too. The only reason I am not giving this place a 5 star rating is that the place is mainly french speaking and although the staff do speak English when you speak to them messages about entertainment etc got spoken in french which left the English having to guess what was going on. I would go back again but only if i was wanting a poolside relaxing break as you can not walk out of the hotel. Marrakech is a good 30 min coach ride and are no shops restaurants etc near by.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burnley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicolaK1153
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,TracyandSteveSmith wrote a review Jul 2018,50,"An amazing hotel, a real gem",We visited Marrakesh for a week as a group of two couples 23rd June and we couldn’t have picked a better hotel. It was our second visit to Marrakesh and didn’t know what to expect as it wasn’t our usual type of hotel having done Adults only previously.    On arrival Iberostar staff took our bags and offered us a cool much needed drink before checking us into our room 30 minutes later.    The two rooms we were allocated were a good size with a sofa dressing table and balcony overlooking the Zen pool. Over the week we all commented on the cleanliness of the rooms having clean bedding almost every day and clean towels daily. We could even walk around the room each morning/evening barefooted and never have a bit of dust on the soles of our feet! Amazing!!! In fact the whole hotel was amazingly clean.    Having unpacked we headed off to find the Zen pool (the quiet pool)!!! We used this pool the whole week. We’d get up at 8am each morning always being first at the pool and would head off for breakfast almost an hour later. On our return there’d be around 10 more beds taken up. Always a sun bed available during the day no matter what time you arrived! There is a bar at the pool and we must mention Salah the barman. He was young cheerful and enthusiastic. He would bring our drinks to us having ordered them at the bar. By the end of the week we’d just stand up he’d spot us and would gesture us to sit down. Drinks would then arrive he remembered each of our drinks every time (there were 4 of us!) a special mention to the lifeguard too a happy face always cleaning around the pool collecting cups and we even spotted him one day ‘babysitting’ two babies in prams sleeping when Mum and Dad grabbed a quick swim.    We must also mention Imad the hotels Relations Manager. Always walking around the hotel checking that everyone was happy and remembering all of our names by the end of the holiday.    The food at the hotel was excellent. Lots of choice and variety some of it not too hot but plenty of it and myself being fussy yet eating well every day proves that!    All in all a great holiday wish we’d booked to stay longer. Would highly recommend and I’m sure we will return one day soon.    A big thank you everyone at Iberostar.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dunstable, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyAndSteveSmith
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,GreatXpectation wrote a review Jul 2018,30,"Okay, but more of a 3 star",2 adults both females in June.    I had a good feeling booking this hotel based on other trip advisor reviews. I quickly learnt that whilst this hotel has many good points the reviews are only as good as the experience of the writer. The problem with good expectations is disappointment which we did encounter on our holiday. The frustrating this was many of these could have been avoided - see my traveller tips at the end of my review for more info.    Overall summary: staff are friendly and eager to help. Whole resort very clean and tidy very pleasant. Food was sub standard and not 24 hours.  Cocktails were very different (and served in TINY flimsy plastic cups approx 200ml) depending where you got them from and who made them even if you asked for the same one. If you want a good value break in the sun and don’t sweat the small stuff this place is for you. If you are used to top notch service with lovely cocktails where food is a highlight of your trip avoid this resort.    Rooms: rooms were clean with twin beds pushed together. There was a fridge with a litre bottle of water on arrival. Any further water required after this could be got from the bars in smaller 500ml bottles. No other soft drinks/alcohol in room. No kettle (but did get one and some milk to put in the fridge upon asking which was good service)    Bathroom: big walk in shower with both an overhead and detachable shower head. Toilet and sink in same room. Hairdryer by sink. Powerful enough.  Frosted glass double doors which closed properly. No lock. No air conditioning so bathroom got hot.    Toiletries: shower gel shampoo shower cap soap cotton buds sewing kit provided. No hair conditioner.    Food: food was very similar for most meals. Breakfast was good with fresh omelettes cooked to order. Plenty of crepes croissants bacon sausages their version of baked beans etc. Coffee from a machine help yourself. Same every day.  Lunch was varied but could always get pizza chips bread rolls cheeses for those who like their home comforts/with kids.  Dinner - again always get rice/chips/cous cous. Vegetables were nice especially the carrots. Did meat cooked each night.  Can reserve the Moroccan restaurant ONCE in your trip the beef tagine was the best beef I had whilst I was there - but the rest of the meal wasn’t as good as the buffet and just a fruit salad for dessert so went to main buffet afterwards for some proper pud! Do wait to try the Moroccan tea afterwards as this was lovely.    Drinks: as outlined in summary.  Main cocktails were:  Pina colada daiquiri (lemon not strawberry) mojito tequila sunrise.    Food outside of restaurant times  Towards the end of our stay we learnt that you can get olives and peanuts from the main bar from 7pm. This wasn’t widely known but if you ask they will get you some. If you want a snack after 10pm be warned there is NOTHING!! This is an area I was really surprised at given an all inclusive 4* resort.    Entertainment  Staff here work really hard to get everyone involved and dancing. So friendly and enthusiastic a lovely team. Clearly lots for the kids too.    Shows from 9:30pm each night different themes each night.  In our opinion best night was the white party and the Moroccan night with traditional food and dancing.  Disco (stairs leading under the theatre area I think it is open 12 - 1am). Not widely advertised so when we went there only 8 guests!    Gym:  2 treadmills - one broken.  Fridge for water which always seemed empty - bring your own!  Weights - no dumbbells.  One bar with approx 4x7.5 kg plates.  No mirrors for checking form.  Couple of machines: chest press shoulder press 2x bike 2x cross trainer.    Tips for guests:  Go to the shop and get yourself some crisps to keep in your room. I can guarantee you that you will be glad you did at some point in your stay!  Go to Marrakech (free shuttle bus from OUTSIDE the hotel - by the road!) but do your research beforehand to know what to expect. Be careful crossing the road. Don’t trust anyone’s directions. Take a map. Be firm when you say “no thank you”. Know what you are willing to pay and work your way up towards that. If they won’t come down to what you believe the item is worth walk away.    Bring a white item of clothing for the “white party” otherwise you will feel out of place - everyone seemed to get the memo yet there was no communication that we received.    When dining outside place a paper napkin over your drinks with a knife over the top to weigh it down so it doesn’t blow away in the breeze! Otherwise you will have wasps in the drink before you know it!    Currency - use ATM to get dirham (closed currency so restrictions bringing in/out the country) either at airport hotel or Marrakech. We used hotel as we felt safer getting cash there rather than busy Marrakech. There are shops etc on the resort which are usual 9-5 hours but closed on Thursday.    Tips for management:  I felt this resort wasn’t really “all inclusive” as there was many a time we wanted a drink or a snack but we were told there wasn’t anything. Please look into providing small snacks 24 hour. Most all inclusives do offer food around the clock even if it is just crisps/nuts/chips or something. After dancing at the evening entertainment and then the disco at 1am some sustenance is needed!!    Ice cream should also be available throughout the day for hot children!! Perhaps the truck could provide this or the pool side bar.    Label your food at the buffet. Teach staff basic terms in English. Asking if something was vegetarian became a frequent challenge as did just asking what something was or asking for something.    Tell guests that the transfer to Marrakech is from OUTSIDE the hotel by the road - we nearly missed the bus due to this as we thought it would pull up outside reception. Give all guests a map of the city.    Fitness centre - sort that treadmill out get water replenished regularly and get a big mirror on the blank wall by the door so guests can check their form. Also would open the room up and make it even lighter/look bigger.    After key evening events such as the white party informs guests of the disco and encourage them to go there immediately whilst the party mood is still there. Instead there was an hour lull from 11 when the white party finished to midnight. This meant the ambiance was completely lost and many hotel guests went their different ways! The disco could be really good fun if you advertised it more and got guests involved!    Overall a good holiday but I have been fortunate enough to have experienced many better than this at similar price points and star ratings elsewhere.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Slough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreatXpectation
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Hakes2805 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Fabulous!,Wow where do I start this hotel is probably one of the best I've ever stayed in. The staff cannot do enough for you. The food and drinks are excellent and the rooms were clean and tidy. We travelled as a group of 10 and the staff were attentive from the moment we arrived. Also offering champagne and cake for other birthday celebrations in the Morrocan restaurant which was a lovely touch. The Zen pool is lovely and bar staff helpful and friendly. Love the extra touches of bringing melon round the pool in the afternoon. Also had a great massage in the spa well worth the money would highly recommend. I have nothing bad to say and would love to return to this brilliant hotel.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hakes2805
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,LaurenRW769 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Wonderful hotel,We visited Marrakesh for a week and we couldn’t have picked a better hotel to have stayed at! It was our first visit to Marrakesh and didn’t know what to expect as it wasn’t our usual choice of holiday.    When we arrived at the hotel we was greeted with a smile by the staff which were so polite throughout our stay! They took our bags and brought us drinks while we waited to get our room cards and wristbands which didn’t take too long considering there was quite a few people checking in the same time as us.    The rooms were spacious and immaculate we couldn’t fault the cleaning!! We had clean towels every day and clean bedding most days which usually when we’ve visited places it had been every other day we’ve had clean towels and bedding! The maid who cleaned our room Zineb was always happy and smiling and did a brilliant job at keeping our room lovely and clean!    There was 3 pools we stayed around the Zen pool which was adults only (16 or over) so was mainly quite and peaceful and away from all the noise and activities going on around the main pool. There is also a bar around this pool and the bar man Salah was so polite and would bring us drinks around the pool when we wanted and if we hadn’t been back to the bar in a while he would bring us drinks down remembering what we had the whole time we stayed there which was also good! By the end of the holiday all the bar staff remembered what drinks we had and we didn’t even have to go to the bar by the end because they bring them straight to us!    The food choice is good and the hotel caters for everyone which is a bonus as many places we’ve visited don’t have much choice and are very repetitive with the food but not at this hotel it was a different food variety every night which none of us could fault.    Also we would like to mention Iman who was there if we needed anything throughout our stay and remembered all of our names from the first day he met us all. All the staff are a credit to this hotel!    To say we enjoyed our stay here would be and understatement there was nothing we could criticise about this hotel and look forward to returning in December with the rest of our family.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenRW769

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Krissy53 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Amazing,Fabulous hotel clean and welcoming. The staff cannot do enough for you and nothing is an issue. Food was amazing and plenty of choices even for the most fussy eater. With the main swimming pool for entertainment you also have the zen pool for over 16 if you wish a quieter surrounding. Lots of entertainment through the day and evening. Plenty of different places to get a drink too. The staff work so hard. They also provide a free shuttle bus into the town. If you get time for a trip the the water falls Ozoud it’s well worth the 3 hour trip to get there. Not for those who cannot walk far as it’s approx 600 steps down and then of course 600 back up. You also go on a small boat at the bottom for a few moments plus you get the meet the hungry Barbary apes.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Hellium72 wrote a review Jul 2018,50,Highly Recommended,Just back from a fabulous weeks holiday at this hotel. I can't recommend it enough. The hotel itself is immaculate - clean and well kept. Amenities are excellent I went with a group of adults and stayed around the adults only Zen Pool however it seems that they really make an effort with the kids here. Gardens are beautiful. Sporting facilities good. Food is fresh well made and the choice is excellent. I've previously found on all inclusive holidays that the alcohol is disappointing not here. The wine is lovely the cocktails are not watered down and made in front of you. Spirits are good and provided in generous measures.    During the stay we attended the White Party around the pool and also the management cocktail party. Both offered generous amounts of rather nice champers. We were also provided with champers on our last night.    However the greatest asset this hotel has is its staff. From the moment you arrive. Everyone is attentive and make an effort to remember names. All the staff are amazing the amination team work so hard and genuinely car about making people happy. The waiting staff are fabulous - no waiting around for drinks at meal times there are staff in abundance waiting to assist. The bar staff remember your drink orders and have them ready as soon as they see you walking towards the bar. Around the Zen pool the bar man brought rounds out to us if we hadn't been up for a while. Staff also brought melon slices around. Particular mention to Salah at the Zen Pool who was very attentive to everyone and Idaam the guest services manager who remembered our names (I was in a group of six) within minutes of greeting us made everyone feel special.    Just two negatives - the entertainment seems to be geared towards children. However there are enough bars and places to go if you are not so interested in group dancing / singing so does not detract from the atmosphere. The second is the free shuttle bus. It drops you about 20 mins walk from the centre and you are immediately set upon by guides offering 'free' services. These are not free and you are expected to pay.    I would recommend this hotel to anyone - there is something for all whether you are a family couple or group of friends. I will definitely go back to this hotel.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hellium72
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,TheMunchers wrote a review Jul 2018,50,"Great Food, Great Staff, Great Rooms, Great Time and only one negative.",This hotel is a really great hotel for an all inclusive the quality of the food is great and I love the fact that this hotel celebrates Moroccan culture in its food and themed night etc. Staff are nice and friendly and I must give a special shoutout to Mustapha in the dining area who looked after us very well and was very attentive at all times. I would advise people after breakfast to take a walk every morning around the beautiful gardens ( just follow the jogging path). The rooms are loverly and clean beds are good and the pillows are fantastic. To summarise this is a great hotel. There are access ramps in many places so that a wheelchair would be able to access many places. You won't be disapointed at this hotel.    Now the negative..  THE FREE HOTEL BUS THAT DROPS YOU TO THE CITY CENTRE LEAVES YOU AT LEAST 1 MILE (2KM's) FROM THE CENTRE (Jemaa el-Fnaa). Once you arrive at the drop off point you are pounced upon by tour guides etc. These guides offer to walk you for free to show how to get somewhere DO NOT take these up on the offer of a free escort. It will cost you do you really think these guys are waiting to meet you and show you around Marrakech out of love??? I think the hotelier or driver must have something to do with the reason you get dropped so far the only reason I think is because you have no idea where you are and it would be quite difficult without a map/satnav to find out where to go so many people will accept the guide offer because of this. There is NO reason they can't drop you closer. If you do want to walk to Jemaa el-Fnaa or Koutoubia Mosque (these are right next to each other (takes about 15mins) these are the instructions from the drop off point:    Opposite the drop off point there is a small Carrefour supermarket  The road directly behind that is the road that takes you all the way to Jemaa el-Fnaa and Koutoubia Mosque (going to the right on that road away from the roundabout next to the drop off point)  Thats it!  a few little tips are:  On this walk the park on right which goes the length of a lot of the walk is pretty we did this on the walk back to the drop off point and loved it.    THE ANIMALS    We sat by the horse and carriage stand near the square and witnessed multiple horses collapsing something I have never seen horses do before and when I say collapse I mean the crashed to the floor not just sat down. They were then whipped to get back up. Sellers will try to put monkeys on you etc If they do expect them to want paying. These sellers etc can get quite aggressive in their attitude to get payment. I do not think any animals is this environment are kept well please don't support this evil trade by buying these services.,Date of stay: July 2018,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMunchers
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Joe P wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Lovely hotel,Currently enjoying a 10 night stay here. Good points are:    The hotel is lovely with modern rooms equipped with a digital safe toiletries and satellite TV. Way above other 4 star hotels.    Food is excellent plentiful choice covering traditional Moroccan grilled meats and fish plus plenty for kids.    Fantastic hotel for children. The staff are so active and find plenty for them to do all the way up to age 17. Staff in general are so welcoming and bend over backwards to make your stay enjoyable.    There are a couple of small things that prevent this hotel being perfect. They are truly small things and may not matter to everyone but for me:    Drinks. The alcoholic drinks menu is not brilliant and quite a few of the spirits are of poor quality. Also the poolside food truck sells sodas or beer nothing else so if you like to have a few cocktails by the pool it's quite a walk to the bar.    Gym. I personally want to get up and train before I start my day. The gym doesn't open until some time around 9.30/10 and that time fluctuates. Found this slightly odd. The spinning class provided by the entertainment team was excellent however.    Wi-fi. Fine in some areas terrible in others. If you just want to refresh your apps you'll be fine in your room or by reception but anywhere else like the pool or bar it's very poor. Also wouldn't expect to download anything as an audio book took 8 hours with multiple retries needed.    Overall we are loving our time here and the hotel deserves its 4 star rating.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joepC5027ZS

The hotel is beautiful the staff work very hard to make sure the grounds are lush and immaculate.    The food was all very fresh and plentiful - great breakfasts continental style salads with delicious breads and a range of hot dishes every lunch and dinner. The special Moroccan dishes on our last night were gorgeous and the chef even took time to give my husband a recipe!    This is a French speaking country - and the clientele are predominantly French - but as travelling anywhere an attempt at a few words is very well received and the staff were all very approachable and thoughtful.    Our garden view room was lovely - very spacious and spotless!    We booked a couples massage in the spa for 1150MAD (about £90) which was really good!    We wanted a few days of child-free rest & relaxation to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and this was perfect!    I highly recommend Easy Transfer - it really was easy!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Hannah K wrote a review Jun 2018,50,What a lovely resort!,This was our first time in Marrakech and it was my husband who chose this hotel this time. We don't normally go 4 star so weren't sure what it would lack from the usual 5 stars we stay at. Upon arriving to Morroco the passport control was terrible and very slow so once we got to the hotel we were very tired and hungry. We arrived late and were greeted by a lovely manager think his name was Iman. He was very friendly and brought us some tea and juice. The hotel grounds were beautiful. We were then shown to our room which was a standard garden view. We had to ask them to change our bed to a double as they were set up as two single beds. We asked the room guy and he set this up for us for when we came back from dinner which was nice. The staff were all lovely and very friendly especially the animation guys! What a lovely team! The food was nice but breakfast was my favourite with a lot of options. Our most favourite thing was the spa located at the hotel. We had the most wonderful hammam and massage sessions most days. I recommend you get this booked in for set days you are there as worth every penny. We didn't want to come back. We enjoyed a camel ride there and quad bikes too which were nearby the hotel. A visit to the souks is a must but bound to get lost so try and keep a known spot in your head. Overall fantastic holiday with the most friendliest staff who go out of their way to make the holiday special for you.

Staff are fantastic and great to see a lot of the staff are still working at the hotel since our last visit. It does make a difference when you know the staff are enjoying their work and not just going through the motions. We like to to totally relax so we used the zen pool everyday the quiet adults only pool. The young waiter at the zen bar was very attentive he soon knew your drinks of choice and ensured you had these when you wanted them. The food was fantastic lots of choices and very well presented. The rooms could probably do with a makeover but they are very clean and comfortable. We will be visiting again.

The drinks at the bar on the all inclusive tariff were of very good quality and we never waited more than a few minutes to be served. Enjoyed the food very much and it was good to have a couple of micowave ovens should you wish to reheat it.  The hotel is located away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech itself but there is a free mini bus which runs several times a day operated by the hotel to take you to the city. There is a small library above Reception area on the first floor.  Swimming pools are wonderful. There is one for kids with a water slide. The main pool where activities are held and the quiet adult only pool which is heated in winter. The bedrooms are nicely furnished with a small balcony. You may wish to bring extra hangers. Drawer space is limited but there is good wardrobe space. Safe and air con are free as is it excellent wifi.  However it is the smiling and courteous staff who make this hotel such a pleasure to stay in.  There is a mixture of nationalities with guests predominantly from France but also guests from Germany and quite a few from the U.K.  We would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and have just rebooked for Christmas.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/solace

Even when it is not breakfast lunch or dinner snacks are available.    Negatives:  - I felt as though the food was repetitive every night a little more variation would be welcome.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,The_Luxury_Trave11er wrote a review Jun 2018,40,"Very Welcoming, Buses to Marrakech Centre- Nice Location Away From the Hustle & Bustle!",On arrival staff were friendly and welcoming. I met the manager on arrival who seated me at a table outside whilst my room was being finished off and sent a waiter to bring some Moroccan tea. It isn't as authentic as you will find in the souks and if you visit or stay with a Berber family this tea is the best! Served very sweet with mint. The manager obviously questioned why I was on my own looking at me as if I was some secret magazine reviewer :)    The hotel is about 20 mins from the centre so no that much of a journey and there are mini buses from the hotel if you don't want to grab a taxi. Always remember your drop off point and pick up times; you can easily get lost.    My bags were kept at reception whilst waiting for my room so I connected to the wi-fi to let my friends and family know I had arrived. At this point the wifi was very good and it reached around the whole resort. Unfortunately after day 2 there were constant issues with the internet which they were trying to fix. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't. Fine if you're one of these people that like to completely switch off from the world at home but not so good when you're on your own and everyone would rather know you'e alive! :') However a young man working at reception offered a tether to his phone so I could get a hold of someone which was much appreciated.    The room was fairly open with beautiful doors in a quiet part of the hotel near the zen pool. I was very grateful for this as the main pool is very loud with music blaring all day. I purposefully avoided that pool for the duration of my stay. The zen pool was more to my taste with cabanas sofas and bar! My room was on the top floor with balcony overlooking gardens pool and each morning was greeted with bird song from the trees. My bags were taken up to my room shortly after followed my work men to test the phone in my room (then put in a new one) tightened the handle on my door and then checked the lights. I had assumed that a previous guest had raised concerns as I hadn't been in the room long and not even noticed these things. Soon after a lovely maid arrived to make sure I had enough towels. The maids cleaned the rooms every day and always laid my pajamas out on the bed with flowers etc.The aircon was amazing. It was 43-44 degrees so definitely needed. Beds were firm and comfortable. TV had English channels if you feel like staying in. Free safe in the room. Big walk in shower.    All meals had a good selection to choose from. For all you bacon fans; it's an Arabic country so no piggy! But plenty of their own sausages eggs cooked in all forms beans toasted breads salads fruit yoghurt and juices for breakfast. Various snacks available throughout the day but the crepes and waffles aren't really worth having. They will make you sandwiches at the main pool bar. This little snack bus is plagued by wasps...lots of them- I didn't see anyone get stung though.    Afternoon meal in the restaurant is the best time to eat and sit outside in the shade under the cold mist sprayers. When it's mid 40 degrees this feels like heaven. Lots to choose from pizza pasta salads tagines rice dishes seafood and they have a sushi night too. Some waiters will bring you drinks to the table others will refuse. The Moroccan restaurant is a nice experience but I find going out to proper restaurants is far better. Lots of drinks to choose from. The Pina Colada's are actually made with coconut cream so they are lush!    There was a celebration afternoon with champagne and dancing to say good bye to the guests. I think they do this every week. There is always some evening entertainment up on the stage by the main pool.    Archery is pointless- the arrows are bent and half the time you spend it looking for your arrows that are lost in hedges or the grass. Okay for kids I guess. Trapeze and table tennis too. Tennis courts and a kids club but I heard some parents moaned that their kids were burnt. Well... maybe you should go and check if they need more sun cream because I'm sure the events team aren't there to put cream on your kids all day when there is only 3 or 4 of them and 30 to 40 kid!    Zen pool- perfect! It fills up quickly though!    Mini shop onsite selling magazines and toiletries but take mags with you otherwise you will pay 7 or 8 £ for a £1 mag from home.    Overall an enjoyable stay which I would recommend to people for their first time in Marrakech. I would rate it a solid 4* hotel.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Hisaronu, Türkiye",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Luxury_Trave11er
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Emma B wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Great hotel,Mixed feelings about this hotel as some amazing friendly staff who would go out of their way to help you apart from the reception team who do not seem to care about your concerns! Room was adequate but we did not have a double bed in our room which was annoying. I did visit reception to say about this and he did not seem to care we also had no water in our fridge as promised on arrival and after 14 hours of travelling we had to go and get our own when all we wanted to do was have some sleep. The noise from our room which was 2144 at night was awful dogs barking and I did not get a good night sleep at all! I have stayed in many Iberostar hotels and this has been the one that I would say that needs much more modernisation and attention to detail. Saying all this the staff that keep the Zen pool going are amazing and really do there best to make you feel comfortable!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2112JSemmab

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,hellphooey wrote a review Jun 2018,50,"Great hotel, fabulous staff",I stayed at this hotel with girlfriends for my 50th birthday. It’s a gorgeous hotel with great staff and facilities. As soon as the staff found out it was my birthday they kept arranging little treats for me such as a birthday cake singing ‘happy birthday’ every time they saw me and giving me a bottle of celebratory fizz!  There are 3 pool areas one for kids one for music & activities and a quiet pool for adults only with no music and it’s own little bar so something for everyone.    In particular the animation team manager Abdul the Zen pool attendant Yousef and one of the restaurant staff members Raschida were fantastic. The Spa staff were also great and we had a wonderful hamam one day.    The food was excellent for a buffet we found plenty of variety a different bbq and roast meat each day and always lots of salads to accompany everything. I particularly enjoyed the tagines. The only food area I wasn’t keen on was the snack shack the food did not taste fresh as it was cooked in bulk and then put on a hot plate to re-heat and in the afternoon they put out sugary snacks that weren’t properly covered and so got inundated with wasps and flies. All that’s needed here are some plates with hinged acrylic covers.    The shuttle into the city is good but drops you outside the city walls so be prepared for a little walk. We enjoyed it. The souks are fantastic you only pay what you want to pay and if they don’t want to sell to you at that price they won’t and you can just say ‘no thanks’ and move on no problem. If you really want something though do barter they love it and it can be great fun. We have been to Marrakesh before and always felt very safe just as with any city anywhere in the world you should be sensible with your bags but I’ve definitely felt more at risk of pick pockets in London Paris and Barcelona.    It’s worth going into the city to eat at night lots of restaurants overlook the square and you can watch the lively square from them and enjoy delicious food at very good prices.    A great city and a great hotel I would definitely go here again and recommend to others.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,HelsKirk wrote a review Jun 2018,50,A Real Gem in Marrakech,Wow! What can we say-there are simply so many fabulous things to be said about this hotel. We stayed for a week and from the moment we arrived were amazed by everything and everyone at the hotel.    The food is simply amazing great quality with lots of variety including speciality nights when you could choose to have Lobster King Prawns Sushi and many more different things– honestly this is the best all-inclusive food we have ever experienced in a buffet restaurant. With regards to the a la carte Moroccan restaurant we had noted prior to our holiday that previous Trip Advisor reviews had not been particularly good. However we found this restaurant to be lovely with the pace of receiving food being spot on and the whole experience being very authentic. In our opinion it is an absolute must ‘to do’ during your stay.    As for the cleanliness of this hotel it was perfect absolutely spotless. Our cleaner Zineb was lovely and made our room look extra special with various towel art displays with petals during our stay. Truly beautiful. Even the pool toilets were cleaned regularly and restocked with toilet paper which was great.    With regards to the pool areas the sun loungers are very good quality and therefore comfortable for all day sunbathing (if you can handle the heat!!). The main pool itself is not heated but to be honest this really is not a problem as we found the pool a relief to dip into to cool down. Around the pool we were treated to table service by a great young man called Salah which we thought was a lovely touch as he really looked after us and made us feel welcome.    Likewise the entertainment team are an absolutely fabulous group of people so professional yet personable too especially Mehdi and Nezar who are both exceptional dancers and truly made our holiday special. We never normally join in activities but both Mehdi and Nezar made it so much fun we actually wanted to join in!    The grounds of the resort are immaculately manicured and all staff not just the groundsmen and cleaners but the lifeguards cleaners and entertainment team all work extremely hard in very hot conditions and are a credit to the owners/managers.    Finally we must mention the help we were given on our penultimate day after Ryanair contacted us to inform us that we needed to be at the airport an hour earlier than planned. Since we were unable to make contact with our transfer taxi firm we approached reception for assistance. Ilias attempted to contact the taxi firm too but with no success. Ihmrad (Manager) then came to our aid and he along with Ilias battled on trying to make contact. We were so impressed that Ihmrad as a Manager was prepared to help and that in fact both of them were so keen to assist. It was a very pleasant surprise and we felt that this was just another example of the Iberostar Staff going above and beyond.    If there was one small negative about the Hotel it is the ‘Palm shop’ which is very poor and I know other people found it to be a problem too. I would advise anyone going to this hotel to ensure they have all of their essentials with them as otherwise it is a struggle to get anything from the shop as it is very small and has only a limited stock of items simply because of its size. Maybe this is something that Iberostar could expand for the future.    However that said our holiday to this hotel was fantastic and became an even more fabulous experience because of the amazing staff whom we have named and many more whose names we didn’t know. The only other negative is that we only stayed for a week and hadn’t booked 2 weeks or more. We will definitely be coming back and hopefully before the end of this year!!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelsKirk

From Arrival at reception until departure our trip was thoroughly enjoyable thanks to friendly and professional staff at every level in this Hotel. The Staff cannot do enough to help make your trip extra special and always seem to have a friendly Bonjour and a smile. Special mention to Mehdi in the Star Friends club who entertained us so well day and night. Also to young Zach who was on work experience and never refused a kick around with the children. Plenty to do in this Hotel Soccer Pitch Basketball High Ropes BadmintonTable Tennis and much more. There is also a path around the grounds (About 1.2K) for walking or running. Hotel and grounds are spotless. For somebody who is usually fed up of all inclusive buffet after 4 days the food here is fabulous there is plenty of choice and it is varied and very good quality and I certainly never got tired of it.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Matt P wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Outstanding hotel,This is an absolutely outstanding hotel. I came here with a group of friends and we can’t wait to return soon.    The hotel grounds are beautiful. There are constantly staff working to keep the gardens looking so amazing. Very relaxing to just walk around the hotel grounds.    The food was very good for an all inclusive hotel. Some nights there was fresh steak being grilled as well as other things. We ate in the Moroccan restaurant on our last night and it was brilliant. Staff were very nice in the Moroccan restaurant. The food was very tasty and filling.    The rooms are brilliant. The beds are extremely comfortable and the air con is very decent. You can get inter-connecting rooms if you need.    There are 3 swimming pools: the main pool the Zen pool and the children’s pool. We didn’t use the children’s pool as we were a group of friends in our twenties. We stuck to the main pool as this had lots of good activities music and entertainment but was still perfectly relaxing.    My only criticism of the hotel is that the WiFi was quite poor. It was generally slightly better in the rooms but on the whole the WiFi needs improving.    There’s a great coach service that heads to the city centre. This needs to be booked preferably a day in advance. The driver was really nice to us and dropped us off early so we could walk to Le Jardin Majorelle.    Now for the staff. Every single member of staff we encountered was exceptional and a true credit to the hotel. It’s hard to include everyone’s name as all staff were outstanding but here is a few who were particularly great to us:    Imrad- He is the the Guest Relations Manager and from the moment we arrived he was extremely welcoming. He got us checked into our rooms straight away despite us arriving very early. We had welcome drinks and Imrad made a point of getting to know us. He told us everything we need to know about the hotel. Whenever we saw him throughout the week he was always asking how we were getting on.    Mehdi - What a great guy. Member of the Animation team. Always chatting to us. He did a great spin class with us one day too. He had lunch with us a couple of days too and was generally such a hilarious and friendly character!    Nezar - Another fantastic member of the Animation Team. As well as entertaining he was also doing other stuff like teaching everyone to cook tagine one day as well! He came and found us after his shift had finished to say goodbye properly to us and to give us some Animation Certificates for attending the Mojito Party which I thought was really friendly. He was also a great DJ in the on-site nightclub!    Ayshee- Also a fantastic Animation team member. She looks after the children so we didn’t see much of her in the day but in the evening shows we always talked to her and she was a credit to the team.    Azara Racha Nema Mario and Dinar were also outstanding members of the Entertainment Team.    Zakaria and Salah - Both working at the various bars by the pools. They were both fantastic and always so friendly whenever we came to get drinks. Zakaria did great mojitos at the Mojito Party too!    Manar - She was waitressing and she was great. Always getting us drinks and making jokes with us.    Finally - the spa staff were all brilliant. We got a hammam clay scrub and 60 minute massage which was excellent. We felt really relaxed afterwards and the staff were so friendly there too.    To sum up the Iberostar in Marrakech is absolutely brilliant. This is the third Iberostar Hotel I have stayed in and they are consistently outstanding.    We had such a great time and have a lot of great memories here. We will definitely be returning.    Thanks for such a great week!    Matt Peter Alfred Alex and Jess,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matt_price1993
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kirsty M wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Fantastic Time,Upon our arrival we were greeted with friendly and helpful staff including the duty manager. Fortunately our room was ready early so we could enjoy our weekend immediately. The room was spacious and spotlessley clean with good views of the grounds.    The food at every meal time was excellent with plenty of choice both hot and cold. The waiting staff were on hand to get you drinks if you hadn't got your own from the drink station and they were quick to remove your empty plates.    While we enjoyed our drinks in the lobby bar of an evening Imad the manager always took the time to ask guests how their day had been and he remembered most guest's name's which was a nice touch.    On the Friday the shop was closed and the hotel even offered to send a driver into the medina for me. This is proof that nothing is too much trouble for them.    We only had 3 night's at this hotel but we will certainly return due to the friendly and relaxed atmosphere.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"March, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstym10

All the staff are great we recognised many from our last trip. Food was slightly better this time fresh fish being grilled outside was a nice addition to the buffet. Nice to se the frogs are still there 😀. The zen pool has gone downhill there are 3 pools on site... a children's pool a large pool with music and aqua sports aqua aerobics etc and the zen pool the zen pool is meant to be tranquil and quiet (zen like) unfortunately there was some young Americans there so lots of ""like this"" and ""like that"" in that 'Saved By The Bell' & High School Musical drivel also some English ladies who twittered on.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Iain S wrote a review Jun 2018,50,1st Class,From the moment we checked in we were treated to 1st class service from all of the hotel staff. I had contacted the hotel prior to our arrival to arrange some flowers for my wife she was suitably impressed with the lovely bouquet of 24 red roses ❤️. The choice of food was superb the special highlight being the Moroccan food which was unlike anything we had tried back in the UK. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and well maintained by a dedicated team of gardeners. The Zen pool which we used was a spot of tranquility very peaceful if you want to chill out with a book or two! Special mention to the young barman at the pool bar Zach who kept our drinks full and as with all the staff had a smile on his face at all times. We visited the nightly entertainment a couple of times which although wasn't really our thing. We found all the animation staff extremely friendly. The free bus into the city was great and we used it on a number of occasions the only thing we would suggest is that perhaps a map could be given out as we needed a couple of times to get our bearings. We have stayed in many hotels and this is one of the best we have experienced for service. nothing was a problem.

Entertainment (daily by poolside and evening) absolutely brilliant.  There are 3 pools in total 1 for children 1 for adults only with a poolside bar and a larger 1 for entertainment.  If you’re looking at a holiday to Marrakesh and Palmerie in particular you need to look no further than this hotel.  Overall - Outstanding!!!!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Selina F wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Short trip,Myself and three friends have just returned from a short four night break from this hotel and I have to say I really cant fault the hotel and staff.  First night we arrived late after a flight delay and were able to go and get some food from the restaurant first and then were shown to our rooms which are spotless as is whole hotel with beautiful gardens.  The staff really can’t do enough for you and nothing is too much trouble. There aren’t any tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms but when the manager Iman came around asking how we were finding our stay my friend asked him could we have a kettle. He said we don’t have kettles in the rooms we are looking into getting some next year but I will see if there’s one spare. Sure enough when we got back to the room we had a kettle tea bags sugar and he even sent up a carton of milk. It’s these little touches that make your holiday so thank you Iman for that.  We attended the manager’s cocktail party where you could have cocktails sparkling wine and o’dourves which was lovely.  The food here is tasty and plentiful. Lots to choose from I particularly enjoyed the Moroccan food in the main restaurant but didn’t try the Moroccan restaurant. One night they had sushi which was delicious.  The only thing I would’ve liked is some sparkling wine cava or prosseco behind the bar even if it were possible to purchase a bottle I would’ve been more than happy to do that. The bar staff are very pleasant especially Mohammed and Zakariya. In fact all the staff are very pleasant.  All in all it was a very enjoyable few days and I would definitely recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2018,,"Widnes, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3selinaf
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mayonews wrote a review Jun 2018,50,A jewel in Marrakech,We were a party of 10 - a mixed group of adults teenagers and children and without exception had a fantastic holiday at Iberostar Club Palmerie Marrakech.  The hotel is very well run with management very visible and available at all hours of the day and night. When we were there the Iberostar owners were on a visit and all staff were nervous and on edge - I don't know why... as a guest I can't imagine that hotel got anything other than a glowing review.  This is an older hotel given a facelift in recent years and rebranded as an Iberostar Hotel. The rooms are spacious and fresh with comfortable beds and good quality showers - air-conditioning was effective and we had a small balcony with a clothes drier - perfect even though we spent so little time in the room.  Food was excellent - lots of choice and very well presented. The desserts are to die for...I am now at home trying to loose the 5lbs I gained on holiday!!! The dining room is light and airy and the outside terrace was lovely for lunch. The food truck serves up snacks and drinks throughout the day while I didn't partake I heard the burgers were excellent. I loved the tagines and the bbq at lunch time was great.  We had an 18th birthday and the manager organised a cake for our birthday girl - thanks for the big fuss you made of her - we appreciated it - even if she didn't!  There are lots of facilities on site - we enjoyed bowels tennis badminton spinning football...you name it they had it. The entertainment team were great and tried to engage all the holiday makers in fun activities. Their good humour was infectious. We enjoyed a number of night time parties - the white night being the best but all we enjoyable and the effort was evident. It was easy to get served in the bar and the mohitos were great.  All in all we had a great stay and would love to return to this hotel - well done to all the friendly staff and management and thanks for a lovely holiday.,Date of stay: June 2018,,Ireland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayonews

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Hengistpod wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Overwhelmingly Impressive Hotel,Iberostar review    I have just spent a week at this hotel with my family and friends. It was a delightful experience throughout and each day I became more aware of the consistent quality of care comfort and service being provided. These are some of my observations:    1. The staff are amazing. From the super-enthusiastic entertainment team to the dining room staff pool staff cleaners kitchen & bar staff & everyone else that makes this vast hotel tick along so smoothly. Without exception staff were smiley kind helpful friendly and fun. They work very hard and are super efficient in their tasks. Abdou in the bar really stood out as did Mehdi in the entertainment team. Both really took a genuine care of the guests with Mehdi spending time chatting to them including people who were alone. He is clearly a very kind and special young man. A lot of the staff were fasting for Ramadan. I was staggered by their ability and commitment to provide such exceptional service in the heat - real professionals!   2. The hotel is huge with 3 x pools great facilities for kids of all ages a golf course tennis & badminton courts archery french bowls trapeze etc. It is set in huge beautifully manicured and lush tropical gardens.  3. A very high standard of cleanliness & comfort is maintained throughout. The bedrooms are simply decorated but very spacious and comfortable and cleaned daily. Indoors there are lots of comfortable lounge areas in which to drink mingle or read. Outside there are lots of seated areas around the gardens bars & pools. There is never a shortage even with the pool sun beds.  4. The entertainment is superb. The star team do a good job of keeping up spirits around the pool during the day and getting people involved in games & competitions. At night there is a show or party. Some of these (particularly the ones led by the incredible Alexi and the professional dance team) were exceptional. Some are a little dated/cheesy but all are entertaining and demonstrate how multi talented some of the staff are.   5. The food is truly wonderful - masses of choice including delicious Moroccan food amazing salads international food (pasta/pizza/grills/roasts). Some nights we had crayfish big shelled prawns sushi... There is lots of fruit pastries and stunning breads. And the deserts are incredible. All food is fresh clean tasty and made with extreme care & skill. And it is presented with flair and beauty (ornately carved beetroots etc). You get one night at the on-site Moroccan restaurant where there is no menu - the 4 x courses just turn up and you enjoy them whilst listening to authentic Berber musicians. This was a lovely experience which the kids really enjoyed.  6. The wine and all inclusive drinks & cocktails are of great quality. There is lots of choice and always a smile at the bar. The coffee from the machines is sublime.  7. This hotel exceeds your expectations in many ways particularly when you can get some great value deals to stay here. In no way did this vacation feel like a economy/value deal. It felt luxurious and decadent and a really indulgent treat in a tropical paradise. One night we had a white party around the zen pool. The entertainment and atmosphere was electric. The fizz came out and it honestly felt like a posh party in Ibiza. Another night we had rose petals on our bedding and towels carved into swans. On our last night there was a managers cocktail party with fizz and canapes.  8. Everything described above is underpinned by some exceptional management which is visible from the moment you arrive. All the managers we encountered were friendly and keen to resolve any concerns or problems. There is a very strong management presence which is impressive reassuring and clearly oversees the impressive range of facilities/services/activities (always punctual) that make up the day. There is an operational manager (young Italian fella who looks like Patrick Swayze/Matt Damon) whose presence attitude leadership and dedication was STAGGERING. This man (I think his name is Jolan) was present at every meal and activity from the moment you woke up to the moment you went to bed. It was like he had been cloned 10 times and distributed around the grounds. Wherever he was he was calmly overseeing activities chatting with guests practically assisting with problems and guiding/encouraging the staff. I spoke to him on a few occasions and was genuinely overwhelmed by his attitude - speaking to me with so much respect and gratitude and making me feel so valued. I am worried than Jolan works too hard. He should occasionally sit down and have a cup of tea!    This hotel is special. It should be a flagship model. It has got everything bang-on and I will be surprised if I ever stay anywhere as impressive as this again.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hengistpod
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Charlie0409 wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Wow!!! Just wow!!!!,First of all the reviews on here do not do the hotel nor that staff justice. Myself my husband and 12 year old son have just returned from a weeks half term break here and we were very upset to leave. We have visited Egypt on a number of occasions and the standards have been so high we have always struggled to find any where that compares that was until now. Where to start?    Staff: From the cleaners the grounds men the waiting staff animation team reception bar staff to management everyone took time to speak and get to know you. Everyone was so polite and could not do enough for you. The bar men got to know us pretty well and soon as we sat down at the terrace bar our drinks were there. The cleaners did an exceptional job cleaning our room on a daily basis complete with rose petals and towel art. Reception staff were so friendly even printing our boarding cards for us. Management walked around the hotel from dawn to dusk and always said hello and made sure everything was good for us.    Room: We stayed in 1173 and the location was perfect. A very large double bed a day bed which was ample enough for our teenager. A very large bathroom plenty of storage and a fridge that had been stocked with water beer and soft drinks for our stay. Our location was perfect and caught the afternoon sun. Room was always spotless. One day our hair dryer would not work and the plug in the sink was broke. Within an hour of informing reception a new plug was fitted and a new hair dryer installed.    Food: Never before have we been to an all inclusive resort and had king prawns lobster sushi and fresh oysters!! We never went hungry and our son who is a fussy eater has eaten the most he ever has on holiday. The quality of the food is out of this world and hats off to the chefs.    Location: This is the only draw back for us as it is in the middle of no where and there are no shops to walk to. There are tours you can do but if you like a wander then this is not the hotel for you. I would suggest however with there being plenty of open space in the grounds maybe twice a week have local stall holders set up for evening shopping. This would be a big bonus.    There is so much more I could say but it just won’t do the hotel justice. A big thank you to all staff and management for making us feel part of the family and making our stay so special in fact we are looking to come back soon.    Top tip: Don’t think about booking this hotel just do it.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ordsall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlie0409
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,hbnmdm wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Excellent!,We had an excellent weeks stay at the Iberostar with our 7 and 3 year old. As  other reviewers have said the hotel is very very clean. The staff are a credit to the hotel they never stop sweeping wiping and tidying. The gardens are very well maintained and watered and look and smell great.    Our room had 4 single beds and was basic but again clean and had all we needed. The hairdryer was one of the better ones I’ve had in a hotel abroad too. The balcony’s are small they barely fit a table and chairs but to be honest this wasn’t an issue for us.    The food was tasty varied and well presented. We didn’t try the Moroccan restaurant and stuck to the main one due to the kids. The outside seating is lovely and again everything is spotless. There was a lady on standby with a sweeping brush constantly removing anything dropped on the floor she was even sweeping under people’s feet in her effort to do her job!    The pools are amazing. The children’s is one of the better pools we have found abroad in size. There was no issue ever with securing a bed. There are so many! The large pool is also huge. We were there first week of June and it was a good temperature not too chilly at all. There are lifeguards on duty which is also great.    The staff are a credit to the hotel. When the wind took some of the parasols and sent them spinning over beds toward the pool the holiday makers were running for cover and the gardener literally threw himself at one to prevent people being hurt. The entertainment crew are great too there is something happening all day. The evening shows were impressive the staff are very talented. My only gripe was the children’s entertainment was very poor and none of the kids wanted to join in because of this. The music in between the children’s and main show was so much more upbeat and all the kids were up on stage dancing to that instead!    Drinks menu isn’t huge but there is a good selection and the wine is decent.    We used the free transport to the city and enjoyed a morning sightseeing.    Management are always visible always talking to guests and checking satisfaction. Our taxi to the airport (booked with our travel agent not the hotel) was very late and one of the managers spotted we were waiting and rang them on our behalf.    I definitely recommend this hotel for families or for couples. There is so much to do here bowls table tennis trapeze gym spa spinning tennis courts football courts and even a little petting zoos. The zen pool means if you don’t want to be harassed by noisy children you won’t be.    GO!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Linz J wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Relaxing holiday,Visited for a week in May we needed a holiday to recharge after a stressful few months at work. This hotel fitted the bill perfectly. We spent everyday lying around the zen pool which was soo peaceful. If more entertainment us your thing then the main pool was full of activities. This hotel really does cater for all holiday types. Staff were friendly and not pushy at all if you didn't want to get too involved.  Food was plentiful for all meals with various options to keep most people happy.  This hotel was exactly what we needed and we left feeling very relaxed.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235linzj

The hotel has evening entertainment for adults and children and there is food for everyone. If you need anything the staff are very helpful. The hotel has also got a Kids Club and they do different things from 9hrs in the morning until 17hrs in the evening. The kids can even visit a mini-zoo in the hotel and try the trapeze. Special thanks to Aisha in the Kids Club and the animation team- you did a great job and made us feel very welcome in Marrakesh!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,xxst4ciexx wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Fab mini break,The hotel overall is at least a 4 star the staff are very friendly and can't do enough to ensure your holiday is perfect.  The food is plentiful and lots of choice including Moroccan dishes salad pizza/pasta and meats and lots of different deserts including fresh crepes and fruit. Only slight gripe is that it's not particularly hot which may not be an issue for most people but we like it hot. Soft drinks are branded and on tap for you to get as many as you like as is wine and beer. Please be aware English isn't an overall commonly spoken language here the reception staff managers and entertainment staff all speak good English but other members of staff not so well the entertainment is mostly in French.    The cocktails are the best I've ever tasted from an all inclusive and much better than the pre mixed drinks your usually served. The choice available is also the best I've ever seen from an all inclusive (this from a picky non wine/beer drinker)  There are lots of nice little touches such as bringing round fresh fruit on sticks to eat while round the pool. They had a cocktail evening where all the guests were invited to present some staff awards. You can get bottled water from all the bars also which was really good.    The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the staff are constantly cleaning and tidying. There are two pools one more lively with games and music and one more quiet with adults only. Wi-Fi is the best I've ever known it is free and available throughout the hotel including in the rooms which was a big positive as its very expensive to use your phone here. There is lots of sunbeds (which are actually very comfortable and very sturdy) and also beach towels available.    The rooms are spacious and again very clean with aircon a tv mini bar and hair dryer. Lots of wardrobe space but few hangers so might need to bring a few if your bringing clothes that may crease. Only issue with the rooms is the cleaning staff take your towels if you want them changing in the morning (quite early) then come later to clean the rooms and bring back your fresh towels later just seams a little odd. The cleaning team did an amazing job cleaning everyday and even made your pajammas into pretty designs and left chocolates on your pillow. Check out was at 12 but we were getting picked up at 17.45 they provided us with a nice clean room to shower in and there was a room to store luggage we also got to keep our all inclusive bands until the end which was really good.    We went to the gym a few times to say there was always someone in there it left a little to be desired the machines are outdated and not in great repair it has great potential but needs more equipment and better machines and also a water fountain.    We took the shuttle bus into Marrakech which was available at regular times and took about 20 mins we probably should have done our research and checked where we were being dropped off as it felt like we were dropped in the middle of no where with lots of men hanging around to try and get us to use their taxis or the be our 'guides'. After riasing this we were shown the map to show people where they will be dropped off and which way to head to depending on what they want to see please ask for this at reception.    I would definatly advise people to visit this hotel everything is very well organised and very clean. We didn't use any of the facilities available for kids but they looked very good and the entertainment team were very good with them. The guest relations manager Imad was extremely helpful and asked honestly on regular occasions if everything was ok he dealt with issues straight away you can tell he ran a tight ship!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bratislava, Slovakia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxst4ciexx
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,stephaniejaine wrote a review Jun 2018,50,"great stay, great value!!",We have just arrived back from a great week at the Iberostar. We arranged airport pick up with the hotel which was on time and very efficient. We were then checked in very easily and quickly then shown to our room which was a good size including a very big bathroom. The hotel itself is very modern clean and well looked after by the staff.    The food was great with lots of choice each day at all meal times. For breakfast there were lots of pastries cereals meats cheese eggs bacon and sausages (not the english type). Then for lunch/dinner we enjoyed the pasta dishes salads grilled meats especially the BBQ chicken rice dishes and the pizzas were so good. We also enjoyed all the different cocktails and the moroccan tea.    The pools were great just a little cold when cloudy at the beginning of the week. We didn't struggle to find a sun bed at all throughout our stay which was perfect as we could relax no matter what time of the day it was. During our stay we tried the trapeze which was an amazing experience although terrifying at the same time. A great asset to the hotel.    We used the hotel bus to visit the medina which was just a short ride then about a 10/15 minute simple walk to the square. We also booked a trip through the hotel staff to Zagora where we camped 1 night in the desert saw both sunset/sunrise and the amazing atlas mountains. A great trip if you enjoy travel.    Overall we had a great time in Marrakesh better than expected and it came to a great end at the white party Saturday night where the entertainment was at its best with dancing fire dancers trapeze and music. Thank you to all the staff who were helpful friendly and hardworking and a special thank you to all those who were fasting for ramadan as they did amazing job in such heat and hard conditions which i can't imagine.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,sxldy88 wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Iberostor,have only been home 1 day already missing the hotel.  The check in literally took around 20 minutes as you have forms to fill out and as we had 4 children with us a lot of writing. But you are givin refreshments etc once checked in we were shown our room we had a interconnecting family room number 2003 it was very clean had a fridge with water in etc.  There are 3 pools as we had our kids we mainly stayed in the kids splash pool area which was always so clean as was the whole of the hotel!! Kids enjoyed the splash pool never got bored. The bigger pool although we used it we had a 6 month old water was just too cold for him to use it. Could do with being heated to take the chill off a bit. The adult pool looked lovely peaceful but we couldn’t use it as had kids but for people travelling with our kids looks lovely. There is a food truck that serves burgers and hot dogs throughout the day would of been nice to maybe serve chips as well ?? The staff were always so friendly and smileing. The whole team from the garden people up to the manager all so welcoming and friendly nothing was too much trouble. Meal times were fine plenty to choose from even a fussy eater will find a few things to thier fancy. The entertainment was good only issue is lot of stairs few times we were stranded waiting for one off the staff to help with buggy up the stairs.  There is a photographer that walks around the hotel taking pictures. Which came as a shock when my son said that a man had takin my daughter of got photos lol. He managed to get some great photos of us all of our holiday which was a nice added extra.  There was always a lot of entertainment going on st main pool I think sometimes the entertainment team should go to the kids pool and try get the kids involved a little more.  There was a shop but I never saw it open ?  We caught the shuttle bus into the city to visit the square which is a must to experience Marrakesh. The shuttle drops you 15 min walk from square so be prepared we choose to get taxis as with 4 young children was easier to get dropped right outside.  Outside the hotel there is always taxis parked if need go anywhere. The hotel grounds are so well kept when you look outside the hotel you realise how hard they work to keep the gardens there was a lot of sport activity’s to do good for a couple. Our room was always cleaned such trustworthy cleaners as well . I really enjoyed my self here would def come back already plAnning next break fantastic staff!!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sxldy88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,farmellino wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Good value for money,The hotel was in a lovely manicured garden setting with 3 pools; one for adults with the Zen bar nearby one larger main pool and one for children. We opted for the adult pool where there were always plenty of sunbeds (we went in late May) so no need to get up extra early! We found tipping the staff made them much more attentive such as the barman around the pool bringing us drinks instead of having to queue up at the bar. Our twin room was always cleaned daily to a very good standard and the beds were a good single size and comfortable. Although one morning whilst we were sleeping the maid came in and took all our towels so be sure to put the 'do not disturb' sign out!  The food was good but we found that from lunch to dinner the dishes were mainly the same so we did get a little bored of it towards the end of the week. Not all dishes were clearly labelled which was a shame as it stopped us from trying things. We booked the Moroccan restaurant one night expecting it to be more authentic than the main eatery. It was quite chaotic unorganised and reminded me of Fawlty Towers! The food was sub-standard here and other guests left after one or two courses. Eventually the assistant manager came in to help but when he came to our table with the wine he completely forgot to serve me any! So unless it drastically improves stick to the main restaurant!  All in all my party had a very enjoyable stay although the evening entertainment was a bit hit and miss but it did add to our amusement.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cleator, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farmellino

When we arrived at the hotel at about 10.15am.. reception gave us our all inclusive wrist bands took our luggage and sent us straight to breakfast as it was about to close...which was really thoughtful as been up since 1.30am!!!  We came back to reception after to be told we could check in in about an hour... which would of been fine if that was the case..... we had a really helpful tour of the hotel which was lovely as we then knew where everything was... and times of everything. We then returned to reception to fill more forms and was told 10 mins and our room would be ready... 30 mins later it still wasn't ready.... I would of rather of been told that it wouldnt be ready till 3pm... we could of then enjoyed the hotel and came back instead of being made to sit in reception and wait. This was my only negative of the whole week!!    Rooms: clean.. fresh towels every day!! Beds comfy... bathroom lovely.    Swimming pool area: love that there are 3 types of pool... the every day use pool l the Zen pool for peace and quite and the kids pool... all areas clean and tidy!    Staff: very friendly welcoming.    Entertainment: poolside entertainment was really good with a variety of things to do.  Evening entertainment was interesting!!!    Restaurant: variety of food... absolutely amazing. Never had a bad meal from main restaurant    Moroccan restaurant: was not massively impressed with this and would rather eat in the main restaurant... service was slow took 20 mins to get a drink and that we had to ask 3 times for... food wasn't that great.. the Moroccan food in main restaurant was better.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,FindingNemo76 wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Mixed review but mostly good!,Visited this hotel with my husband during the last week of May. After a horrendous experience in Marrakech airport customs control we were delighted to be able to have early check in into our room.    On first impression the hotel reception is impressive and the reception staff are friendly. After getting information about the hotel we went to our room.    We had booked a double but got two twin beds pushed together. I’ve come across this before but usually the bedding is made up as a double bed - our beds were made up as individual but pushed together. We also booked a pool view room but we could only see a sliver of it due to the view being obscured by a tree by the restaurant. Because we hadn’t paid much for the room and weren’t planning on being in it too much we didn’t ask to change but if you want an unblocked view if the pool just be wary.    We only ate in the buffet restaurant for dinner and breakfast. There was always plenty of food catering for those with adventurous palettes and those who like their food simple. We had to get our own drinks the first night but for the rest of our stay we had table service.    We used the Zen pool as preferred to be in a quiet area and away from children. There are plenty of sun beds - best beds for sun during our stay were on the short ends of the pool! The bar is self serve for coffee and you have to go up yourself to get drinks although the bar man would get drinks for some people and bring it to their sun beds.    All in all this was a good hotel. Just a few minor points that I would change but otherwise we had a good time.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FindingNemo76

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,clarri wrote a review May 2018,50,Just Wow...,"So I think I used that phrase a few times a day! ""just wow"".  I'm not sure there is much I can add to all the fabulous reviews but here goes.  We arrived quite late (after our transfer driver got lost but that's for another review which has nothing to do with Iberostar Club Palmeraie). We made it to the dining room ten mins before they closed but we were told they would have done us a cold plate anyway.  We got a garden view room which was just gorgeous. We awoke on our first morning to the most amazing birdsong which I never tired of.  The food is indescribable. Its just fabulous. My only teeny tiny gripe was they had no normal butter at breakfast but that was easily solved by taking a few at lunch each day & remembering to bring it down. The array of choices is just astounding. How they manage it so well I just don't know. No one could complain that there wasn't anything to suit their culinary desires. Wines were very good as were the cocktails gin & tonics etc although my partner reckons the bar men need a lesson in beer pouring!!    We spent most days at the zen (adult only) pool doing one day by the main pool. I'm not into the whole animation join in thing but if you are they are brilliant working tirelessly smiling friendly etc. I do agree with someone who said their shows are a bit tired.. We went to one & weren't over impressed but they worked so hard so I would guess its up to the hotel to let them change it.    The staff were great. Shout out to Salah who went out of his way with poolside attending. Also I can't remember his name but one of the life guards really looked after me when he realised I had back problems & gave me a soft cushion.    So my few little complaints -  The water bottles. The amount of plastic made me cringe... Especially as they highlighted about straws on the bars (then proceeded to put 2 on one drink). How about water stations & reusable bottles??  Next. The rooms were SPOTLESS.. but 3 mornings at between 9 & 9.30 the cleaner tapped & walked straight in to collect the towels luckily didn't catch either of us naked but it could have happened. Also took towels regardless of whether we hung them or not so again even though they have a sign saying about saving water it didn't matter.  Lastly. Oh dear. Why are the female members of staff all so miserable & quite frankly unfriendly?? From the reception to the afternoon bar lady to the dining area. No matter how much I smiled said thank you etc nope... They weren't rude just seemed really miserable.    I had a hammam & massage. Best massage ever. Not the cheapest but worth the treat.    We were both truly sad to leave & both of us want to return.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Laurie H wrote a review May 2018,50,I miss it so much!,The staff and services here are an absolute complete credit to this hotel!    I am in awe of all the lovely people who work there and miss them all. The hotel is amazing the best I’ve stayed in the grounds are beautiful the flowers and the trees are the perfect Instagram backdrop! The rooms are just what you need shower was perfect after a day at the pool.    There are 3 pools one kids pool the main pool and a zen pool. We spent most our time at the zen pool as we wanted to chill for the most part. This was a beautiful area with a bar on hand bar man was lovely and very friendly. There’s also a guy there I’m not sure if he’s a lifeguard but we called him the Zen patrol he’s there to help with umbrellas and he tidys up too. We call him the zen patrol because the zen pool isn’t allowed kids inflatables and you can’t be too loud and it’s very Zen to say the least and this poor guy had the worst job of kicking people out and telling them to shush he got a lot of stick while we were there and we felt bad for him. However he is lovely and was always happy to see us and made us feel welcome.    The food was fantastic and the chefs were great I’m a massive pizza fan and the pizza is DELISH! So fresh and tasty I had it every day. Also lots and lots of choice from seafood to meatballs there was always something for you to eat.    We didn’t really do the entertainment side of things we chilled in the outside bar area playing cards and listening to our favourite singer with the keyboard who we looked forward to every night. The bar staff were amazing and one guy who was a waiter I think his name was Mohamed but don’t quote me on it did something extra special we left our cards one night and when we went to bring them down we were gutted that we’d lost them he had picked them up and kept them safe for us and went and got them for us from wherever he had kept them it seems like nothing but he didn’t have to do that and that’s just a little extra mile that really made our day so thank you Mohamed!    Also special thanks to the bar staff who were on the whole 10 nights we were there always making sure our drinks were full and making us smile service you won’t find anywhere else especially in the U.K.    The entertainment team were very friendly and we had the pleasure of Ayoub’s company who was there for 15 days and we were there for 10. He was adorable and was always so nice to talk to he was our favourite.  We also spent a night playing cards with Aziz who was a laugh and he spent his night off with us learning new games and chatting to us he was a fabulous entertainer and worked very hard all day everyday.    I can’t tell you how much I miss this place and I wish I was there right now it was perfect. Until next time!

Kids Club was fantastic food amazing entertainment brilliant and the facilities very clean.    We arrived late on a Sunday evening and the staff immediately brought us into the restaurant for dinner before we checked in. We found the staff very friendly and helpful at all times. Our little girl had an amazing time at the kids club and was looked after exceptionally by Flores Aihcia and Fatima. Every morning after breakfast she couldn't wait to get to the club to play with her friends and loved the animation girls. They had great fun all morning and were then taken for lunch (if they wanted) with all the rest of the kids. The fun continued after lunch too. She loved the kids disco at night time as well.    The food was excellent at the hotel as well. One of the things I was worried about was the possibility of it being repetitive but it was anything but. Every night there was an area with different cuisine Sushi Fish Moroccan. There was always Moroccan food :-)    We had such a great time.

Advertised as a 4 star hotel and I genuinely would say it’s not far off a 5 star. The staff were absolutely amazing!!  Mehdi who was part of the entertainment team was a brilliant character. Knew when to leave you alone and when to have a chat etc..  All bar staff extremely attentive.. I hadn’t finished my drink and they had already put a fresh one down.. Mohamed being the best one fetching us olives nuts breads and cheeses. Excellent service.  To be honest the staff make that place what it is!  Room was spacious and clean fresh towels every day cleaner even tidied our clothes etc again a superb service.  The single drawback was the night shows but the staff put such an effort in they need some serious training and up to date themes etc but you can’t blame them..and we still got stuck in and watched them.

Having a heated pool will make this place very attractive to come again  - the Moroccan restaurant was bit disappointing in fact the food in main restaurant buffet was much better .

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Rodders89 wrote a review May 2018,30,It was ok!!,At first we were pleased with the hotel.    There are six of us to adults for children and we have two rooms which were clean and well presented.    As stated in other reviews the pools are quite cold but refreshing.    Language barrier can be difficult with some of the staff but the ones do you understand English very helpful and pleasant .    Real disappointments.    After two days of being at the hotel at the children’s pool we Began to get the feeling if you had children  we were classed as a lower class guests.    We were not allowed to have the comfortable Sun loungers but we have been using them for the previous two days until the lifeguards decided that they need to be removed all of them from the children’s pool.    I didn’t find this acceptable and went and found the hotel manager which in the end he did sort it out.    Shortly after four lifeguards stood at the other end of the pool pointing and saying something towards us they were out of hear shot and I couldn’t quite make out what they were saying but it was very unprofessional.  Their whole behaviour was borderline intimidating.    After spending the day at the pool before we even left the sun loungers ( the children had stood up to dry their selfs)one of the rude arrogant lifeguards was packing up sun loungers before we even left.  Again unprofessional!!!    Also if you want a cocktail you have to go to the Zen bar or the main bar. At the zen bar you are questioned on what pool you are at depending on your answer depends on the quality of plastic cup you are given.    So my point is if you have children you can only lie on the uncomfortable plastic sun loungers because previous guests have broken the comfortable ones so therefore because you have Children you’re not able to be comfortable!!!    If you want to drink something more than Coke or beer then be prepared to drink as of cheap plastic cups.    We work hard to be able to take our family on holiday and do expect to be treated like any other all inclusive guest regardless wether we have children or not.  We can see that there has been hard work put into the hotel but have let yourselfs down massively and other things like stated above.    Staff with an attitude bordline trying to intimidate guests is surely not an image any hotel wants!!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Molly wrote a review May 2018,50,Lovely hotel with amazing staff,My boyfriend and I have just returned from an amazing week at the Iberostar. The food was great a couple of nights were average but some nights were just amazing with seafood such as lobster prawns and oysters. They also had sirloin steak a sushi night and amazing freshly made pizza for lunch and dinner. Also the deserts were amazing - mousses gooey meringues and macaroons. On our last night (Monday) they had cocktails and canapés by the pool and even some fizz! Was a great end to the week. The drinks were good - they had proper coffee at the main bar (thanks to the barman who always put lovely designs on my cappuccino). The cocktails that they had were great - mojitos and piña coladas - however the selection was limited the 'daiquiris' weren't very daiquiri like. The tap beer and the wine was very good. We spent our time at the quieter zen pool which was nice and relaxing and always had a lounger available. A huge thank you to Salah who looked after us amazingly at the pool and made our week so special. We never were without a drink and he even gave us bits of pineapple and nuts to snack on throughout the day. He always had a smile on his face and nothing was too much trouble - he is a massive credit to the hotel. The animation team were great we didn't get too involved with the activities in the day but thanks to Aziz who was always around with a big smile at meal times and always made sure to have a chat he was also great in the shows and everyone loved him! Also Mehdi - such a funny and genuine person we wish we got to speak to you earlier in the week we loved chatting with you! also a great performer in the shows with his backflips and breakdancing! The staff as a whole were just amazing and made such a wonderful hotel even better - probably the best staff I have ever come across there are just to many to mention!! But also a thanks to both Mohammed from animation and the Bar and Zyad from the bar.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbanana123

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Rowena61 wrote a review May 2018,50,"Brilliant time, sad to be home",I visited this hotel with a friend for 4 nights and we stayed in a pool room view.  The hotel is really lovely and very well kept the gardens are beautifully maintained and there are always people out tending to them.  The pool areas are lovely the main pool was a little chilly due to the time of year but we still got in as did lots of others. There is a smaller heated pool but we chose not to sit around that one as it was a bit more crowded. The kids pool looked amazing although we obviously didn't use it. There is a really nice play area and water slides too so if you're coming with children they wont be disappointed.  It's also really worth mentioning that there are no fights for sunbeds at all!!! Not even if you go out mid morning!  We had mixed weather with a bit of rain on a couple of days but the staff go out of their way to ensure that guests are happy at all times.  The room was really clean we never had to ask for anything to be changed or cleaned. The balconies are a little small but that was fine we didn't spend too much time sat on it.  The main buffet restaurant was very nice lots of choices and the salad bar was great we loved the harissa dressing that you could add. There were also chocolate fountains with fruit kebabs or you could have a crepe made. We did visit the a la carte restaurant but in all honesty we were happier eating in the buffet. The breakfasts were my favourite I have a sweet tooth and I'm already missing the donuts!  The hotel do offer cocktails and various different alcoholic drinks they're not the best I've ever had at an all inclusive but the rose wine was particularly nice so we stuck to that and the bar staff are certainly not mean with the amount they give you.  Every evening there was entertainment whether it be outside or in the function rooms due to the evening temperature. The animation team work really hard and very long hours to keep the guests happy. A special mention goes to Mehdi who we loved chatting to every day he did his best to get everyone involved in activities and worked really hard to make sure we had fun. He's a real credit to the hotel.  It's a predominently french speaking hotel so maybe brush up on your french before you go but we found we got by just fine.  Thanks for a lovely time Club Palmeraie we will definitely be back!,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Stockport, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rowena61
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Clare-Boris wrote a review May 2018,40,Great hotel at a fabulous price,This is our 3rd experience of staying in an Iberostar property and again we were very impressed.    The rooms were nice with a small balcony and large bathroom. We didn’t have a bath in our room just a rain shower which was extremely powerful. The bed was pretty comfortable too.    The grounds of the hotel are beautiful with manicured flower beds full of colour. You have the main pool which is large but not heated so it wasn’t busy. The snack wagon is located here. The food being served was fine if you wanted something quick.    The smaller heated pool which is still fairly big was much busier but never a problem getting sun loungers. There is a bar close by too managed by a woman who doesn’t smile very much!    The main restaurant is large and we were always looked after by a lovely lady (whose name escapes me). The choice of food on offer for breakfast lunch and dinner was plentiful and everything I selected was extremely tasty. How a previous review said the food choices were poor is beyond me. We didn’t try the traditional tagine restaurant as we had previously tried it in Agadir (Iberostar) and preferred the main dining experience.    The main bar was spacious with waiters that quickly got to know our drink orders (20 Dirham will get you table service). There was often a quiz or theme night scheduled which was good fun. The entertainment team are very friendly. We did spend a couple of nights in the main theatre watching the shows which was a bit cheesy and the room could do with a bit of TLC and a couple of times we went to the nightclub. This was very quiet which might have been due to the time of the season average age being over 60 or that the music was dreadful. But it meant you could get a late drink till 1am.    Used the spa facilities which both my friend and I found a little weird. You have to pay the day before plus it’s a bit of a hard sell. Treatments were fine but language barrier made it a tad awkward.    All in all a very chilled week marred only by the weather a couple of days and not being able to extend our rooms on the final day (unless we moved rooms which defeats the object).,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sutton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clare-Boris

Rooms were simple and clean no in-room coffee/tea making facilities etc. Service was exemplary. Saleh was great on the pool bar and there was a lovely man working in the restaurant whose name I've now forgotten. Food was of good quality and something for everyone. All inclusive was a great option and value for money with cocktail drinking Teenager and younger ones constantly looking for a juice/soda etc. The wine was very drinkable also!. The waffle/hotdog van was a hit. Trapeze was great. Never a shortage of beds even over Easter Weekend. Pool was heated enough for me to get in and I can take some persuading. Enjoyed a great massage in the Spa and husband and kids enjoyed Spin classes and volleyball. The grounds are mature and very well looked after. The Hotel celebrated their 1 year birthday whilst we there. Imagine it will continue to go from strength to strength.

The hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport not near the tonw center  It is a quite area.  It has lotas of facilities as 3 swiming pools 2 restaurants 2 bar 2 gyms disco club... it a big hotel  Massive garden with football pitch golf...  Loads of enterteiment.  Great variety of food / buffet included breakfast lunch and dinner    I would recommened the Morocco restaurant amazing food and music    The staff are really good. Cleaning all the time make sure you are happy. Really polite    The manager was really profesional with us. Welcome us the firts day  I had some questuons which he deal amazing with them. Example: the hotel has a iron service not irons in the rooms. I needed to rion a shirt for the firts night and he let me borrow 1 iron and the iron table for the day. Which I really appreciated.    We went to 2 excursions by Tomas Cook travel agent at the hotel.  One was a night out dinner and shows at the Riad Lotus Privelege. Everything was great only the location is a little bit weird in the middle of center of the city. A taxi will drop you and pick you up. It is safe.    The second one we went to visit the Palaces the Medina.. so good    We are so happy with the hotel everything was a excellent experience  Exploring a new culture new country and relaxing.  I forgot to meation the Spa was INCREDIBLE we had stone massage scrub ... really good price too.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,kist_10 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Perfect place to stay,Second time we visited this beautiful place. The gardens are so nice and well kept. Most of the guests are French and since Kappa club is present with some entertainers I have the feeling they are forgetting a bit about their other guests. Nobody met us at the reception and cared in a way some people write about. You feel a bit anonymous when you are not part of the big groups and families that are visiting the hotel. For us its's okay we do not have the need to be amused but a little more attention (especially for returning guests could and would be nice). Nevertheless we will return because a lot of things at this hotel are very nice. Restaurant bar rooms everyone is taking good care of you. It's possible to have a late check out but not easy to get one you have to arrange it early on the day of your arrival and until 11 its not sure if you have to check out of your room at 12 or can use the room until 3 or 6 o clock. This could be arranged a bit smoother. I suppose they know at what time guests will be arriving. The golf pro arranged for us to play a few times at the golfcourses near by which was very nice. Keep in mind that French is the most spoken language in this hotel and that not everybody speaks English so sometimes that's not easy. The Moroccan restaurant was nice but there were much more tables in the restaurant than the year before so you did not feel special and the atmosphere was different. We really recommend this hotel and hope that they will keep doing their utmost to improve also the small things that can be improved.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Boskoop, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kist_10
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,boo5 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Fab Hotel,From the moment I arrived I felt the staff really cared. I’d booked a quick solo break last minute & emailed the hotel asking for a ground floor room near reception due to walking issues. My room was perfect very close to the lobby with a fab view of the gardens. The room was cleaned well daily the only issue I had was the cleaner accidentally throw away my travel face cleanser but the head of housekeeping couldn’t have been more apologetic.    The weather was kind very cold & quite wet even for Marrakech apparently meaning most of the guests were inside the hotel during the day. The animation team were there arranging things to do I was never bored.  I got to know the bar staff who were lovely & kept me supplied with olives yum!! Always happy & nothing was too much trouble.  When I could sit outside by the quite pool I had lovely conversations with Bouchra she was lovely and keen to learn helpful phases in English which hopefully she will remember.    Most impressive was the dining I travel a lot & have stayed in AI’s over the years well I have never seen such a selection of wonderful food & would challenge anyone not to find something to eat at every meal!!  The staff were constantly clearing tables & refilling food stations.  My best meal was one evening walking in to the most amazing display of seafood wow (see photos).    I throughly enjoyed my stay & cant wait to return I’m hoping to book for early October (I don’t normally go back to the same place so quickly)    Thank you for the wonderful experience.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Beckenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boo5

The location was stunning - and a free shuttle bus into the city meant that we could pop into the city centre when we liked - so we had the best of both worlds.    The hotel was spotlessly clean - possibly one of the cleanest hotels I’ve stayed at.    The food was very tasty fresh well cooked and a huge variety to suit all tastes. We ate something different almost every day.    The staff were incredibly friendly helpful and attentive - every single person made us feel very well looked after.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,CALIFORNIA270711 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Lovely hotel with lovely staff,Had a delightful short break at the Palmeraie. The hotel has extensive grounds which are utilised well. The hotel is welcoming and the staff are in the main exceptional.  There is a main dining area and one additional Moroccan themed restaurant which in my opinion limits your food choices. The range of food offered in the main dining area is good and of good quality but the vegetarian options were limited. Although the chef is very happy to provide an alternative if requested. There was a large Asian family when we stayed and it appeared that their meals were specifically catered for. The few days we were there did become repetitive for food choices. There was one themed Moroccan night and I would suggest they offer at least two more themed nights each week to vary the dining options as there are no other restaurants to go to.  The animation team work tirelessly to entertain and there is a whole schedule of daytime activities to keep the most hyperactive child or adult busy. Each evening there is a short cabaret type show and a nightclub from 11pm-1am (we didn’t attend the club). There are kids clubs for all up to age 17 and a kiddie pool too. The hotel offers two pools - one heated and one not.  Rooms are very clean and fairly up to date decor wise. No kettle is provided but this can be requested. There is a mini bar however even though the hotel is all inclusive there is only on item in there which is complimentary. Ironing is only offered through the hotel laundry service with a charge attached. Bring your own travel iron if you like crease free clothing.  The spa looked inviting but it left a lot to be desired. It may be the Moroccan way but I felt it lacked the serenity of a spa as an escape from the stresses of life. This is in the main to do with the staff who are brusque. There is much that can be done to improve the customer experience and I wouldn’t go back there. The spa is not run by the hotel may I add.  There is an infirmary on the hotel grounds and we had an unfortunate need to use an outside doctor during our stay. They arrived quickly and offered medication and advice. Very happy with the service we received.  The hotel lay on a weekly cocktail and canapé reception which allows you to meet the staff and other guests. It was very well organised and guests are made to feel very special.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CALIFORNIA270711

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Ktgilbo wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Nice hotel with lots to do,We have just spent 5 nights here. The weather was hit and miss so we managed to try so activities we wouldn’t have otherwise. There are plenty of sporting activities to do during the day and the staff that ran them were really helpful. We really enjoyed archery and then did tennis and table tennis. When it was warm we sunbathed around the main pool because the adults only pool was full of children because it was heated and no one stopped the children from going there. There was plenty of food to choose from at each meal but the staff were unable to keep up with the change over of tables so when we went in at 9 for our evening meal there was rarely a table set and we would have to wait. There is also an al a carte restaurant that you can go to once in your stay. It is a set meal and you can choose fish or meal which you get for your main in a tagine. We really enjoyed this meal. The bar staff were really friendly and we never waited more than a couple of minutes to get served. By the end of our stay they were bringing drinks over to us and having them ready as soon as we got to the bar.    Pros  Very clean  Friendly staff  Plenty of food to choose from  Themed nights - casino in main bar cocktail party    Cons  Some days our room wasn’t cleaned until 6pm.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ReimR wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Great week in a fantastic hotel,This is a charming hotel that provides a perfect base for a relaxing holiday. We stayed here for 7 nights with our two children (14 and 11) and enjoyed a super holiday. The hotel is just as others have said. It's very good value spotlessly clean and the staff are very friendly clearly work very hard and are very efficient. (We had a problem with the flush on our loo when we returned to our room quite late in the evening. Having notified reception a plumber turned up within 5 minutes and he replaced the flush and made good within 15 minutes - very impressive). It also felt very very safe with lots of security.    I'm a coeliac which can make travel a bit more complicated. The staff were brilliant. On arrival the manager introduced me to the chef and waiters who were always on hand to talk me through the ingredients and even offered to buy me GF bread pasta and biscuits. As it was I had plenty to eat - loads of salads tagines and stews bbq meats and roasts and fish and fruits. (I think they said that they would soon have dedicated gluten free areas at the buffet).    Finally the entertainment staff were brilliant with my 11 year old who we barely saw. He loved Star friends kids club - the girls / boys worked so very hard and formed a real bond with all the kids. Special mention must go to Aicha and Fatima who were fantastic    In short a great hotel that we would thoroughly recommend and would have no hesitation in returning to at some point in the not-to-distant future (hopefully!). Thank you so much for a fabulous time. Hope to see you again.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,iamjonneeperez wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Fantastic Family Holiday,We just got back to England after a 7 day all inclusive holiday from Iberostar.    On arrival it was very welcoming and a beautiful hotel - especially for the deal we got.    The room was very clean and well kept. However no kettles and irons provided in the room. A little walk to the van bar or restaurant and all your needs would be met with a smile. Ironing service is provided at a fee - not a deal breaker but just be prepared for this maybe? Also a towel deposit is required but refunded at end of stay. The money refunded we just spent at the Medina market about half an hour from the hotel which the hotel provide a complementary bus service throughout the day.    The food was really good with a decent choice. Does get a bit repetitive but great efforts to offer different choices daily on all meals. An exceptional effort on presentation and really friendly waiting staff in the restaurant. Especially Mustapha - such a joy to have around.    Goes without saying that all the Star Friends are so hard working and friendly and make your stay so much more comfortable to make sure you are happy and get to know you and your family.    A great variety of activities on offer which you get invited to but able to join as you please. I wasn't prepared for a football game with guests and staff but it was fun. My body is still hurting haha and it was especially nice to see the Manager join in on the game too bonding with staff and guests. You will also have the opportunity to try things like trapeze and archery which was pretty cool to have at the hotel.    The park for the kids was a god send. Our 6 year old spent hours daily playing in the park and got to meet loads of new friends. We was very comfortable allowing him to just roam freely without worry. The Star Friends offer which I can only describe as a baby sitting service where they will ensure that your kids are safe fed and kept active while you enjoy some relax time.    The entertainment in the evenings were very good again with great efforts from all the staff after a long day working so hard to ensure all guests were happy. Be prepared to join in with some fun dancing - don't worry. Just make good use of the alcohol throughout the day and copy the dance moves. I was terrible but really good to see that the staff encourage you to participate.    I could go on and on. But if you are looking for somewhere nice safe and friendly to stay in Marrakech whether its to stay in one place or explore. Iberostar in my opinion would not disappoint and I am very hard to please.    I would also like to use this as an opportunity to thank everyone at the Iberostar for making our family holiday a very nice one and for making us feel very welcome.    We hope to see you again in the future. Very best wishes to you all.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Lindos14 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Lovely family holiday,We have just spent 15 nights at the Iberostar as a family of four with 4 & 6 year old kids.    Where to start we arrived off the later BA flight and didn’t get to the hotel until around 22.30 the gates to the hotel were locked and we had to be let it by the security guard he wouldn’t however let our minibus in and so we had to grab the kids our luggage and walk up the drive granted it’s not far but wasn’t what we were expecting. Unfortunately it didn’t get much better at check-in I had booked directly on the Iberostar website which I don’t think happens very often so the check-in staff constantly asked me for my ‘voucher’ when I said I don’t have a voucher this seemed to massively confuse them. We finally got our room keys and were off-handedly pointed in the direction of our rooms we got lost! When we found our rooms to say we were disappointed would be an understatement sparse is the best word to use. I decided to go and let reception know that I was unhappy and wanted to speak with a manager first thing in the morning. This is where things started to change for the better I was told the General Manager was still in his office and would see me. We had a conversation and I let him know my disappointment in the room etc. He immediately found another room for me to look at which I decided would be best done on a nights sleep and with my wife.    Next morning we had breakfast and I then went to see the other rooms and what a difference. It’s as if the rooms we initially had were In a different hotel that had been forgotten. The new rooms were bright airy and had all the finishing touches that you would expect. The GM then went over and above to make us feel welcome and comfortable and I would like to thank him for this.    We booked the interconnected rooms and they are brilliant for a family of four as it gives space while still being close to the kids.    You would think that from this start I am going to be writing a negative review but it’s going be balanced!!    The hotel grounds are fantastic clean and exceptionally well kept. There is a basket ball court tennis courts trapeze volleyball badminton pétanque and three swimming pools.  Now the pools they are nothing short of freezing! One of them is supposedly heated but not to much a warm level. I had the kids in wet suits but they still got blue lips and couldn’t stand the water for that long. The non-heated pools were just a no-go unless you wanted to use them as an ice bath after a run!!    Food - is a good quality and there is more than enough if it. I would have liked more variety after spending 15 nights at the hotel it got all a bit the same. Unlike many all-Inclusive hotels you only have the one place to eat and that makes it a very busy place to be.    I had seen comments on other reviews about not speaking French being an issue and have to say what utter rubbish. Most of the staff speak English and all you need to do is be polite with a Bonjour and Ca Va surely everyone is able to do this.    I want to make my final point about the Service. The service at the hotel is some of the best that I have ever had in hotels. A special thank you to Rachida Laila and Mohammed in the restaurant. They went over and above every single day to look after us and our kids.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindos14

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mkhan1978 wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Felt like I was visiting family....,Just back from the wonderful Iberostar and getting withdrawal symptoms. Journey from airport was hassle free booked transfer via holiday extra and taxi ride took 40 minutes.    On arrival was swiftly greeted by reception staff who sat us with fruit punch and took us through the booking process. Relations manager Imad came promptly to welcome us was very friendly and professional. We got to the hotel at 13:00 and check in officially is at 15:00 but our rooms were ready so we got in promptly. Rooms were clean fitted with TV a fridge and a safe no iron or hair dryer and no tea coffee facility.    Hotel grounds are beautiful  3 swimming pools 1 heated zen pool with bar the other splash pool shallow for all ages ice cold but good fun with slides etc and the main pool tranquil but mostly empty as it was cold in march.    Main restaurant is oasis which caters for all palates clean and buzzing with activities staff are very welcoming special mention for Mohammed mustapaha and laila who made us feel at home and looked after us as family members.    There is also a Moroccan restaurant jawahara you get one meal per room per stay free of cost it was a nice experience and a bit different.    Animation team are hard working all day around  our main contact was with the children’s club and they were a god send. After breakfast they will take kids off you  keep them entertained with arts and crafts visit to in house zoo different games and trapeze also take kids for snacks and lunch giving you kids free few hours everyday to lounge around undisturbed. Special mention to aichaflorence and fatima. They were so patient welcoming and professional that we felt comfortable in leaving our 4 and 7 year old in there capable and safe hands. Then in evening there is option for kids to have dinner in the main restaurant with other kids followed by mini disco which meant that kids were bonding with each other and loved the friendships they formed.    Bus to city center takes 35 minutes  you have to book ahead it is free of cost and drops you 10 min walk away from jamaa el Fanaa.    Wi-fi if available with good speed al over the hotel and grounds. Bars catered for variety of drinks and night time entertainment was pleasurable.    I have visited many hotels and all inclusive resorts the thing that stands out in Iberostar is there staff sense that staff are making an effort and trying to provide variety with pool side BBQ archery dance classes bowls tennis basketball volleyball to cater for all tastes and to top it all they do it with a warm smile.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Faisal S wrote a review Apr 2018,50,The best Hotel we have ever been to!!,I stayed at here for 4 nights in the middle of march with my wife and 19 month old son. From the minute we got there to the minute we left the hospitality and customer service were outstanding. We felt very welcome.    The grounds rooms and restaurants are in pristine condition. There are always friendly workers maintaining the hotel and they are the foundation to it being extremely clean.    The buffet was very good and had something for all of us (including my son)! My only recommendation would be to have more of a variety for desserts.    There are also many activities to do on the grounds; including sports theatre and lots of lovely areas to lounge about and relax. We also found the free shuttle bus service to the city centre very useful.    The rooms are very well maintained and comfortable. They were cleaned on a daily basis and are quite spacious.    In summary what sets this hotel apart from any other is the hospitality and exceptionally maintained grounds. From the cleaners chefs reception staff and everyone else there was a real positive vibe. We will definitely be returning in the near future.,Date of stay: April 2018,,"Carlton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/749faisals

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Aloubaker wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Lovely hotel, will definitely be back",Have just returned from 4 nights at the Iberostar Club Marrakech for a long weekend stay with my mum. Overall we had an amazing time and will definitely be back to stay at this hotel again.    Positives - staff are very friendly we had read some reviews about staff not being attentive enough or speaking good english which we found to be completely the opposite. Everyone we spoke to remembered our name and went out of their way to help us. Hotel is very clean and well kept entertainment each night is good drinks included within the inclusive package are fine with a big choice of cocktails included. Food was lovely a wide selection of all sorts we never got bored.The manager in particular was lovely and on our first day when we arrived before check in time he came and introduced himself to us and made a call to reception to get the room ready early.    Rooms for improvement (if picking at straws) - when we arrived we were not informed of the towel deposit situation we had to ask another guest who told us that we needed to first go to reception and pay 100 dirham per person to collect a towel card then walk to the side of the zen pool to collect the towels. A key thing we were not explained when we paid our deposit was that not only do you need to return your towel card to get your money back but that you also need to keep the payment receipt if you lose this whilst your there then they wont give you your money back (even with your towel card returned). Luckily I found mine screwed up at the bottom of my bag! The shuttle in to the city drops you about 15 minutes from the center which we knew from reading reviews and talking to other guests the reception didn't actually tell us this or even make us aware when we checked in that the service was available. Had we not of paid a guide when we stepped off of the shuttle we would have had no clue on where to go - would help if the driver gave directions when he drops you off. I understand that the roads are too narrow in the center for the bus to drop you off in the middle but there is definitely the space to drive closer to the main square than they do. I did overhear another guest one day at reception request a map of the city they also asked the manager to draw the walking directions - this should be given to you when you book the shuttle. The wall lights in our room didn't switch off during our whole stay we tried every switch without luck. This wasn't a massive issue for us and we didn't notify reception (we just removed the room card from the wall which turns off the electric at night as it wasn't hot enough to need air conditioning) in the height of the summer this could have been an issue. Lastly the welcome pack received when we checked in with the bar/restaurant serving times etc was written in french only so we had to guess the timings - but this was no biggy.    Overall we had a lovely time for the price that we paid against the food/drink and service we received we were very pleasantly surprised and are looking forward to going back again!,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,Essex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aloubaker

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Polecatcaz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Very impressive hotel,We had a lovely 4 days in Marrakech and wished we were staying longer.  This hotel is a great base for a combination of luxury/relaxing in a hotel and visiting Marrakech town - we used the shuttle bus daily (spot on time - don't be late!!) and it dropped you conveniently half way between the old and new town so perfect for exploring both - about 15 mins walk either way. It was then lovely to get back from the hustle and bustle to enjoy a welcoming beer/wine whilst relaxing by the amazing pool.  The staff here are brilliant and everyone is so happy and welcoming. (and I don't have a clue what other travellers wrote about French guests being preferred - we were treated the same as everyone else in a lovely welcoming manner)  The food is good for an All Inclusive and plenty of choices. I liked the fact that food was always being cooked freshly in front of you and the Moroccan dishes were lovely. The salads were great too - nice to have plenty of fruit and vegetables available.  My only negative comment would be the coffee that is served with breakfast from the machines - it's just average. I think it would elevate the breakfast offering to have filter coffee on the go over breakfast - we typically waited til 9:30am for our breakfast so we could via the main bar that has switched the espresso machine on by then for our morning coffees!  Basically this is a great hotel for a stay in Marrakech that gets you the best of both worlds of seeing the city but enjoying the luxury of a resort hotel in amazing grounds.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,John G wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Very nice but,We went for a few days winter sun and ended up having a city break as the sun was missing for the first few days.  Having read reviews we chose iberostar even though we always go 5 star.  The hotel was lovely but you only get one chance to make a first impression.  We went to our room to await our luggage and immediately noticed twin beds. We called reception and asked to be moved to a room with a double bed only to be told they had no double beds but would ask housekeeping to remake the bed as one.  While waiting I noticed my jacket that I had put down was covered in dust. The furniture was covered in builders dust I started looking further and found long hairs on the floor and then other bits of dirt became apparent the pubic hair on the bathroom floor was the last straw. I called reception and said I wanted someone to come and look at the state of the room. Having been told someone was coming immediately I waited for 15 minutes before going to reception and demanding someone return with me.  The lady who came with me was very apologetic and took photos of the issues and arranged for housekeeping to come and clean the room while we went for a walk around the hotel grounds for half an hour.  To be fair on our return the room was spotless but still no luggage so I went back to reception and collected my unattended suitcase myself.  Other than that the room remained spotless for the rest of our stay. The restaurant was clean with a good variety of food which was warm and well cooked. The local beer had a funny aftertaste but the house wine was very good.  Hotel staff spoke good English and were all helpful and friendly.  The spa is apparently not part of the hotel although within the building. Staff there were friendly and gave us a guided tour which all looked really nice until we came to book a treatment when we were told we couldn't charge it to our room we had to pay in full up front at time of reservation in cash.  We chose not to and went to a spa in town instead which was just as nice and was only 1/3 of the price.,Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Crowborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johngW8052CQ
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jojo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good hotel,We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.    Other comments and tips:  - we were told in the reception that there is no tables free for two nights (our last nights) in the ala carte restaurant. While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MimiM88 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,A family stay - positives and negatives,We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads.    Pros: we arrived a bit early just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean.    Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. I was disappointed that no staff said a word of discouragement. My daughter also accidentally left her Christmas gift from her dad - a new sweatshirt in the room. I called and emailed the hotel from the airport. The person who answered said they would look for it but we never received a response. The 2 emails I sent to the front desk (who had previously responded to my questions before the trip) went unanswered. Really disappointed in lack of a response when it likely easily could have been located. It would still be nice to hear from them.    The dining room feels like you are eating in a cafeteria.    I was disappointed with the overall service of this hotel. We would not choose to go back again nor recommend it to other families.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hanover, New Hampshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Wumz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings",I went with my friend spent 4 nights. All inclusive.  Greeted well by the staff although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable.  The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed.  The shuttle to town was very useful although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening.  The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we requested.  I guess for that time of the year it was a bit chilly we were often cold in the hotel and had to crank up the temp on the AC. In the summer this would be appreciated.  We attended the spa at the hotel which we understand are independent from them we felt we overpaid for the treatment and it was not what they said it would be. I wouldn't do the harman experience again - men were walking around and as a woman this was a very uncomfortable and anxiety provoking expeirence despite the staff trying to reassure me of privacy.  Overall a lovely trip. I would go there again.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wumz
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Catherine166 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside.    The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English.    The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. Housekeeping changed the towels daily and left towel designs on the bed which was very nice to come back and see.    We all commented on how nice the food was and the wide choice available but at times it could have been a little hotter but there are microwaves to help with this. I often chose to eat the Moroccan choice and loved it.    We spent time by the heated pool and this was warm and large enough to enjoy a swim. There were plenty of sun loungers after 10am. We paid a 100 Dirham deposit for towels.There is a bar closely situated to the heated pool and at times we did not even have to get off our sunbeds as the friendly bar lady came to us and even remembered our drinks.    Hotel entertainment was good in the bar areas in evenings but a little amateurish in the theatre in the later evenings. Plenty of different activities going on throughout the day for adults and children. Bar staff were always friendly and we had no complaints with the all inclusive drinks including wine in the restaurant on a help yourself basis.    All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend this hotel to families friends and couples.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine166
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mrcairo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good vacation with some issues.,"We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for 8 nights in February 2018. I'll start by saying we definitely had a pleasant relaxing stay and I would certainly recommend the hotel. That said there were some issues that could have take the stay from good to great.    Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at the food was not lots of fried unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar many vegetable dishes and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating as did the bar area. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet - some of my companions thought the beds were a bit overly firm but I thought they were great. There were lots of activities during the day - we played petanque and watched the people trying the trapeze out. The hotel and grounds were super clean and perfectly maintained.    Cons: The all-inclusive package only included local well alcohol - having it include name brands (like every other all-inc I've done) would have been a nice (and I daresay expected) option. The non-buffet restaurant (one meal there was included) was meh; the buffet was certainly preferable. The biggest issue we had was the service. While no one was by any means rude or unpleasant neither did we ever feel ""welcomed"" or that anyone was really going out of their way to make the stay more pleasant. In particular all our interactions with the front desk - checking in trying to get towels etc - were VERY challenging with several folks standing behind the desk talking to one another rather than helping. It also appeared to us that French speakers got much more engagement - table service in the bar just general attention.    In short - it was a very nice stay but fell short of what I would consider a 5-star stay.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrcairo
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,parsey2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.",We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain but this also means the place is not completely individual and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly. The idea of coming to a Moroccan 'holiday camp' styled as a British Butlin's with sun would definitely have put me off but I'm glad to say the place is much more sophisticated than that. Yes everyone eats at the same time in a 'grand buffet' and as such mealtimes are a little uncouth with folk wolfing down plate after plate and getting up and down more times than prices on the stock market but the food is very well presented and is of reasonable quality albeit clearly produced to a fairly tight budget.    For those that want to participate and many do there are lots of sporting facilities on site and participation is very easy to organise. We saw football tennis volleyball foot volleyball boules badminton spinning golf (hitting into a large net) archery and even a high trapeze for beginners! There are also 2 pools (as well as a kiddies paddling pool) but the larger pool is not heated and during the time we were there I only saw 2 hardy folk dare to enter. The smaller pool is heated (although by no means hot) but with it being quite a bit smaller felt a bit cramped.    The grounds are wonderfully kept and all you need is a sunny day (of which thankfully Morocco has an ample supply) and just taking a stroll around the venue can lift one's spirits. Palm and olive trees in abundance.    For those that don't want to spend to whole time on site the hotel run a free shuttle service into the city but this needs to be booked in advance and certain journey times can become unavailable when the hotel is full. And I felt the times offered were a little limited; starting at 9am and then 10am but I don't think there was another one until about 2pm. If I could find an area that the hotel is found wanting then I think they could put on a more frequent service. Having said that there are always taxis outside the gates of the hotel but of course they are not free!    But of all the aspects at this hotel that impress chief among them is the supreme attentive and warm hospitality from the staff. From the extremely charming and wonderfully slick hotel customer relationship manager to the friendly barmen and smiling housekeepers the place is filled with such polite people that it makes you forget and forgive any other misgivings you have about the hotel.    Moroccans cetainly know how to make you feel welcome. It's such a tragedy how Islamic culture is portrayed in European society because truly the Arabic hospitality we have experienced on 3 trips to Morocco now has been so warm and inviting. I always come away feeling I want to write to their King Hassan II to say how impressed I am with his country and his people. We always err when we stereotype a whole culture but of course Western tourists can't be blamed for having preconceived concepts of an Islamic society formed from the daily exposure to 24/7 news coverage and I admit the first time you step into what feels a very alien environment it is a bit of a culture shock but we really must open our eyes to this mature and highly sophisticated society and there we can find true gems. And if you are one of those Westerners that would still like a few homely creature comforts and perhaps a little apprehensive about taking a complete plunge into a venue that is a little removed from your typical European holiday destination then trying this hotel would certainly not disappoint.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parsey2018

Check-in was smooth hotel is clean and grounds prestine! Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up.    Very friendly entertainment team keep the clientele engaged massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays.    Lots to keep you active from stretching water aerobics tennis archery and spin. Nice gym too.    Not over crowded always had a sunbed heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay.    Food was excellent and plentiful caters well for vegetarians! Wouldnt bother booking the Moroccon as the main restaurant beats the Moroccon hands down wider selection of tagines- . I did miss the filtered coffee at breakfast and there is no waiter service throughout the restaurant/bar/pool - you have to go up and get your own drinks (this is me being pesismistic).    Hotel offers free shuttle service to the square which is approx. 20 mins away would recommend a visit in the evening (after 7pm) when the square awakes. The resort itself is secluded and nothing outside.    Approx 30 minute journey from the airport - would recommend booking with marrakechairporttransfer.com ( very competitive and great service!)    We did a day at the atlas mountains which was a great experience - recommend booking through Tripadvisor/Viator (again very competitive with a fantastic tour guide)    I will be leaving a separate review on our Atlas mountain experience on Tripadvisor.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michael S wrote a review Feb 2018,20,So Many Problems,I stayed here for a week and had a terrible stay. My room door did not lock but did shut.  We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived.  The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying.  The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive. Im shocked there are so many good reviews on this hotel we were very disappointed.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsX8511KG
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jojo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good hotel,We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.    Other comments and tips:  - we were told in the reception that there is no tables free for two nights (our last nights) in the ala carte restaurant. While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.

We did a day at the atlas mountains which was a great experience - recommend booking through Tripadvisor/Viator (again very competitive with a fantastic tour guide)    I will be leaving a separate review on our Atlas mountain experience on Tripadvisor.    All in all a great resort giving great value for money!!,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myopinionbk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michael S wrote a review Feb 2018,20,So Many Problems,I stayed here for a week and had a terrible stay. My room door did not lock but did shut.  We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived.  The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying.  The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive. Im shocked there are so many good reviews on this hotel we were very disappointed.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsX8511KG
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jojo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good hotel,We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.    Other comments and tips:  - we were told in the reception that there is no tables free for two nights (our last nights) in the ala carte restaurant. While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.  We had a wonderful time here and will be returning  as lovely as the setting was the biggest plus was the hotel staff- everyone from receptionto cleaners  waiters bar staff and the entertainment team were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MimiM88 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,A family stay - positives and negatives,We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads.    Pros: we arrived a bit early just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean.    Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. I was disappointed that no staff said a word of discouragement. My daughter also accidentally left her Christmas gift from her dad - a new sweatshirt in the room. I called and emailed the hotel from the airport. The person who answered said they would look for it but we never received a response. The 2 emails I sent to the front desk (who had previously responded to my questions before the trip) went unanswered. Really disappointed in lack of a response when it likely easily could have been located. It would still be nice to hear from them.    The dining room feels like you are eating in a cafeteria.    I was disappointed with the overall service of this hotel. We would not choose to go back again nor recommend it to other families.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hanover, New Hampshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Wumz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings",I went with my friend spent 4 nights. All inclusive.  Greeted well by the staff although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable.  The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed.  The shuttle to town was very useful although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening.  The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we requested.  I guess for that time of the year it was a bit chilly we were often cold in the hotel and had to crank up the temp on the AC. In the summer this would be appreciated.  We attended the spa at the hotel which we understand are independent from them we felt we overpaid for the treatment and it was not what they said it would be. I wouldn't do the harman experience again - men were walking around and as a woman this was a very uncomfortable and anxiety provoking expeirence despite the staff trying to reassure me of privacy.  Overall a lovely trip. I would go there again.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wumz
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Catherine166 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside.    The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English.    The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. Housekeeping changed the towels daily and left towel designs on the bed which was very nice to come back and see.    We all commented on how nice the food was and the wide choice available but at times it could have been a little hotter but there are microwaves to help with this. I often chose to eat the Moroccan choice and loved it.    We spent time by the heated pool and this was warm and large enough to enjoy a swim. There were plenty of sun loungers after 10am. We paid a 100 Dirham deposit for towels.There is a bar closely situated to the heated pool and at times we did not even have to get off our sunbeds as the friendly bar lady came to us and even remembered our drinks.    Hotel entertainment was good in the bar areas in evenings but a little amateurish in the theatre in the later evenings. Plenty of different activities going on throughout the day for adults and children. Bar staff were always friendly and we had no complaints with the all inclusive drinks including wine in the restaurant on a help yourself basis.    All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend this hotel to families friends and couples.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine166
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mrcairo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good vacation with some issues.,"We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for 8 nights in February 2018. I'll start by saying we definitely had a pleasant relaxing stay and I would certainly recommend the hotel. That said there were some issues that could have take the stay from good to great.    Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at the food was not lots of fried unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar many vegetable dishes and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating as did the bar area. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet - some of my companions thought the beds were a bit overly firm but I thought they were great. There were lots of activities during the day - we played petanque and watched the people trying the trapeze out. The hotel and grounds were super clean and perfectly maintained.    Cons: The all-inclusive package only included local well alcohol - having it include name brands (like every other all-inc I've done) would have been a nice (and I daresay expected) option. The non-buffet restaurant (one meal there was included) was meh; the buffet was certainly preferable. The biggest issue we had was the service. While no one was by any means rude or unpleasant neither did we ever feel ""welcomed"" or that anyone was really going out of their way to make the stay more pleasant. In particular all our interactions with the front desk - checking in trying to get towels etc - were VERY challenging with several folks standing behind the desk talking to one another rather than helping. It also appeared to us that French speakers got much more engagement - table service in the bar just general attention.    In short - it was a very nice stay but fell short of what I would consider a 5-star stay.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrcairo
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,parsey2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.",We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain but this also means the place is not completely individual and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly. The idea of coming to a Moroccan 'holiday camp' styled as a British Butlin's with sun would definitely have put me off but I'm glad to say the place is much more sophisticated than that. Yes everyone eats at the same time in a 'grand buffet' and as such mealtimes are a little uncouth with folk wolfing down plate after plate and getting up and down more times than prices on the stock market but the food is very well presented and is of reasonable quality albeit clearly produced to a fairly tight budget.    For those that want to participate and many do there are lots of sporting facilities on site and participation is very easy to organise. We saw football tennis volleyball foot volleyball boules badminton spinning golf (hitting into a large net) archery and even a high trapeze for beginners! There are also 2 pools (as well as a kiddies paddling pool) but the larger pool is not heated and during the time we were there I only saw 2 hardy folk dare to enter. The smaller pool is heated (although by no means hot) but with it being quite a bit smaller felt a bit cramped.    The grounds are wonderfully kept and all you need is a sunny day (of which thankfully Morocco has an ample supply) and just taking a stroll around the venue can lift one's spirits. Palm and olive trees in abundance.    For those that don't want to spend to whole time on site the hotel run a free shuttle service into the city but this needs to be booked in advance and certain journey times can become unavailable when the hotel is full. And I felt the times offered were a little limited; starting at 9am and then 10am but I don't think there was another one until about 2pm. If I could find an area that the hotel is found wanting then I think they could put on a more frequent service. Having said that there are always taxis outside the gates of the hotel but of course they are not free!    But of all the aspects at this hotel that impress chief among them is the supreme attentive and warm hospitality from the staff. From the extremely charming and wonderfully slick hotel customer relationship manager to the friendly barmen and smiling housekeepers the place is filled with such polite people that it makes you forget and forgive any other misgivings you have about the hotel.    Moroccans cetainly know how to make you feel welcome. It's such a tragedy how Islamic culture is portrayed in European society because truly the Arabic hospitality we have experienced on 3 trips to Morocco now has been so warm and inviting. I always come away feeling I want to write to their King Hassan II to say how impressed I am with his country and his people. We always err when we stereotype a whole culture but of course Western tourists can't be blamed for having preconceived concepts of an Islamic society formed from the daily exposure to 24/7 news coverage and I admit the first time you step into what feels a very alien environment it is a bit of a culture shock but we really must open our eyes to this mature and highly sophisticated society and there we can find true gems. And if you are one of those Westerners that would still like a few homely creature comforts and perhaps a little apprehensive about taking a complete plunge into a venue that is a little removed from your typical European holiday destination then trying this hotel would certainly not disappoint.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parsey2018

Also would be useful to have an information book in the room some things you find out as you go eg towel hire etc    Location is out of town but the shuttle bus works really well - and to be honest for a relaxing break it is probably a plus that you are not in central Marrakech,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burbage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy1966a

Check-in was smooth hotel is clean and grounds prestine! Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up.    Very friendly entertainment team keep the clientele engaged massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays.    Lots to keep you active from stretching water aerobics tennis archery and spin. Nice gym too.    Not over crowded always had a sunbed heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay.    Food was excellent and plentiful caters well for vegetarians! Wouldnt bother booking the Moroccon as the main restaurant beats the Moroccon hands down wider selection of tagines- . I did miss the filtered coffee at breakfast and there is no waiter service throughout the restaurant/bar/pool - you have to go up and get your own drinks (this is me being pesismistic).    Hotel offers free shuttle service to the square which is approx. 20 mins away would recommend a visit in the evening (after 7pm) when the square awakes. The resort itself is secluded and nothing outside.    Approx 30 minute journey from the airport - would recommend booking with marrakechairporttransfer.com ( very competitive and great service!)

For those that want to participate and many do there are lots of sporting facilities on site and participation is very easy to organise. We saw football tennis volleyball foot volleyball boules badminton spinning golf (hitting into a large net) archery and even a high trapeze for beginners! There are also 2 pools (as well as a kiddies paddling pool) but the larger pool is not heated and during the time we were there I only saw 2 hardy folk dare to enter. The smaller pool is heated (although by no means hot) but with it being quite a bit smaller felt a bit cramped.    The grounds are wonderfully kept and all you need is a sunny day (of which thankfully Morocco has an ample supply) and just taking a stroll around the venue can lift one's spirits. Palm and olive trees in abundance.    For those that don't want to spend to whole time on site the hotel run a free shuttle service into the city but this needs to be booked in advance and certain journey times can become unavailable when the hotel is full. And I felt the times offered were a little limited; starting at 9am and then 10am but I don't think there was another one until about 2pm. If I could find an area that the hotel is found wanting then I think they could put on a more frequent service. Having said that there are always taxis outside the gates of the hotel but of course they are not free!    But of all the aspects at this hotel that impress chief among them is the supreme attentive and warm hospitality from the staff. From the extremely charming and wonderfully slick hotel customer relationship manager to the friendly barmen and smiling housekeepers the place is filled with such polite people that it makes you forget and forgive any other misgivings you have about the hotel.    Moroccans cetainly know how to make you feel welcome. It's such a tragedy how Islamic culture is portrayed in European society because truly the Arabic hospitality we have experienced on 3 trips to Morocco now has been so warm and inviting. I always come away feeling I want to write to their King Hassan II to say how impressed I am with his country and his people. We always err when we stereotype a whole culture but of course Western tourists can't be blamed for having preconceived concepts of an Islamic society formed from the daily exposure to 24/7 news coverage and I admit the first time you step into what feels a very alien environment it is a bit of a culture shock but we really must open our eyes to this mature and highly sophisticated society and there we can find true gems. And if you are one of those Westerners that would still like a few homely creature comforts and perhaps a little apprehensive about taking a complete plunge into a venue that is a little removed from your typical European holiday destination then trying this hotel would certainly not disappoint.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parsey2018

Also would be useful to have an information book in the room some things you find out as you go eg towel hire etc    Location is out of town but the shuttle bus works really well - and to be honest for a relaxing break it is probably a plus that you are not in central Marrakech,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burbage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy1966a
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,myopinionbk wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great Hotel!!,A very much French speaking hotel we felt welcomed and well placed.    Check-in was smooth hotel is clean and grounds prestine! Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up.    Very friendly entertainment team keep the clientele engaged massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays.    Lots to keep you active from stretching water aerobics tennis archery and spin. Nice gym too.    Not over crowded always had a sunbed heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay.    Food was excellent and plentiful caters well for vegetarians! Wouldnt bother booking the Moroccon as the main restaurant beats the Moroccon hands down wider selection of tagines- . I did miss the filtered coffee at breakfast and there is no waiter service throughout the restaurant/bar/pool - you have to go up and get your own drinks (this is me being pesismistic).    Hotel offers free shuttle service to the square which is approx. 20 mins away would recommend a visit in the evening (after 7pm) when the square awakes. The resort itself is secluded and nothing outside.    Approx 30 minute journey from the airport - would recommend booking with marrakechairporttransfer.com ( very competitive and great service!)    We did a day at the atlas mountains which was a great experience - recommend booking through Tripadvisor/Viator (again very competitive with a fantastic tour guide)    I will be leaving a separate review on our Atlas mountain experience on Tripadvisor.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michael S wrote a review Feb 2018,20,So Many Problems,I stayed here for a week and had a terrible stay. My room door did not lock but did shut.  We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived.  The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying.  The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jojo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good hotel,We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.    Other comments and tips:  - we were told in the reception that there is no tables free for two nights (our last nights) in the ala carte restaurant. While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MimiM88 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,A family stay - positives and negatives,We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads.    Pros: we arrived a bit early just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean.    Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. I was disappointed that no staff said a word of discouragement. My daughter also accidentally left her Christmas gift from her dad - a new sweatshirt in the room. I called and emailed the hotel from the airport. The person who answered said they would look for it but we never received a response. The 2 emails I sent to the front desk (who had previously responded to my questions before the trip) went unanswered. Really disappointed in lack of a response when it likely easily could have been located. It would still be nice to hear from them.    The dining room feels like you are eating in a cafeteria.    I was disappointed with the overall service of this hotel. We would not choose to go back again nor recommend it to other families.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hanover, New Hampshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Wumz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings",I went with my friend spent 4 nights. All inclusive.  Greeted well by the staff although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable.  The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed.  The shuttle to town was very useful although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening.  The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we requested.  I guess for that time of the year it was a bit chilly we were often cold in the hotel and had to crank up the temp on the AC. In the summer this would be appreciated.  We attended the spa at the hotel which we understand are independent from them we felt we overpaid for the treatment and it was not what they said it would be. I wouldn't do the harman experience again - men were walking around and as a woman this was a very uncomfortable and anxiety provoking expeirence despite the staff trying to reassure me of privacy.  Overall a lovely trip. I would go there again.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wumz
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Catherine166 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside.    The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English.    The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. Housekeeping changed the towels daily and left towel designs on the bed which was very nice to come back and see.    We all commented on how nice the food was and the wide choice available but at times it could have been a little hotter but there are microwaves to help with this. I often chose to eat the Moroccan choice and loved it.    We spent time by the heated pool and this was warm and large enough to enjoy a swim. There were plenty of sun loungers after 10am. We paid a 100 Dirham deposit for towels.There is a bar closely situated to the heated pool and at times we did not even have to get off our sunbeds as the friendly bar lady came to us and even remembered our drinks.    Hotel entertainment was good in the bar areas in evenings but a little amateurish in the theatre in the later evenings. Plenty of different activities going on throughout the day for adults and children. Bar staff were always friendly and we had no complaints with the all inclusive drinks including wine in the restaurant on a help yourself basis.    All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend this hotel to families friends and couples.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine166
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mrcairo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good vacation with some issues.,"We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for 8 nights in February 2018. I'll start by saying we definitely had a pleasant relaxing stay and I would certainly recommend the hotel. That said there were some issues that could have take the stay from good to great.    Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at the food was not lots of fried unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar many vegetable dishes and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating as did the bar area. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet - some of my companions thought the beds were a bit overly firm but I thought they were great. There were lots of activities during the day - we played petanque and watched the people trying the trapeze out. The hotel and grounds were super clean and perfectly maintained.    Cons: The all-inclusive package only included local well alcohol - having it include name brands (like every other all-inc I've done) would have been a nice (and I daresay expected) option. The non-buffet restaurant (one meal there was included) was meh; the buffet was certainly preferable. The biggest issue we had was the service. While no one was by any means rude or unpleasant neither did we ever feel ""welcomed"" or that anyone was really going out of their way to make the stay more pleasant. In particular all our interactions with the front desk - checking in trying to get towels etc - were VERY challenging with several folks standing behind the desk talking to one another rather than helping. It also appeared to us that French speakers got much more engagement - table service in the bar just general attention.    In short - it was a very nice stay but fell short of what I would consider a 5-star stay.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrcairo
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,parsey2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.",We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain but this also means the place is not completely individual and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly. The idea of coming to a Moroccan 'holiday camp' styled as a British Butlin's with sun would definitely have put me off but I'm glad to say the place is much more sophisticated than that. Yes everyone eats at the same time in a 'grand buffet' and as such mealtimes are a little uncouth with folk wolfing down plate after plate and getting up and down more times than prices on the stock market but the food is very well presented and is of reasonable quality albeit clearly produced to a fairly tight budget.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Catherine166 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside.    The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English.    The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. Housekeeping changed the towels daily and left towel designs on the bed which was very nice to come back and see.    We all commented on how nice the food was and the wide choice available but at times it could have been a little hotter but there are microwaves to help with this. I often chose to eat the Moroccan choice and loved it.    We spent time by the heated pool and this was warm and large enough to enjoy a swim. There were plenty of sun loungers after 10am. We paid a 100 Dirham deposit for towels.There is a bar closely situated to the heated pool and at times we did not even have to get off our sunbeds as the friendly bar lady came to us and even remembered our drinks.    Hotel entertainment was good in the bar areas in evenings but a little amateurish in the theatre in the later evenings. Plenty of different activities going on throughout the day for adults and children. Bar staff were always friendly and we had no complaints with the all inclusive drinks including wine in the restaurant on a help yourself basis.    All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend this hotel to families friends and couples.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine166
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mrcairo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good vacation with some issues.,"We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for 8 nights in February 2018. I'll start by saying we definitely had a pleasant relaxing stay and I would certainly recommend the hotel. That said there were some issues that could have take the stay from good to great.    Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at the food was not lots of fried unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar many vegetable dishes and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating as did the bar area. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet - some of my companions thought the beds were a bit overly firm but I thought they were great. There were lots of activities during the day - we played petanque and watched the people trying the trapeze out. The hotel and grounds were super clean and perfectly maintained.    Cons: The all-inclusive package only included local well alcohol - having it include name brands (like every other all-inc I've done) would have been a nice (and I daresay expected) option. The non-buffet restaurant (one meal there was included) was meh; the buffet was certainly preferable. The biggest issue we had was the service. While no one was by any means rude or unpleasant neither did we ever feel ""welcomed"" or that anyone was really going out of their way to make the stay more pleasant. In particular all our interactions with the front desk - checking in trying to get towels etc - were VERY challenging with several folks standing behind the desk talking to one another rather than helping. It also appeared to us that French speakers got much more engagement - table service in the bar just general attention.    In short - it was a very nice stay but fell short of what I would consider a 5-star stay.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrcairo
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,parsey2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.",We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain but this also means the place is not completely individual and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly. The idea of coming to a Moroccan 'holiday camp' styled as a British Butlin's with sun would definitely have put me off but I'm glad to say the place is much more sophisticated than that. Yes everyone eats at the same time in a 'grand buffet' and as such mealtimes are a little uncouth with folk wolfing down plate after plate and getting up and down more times than prices on the stock market but the food is very well presented and is of reasonable quality albeit clearly produced to a fairly tight budget.    For those that want to participate and many do there are lots of sporting facilities on site and participation is very easy to organise. We saw football tennis volleyball foot volleyball boules badminton spinning golf (hitting into a large net) archery and even a high trapeze for beginners! There are also 2 pools (as well as a kiddies paddling pool) but the larger pool is not heated and during the time we were there I only saw 2 hardy folk dare to enter. The smaller pool is heated (although by no means hot) but with it being quite a bit smaller felt a bit cramped.    The grounds are wonderfully kept and all you need is a sunny day (of which thankfully Morocco has an ample supply) and just taking a stroll around the venue can lift one's spirits. Palm and olive trees in abundance.    For those that don't want to spend to whole time on site the hotel run a free shuttle service into the city but this needs to be booked in advance and certain journey times can become unavailable when the hotel is full. And I felt the times offered were a little limited; starting at 9am and then 10am but I don't think there was another one until about 2pm. If I could find an area that the hotel is found wanting then I think they could put on a more frequent service. Having said that there are always taxis outside the gates of the hotel but of course they are not free!    But of all the aspects at this hotel that impress chief among them is the supreme attentive and warm hospitality from the staff. From the extremely charming and wonderfully slick hotel customer relationship manager to the friendly barmen and smiling housekeepers the place is filled with such polite people that it makes you forget and forgive any other misgivings you have about the hotel.    Moroccans cetainly know how to make you feel welcome. It's such a tragedy how Islamic culture is portrayed in European society because truly the Arabic hospitality we have experienced on 3 trips to Morocco now has been so warm and inviting. I always come away feeling I want to write to their King Hassan II to say how impressed I am with his country and his people. We always err when we stereotype a whole culture but of course Western tourists can't be blamed for having preconceived concepts of an Islamic society formed from the daily exposure to 24/7 news coverage and I admit the first time you step into what feels a very alien environment it is a bit of a culture shock but we really must open our eyes to this mature and highly sophisticated society and there we can find true gems. And if you are one of those Westerners that would still like a few homely creature comforts and perhaps a little apprehensive about taking a complete plunge into a venue that is a little removed from your typical European holiday destination then trying this hotel would certainly not disappoint.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parsey2018

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,myopinionbk wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great Hotel!!,A very much French speaking hotel we felt welcomed and well placed.    Check-in was smooth hotel is clean and grounds prestine! Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up.    Very friendly entertainment team keep the clientele engaged massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays.    Lots to keep you active from stretching water aerobics tennis archery and spin. Nice gym too.    Not over crowded always had a sunbed heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay.    Food was excellent and plentiful caters well for vegetarians! Wouldnt bother booking the Moroccon as the main restaurant beats the Moroccon hands down wider selection of tagines- . I did miss the filtered coffee at breakfast and there is no waiter service throughout the restaurant/bar/pool - you have to go up and get your own drinks (this is me being pesismistic).    Hotel offers free shuttle service to the square which is approx. 20 mins away would recommend a visit in the evening (after 7pm) when the square awakes. The resort itself is secluded and nothing outside.    Approx 30 minute journey from the airport - would recommend booking with marrakechairporttransfer.com ( very competitive and great service!)    We did a day at the atlas mountains which was a great experience - recommend booking through Tripadvisor/Viator (again very competitive with a fantastic tour guide)    I will be leaving a separate review on our Atlas mountain experience on Tripadvisor.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michael S wrote a review Feb 2018,20,So Many Problems,I stayed here for a week and had a terrible stay. My room door did not lock but did shut.  We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived.  The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying.  The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jojo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good hotel,We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.    Other comments and tips:  - we were told in the reception that there is no tables free for two nights (our last nights) in the ala carte restaurant. While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.  We had a wonderful time here and will be returning  as lovely as the setting was the biggest plus was the hotel staff- everyone from receptionto cleaners  waiters bar staff and the entertainment team were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MimiM88 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,A family stay - positives and negatives,We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads.    Pros: we arrived a bit early just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean.    Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. I was disappointed that no staff said a word of discouragement. My daughter also accidentally left her Christmas gift from her dad - a new sweatshirt in the room. I called and emailed the hotel from the airport. The person who answered said they would look for it but we never received a response. The 2 emails I sent to the front desk (who had previously responded to my questions before the trip) went unanswered. Really disappointed in lack of a response when it likely easily could have been located. It would still be nice to hear from them.    The dining room feels like you are eating in a cafeteria.    I was disappointed with the overall service of this hotel. We would not choose to go back again nor recommend it to other families.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hanover, New Hampshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Wumz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings",I went with my friend spent 4 nights. All inclusive.  Greeted well by the staff although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable.  The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed.  The shuttle to town was very useful although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening.  The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we requested.  I guess for that time of the year it was a bit chilly we were often cold in the hotel and had to crank up the temp on the AC. In the summer this would be appreciated.  We attended the spa at the hotel which we understand are independent from them we felt we overpaid for the treatment and it was not what they said it would be. I wouldn't do the harman experience again - men were walking around and as a woman this was a very uncomfortable and anxiety provoking expeirence despite the staff trying to reassure me of privacy.

While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.  We had a wonderful time here and will be returning  as lovely as the setting was the biggest plus was the hotel staff- everyone from receptionto cleaners  waiters bar staff and the entertainment team were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MimiM88 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,A family stay - positives and negatives,We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads.    Pros: we arrived a bit early just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean.    Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. I was disappointed that no staff said a word of discouragement. My daughter also accidentally left her Christmas gift from her dad - a new sweatshirt in the room. I called and emailed the hotel from the airport. The person who answered said they would look for it but we never received a response. The 2 emails I sent to the front desk (who had previously responded to my questions before the trip) went unanswered. Really disappointed in lack of a response when it likely easily could have been located. It would still be nice to hear from them.    The dining room feels like you are eating in a cafeteria.    I was disappointed with the overall service of this hotel. We would not choose to go back again nor recommend it to other families.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hanover, New Hampshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Wumz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings",I went with my friend spent 4 nights. All inclusive.  Greeted well by the staff although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable.  The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed.  The shuttle to town was very useful although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening.  The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we requested.  I guess for that time of the year it was a bit chilly we were often cold in the hotel and had to crank up the temp on the AC. In the summer this would be appreciated.  We attended the spa at the hotel which we understand are independent from them we felt we overpaid for the treatment and it was not what they said it would be. I wouldn't do the harman experience again - men were walking around and as a woman this was a very uncomfortable and anxiety provoking expeirence despite the staff trying to reassure me of privacy.  Overall a lovely trip. I would go there again.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wumz
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Catherine166 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside.    The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English.    The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. Housekeeping changed the towels daily and left towel designs on the bed which was very nice to come back and see.    We all commented on how nice the food was and the wide choice available but at times it could have been a little hotter but there are microwaves to help with this. I often chose to eat the Moroccan choice and loved it.    We spent time by the heated pool and this was warm and large enough to enjoy a swim. There were plenty of sun loungers after 10am. We paid a 100 Dirham deposit for towels.There is a bar closely situated to the heated pool and at times we did not even have to get off our sunbeds as the friendly bar lady came to us and even remembered our drinks.    Hotel entertainment was good in the bar areas in evenings but a little amateurish in the theatre in the later evenings. Plenty of different activities going on throughout the day for adults and children. Bar staff were always friendly and we had no complaints with the all inclusive drinks including wine in the restaurant on a help yourself basis.    All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend this hotel to families friends and couples.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine166
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mrcairo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good vacation with some issues.,"We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for 8 nights in February 2018. I'll start by saying we definitely had a pleasant relaxing stay and I would certainly recommend the hotel. That said there were some issues that could have take the stay from good to great.    Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at the food was not lots of fried unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar many vegetable dishes and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating as did the bar area. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet - some of my companions thought the beds were a bit overly firm but I thought they were great. There were lots of activities during the day - we played petanque and watched the people trying the trapeze out. The hotel and grounds were super clean and perfectly maintained.    Cons: The all-inclusive package only included local well alcohol - having it include name brands (like every other all-inc I've done) would have been a nice (and I daresay expected) option. The non-buffet restaurant (one meal there was included) was meh; the buffet was certainly preferable. The biggest issue we had was the service. While no one was by any means rude or unpleasant neither did we ever feel ""welcomed"" or that anyone was really going out of their way to make the stay more pleasant. In particular all our interactions with the front desk - checking in trying to get towels etc - were VERY challenging with several folks standing behind the desk talking to one another rather than helping. It also appeared to us that French speakers got much more engagement - table service in the bar just general attention.    In short - it was a very nice stay but fell short of what I would consider a 5-star stay.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrcairo
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,parsey2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.",We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain but this also means the place is not completely individual and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly. The idea of coming to a Moroccan 'holiday camp' styled as a British Butlin's with sun would definitely have put me off but I'm glad to say the place is much more sophisticated than that. Yes everyone eats at the same time in a 'grand buffet' and as such mealtimes are a little uncouth with folk wolfing down plate after plate and getting up and down more times than prices on the stock market but the food is very well presented and is of reasonable quality albeit clearly produced to a fairly tight budget.    For those that want to participate and many do there are lots of sporting facilities on site and participation is very easy to organise. We saw football tennis volleyball foot volleyball boules badminton spinning golf (hitting into a large net) archery and even a high trapeze for beginners! There are also 2 pools (as well as a kiddies paddling pool) but the larger pool is not heated and during the time we were there I only saw 2 hardy folk dare to enter. The smaller pool is heated (although by no means hot) but with it being quite a bit smaller felt a bit cramped.    The grounds are wonderfully kept and all you need is a sunny day (of which thankfully Morocco has an ample supply) and just taking a stroll around the venue can lift one's spirits. Palm and olive trees in abundance.    For those that don't want to spend to whole time on site the hotel run a free shuttle service into the city but this needs to be booked in advance and certain journey times can become unavailable when the hotel is full. And I felt the times offered were a little limited; starting at 9am and then 10am but I don't think there was another one until about 2pm. If I could find an area that the hotel is found wanting then I think they could put on a more frequent service. Having said that there are always taxis outside the gates of the hotel but of course they are not free!    But of all the aspects at this hotel that impress chief among them is the supreme attentive and warm hospitality from the staff. From the extremely charming and wonderfully slick hotel customer relationship manager to the friendly barmen and smiling housekeepers the place is filled with such polite people that it makes you forget and forgive any other misgivings you have about the hotel.    Moroccans cetainly know how to make you feel welcome. It's such a tragedy how Islamic culture is portrayed in European society because truly the Arabic hospitality we have experienced on 3 trips to Morocco now has been so warm and inviting. I always come away feeling I want to write to their King Hassan II to say how impressed I am with his country and his people. We always err when we stereotype a whole culture but of course Western tourists can't be blamed for having preconceived concepts of an Islamic society formed from the daily exposure to 24/7 news coverage and I admit the first time you step into what feels a very alien environment it is a bit of a culture shock but we really must open our eyes to this mature and highly sophisticated society and there we can find true gems. And if you are one of those Westerners that would still like a few homely creature comforts and perhaps a little apprehensive about taking a complete plunge into a venue that is a little removed from your typical European holiday destination then trying this hotel would certainly not disappoint.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parsey2018

Also would be useful to have an information book in the room some things you find out as you go eg towel hire etc    Location is out of town but the shuttle bus works really well - and to be honest for a relaxing break it is probably a plus that you are not in central Marrakech,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burbage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy1966a
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,myopinionbk wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great Hotel!!,A very much French speaking hotel we felt welcomed and well placed.    Check-in was smooth hotel is clean and grounds prestine! Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up.    Very friendly entertainment team keep the clientele engaged massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays.    Lots to keep you active from stretching water aerobics tennis archery and spin. Nice gym too.    Not over crowded always had a sunbed heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay.    Food was excellent and plentiful caters well for vegetarians! Wouldnt bother booking the Moroccon as the main restaurant beats the Moroccon hands down wider selection of tagines- . I did miss the filtered coffee at breakfast and there is no waiter service throughout the restaurant/bar/pool - you have to go up and get your own drinks (this is me being pesismistic).    Hotel offers free shuttle service to the square which is approx. 20 mins away would recommend a visit in the evening (after 7pm) when the square awakes. The resort itself is secluded and nothing outside.    Approx 30 minute journey from the airport - would recommend booking with marrakechairporttransfer.com ( very competitive and great service!)    We did a day at the atlas mountains which was a great experience - recommend booking through Tripadvisor/Viator (again very competitive with a fantastic tour guide)    I will be leaving a separate review on our Atlas mountain experience on Tripadvisor.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michael S wrote a review Feb 2018,20,So Many Problems,I stayed here for a week and had a terrible stay. My room door did not lock but did shut.  We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived.  The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying.  The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive.

Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.

Also would be useful to have an information book in the room some things you find out as you go eg towel hire etc    Location is out of town but the shuttle bus works really well - and to be honest for a relaxing break it is probably a plus that you are not in central Marrakech,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Burbage, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andy1966a
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,myopinionbk wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great Hotel!!,A very much French speaking hotel we felt welcomed and well placed.    Check-in was smooth hotel is clean and grounds prestine! Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up.    Very friendly entertainment team keep the clientele engaged massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays.    Lots to keep you active from stretching water aerobics tennis archery and spin. Nice gym too.    Not over crowded always had a sunbed heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay.    Food was excellent and plentiful caters well for vegetarians! Wouldnt bother booking the Moroccon as the main restaurant beats the Moroccon hands down wider selection of tagines- . I did miss the filtered coffee at breakfast and there is no waiter service throughout the restaurant/bar/pool - you have to go up and get your own drinks (this is me being pesismistic).    Hotel offers free shuttle service to the square which is approx. 20 mins away would recommend a visit in the evening (after 7pm) when the square awakes. The resort itself is secluded and nothing outside.    Approx 30 minute journey from the airport - would recommend booking with marrakechairporttransfer.com ( very competitive and great service!)    We did a day at the atlas mountains which was a great experience - recommend booking through Tripadvisor/Viator (again very competitive with a fantastic tour guide)    I will be leaving a separate review on our Atlas mountain experience on Tripadvisor.    All in all a great resort giving great value for money!!,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myopinionbk
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Michael S wrote a review Feb 2018,20,So Many Problems,I stayed here for a week and had a terrible stay. My room door did not lock but did shut.  We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived.  The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying.  The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jojo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good hotel,We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.    Other comments and tips:  - we were told in the reception that there is no tables free for two nights (our last nights) in the ala carte restaurant. While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MimiM88 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,A family stay - positives and negatives,We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads.    Pros: we arrived a bit early just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean.    Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. I was disappointed that no staff said a word of discouragement. My daughter also accidentally left her Christmas gift from her dad - a new sweatshirt in the room. I called and emailed the hotel from the airport. The person who answered said they would look for it but we never received a response. The 2 emails I sent to the front desk (who had previously responded to my questions before the trip) went unanswered. Really disappointed in lack of a response when it likely easily could have been located. It would still be nice to hear from them.    The dining room feels like you are eating in a cafeteria.    I was disappointed with the overall service of this hotel. We would not choose to go back again nor recommend it to other families.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hanover, New Hampshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Wumz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings",I went with my friend spent 4 nights. All inclusive.  Greeted well by the staff although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable.  The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed.  The shuttle to town was very useful although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening.  The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we requested.  I guess for that time of the year it was a bit chilly we were often cold in the hotel and had to crank up the temp on the AC. In the summer this would be appreciated.  We attended the spa at the hotel which we understand are independent from them we felt we overpaid for the treatment and it was not what they said it would be. I wouldn't do the harman experience again - men were walking around and as a woman this was a very uncomfortable and anxiety provoking expeirence despite the staff trying to reassure me of privacy.  Overall a lovely trip. I would go there again.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wumz
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Catherine166 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside.    The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English.    The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. Housekeeping changed the towels daily and left towel designs on the bed which was very nice to come back and see.    We all commented on how nice the food was and the wide choice available but at times it could have been a little hotter but there are microwaves to help with this. I often chose to eat the Moroccan choice and loved it.    We spent time by the heated pool and this was warm and large enough to enjoy a swim. There were plenty of sun loungers after 10am. We paid a 100 Dirham deposit for towels.There is a bar closely situated to the heated pool and at times we did not even have to get off our sunbeds as the friendly bar lady came to us and even remembered our drinks.    Hotel entertainment was good in the bar areas in evenings but a little amateurish in the theatre in the later evenings. Plenty of different activities going on throughout the day for adults and children. Bar staff were always friendly and we had no complaints with the all inclusive drinks including wine in the restaurant on a help yourself basis.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mrcairo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good vacation with some issues.,"We stayed at the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech for 8 nights in February 2018. I'll start by saying we definitely had a pleasant relaxing stay and I would certainly recommend the hotel. That said there were some issues that could have take the stay from good to great.    Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at the food was not lots of fried unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar many vegetable dishes and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating as did the bar area. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet - some of my companions thought the beds were a bit overly firm but I thought they were great. There were lots of activities during the day - we played petanque and watched the people trying the trapeze out. The hotel and grounds were super clean and perfectly maintained.    Cons: The all-inclusive package only included local well alcohol - having it include name brands (like every other all-inc I've done) would have been a nice (and I daresay expected) option. The non-buffet restaurant (one meal there was included) was meh; the buffet was certainly preferable. The biggest issue we had was the service. While no one was by any means rude or unpleasant neither did we ever feel ""welcomed"" or that anyone was really going out of their way to make the stay more pleasant. In particular all our interactions with the front desk - checking in trying to get towels etc - were VERY challenging with several folks standing behind the desk talking to one another rather than helping. It also appeared to us that French speakers got much more engagement - table service in the bar just general attention.    In short - it was a very nice stay but fell short of what I would consider a 5-star stay.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrcairo
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,parsey2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.",We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain but this also means the place is not completely individual and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly. The idea of coming to a Moroccan 'holiday camp' styled as a British Butlin's with sun would definitely have put me off but I'm glad to say the place is much more sophisticated than that. Yes everyone eats at the same time in a 'grand buffet' and as such mealtimes are a little uncouth with folk wolfing down plate after plate and getting up and down more times than prices on the stock market but the food is very well presented and is of reasonable quality albeit clearly produced to a fairly tight budget.    For those that want to participate and many do there are lots of sporting facilities on site and participation is very easy to organise. We saw football tennis volleyball foot volleyball boules badminton spinning golf (hitting into a large net) archery and even a high trapeze for beginners! There are also 2 pools (as well as a kiddies paddling pool) but the larger pool is not heated and during the time we were there I only saw 2 hardy folk dare to enter. The smaller pool is heated (although by no means hot) but with it being quite a bit smaller felt a bit cramped.    The grounds are wonderfully kept and all you need is a sunny day (of which thankfully Morocco has an ample supply) and just taking a stroll around the venue can lift one's spirits. Palm and olive trees in abundance.    For those that don't want to spend to whole time on site the hotel run a free shuttle service into the city but this needs to be booked in advance and certain journey times can become unavailable when the hotel is full. And I felt the times offered were a little limited; starting at 9am and then 10am but I don't think there was another one until about 2pm. If I could find an area that the hotel is found wanting then I think they could put on a more frequent service. Having said that there are always taxis outside the gates of the hotel but of course they are not free!    But of all the aspects at this hotel that impress chief among them is the supreme attentive and warm hospitality from the staff. From the extremely charming and wonderfully slick hotel customer relationship manager to the friendly barmen and smiling housekeepers the place is filled with such polite people that it makes you forget and forgive any other misgivings you have about the hotel.    Moroccans cetainly know how to make you feel welcome. It's such a tragedy how Islamic culture is portrayed in European society because truly the Arabic hospitality we have experienced on 3 trips to Morocco now has been so warm and inviting. I always come away feeling I want to write to their King Hassan II to say how impressed I am with his country and his people. We always err when we stereotype a whole culture but of course Western tourists can't be blamed for having preconceived concepts of an Islamic society formed from the daily exposure to 24/7 news coverage and I admit the first time you step into what feels a very alien environment it is a bit of a culture shock but we really must open our eyes to this mature and highly sophisticated society and there we can find true gems. And if you are one of those Westerners that would still like a few homely creature comforts and perhaps a little apprehensive about taking a complete plunge into a venue that is a little removed from your typical European holiday destination then trying this hotel would certainly not disappoint.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parsey2018

There were lots of activities during the day - we played petanque and watched the people trying the trapeze out. The hotel and grounds were super clean and perfectly maintained.    Cons: The all-inclusive package only included local well alcohol - having it include name brands (like every other all-inc I've done) would have been a nice (and I daresay expected) option. The non-buffet restaurant (one meal there was included) was meh; the buffet was certainly preferable. The biggest issue we had was the service. While no one was by any means rude or unpleasant neither did we ever feel ""welcomed"" or that anyone was really going out of their way to make the stay more pleasant. In particular all our interactions with the front desk - checking in trying to get towels etc - were VERY challenging with several folks standing behind the desk talking to one another rather than helping. It also appeared to us that French speakers got much more engagement - table service in the bar just general attention.    In short - it was a very nice stay but fell short of what I would consider a 5-star stay.",Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Baltimore, Maryland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrcairo
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,parsey2018 wrote a review Mar 2018,50,"Wonderful, attentive service. Beautiful surroundings. Great value.",We have just spent a lovely break away with friends at this hotel. We were a party of 8 - 3 couples and 2 toddlers. It was the first time I've been on an 'all inclusive' holiday and I wasn't sure of what to expect. The hotel is situated about 15 - 20 mins drive away from the centre of Marrakech in the Palmery area to the east of the city. It therefore is away from the bustle of such a lively city and is a very different option from one of the classic city centre Riads through which Marrakech gets such a wonderful reputation. It is part of an international chain and as such benefits from many of the facilities familiar to other hotels in this chain but this also means the place is not completely individual and thus the character of the place suffers ever so slightly. The idea of coming to a Moroccan 'holiday camp' styled as a British Butlin's with sun would definitely have put me off but I'm glad to say the place is much more sophisticated than that. Yes everyone eats at the same time in a 'grand buffet' and as such mealtimes are a little uncouth with folk wolfing down plate after plate and getting up and down more times than prices on the stock market but the food is very well presented and is of reasonable quality albeit clearly produced to a fairly tight budget.    For those that want to participate and many do there are lots of sporting facilities on site and participation is very easy to organise. We saw football tennis volleyball foot volleyball boules badminton spinning golf (hitting into a large net) archery and even a high trapeze for beginners! There are also 2 pools (as well as a kiddies paddling pool) but the larger pool is not heated and during the time we were there I only saw 2 hardy folk dare to enter. The smaller pool is heated (although by no means hot) but with it being quite a bit smaller felt a bit cramped.    The grounds are wonderfully kept and all you need is a sunny day (of which thankfully Morocco has an ample supply) and just taking a stroll around the venue can lift one's spirits. Palm and olive trees in abundance.    For those that don't want to spend to whole time on site the hotel run a free shuttle service into the city but this needs to be booked in advance and certain journey times can become unavailable when the hotel is full. And I felt the times offered were a little limited; starting at 9am and then 10am but I don't think there was another one until about 2pm. If I could find an area that the hotel is found wanting then I think they could put on a more frequent service. Having said that there are always taxis outside the gates of the hotel but of course they are not free!    But of all the aspects at this hotel that impress chief among them is the supreme attentive and warm hospitality from the staff. From the extremely charming and wonderfully slick hotel customer relationship manager to the friendly barmen and smiling housekeepers the place is filled with such polite people that it makes you forget and forgive any other misgivings you have about the hotel.    Moroccans cetainly know how to make you feel welcome. It's such a tragedy how Islamic culture is portrayed in European society because truly the Arabic hospitality we have experienced on 3 trips to Morocco now has been so warm and inviting. I always come away feeling I want to write to their King Hassan II to say how impressed I am with his country and his people. We always err when we stereotype a whole culture but of course Western tourists can't be blamed for having preconceived concepts of an Islamic society formed from the daily exposure to 24/7 news coverage and I admit the first time you step into what feels a very alien environment it is a bit of a culture shock but we really must open our eyes to this mature and highly sophisticated society and there we can find true gems. And if you are one of those Westerners that would still like a few homely creature comforts and perhaps a little apprehensive about taking a complete plunge into a venue that is a little removed from your typical European holiday destination then trying this hotel would certainly not disappoint.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Somerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parsey2018

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,myopinionbk wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great Hotel!!,A very much French speaking hotel we felt welcomed and well placed.    Check-in was smooth hotel is clean and grounds prestine! Temperatures were around 21 degrees during the day and cooler in both the mornings and evenings - suggest you layer up.    Very friendly entertainment team keep the clientele engaged massive thank you to Mido who made the kids holidays.    Lots to keep you active from stretching water aerobics tennis archery and spin. Nice gym too.    Not over crowded always had a sunbed heated pool was lovely - didnt see anyone in the normal pool during our 5 day stay (probably because the weather was not hot enough). There is a deposit of 100 dh (pp) for the towels which is refunded at the end of the stay.    Food was excellent and plentiful caters well for vegetarians! Wouldnt bother booking the Moroccon as the main restaurant beats the Moroccon hands down wider selection of tagines- . I did miss the filtered coffee at breakfast and there is no waiter service throughout the restaurant/bar/pool - you have to go up and get your own drinks (this is me being pesismistic).    Hotel offers free shuttle service to the square which is approx. 20 mins away would recommend a visit in the evening (after 7pm) when the square awakes. The resort itself is secluded and nothing outside.    Approx 30 minute journey from the airport - would recommend booking with marrakechairporttransfer.com ( very competitive and great service!)    We did a day at the atlas mountains which was a great experience - recommend booking through Tripadvisor/Viator (again very competitive with a fantastic tour guide)    I will be leaving a separate review on our Atlas mountain experience on Tripadvisor.

We were asked to move rooms after 1 night as our room was not ready when we arrived.  The shuttle bus does not stop at the market although they told us it did. Next time we will get a taxi. Very annoying.  The wifi is terrible either in the rooms or in the hotel. Its basically 5% coverage at best. Just does not work. The cleaner would tidy the room at 4pm each day so late. Extras such as washing and telephone calls so expensive. The bed sheet had stains. At breakfast food often run out at one point there was no bread lemon and milk. We waited ages for it to arrive.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Jojo wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Good hotel,We are halfway through our holiday in Marrakech. Here is some pros and cons:    Pros:  - beautiful clean and well maintained hotel  - room good size tile flooring which is huge plus  - staff seem to enjoy their work they seem happy and creates good atmosphere.  - free shuttle bus to the town (doesn’t take straight to the souks but it’s not far and easy to find)    Cons:  - when we arrived and were looking around where to find our room piccolo asked our room number and literally took our suitcases out of our hands and started to walk to the room. We had just exchanged money and had no change to give him( plus we never asked to take our bags). Later the night when we were enjoying ourselves and having wine at the bar he came to us saying our room door was open. I went all to way to the room only to find out it was locked and not open. Clearly he was pissed off we never gave him a tip.  - food is not great there is lot of options but the meat is not good and there is little of it. One night they had fish and other sea food but not other meat options.  - Not all of the foods are labeled (if you have allergies it’s impossible to know what’s in them)  - staff was friendly but I noticed most of them only really talked to my partner and totally ignored me. I was okay with it just thought it was quite rude.  - there is no body lotion or hair conditioner in the room which was a pain for us as we only had hand luggage with us.    Other comments and tips:  - we were told in the reception that there is no tables free for two nights (our last nights) in the ala carte restaurant. While we were having lunch one staff member called Imad (?) came to speak to us (remembering our names from the day one) and organised a table for us so we could have our Moroccon meal before leaving home. Obviously we were more than happy about this.    - exchange rate was a lot better at the airport and at the hotel(1205AIRPORT) (1235HOTEL) and in London Gatwick (84),Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Scotland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannnan

Warmly wecolmed with drinks in reception and taken to our room. Room quiet looking out onto gardens and very clean.  The hotel location is about 20mins drive from Marrakech old town and there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel bookable at reception.  The hotel grounds are large and beautifully landscaped. The is lots to do -table tennis boules tennis football volleyball spinning Zumba etc or you can just relax round one of the pools or the bars -the are plenty of quiet areas to laze in. One of the pools was heated and it was delightful to dip into.  The food is of very good quantity and never stops! If you have fussy children they might be restricted a little. The all inclusive drinks including the wines are very acceptable.  There were very few English visitors when we arrived mostly French tourists but we didn't find that was a problem or affected the service we received -a rudimentary ""Bon Jour"" will get you a long way.  We had a wonderful time here and will be returning  as lovely as the setting was the biggest plus was the hotel staff- everyone from receptionto cleaners  waiters bar staff and the entertainment team were so friendly and couldn't do enough for us.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,MimiM88 wrote a review Mar 2018,30,A family stay - positives and negatives,We were very much looking forward to our stay at the Iberostar Marrakesh after spending a week touring thorough Morocco and staying in smaller Riads.    Pros: we arrived a bit early just before lunch finished and they welcomed us to go have lunch. The buffet varied every day. One heated pool. Trapeze experience for the kids. Kids love playing Ping Pong. The transportation via shuttle to the center was timely and nice. The rooms were modern and clean.    Cons: I agree with other guests that the French speakers seemed more attended to. There was quite a long wait at reception to check in. There were guests - both children and their parents who were accosting the geese - chasing them and throwing things at them - mother geese who wanted to protect their nests and their eggs. I was disappointed that no staff said a word of discouragement. My daughter also accidentally left her Christmas gift from her dad - a new sweatshirt in the room. I called and emailed the hotel from the airport. The person who answered said they would look for it but we never received a response. The 2 emails I sent to the front desk (who had previously responded to my questions before the trip) went unanswered. Really disappointed in lack of a response when it likely easily could have been located. It would still be nice to hear from them.    The dining room feels like you are eating in a cafeteria.    I was disappointed with the overall service of this hotel. We would not choose to go back again nor recommend it to other families.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hanover, New Hampshire",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiM88
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Wumz wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great stay, lovely staff and surroundings",I went with my friend spent 4 nights. All inclusive.  Greeted well by the staff although I did find that one particular staff member hovered around for a tip when they took our bags to the room. Generally everyone was very hospitable.  The food was varied and good - although I doubt it was authentic morrocan food at the buffet. The restaurant manager kindly managed to get us a table last minute the food was good - although I felt it was very similar ingredients and drinks to what is served in the buffet and the poor serves seem overwhelmed.  The shuttle to town was very useful although we found out about this 2 days into our visit after over paying for taxis. It's a shame the shuttles doesn't operate later into the evening.  The rooms were clean and nicely prepared every time we requested.  I guess for that time of the year it was a bit chilly we were often cold in the hotel and had to crank up the temp on the AC. In the summer this would be appreciated.  We attended the spa at the hotel which we understand are independent from them we felt we overpaid for the treatment and it was not what they said it would be. I wouldn't do the harman experience again - men were walking around and as a woman this was a very uncomfortable and anxiety provoking expeirence despite the staff trying to reassure me of privacy.  Overall a lovely trip. I would go there again.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wumz
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Catherine166 wrote a review Mar 2018,40,Pleasent family stay at the Iberostar,I was in a party of five adults and this was our first visit to Marrakech. Weather at the end of Feb was warm in the day but I wish I had taken a coat for the evenings as it was a little chilly outside.    The hotel was further out than I would usually stay but it made for an interesting trip when you left the hotel. We used the free hotel shuttle to the Souks and this arrived and left on time. Although we did not book with Thomas Cook we were able to book a very enjoyable and reasonable priced trip to the Atlas mountains with the helpful Thomas Cook lady who sits in the reception area and she speaks English.    The hotel staff do an excellent job at keeping the hotel clean throughout. Rooms were ample size with small balcony/terrace with drying rack provided and free safe. Housekeeping changed the towels daily and left towel designs on the bed which was very nice to come back and see.    We all commented on how nice the food was and the wide choice available but at times it could have been a little hotter but there are microwaves to help with this. I often chose to eat the Moroccan choice and loved it.    We spent time by the heated pool and this was warm and large enough to enjoy a swim. There were plenty of sun loungers after 10am. We paid a 100 Dirham deposit for towels.There is a bar closely situated to the heated pool and at times we did not even have to get off our sunbeds as the friendly bar lady came to us and even remembered our drinks.    Hotel entertainment was good in the bar areas in evenings but a little amateurish in the theatre in the later evenings. Plenty of different activities going on throughout the day for adults and children. Bar staff were always friendly and we had no complaints with the all inclusive drinks including wine in the restaurant on a help yourself basis.    All in all a very nice stay and we would recommend this hotel to families friends and couples.,Date of stay: February 2018,,"Shoreham-by-Sea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Catherine166

Pros: The price was very reasonable given the amenities. The buffet was excellent - unlike other all-inclusives I've stayed at the food was not lots of fried unhealthy options. There was a substantial salad bar many vegetable dishes and the overall predominance of Moroccan food was a nice treat. The various pools had plenty of seating as did the bar area.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Danielle I wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Excellent,We arrived on a sunday around lunch time. Our room was not ready and so we were shown to the restaurant for lunch. After finishing the room was ready and our luggage was taken to the room by a porter who showed us the way also. The room was spotless well laid out and well maintained although the 'all rooms have a pool garden or mountain view' was a little bit of a let down as we had 2 trees a constantly barking dog on land next door and a main road!    The food is varied there's a choice for everyone and I especially loved the specials area which changed each meal time. I would say though that staff should be aware that not everyone wants a 'snotty egg' and flipping it and taking it off the grill doesn't then mean it's cooked. I was huffed at and eyes rolled when I asked for it to be cooked longer as it was still raw! The cocktails however leave a lot to be desired. The daiquiri is citrus fruit and very tart and the pina colada is not like one back here at home. We found a lovely chocolate liquor on the menu that we stuck with. You were served almost immediately when at the bar and there was a bar by the quiet pool and a wagon by the main pool which served snacks as well as drinks.    The pool areas were well maintained very clean tidy and staff collected rubbish regularly throughout the day. Although there is a wasp problem which means having anything but water is risky by the pool! The lifeguards come and put the umbrellas up for you each morning if you ask.    The animation staff all clearly enjoy their jobs although I found the constant harassment of one of them slightly annoying. Grabbing my drink to stop me drinking in the restaurant and tickling my feet every day because I was busy by the pool side. I also didn't like the fact that they would come and sit with you at meal times. For me meal times are a family thing to allow us all to catch up after doing different activities during the day. The dancers were exceptional and put on fabulous evening shows without fault. The day time activities were jam packed with water polo Aqua trapeze salsa spinning etc...    There's photographers on site that come round and snap you taking part in the activities or when you're in the pool with family or friends etc and you can view these at the desk and purchase if needed although they are not in any way pushy.    There's a souvenir shop on site and also a genera shop on site both of which have closed days and shut at 6pm. I think they should open later and close later as they open for the period of time people are in the pool and I never saw anyone in the shops although we did use the general store to get some snacks for the journey home.    A family member got an ear infection whilst we were away however staff assisted in calling a doctor and arranging an appointment for us.  There are taxis just outside of the hotel and we paid no more than 100 MAD each way into marrakech during the day and no more than 150 MAD during the evening. Alcohol is not served in shops after 8pm. The market and souks in marrakech are something to experience. However I did not like it as it was like being in London 3 fold with the amount of people and mopeds just ride straight up to you waiting for you to move!    The staff are all friendly all smile and say hello or good morning/evening and we're more than happy to help us in arranging a birthday cake and a bottle of fizz to our room for a family members birthday.    My only niggles through this are the best on total citrus cocktails which weren't really drinkable and the fact that our room was being cleaned until 5/530pm each day. We did ask at reception if we could have it cleaned earlier on the day of a family member birthday as we were going out at 5pm that evening but we're told 'other people need their rooms cleaned also' I just let this comment go given the fact it was a special day for family and we had plans!    I would thoroughly recommend the hotel though and would love to return in the future. I would even go as far as to say that it should be a 5* and not 4!!,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705daniellei
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Dibley1703 wrote a review Sep 2017,50,The staff make this hotel amazing,We have stayed at many hotels around the world but the staff at this hotel were the friendliest we have ever met. From the cleaners to the bar staff to the animation crew to the managers they all deserve a big thank u for making our holiday so special.  We very rarely return to the same hotel again but I do think we will be back.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and the food is varied with a good variety of both non and alcoholic drinks.  I would like to say a big thank you to the animation team who were amazingly brilliant and very funny and friendly. Special thanks to Sali Nazier and Mohammed.    This hotel definitely warrants a 5 rating but I would like to point out something that the management should address. On day 2 of our 10 day holiday whilst catching the hotel shuttle bus to Marrakesh I tripped outside the gates of the hotel as the ground was extremely uneven. I think this is still part of the hotel grounds as it’s still within the confines of the walls of the hotel so to speak. I badly bruised and grazed both my knees and elbows and returned to the hotel to ask for first aid antiseptic wipes bandages etc to be told they there wasn’t anything available! The reception staff didn’t even make a note of the incident. Hopefully this will be addressed as I would hate this to happen to another guest.    This aside the hotel was fantastic thanks again,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dibley1703
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,plufkin wrote a review Sep 2017,50,MARRASESH,Food - the buffet was great for breakfast lunch & supper food was really varied and plenty of choice with different specialties every night. Seafood night was one of the best along with fantastic paella and fiduea also! The food in the Moroccan restaurant is definitely an experience not to miss out on so make sure you book this in with reception on arrival to avoid disappointment. The food truck by the pool was great with burgers sandwiches waffles & pancakes to keep you going during the day - manned by Mustapa and the team who were amazing!    Hotel - plenty of space in the room and they were left spotless every day super helpful and friendly staff everywhere. The entertainment team had so much energy and constantly running activities around the pool. Tennis golf spinning table tennis boules archery and trapeze were on offer everyday and well worth having a go at (at no additional cost). The grounds are extremely well kept and lovely. A few Wasps around but they're only interested in your drinks.    Marrakech - the hotel runs a free shuttle that drops you a 10 minute walk from the main square and souks. The coach driver was really friendly so just check with him on directions. In the evening it's complete chaos but good fun. Be prepared for everyone to attempt to rip you off for all you're worth but with some good haggling there are great bargains to be had. Would recommend going in the evening as that's when it comes alive a taxi back only costs 150D if you miss the coach.    Drinks - great local beer wines and spirits. Cocktails were good. Fruit juice in the restaurant in the restaurant was also great.    Very few if any negatives I'd note - some days the music great quite loud but the entertainment team keep it really fun and there is a quite pool also.    Overall loved our time spent at the Iberostar Club Palmaraie hotel and would thoroughly recommend to anyone thinking of staying. Would definitely return for a relaxing week in the sun but with the option for activities and cultural experiences.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plufkin

Rooms are good size well maintained and comfortable.  3 pools again all very clean. We spent time at the Zen pool which is very quiet and relaxing and at the main pool which had the fantastic animation team working extremely hard all day!  All of the animation team are fantastic each very kind and friendly brilliant sense of humour very good English but above all they seemed to enjoy themselves too!  The bar staff too were very friendly each remembered our drinks order and would carry out to our tables for us. those who struggled slightly with English quickly apologised and found someone to help them.  Food was good always plenty of choice and enough. I've definitely come home heavier!  The two photographers spend all day taking photos often capturing you unaware which in turn makes for some lovely natural pictures. These are then put on a screen for guests to look through at their own pleasure. No pressure to buy any. We did and at a very reasonable price.  The reception staff were also very professional and always smiling. Great first impression on arrival!  Would often see managers walking around the hotel talking with guests and it was lovely to see their positive interaction with staff.  Lots of activities to keep you entertained day and night.  The hotel runs a free shuttle bus in to Marrakesh. The souks are much bigger than we expected but good to experience and see some of the Moroccan culture.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Kensington76 wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Autumn break,Stayed here the middle of September as a couplewe really could not fault any of the services offered at the hotel.  The room was spacious very clean and well appointed the balcony although quite small was adequate for our requirements the restaurant was offering a very extensive variety of food and self service drinks although waiter service is available.  The quality of alcoholic drinks was good as was the service often drinks ready for you at the bar of brought to your table.  There are three pools one activity pool where te animators are based one quiet pool and a children's lagoon type pool with a few water park type amusements all are very well maintained there were always sunbed availability and virtually no 06.00 am towel reservists which made the whole experience relaxing.  The hotel is approx thirty minutes from the airport by taxi.  The grounds are extensive and very well kept and from what I could see are being continually revamped and improvedI firmly believe this hotel is only going to get even better as all the right ingredients are all ready in place so I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.  Do not forget there is a city tax to be paid direct to the hotel on arrival in our case for a week this was 277Dirham.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,kent uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kensington76
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Stevie M wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Excellent hotel,We are on our final day here at Iberostar Marrakesh and the hotel is the best that I have ever been to. The value for money is outstanding . We arrived at the hotel at around 11am and we were given an early check in without hesitation. When we arrived we were a little unsure on how to programme the safe so we asked the reception and somebody was at our room in a matter of minutes. The WIFI signal is excellent in the rooms (good enough to stream English television). We actually forgot our plug adaptors and within an hour the lady at reception had managed to get hold of one for us. The beds are very comfortable and the shower is lovely and warm. The hotel is absolutely spotless and the staff are always working very hard to make the hotel look beautiful. Even the room cleaners stop and say hello each day. The only problem we had was with the noise until 2/3am in the morning. I spoke to a FOH manager about this on Saturday morning and he asked what room we were then laughed and said we had a good room. His reaction left a bitter taste in my mouth. This is such a shame considering how pleasurable our star was. Today we met the public relations manager and he was very attentive and  accommodating. It turns out that he was on leave for a week before so that might be  be why we had trouble. We did discuss a little problem with him regarding our aircon and this was immediately rectified and arrived to wine and fresh fruit in our room. I would definitely recommend to friends and family. The hotel should definitely be more than the 4 stars.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ashford, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/135steviem

Weather was fab at 40oc and the hotel offers a free bus to marrakech. Once again Imad was amazing remembering the customers names we couldn't fault this hotel and it's all the running of imad.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Lucy H wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Amazing hotel,2nd time staying at this hotel and definitely just as good the second time around :)    Arrived at the hotel early before usual check in time and we were able to get to our room almost straight away. All staff are really friendly and welcoming and the rooms and hotel grounds are really clean. Food and drinks are also really good with a nice variety so you don't get bored throughout the stay.    Best thing about this hotel has to be its animation team - a special mention for Amine and Momo who were so friendly throughout our stay and encouraged us to join in with lots of activities throughout the day which really made our holiday special so thank you to these 2 amazing members of staff. Iberostar is lucky to have them. Evening shows are also good fun especially the after show dancing. Members of the animation team sit and have their meals with the guests in the restaurant which is lovely and makes you feel so welcome at the hotel.    Overall an amazing stay was had at this hotel and I hope to visit again very soon!,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyvh95

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Danielle I wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Excellent,We arrived on a sunday around lunch time. Our room was not ready and so we were shown to the restaurant for lunch. After finishing the room was ready and our luggage was taken to the room by a porter who showed us the way also. The room was spotless well laid out and well maintained although the 'all rooms have a pool garden or mountain view' was a little bit of a let down as we had 2 trees a constantly barking dog on land next door and a main road!    The food is varied there's a choice for everyone and I especially loved the specials area which changed each meal time. I would say though that staff should be aware that not everyone wants a 'snotty egg' and flipping it and taking it off the grill doesn't then mean it's cooked. I was huffed at and eyes rolled when I asked for it to be cooked longer as it was still raw! The cocktails however leave a lot to be desired. The daiquiri is citrus fruit and very tart and the pina colada is not like one back here at home. We found a lovely chocolate liquor on the menu that we stuck with. You were served almost immediately when at the bar and there was a bar by the quiet pool and a wagon by the main pool which served snacks as well as drinks.    The pool areas were well maintained very clean tidy and staff collected rubbish regularly throughout the day. Although there is a wasp problem which means having anything but water is risky by the pool! The lifeguards come and put the umbrellas up for you each morning if you ask.    The animation staff all clearly enjoy their jobs although I found the constant harassment of one of them slightly annoying. Grabbing my drink to stop me drinking in the restaurant and tickling my feet every day because I was busy by the pool side. I also didn't like the fact that they would come and sit with you at meal times. For me meal times are a family thing to allow us all to catch up after doing different activities during the day. The dancers were exceptional and put on fabulous evening shows without fault. The day time activities were jam packed with water polo Aqua trapeze salsa spinning etc...    There's photographers on site that come round and snap you taking part in the activities or when you're in the pool with family or friends etc and you can view these at the desk and purchase if needed although they are not in any way pushy.    There's a souvenir shop on site and also a genera shop on site both of which have closed days and shut at 6pm. I think they should open later and close later as they open for the period of time people are in the pool and I never saw anyone in the shops although we did use the general store to get some snacks for the journey home.    A family member got an ear infection whilst we were away however staff assisted in calling a doctor and arranging an appointment for us.  There are taxis just outside of the hotel and we paid no more than 100 MAD each way into marrakech during the day and no more than 150 MAD during the evening. Alcohol is not served in shops after 8pm. The market and souks in marrakech are something to experience. However I did not like it as it was like being in London 3 fold with the amount of people and mopeds just ride straight up to you waiting for you to move!    The staff are all friendly all smile and say hello or good morning/evening and we're more than happy to help us in arranging a birthday cake and a bottle of fizz to our room for a family members birthday.    My only niggles through this are the best on total citrus cocktails which weren't really drinkable and the fact that our room was being cleaned until 5/530pm each day. We did ask at reception if we could have it cleaned earlier on the day of a family member birthday as we were going out at 5pm that evening but we're told 'other people need their rooms cleaned also' I just let this comment go given the fact it was a special day for family and we had plans!

They charge 100 dirham per towel which apparently makes them gold kind of ridiculous when you have to watch your towel like something of value...    So we problem solved and went to the other pool which is heated but apparently our kids ( who are young and were just talking ) were told to leave because it is a ""quite pool"" (there were other kids in the pool and no sign anywhere to be quite or adults only) the assistant manager did this in extremely rude/disrespectful manner borderline yelling at us.    Next day we went back to this pool as the other pool was busy and cold and after they told us again it is for quite ppl only we spoke to manager who was much nicer and told us we can be there and he will add sign to change this pool and make it clear that this is adults quite pool.    They have one restaurant and when hotel is busy it is packed the lines are long and it is a process.

Iberostar have bought the rooms and main restaurant into modern day which was needed and made some great additions like the food truck and childrens pool  Special mention goes to our animation friends who we shared so much laughter with - Amine Fati Walid Sali and Nezar (very talented dancer and choreographer) - they are a very special team and Ibersostar are lucky to have them  My 2 suggestions for the hotel would be - review check in process to speed it up and suggest Abdel the animation manager learns more English  Thanks to all the team for another great holiday,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/193brigittet
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Linda R wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Beautiful hotel fab holiday,We stayed here from 11-18th September 2017. Beautiful hotel which was spotlessly clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. The animation team were amazing always happy and polite. Nothing was too much for them. Upon arriving you need to pay your tourist tax. We paid 417 Dirham for 3 people for a 7 night stay (about £11.50 per person for 7 nights) we also paid 100 Dirham to hire a beach towel this is refunded at the end of the holiday when you return the towel. (You can change the towel for a clean one at any time). Cocktails were ok depending on who made them. Food was varied and in abundance. Lobster steak lamb king prawns & chicken it was on the menu. Chocolate fountain with fruit kebabs cakes ice cream cheese and crackers for afters. At lunch you could either have a burger in bun or go the restaurant. BBQ's were laid on regularly. The Moroccan restaurant was lovely with amazing service. I came home 5lbs heavier 😱. There are 3 pools. Quite pool(looked at it but never stayed round it) main pool where we stayed. The team made sure there is something going on every day but they don't force you to join in. They had big bed areas around the pool which you could sunbath on as well as regular sun loungers. Alway a bed available. If you wanted one of the big beds you had to get there early. There was also a children's pool but most stayed in main pool. They had table tennis 5 aside archery and trapeze and gardens to walk in. There was also a TV showing football for the footy fans. Two small shops. One selling ornaments the other clothes and a few essentials. Little overpriced. There was a dance show every night. The team put their all into the shows. There was also a singer by the bar area playing piano most nights and a night club. Karaoke was the best night by far soooo funny. The whole holiday was lovely and relaxing. My only criticism was that the pool water was a little cold. Once in you got use to it but would have been nice not to shiver.  I would definitely go back,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Warrington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280LindaF
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sophia O wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Beautiful Summer Break,We stayed at this resort in June this year and had such an amazing holiday. The hotel itself is immaculately clean and beautiful. It is set in expansive grounds with plenty of places to recline with a drink and relax. My partner and I am more likely to sit by the pool and read a book than take part in the daily pool activities; so the 'quiet pool' was our preferred place to lounge. There are ample sun loungers and shaded areas to take a break from the sun. In addition freshly made juices and drinks are bought around regularly to keep hydration levels up which is an absolute must in the sun.    The staff of the hotel are a credit to the establishment and in particular the kind customer relations manager who outstandingly remembered all guests names. The staff were friendly and always had a smile and a greeting for you. The staff mainly speak french so a basic understanding of it will assist you; though my partner did not struggle. We stayed during Ramadan this year and I genuinely do not know how they managed in the summer heat without becoming irritable. The management all look professional and respectable in full suits which is quite the contrast to holidaymakers in their summer wear! In the hotel grounds typical summer wear is appropriate whereas outside of the complex more conservative clothing is a must.    The food is great and there is not a day that passed where I did not eat Tagine!! Thinking about it now is making my mouth water; and it definitely beats the 5 minute cous cous that we have on offer in the UK :). As with most all inclusive holidays it can get slightly repetitive but I implore you to eat the Morrocan food on offer as it is genuinely outstanding.    There is a prebookable shuffle bus which drops guests off in Marrakesh for those that want to visit Jamal Fna or the Majorelle gardens; this is our only word of warning. Please be careful when getting off the bus as it is perhaps a 15 minute walk from the drop off point to the souks. Upon getting off the bus you are immediately accosted by 'hotel representatives' who will lead you to the sites (in the wrong direction) for a fee. This is pretty typical in the souks but it can be a bit of a shock to the system to be immediately approached by these persons who can seem quite convincing. I wish we'd been warned of this beforehand.    Overall if you're looking for somewhere with guaranteed sun and a hotel complex where you can relax and have a bit of a laugh with the entertainment on offer - this place is for you.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophiaautumn

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,mm_screen wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Amazing stay... Thanks you,We stayed at this resort for a week in the last week of August. It was a good experience.  Have to say that the staff at this resort works very hard. Kudos to them.    We were greeted by Ikram and Imad on arrival and it was a very warm welcome. Imad is very friendly and always in a courteous mood to keep the guests comfortable.    If I have to pick something I would state the following. Should not be seen as something against the resort but more as some areas for improvement.  a) The activity program and schedule could be advertised a bit more. Perhaps give a copy or specifically mention it when checking in.  b) Food is good and a lot to choose from… but still after the 4th day it would become a bit monotonic so some more rotation may help. The decor ninth restaurant can also be worked on The walls can have some color as currently they are very bland.  c) The restaurant is very tidy and continuously cleaned so clean and very hygienic. A little issue with the house flies sometimes. Perhaps some Some control on the flies in the restaurant would improve it even more. May be investing in some fly due traps etc.  d) Bar staff is amazing and always friendly. The bar area can be more cleaner though… perhaps some fragrance in the cleaning liquid will help.  (e) The lobby area should be air-conditioned. It is always a bit warmer than other areas.  (f) Sofa area on the second floor over the lobby does not look inviting. Perhaps some redesign may help.  (g) Our booking was for a Double room with garden view. Not sure if it was as it faced a side of the property and some parking. I did not raise the issue as we were very tired on arrival and wanted to settle.  (h) The Palm shop lady is friendly. I guess could keep a few items like travel adapters and playing cards. (For both we had to go into the city)  (i) The courtesy bus service is great and very reliable. It would be great if it also had a stop in the medina area in addition to place of freedom. It will help the visitors.  (j) Evening entertainment is a great addition. Abdel and team work very hard and quality is good. Minor feedback on very high contrast on the large display screen which Abdel resolved the very next day.    We have been to many resorts all over the world and have to say that this one would be in the top quartile for me.    Our overall experience was very pleasant and nice.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Eve W wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Group holiday to Iberostar....Absolutely fantastic!,We went on a group holiday to Iberostar Club Palmerie for one week in September 2017. The hotel staff were friendly and approachable at all times and they could not do enough for you. The hotel manager Imad was very welcoming and was pleased to help with any queries we had throughout the week he was also very accommodating in arranging rooms nearby the rest of our party.  The bar staff (particularly Mohammed and Yassine) were friendly and always smiling and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them they really made our time in the bar comfortable.  The entertainmet staff were on hand all day and night to ensure we were all having a good time they arranged activities throughout the day and really worked hard to ensure all the guests were getting involved and having a good time. Sali Neysar Fati and Amine were especially great and really made our visit memorable.  The professional dancers and the entertainment team put on a show every night that was both varied and ineresting to watch and once again they all ensured that we were able to get involved.  The cleaning and gardening staff were also very polite and helpful and the hotel and the grounds were in great condition the rooms were spacious clean and well air conditioned and the balcony provided a nice spot to sit and appreciate the surroundings.  I cannot praise this hotel and the staff enough and would highly recommend staying here on a visit to Marrakesh. The entire staff were friendly helpful and welcoming and this really made our trip one to remember.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/535evew

Including the poolside food truck (thanks mustafa!)  The pools were clean and had plenty of things to do surrounding it and if you prefer the quiet life then check out the Zen pool and bar for a more relaxed atmosphere.  I need to shout out Imad the hotel manager who was always around to help with anything you can throw at him!  Also the bar staff (mohamed yassine and all the others!) Were beyond friendly and really made me and my family feel at home.  The star friends (animation team) were brilliant all week (shout out to sali amine and naisar) getting everyone up and involved answering any questions and making us feel at home once again.  The entertainment was out of this world with professional dancers who were not only great to watch but also friendly and approachable!  The cleaning and gardening staff were friendly too and ready to help.    Staying here was an experience me and my family will never forget and we will definitely be back!

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Bootnecker wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Great All Inclusive Hotel with outstanding service,Out travel out was via was via Ryanair and probably cannot expect more but with Ryanair these days you don't even get a seatback pocket to temporarily store things in and with just as little leg room as if you had!! Flights were on time. Luton was slow going out but quick on return and very slow inbound to Marrakech (RAK) but much faster outbound although numerous checks were made from Bag drop to boarding aircraft - far more than is normal which I guess is encouraging.    Transfer to hotel from RAK was chaotic to say the least and took considerable time. Return journey was much smoother and on time.    Fantastic service exemplified by Imad (CRM) through virtually every attendant or bar-person. Very wide selection of food; drinks also great were local varieties but of very acceptable quality - wine beer tea coffee unlike some All Inclusives I have experienced in the past. It did however become a little repetitive after a week! Entertainment was great and continuous if you wanted it. Facilities were also fantastic - pools (but see note below) golf table tennis. tennis beach volley-ball football Boules archery kids park etc. Apart from Imad (an exceptional Manager) special mentions go to Halima (main Hotel bar) and other bar staff Mustaffa (outside Bfast/lunch) and the golf pro who cured a bad swing habit of mine!    Spa treatments were good and quite reasonably priced although the white coated manager Naim(?) was a rather rude individual.    The Marrakech shuttle bus was useful and we used it twice but don't expect it to hang around on return pickup - they don't count out/back numbers but return by taxi only 150MAD. Marrakech visit(s) were awesome if somewhat intimidating but we used a guide for 170MAD and he looked after us (as well as his mates!) - he met us off the coach shuttle. Food and entertainment (belly dancing) at Comptoire Dana very highly recommended. Experiencing the driving in Morocco is entertaining to say the least and best done with the eyes shut for those who are nervous!    Issues: Wasps were a bit of an issue at meal times if eating outside and some days just laying by the pool. We were never stung thankfully.  And the supposed adult only quieter pool was frequently occupied by children some unaccompanied which because the pool was smaller was a bit of pain. Toward the end of the week our pool attendant became much more proactive in removing or constraining the more unruly offenders including talking to their parents if accompanied.  Overall a wonderful experience made all the better by the superb Imad and the myriad staff attending to daily/hourly needs.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Eastleigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bootnecker

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,154mims wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Wonderful,My partner and I had a short five day trip in August. The hotel was full but we were looked after beautifully by all of the friendly and helpful staff. Special mention must go to Immad who went out of his way to look after us (buying us a forgotten adapter and getting it to us the next day) and make us feel individual and special. As a couple we chose to frequent the Zen pool during the day and the outside bar at night - avoiding the loud busy pool and entertainment. Perfect for us to relax and unwind. The food was excellent in quantity and variety and the Moroccan restaurant outstanding - the soup was out of this world! The complimentary bus into Marrakech was also excellent. Although our room was spacious well appointed and clean is was VERY close to the outside stage - we could even see it from our balcony! So it was very noisy from 8pm - 11.15pm at this time the entertainment always stopped promptly. However if I had been travelling with my children this would have been a bigger issue. This aside all else was as wonderful as we'd hoped for and we'd certainly recommend the hotel to others as well as return ourselves.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/154mims

The grounds are well kept the staff can't do enough for you the activities are different (try the trapeze) and the food is amazing. Head chief needs a pay rise. The evening entertainment wasn't for us but other families loved it.  Book a couple of day trips out. I can recommend jumbo tours. The quad bikes through dirt tracks leading to a beautiful lake was exciting bit not for the faint hearted. The historical tour gave us an insight into Marrakech.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,LaBrujita43 wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Family Holiday in Morroco,Six of us stayed here for 12 nights from the end of July until the first week in August as all inclusive guests. The hotel is lovely and immaculately clean. There was some confusion initially over our rooms (3 of them) not being next to each other but after asking to see the Manager Ahmed rectified the situation for us. The rooms were clean and bright and fully met our requirements and the grounds of the hotel were lovely and very well maintained. The majority of the staff were superb ranging from the Manager to the waiting staff and cleaning ladies always helpful friendly and attentive. The lady who works in the Zen pool bar was regularly rude somewhat disappointing when compared to the fantastic service from other staff.  The pools were big enough and very clean there was normally a shortage of Sunbeds though as the hotel was full most of the time we were there. The food was super with a huge variety of fresh dishes every lunch and dinner time with a good range of salads and vegetables. Breakfast was good. Drinks were nice especially the Mojitos! The daily evening entertainment was fantastic and all of us enjoyed it including two moody 13 year olds. We never used the Kids Club but it looked like all of the children who did attend had lots of fun when they trooped by.  The free transport down to the town and back was good and we utilised it a few times. The driver was friendly. Overall we had a lovely stay here and would highly recommend it. It suited our needs as a family perfectly. If we were going by ourselves though again we would stay somewhere quieter as it did get hectic when the hotel became busier although I think this can be said of all hotels at the height of the season.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"La Alcaidesa, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaBrujita43

They are constantly asking you if you need anything and making sure everything is as you wish. I would recommend this hotel to anybody wishing to visit Marrakech.

Jad who looks after kids from ages 13-17 was great at making my kids time here a blast. He took them to a disco in which they played games etc. The animation team were amazing at keeping the kids occupied and held many activities for them to do. Meanwhile the kids were off doing their activities me and my sisters went to dance with Sali (an entertainer). They had shows on at night after dinner where the little kids have a mini disco and some terrific dance shows. The service here I've found no where else.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,hannahlsmith wrote a review Aug 2017,40,Overall good holiday,I think this hotel is a good 'standard' all inclusive it was excellent value for money for a few days away in August. We had a lovely break and would recommend the hotel to others who want to relax and perhaps do a bit of exploring too.    Food - The food in the main buffet restaurant was fine there was plenty of choice and we always found something that we liked. We went to the Moroccan restaurant (one per stay) and really enjoyed the food there although it wasn't a menu choice as we'd expected but just a set meal choosing between fish or beef for the main dish (not really catering for vegetarians either). The service in there was fantastic and we were looked after well. The main buffet was extremely busy during peak times and sometimes felt a bit chaotic it seemed that there weren't really enough staff to cope with the number of people so sometimes we had to wait for tables to be restocked with cutlery and glasses to be replaced at the drinks station etc. There was also a snack truck which offered burgers and hot dogs at lunch time and then crepes and waffles later in the afternoon. Again this could be quite chaotic and stressful as it was very busy and quite small! A big thank you to Faissel in the lobby bar who remembered our order and had our Sangria waiting as soon as he saw us near the bar!    Pools - there are three pools: main pool (where there are activities all day) 'quiet' pool (see my notes below about how 'quiet' it was!) and then a small splash pool for children. We mainly used the quiet pool and the bar there was fine it was quite basic and seemed to have a wasp problem but generally fine and did what we wanted. You could get pool towels from the hotel for a 100 dirham deposit per towel which you got back on check out.    Rooms - rooms were lovely very tastefully decorated and felt quite luxurious. As I mention below there is a minibar which comes stocked with water but no tea and coffee making facilities. The bathrooms is lovely and spacious and well equipped. Also plenty of space with two huge wardrobes. Safe in the room is free to use TV is huge (although not many English channels) balcony is not massive but big enough for two chairs and table so does the job perfectly well.    Getting out and about - we ventured out of the hotel into the city centre a few times. There is a free shuttle which goes into the town about 5 times a day but you have to book this 24hrs in advance which means you have to plan ahead for how long you will be (which can be difficult when you're just exploring a new place!). This drops you in 'freedom place' which is in the new town however the things we wanted to explore were all in the old town which meant that we had to get a taxi once we were there. After this first trip we ended up just getting a taxi straight from the hotel to the old town as it was more straightforward for what we wanted to see. This cost about 150 dirhams each way and took about 20 minutes. We went to the souks and recommend (although quite chaotic and non-touristy so beware of this) and also saw Ben Youssef Medersa (recommend this if you want to see a snippet of traditional Moroccan culture and don't mind walking around the small local backstreets).    I do think there are a few small and minor things that would make this hotel vastly more luxurious/enjoyable that I want to suggest:    1. Relax/quiet pool - we used this pool most of the time because we wanted to chill and enjoy peace and quiet but found that sometimes it wasn't so 'quiet' as there were lots of children jumping in splashing and shouting (as children understandably do). Perhaps this could be an adult only pool so that it's easier to enforce the 'quiet'. There also seems to be a shortage of pins to hold the umbrellas open which means it can be hard to find a spot with a working umbrella! The lifeguard did a great job of make-shifting a pin with a lollypop stick but not ideal.    2. Mini-bar and in room drinks. There is a mini-bar which comes handily stocked with a big bottle of water which was great to have in the room but we found ourselves wanting a coke or a soft drink in the room sometimes - maybe a wider selection of offerings? There are also no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which might have helped with this.    3. Staff friendliness. Most staff were happy to help and were friendly but I found that some staff were not so accommodating. As it is largely French speaking guests most staff speak fluent French but not so fluent English. This wasn't really a problem as we could usually communicate what we wanted to but it sometimes meant that staff could be a bit rude by having a conversation across you to another guest in French while they were serving. For example we were booking in to the Moroccan restaurant at reception and whilst the staff member was taking our booking she had a conversation across us to a guest behind in French which felt a bit rude. This happened at the bar and snack bar too!    Overall I think this a great hotel for a short period of time and we had an enjoyable stay but lots of little tweaks would make it excellent for us.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahlsmith
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,LondonMrd wrote a review Aug 2017,50,You will NOT be disappointed.............we weren't !!!,Having just returned last week after spending 6 days in this wonderful hotel I could not recommend it enough. We travelled with 3 boys (9 9 & 6) and elderly parents more so to celebrate our fathers 80th birthday.    We were not disappointed from the moment we checked with speed in which this was done and then off to our clean spacious and modern garden facing rooms. We had 3 all next to each other which made it easier to ensure all 9 of us were together most of the time.    The main buffet restaurant always had an abundant of choice despite that as our mother is a vegetarian one of the main chefs was always to hand to make any particular dish she fancied which was VERY nice of him/them. You were always greeted by a smile by all though one was always there to greet us and this was Karim. If we did not see him he made a point to come and find us to ensure everything was ok...........which truth to be told it always was.    Mustafa who looked after the table outside was always there to greet us with a smile and always ensure a table for 9 was made available. This service was continued throughout our stay and by ALL members of staff such as Salah in the outdoor food camper van along with Abdillali always running around getting drinks from the bar and bring them outside.    Throughout the day there were lots of activities for all to do (including kids) from table tennis archery football and various water activities. The animation team were fantastic and always got everyone involved from young to old even during the foam party on the Friday. The evenings were also fun packed with varying themed shows by evening animation team which were held in the open-air theatre and very enjoyable.    Despite the above the highlight of our trip was when the surprise birthday cake organised by my wife & sister for my father's 80th was brought out. Karim and the entire animation team brought it over singing 'Happy Birthday' and not only that but each one personally wishing him for which we are extremely grateful and will not forget this........MANY MANY THANKS !!    So all in all you will NOT be disappointed with this place as ALL the staff make it such a wonderful place to spend your holiday in and given its only been a few months since Iberostar took over this place it can & will only get better :)    I'd like to end by saying a BIG THANK YOU to you all (from all 9 of us) you made our trip a very memorable one more so with the added birthday celebration which I'm sure my father will not forget in a hurry.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonMrd
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,LondonTravellerUK91 wrote a review Aug 2017,20,Good hotel but words of warning (!),I came and stayed in this hotel with two friends at the end of June for one week and whilst our experience on the whole was great (the majority of the staff are brilliant the rooms are clean and the facilities are really well maintained) I did feel the need to write a review mainly as a lesson learnt that I can share with anyone else who goes here.    We used the safes for our valuables the entire trip until I forgot on our second to last night to put away a diamond necklace that I had been wearing that evening and some cash. When I came back to the room the next day having spent the day around the pool I immediately noticed that my necklace and the cash were no longer in the room. Conscious that I didn't want to accuse the hotel staff without looking in the room very thoroughly I turned the room upside down to try and find the necklace and cash (despite knowing exactly where they had been left but thought perhaps the housekeeping may have tidied it away).  Once I was confident that the necklace and cash were definitely not in the room I then went down and spoke to the staff about the situation.  Now I'm keen to say that I fully accept the fact that a lot of the responsibility falls to myself for having forgotten to use the safe on this occasion however the way that the situation was handled by the hotel management was appaulling. I was accused of lying then had our room searched upside down whilst a woman stood in the room saying what a mess it was and it was no surprise things had gotten lost in here (it had not been a mess prior to turning the room upside down in the bid to find the stolen items) and then told that I should feel guilty they were going to sack the member of staff who had cleaned the room - exact wording being 'Are you happy that I will sack her tomorrow?'  I was then told to go to a neighboring town to obtain a police report at 10pm where the deputy manager told me 'it would most likely not be useful as they wouldn't speak English' but whilst also offering me no further support with the situation despite the fact that at this stage I had repeatedly stated that it wasn't about the accusations it was about working together to find a solution to the situation.  Long story short the police wouldn't help at all stating it was not their business the deputy manager left the hotel despite saying he needed the report (to sack the cleaner) which I'd been sent off to the police station to get and then the manager assured me that he would look into it and be in touch once he had more information.  I've been back in the UK for 1 month now and despite two emails asking if they had any update on the situation have heard nothing back.  In conclusion use your safe and if you have anything stolen from your room; be prepared that they will not help you to solve the issue will accuse you of lying and will not accept any responsibility.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonTravellerUK91

We arrived in between lunch and dinner so the restaurant wasn't open "" no problem we will open the kitchen and prepare whatever you would like to have"". That was the start of what can only be described a truly wonderful experience nothing was to much all the staff were friendly greeting each and everyone with a smile. Our room was spotless and refreshingly cool from the Moroccan heat and the hotel and grounds were immaculate.  The only thing I could have a bit of a niggle about was that all food and drinks seemed to be sugar based which is not great for a person like me who doesn't have a sweet tooth at all.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,donnal965 wrote a review Aug 2017,50,FABULOUS!,My husband and I stayed here between the 28th July and 4th August this year after much deliberation on which hotel to stay in we chose the Iberostar Club Palmeraie following excellent reviews on trip advisor. We were travelling without our children and were looking for something special within our budget. We were not disappointed!  After a rocky arrival with regards to our room NOT being ready and having to wait due to a late check out of the previous occupant! our room was comfortable spacious and extremely clean as is the whole resort the management particularly Imad and the rest of the management team are very conscientious and take great pride in their guests comfort they would check on us daily and remembered our names went above and beyond to restore my faith in our decision to stay here. The hotel is a little way from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech however they do offer a free shuttle bus. This is just what we were looking for [a nice quiet hotel]. We arrived on my birthday and was treated to a bottle of champagne birthday cake and sang to by the animation team in the restaurant that evening. The staff there are extremely attentative and would particularly like to mention Halima and Fassial in the lounge bar whom quickly realised what we were drinking and these would be poured/served to us without having to utter a word but with beaming smiles Halima was exceptional and her friendliness ensured we were like friends. Rachid and Rachida in the restaurant and also the Moroccan restaurant couldn't do enough for us. In all fairness all the staff ensured that we were made to feel special and all would acknowledge us this to made us feel valued and our trip enjoyable. Whilst we stayed away from the main pool [our choice....more busy/loud] we always managed to get a sun lounger by the Zen Pool which also had it's own pool bar. The buffet style restaurant had great variety food was varied hot and flavoursome.  This hotel is definitely worth a visit and we will return!,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Borth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnal965

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ronin_maastricht wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Look no further!,This resort is beautiful with spotless modern rooms and amazingly kept gardens but what sets this resort apart from the others we have visited is definitely its staff. We would like to give special thanks to Imed who tended flawlessly to our needs. For him 'no' was not an option and he worked hard to remember who we were and checked up on us daily.    Although I am not a fan of buffet restaurants the staff really worked had to prepare various and delicious dishes. The buffet was continiously restocked and cleaned. Abdel (chef terras exterieur) was fantastic he always made sure our dinners were very special with his eye for detail and infinitive smile. Chef Mamadou himself brought baby meals to our 10-month old daughter!    The highlight of our 5-y daughter was the Star Club she loved to have dinner with her friends and to dance on the sophisticated stage afterwards. Special compliments also to Mimi and Aïcha of the Star Club who made it extra special for her. The whole animation team was great but we would like to give special thanks to Momo who danced with our baby girl multiple times.    The only thing I could think of as a point of criticism was the amount of wasps around the pool area. Me and my daughter were both stung and around the foodtruck there must have been >100 wasps continuously buzzing around. Maybe something could be done about this even though I recognize that its difficult to completely solve.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,546jean1957 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Amazing week in Marrakech,I visited the hotel in July 2017 for one week with my husband daughter and friend and we were extremely surprised!  We arrived around 10PM and were greeted by the very polite and helpful reception staff. The restaurant was open for late arrivals too which was great.    The food in the main restaurant was an exceptional buffet with plenty of choice and variation each day. The Moroccan Day/Night was one of our favourite days for the food! Thankyou to Laila and Samedi (morning/afternoon staff) for your excellent service as they went the extra mile for me and my family throughout the whole week. All bar staff are great too and very good at remembering our drinks.    There are two pools the Zen Pool if you want a little peace and quiet and the main pool with music and more entertainment.    The animation team were excellent especially MoMo and Jad - well done to you for your great energy and humour! Throughout the day there is a variety of activities my favourite was Aqua Gym with Samedi thankyou! A highlight of our holiday was the afternoon parties such as Mojito and Mousse Party! The entertainment and dance team were great at entertaining us!    The evening shows provided by the professional dancers were amazing! They performed in variety of shows such as Brazil Bollywood Disco and Around the World! Amazing choreography and such beautiful costumes! Well done to the talented Carina Michaela Denna Rony and Gabriel for your hard work such a brilliant professional dance team!    After the show we went to the hotel club which is open until 1AM. Some nights the club was not busy but thank goodness for the DJ Oussama! We loved his music as he played current music with good mixes too. He was great and even gave us the names of his music well done and thankyou!    Overall we had a great holiday! I cannot fault anything! The highlights of our holiday was staying in a beautiful hotel the staff were very friendly and the dance and entertainment team were excellent.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,donna172002 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Fabulous Hotel,Myself and 2 friends stayed at this hotel between 11th and 18th July 2017 and we were impressed with everything.    Upon arrival the bell man loaded our bags until we checked in. The reception staff were very helpful especially advising what to put on our check in forms im relation to entry number etc.  One of our friends arrived at the hotel on s different shuttle as we booked separately and upon asking the staff where his room would be located they advised he was close and we ended up with rooms next door to each other.    We arrived after 10pm after Dinner sittings had finished but reception advised us where we could find some nibbles which was appreciated.    Rooms are lovely. Clean tidy decent size and the shower was amazing (which all ladies will appreciate - decent pressure to wash hair and was a decent size etc.)    Pools were clean and spacious plenty of sunbeds to pick from. We spent our time by the quiet pool but often wondered over to the main pool to see the entertainment while enjoying the food truck that is situated there.  The kids pool/area looked amazing and so refreshing.    The selection of food and drinks were great. Looked forward to every meal and the selection of fruit salad and vegetables was good to see. The hotel provided pasta dishes pizza as a norm but the selection of hot meat cold selection and morrocan dishes changed with every meal every day.    Staff at the hotel were polite and always happy to help. The bar staff knew your drinks after a couple orders and nothing was too much trouble for them (cleaners and management).  Would I did like was that management and the owners were always on site walking around not only to ensure everyting was running smoothly but also chatting and mixing with customers.  All staff worked as a team and ensured all areas were cleaned constantly.    The facilities and entertainment at the hotel were A glass. Gym had great equipment (instructions in French but we worked it out). The daily activities carried from volley ball to spinning and even trapise. Evening entertainment was great sometimes focused towards the French nationality but this was predominantly the nationality in the hotel. However we still enjoyed it and the light music held outside near the main bar was enjoyable and relaxing.    The gardens are always beinging attended too and are so green. Each morning we had the pleasure of hearing and seeing the gease on site was great to see.    Overall this hotel was fabulous and we would recommend this hotel to friends and family and would return again.    Thank you to the hotel as our holiday was fun and relaxing.

Super clean hotel nothing to say about it to see how clean it is one person clean it up the pool chairs everyday one by one.    2 pools 1 for resting 1 for animation really good.  Kids club available with activities during all day it seems they are separated by ages.    The food is varied even for vegetarians easy to find something different to eat during the stay.    Animation team always helpful.    The Client manager Imad amazing person it suits up for the job always asking if anything is needed or if something was wrong even asked for recommendations to implement in the hotel.    Laila at the restaurant always available to help super fast worker super smiling waitress.    For the price we paid and for the amazing time we passed its a must go hotel.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Mel_R4 wrote a review Jul 2017,40,Fun in the sun!,I stayed here from the 10th-17th and had an amazing trip! I was actually due to stay in another hotel but due to extremely bad reviews changed over to this hotel and I am so glad I did.    The hotel itself is beautiful lovely open plan grounds secure and safe and lots of places to explore. There are three pools a kids pool a quiet 'zen' pool and the main pool where the daily entertainment and activities take place. The pools are clean and unlike some all inclusive resorts where you have to fight to find a sun lounger there are plenty around. No chance of being bored with activities such as water polo volleyball trapeze swings archery etc. There's also a free shuttle bus in to the city and an excursion desk for any adventure seekers with trips like quad biking and mountain climbing!    The animation team are the best! So much fun and really make your holiday that little bit more enjoyable. Shout out to Jad Muhamed Amine and Feti who were fab.  Food was great although a little repetitive at times.    Only negatives I can think of was that the reception staff were a little rude and unhelpful at times. Also the language barrier can be a little tricky at times. It didn't concern me as much as I'm fluent in French but maybe scrub up on a few french phrases just in case!!

The staff in hotel were some of the nicest people I have meet on a holiday they can not do enough for you from the moment you arrive till you leave and are on hand to help with any issues not that there were any.  The animation team were super very talented  who made the holiday they seemed to care about everyone not pushy if you did not want to join in it was fine but there was always things to do they work so hard at making your holiday feel special and I was amazed how hey managed to keep going as it was a long day for them and hot!!!!  The best bit for us was the kids club I myself and daughter in law along with my grandson zach well iv been to hotels were if you are lucky you can pop them to a club for a few hours oh no not here they take them from 9.00till 17.00 the kids all eat together then at night meal time 19 15 them on to disco kids club Zach loved it so we got time to enjoy some peace and he had a ball !!! Unbelievable these staff do an amazing job looking after them.  At meal times the animation team like to sit with the customers and we enjoyed a few meals enjoying hearing about there thoughts for the future I for one wish them all the best in there future.  The manager was around everyday spoke to all guests by name !! Always asking if everything was ok very nice touch.  Even though there are a lot of French in hotel and some staff struggle a little with English we never found it a problem and all the kids managed to understand each other as did he adults.  I could write loads more about all the staff and hotel but I would ru out of time !!!

He ensured he made himself available to check our stay was going well. We felt listened to and attended to. I was really chuffed when I returned to the hotel room on my mothers birthday to find that the staff had put roses and a heart with a special birthday message for her. they also left two glasses and a chilled champagne bottle which made my mothers day particularly special.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,keithcrewe wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Iberostar has worked very hard to turnaround this hotel!,Just returned from this hotel after spending a very relaxing week there.    The hotel.......Two storey buildings set amongst beautifully maintained gardens with a childrens' pool an activity pool and a very quiet zen pool.  Lots of different activities around the gardens ie tennis courts trapeze exercise bikes golf and archery to name a few.  The hotel is gated and guarded by security they also patrol around the grounds which is very reassuring.    The staff.......Obviously all retrained under the Iberostar flag after the dreadful reviews from the previous owners.  The managers set a fine example to their staff being very helpful and courteous at all times.  Special mention to Immad who even walked around the pools to introduce himself and offer any assistance or advice. When you meet him again he amazingly remembers everybodys' name and I mean everybody!  Almost without exception all the staff are very cheerful chatty and courteous.    The restaurant......Caters for all nationalities hot and cold buffet style something for everyone in a very relaxed cool atmosphere. There is an outside dining area for those who prefer alfresco    The entertainment.......There always seems to be some activity happening throughout the hotel and the guys and girls work very hard. If you have children they will have a ball here.    The rooms..... We were located down the end near the zen pool. The rooms are very generous with beautiful bathrooms and are cleaned spotlessly every day The beds are huge and very comfortable. Flatscreen TV's with a few English speaking channels.    The shuttle bus.........From memory I think it runs into Marrakesh about 5 times a day with a return which is a free service.  The bus stops about a 25 minute walk into the medina or if you walk into the other direction to the newer shopping mall and shops its about a 15 minute walk.  Top tip catch the 9am shuttle for a more relaxed and cooler stroll around the souks after 11am it gets very hot and the square gets much more populated with obviously more hassling.    Conclusion........ Iberostar have done a first class job with this hotel but I have a couple of negatives  To me the face of the hotel is the reception staff and we did not find them as cheerful or as helpful as the rest of the staff. They could be more welcoming and consistent..  There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms as a suggestion a machine could be located in each block. A five star hotel should have this facility.  My third negative is the fact that Brits are being targeted for this hotel and its still predominantly aimed at French speaking people. The Thomas Cook desk for excursions for instance does not have English literature. We also attended a show one evening and did not understand the compere as it was in French. The next evening was a star friends show which was also French speaking. We did not attend any other shows. I was told by another Swiss Karaoke loving guest that the karaoke songs to choose from were also predominantly French and he was very disappointed.  All in all a fabulous stay and fantastic value for money.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,plymouth uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithcrewe

Some stuff I didn't realise before I went: There are multiple pools multiple bars handy shuttle service to the town and LOADS of stuff to do on site (trapeze spin classes archery entertainment theatre spa etc etc).

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Sam G wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Really impressed!,My girlfriend and I spent a week here in June 2017 and were really impressed. The room was spotless and really comfortable. All of the hotel staff were friendly without being too intrusive and Imad from customer services was exceptional in his level of attentiveness to everybody - he learned our names and checked in with us every time he passed to make sure we were happy and when he overheard that it was my girlfriend's birthday he arranged for champagne and a freshly made cake to be sent up to our room. It was a really generous gesture and totally made her day.    The grounds of the hotel are really well maintained and very attractive to walk around. We visited during Ramadan so the hotel wasn't as busy as it could have been - however all the staff were so brilliantly attentive and working so hard that I expect even at peak times any guest would be well looked after. The activities pool does have its noisier periods when activities are happening throughout the day but there's a quieter pool to retreat to if that isn't your thing. There's a wide range of food available throughout the day and the evening buffet rotates through lots of different options to keep the all-inclusive options varied.    We were also surprisingly impressed by the quality of the evening entertainment - the dance nights were lots of fun and really well choreographed and even the cheesy moments were enjoyable because the staff were obviously having fun with it.    The hotel is a really pretty and well maintained one but it's the staff that left us the most impressed. It was just the sort of relaxing break we both needed and we couldn't have asked for more in terms of how well we were looked after.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987samg

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Pearly wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Amazing !!,After being transferred from a dreadful hotel this place was paradise! From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty! Drinks on arrival whilst waiting for our room cold bottles of water ..very impressed within a few minutes. The room was immaculate bathroom spotless towels smelt fresh fridge fully working with bottles of water could not fault it. 3 pools one lively with full entertainment programme chilled out pool and children's pool. Staff brought drinks to sun loungers and towels available for hire. Food was excellent bright airy restaurant spotless clean and plenty of choice! Deserts were amazing!! Wine served to table if required. Morrocan restaurant is definitely worth booking into - the food was fabulous and service 5 star. I would like to personally thank the following staff Iman (the manager) for his constant customer care - everyday he was going round the pool checking everyone was enjoying their stay. Also Mammadou (chef) couldn't do enough for you if you had specific dietary needs. Walid entertainment manager for his constant good humour and jokes Jad for his archery lessons and Mohammed for his excellent bar/waiter service (his mojitos are unreal!) I personally could not fault this hotel or any of the staff and I admit I am very fussy with high standards. To conclude security is high on site plenty of officers patrol day and night so I felt safe walking around evening entertainment was excellent also there is a nightclub from 11 pm to 1 am where staff go after their shift. It was lovely talking to everyone and we made lifelong friends here. Please don't hesitate to book a break here - we will definitely return !,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Darlington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235pearlw
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ftill123 wrote a review Jul 2017,30,Wanted to love it; not amazing but not bad,Reading the rave reviews I was so excited to stay for five night; the hotel was an average all inclusive.    My main annoyances at the hotel;  No gowns or slippers in the rooms (it's 40c outside yes but in an air conditioned room it's nice to have these)  No tea or coffee making facilities in the room  No TV listing guide  Our toiletries were not replenished on a daily basis; I had to find house keeping one day to ask for more (not really something you should have to do if the hotel really is 4*)  So many wasps outside!  Some of the pre-prepared meals at the buffet had no ingredients listings  Other guests using the incorrect serving implements for meals and causing meat cross contamination (not sure what the vegetarian who stayed here loved about plain pasta but I found the vegetarian food very boring)  Some nights at dinner it was like a zoo other nights you had table service    Plus points for the hotel;  Friendly staff  Beds were comfortable  Wide selection of drinks available at the lobby bar    I would also like to mention that on the shuttle bus into town all three times with different drivers they seemed to stop and pick up their friends (non hotel guests) this made me a little uneasy as you weren't sure who was on the bus with you.    I would lastly like to suggest the hotel does private hotel run transfers to and from the city or around Marrakesh. This service was really lacking again if it was supposed to be a 4* hotel    We would return to Marrakesh but probably not to this hotel,Date of stay: July 2017,,"Basingstoke, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ftill123
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,ceirej wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Amazing 4 nights,Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of July and had the best time. The rooms are really nice spacious. The food is great both in the buffet everyday and at the Moroccan restaurant. One of the girls I was with had a very bad nut allergy and the chef couldn't have been more accommodating. Chef Mammado showed her around the buffet everyday so she knew what she could eat and everyday made her her own cake as she couldn't have desert. All the staff were very accommodating and will help you with whatever you need. There were plenty of activities put on by the entertainment team which were all loads of fun.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceirej
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,nikkibairdmurray wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Brilliant hotel with brilliant staff,Me and some girlfriends have recently got back from a four day stay at this hotel and honestly couldnt fault it. All the staff were so friendly and we were welcomed as soon as we walked through the door. Our trip was made slightly more difficult as one of my friends has a severe nut allergy this was mentioned at check in and she was immediately taken to meet the chef (Mamado) who advised her of what she could eat at every buffet. He even made her a special dessert at every meal and we all really appreciated his amazing service.  During the day there was a lot going on at the hotel and the animation team (Amine Rasta Morad Abdel and Walid) ensured that there was never a dull moment (there is also a quiet pool to relax) and offered a range of activities such as archery trapeze aqua gym water polo football and volley ball. They were always very friendly and enthusiastic and throughout the day and night ensured that you were having the best time.  All the staff in the hotel were amazing and all seemed to take pride in working there which they really should. I am already looking at planning a trip back next year and really looking forward to it.  Thank you everybody for such a lovely holiday.,Date of stay: July 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Krabi Province, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkibairdmurray
Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,sheldonv1 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Excellent hotel,We arrived here from staying in an awful hotel in Marrakesh. This hotel saved our holiday. As soon as we walked we were welcomed with a smile and cool drink. The staff are very friendly and can't do enough for you. The rooms are very well looked after spotlessly clean great air con tv and fridge also in the room. The hotel has a main activities pool with the entertainment on the go all day there is a quiet pool which has its own bar and a kids pool also. The food was good varied choice everyday. The only small draw back is the location is out of Marrakesh but the hotel put a bus on daily so you can go into town.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone really enjoyed our stay.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newton Aycliffe, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheldonv1

Food was really good and would definitely recommend a visit to the themed Moroccan restaurant. Both day time and evening entertainment were fab and enjoyable. All the animation team was amazing - especially Amine Walid who were all so friendly and made our holiday fun and one that we will always remember.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Cherry S wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Perfect first holiday with a baby!,My partner and I spent a wonderful 4 nights at the Iberostar Palmeraie with our 10 month old baby. From the moment we arrived all of the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. They went out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Our room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. They had even given us a travel cot for the baby! All of the steps in the hotel had ramps so it was easy with a buggy. The swimming pools were excellent. Particularly the kids pool which was great for a baby and in parts was shallow enough to crawl in.  The food was really good especially all of the tagines and grilled meats at lunch and dinner. The restaurant has lots of highchairs for all the children and there is plenty of choice for kids whether you have a fussy eater or not!  The entertainment in the evenings was really good and of a high standard.  Overall we were really impressed with everything and the holiday could not have been easier or more stress free! Highly recommended,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50cherrys

We are not easily impressed but the Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech was far superior to the other 4 star hotels we have stayed at in Marrakech. The hotel is architecturally magnificent and we particularly appreciated the quiet Zen pool.  Have never seen such happy staff and were treated like honoured guests. Mealtimes were elegant but relaxed with a very good variety of food on offer.  We were impressed with the courteous and professional guest relations manager who often walked around the hotel rather than hide in an office.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Lizzie A wrote a review Jun 2017,50,Just what we needed - thank you. 😊,Booked through Voyage Prive little bit apprehensive as it was our fist booking through them but we needent have been nervous. The hotel was lovely. Met on arrival around 11am to a fruity drink and sweets whilst we checked in.  Tip - don't forget about the tourist tax around £20 for our five night stay  Our room was ready on arrival and a kind porter bought up our bags.  Lovely room massive bathroom with large rain head shower! Cute little balcony and the all important air conditioning!  The managers are very visual throughout the hotel Imad especially - making sure to personally welcome you and remember your name!!  Food is lovely catering to the mass market with lots of option but a little repetitive. The Moroccan restaurant is a must beautiful food and great atmosphere.  There is a food truck by the pool that serves drinks all day and food in the afternoon - on the first couple of days it was really busy and wasps everywhere. We mentioned this to the management and the next day was 100x better. More chefs and staff to wipe the tables every half an hour or so.  We were a little nervous about heading into Marrakech itself however with the complimentary shuttle bus we decided to head in Imad again had given us tips on how to get around and what to do - thank you so much for this! It was a amazing experience the Souks are everything you imagine. Well worth a trip in!  The smaller pool we preferred it was quieter and ideal for a chill.  Activities - although there aren't too many there was just enough for us we tried archery table tennis and the golf the instructors were really helpful Hassan especially.  I would thoroughly recommend this place and would definitely return.

Iberostar Club Palmeraie Marrakech,lbro wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Great time here - trying really hard and it shows,Stayed here for 3 nights in this week. Booked this very last minute after the reviews at the hotel we had planned to stay at were so bad we cancelled.  This hotel is a little way out from the airport and a top tip would be to book a transfer before you get here - the taxis at the airport will rip you off.  Arrived at 11am and were greeted with drinks and sweets. Our rooms were ready and we were checked in really quickly after paying the tourist tax.  The hotel and grounds are really clean with lots of facilities. Rooms were a good size and beds were very comfy. Shampoo etc in room and a small hairdryer.  Plenty of sun beds available on the first day - much busier the other 2 days but we are up early so not a problem for us.  So what do they need to work on to get a 5 star review?  Drinks  Pool bars. One by the main pool does not do a good selection of drinks. So you end up in the main bar and they give you a glass to have by the pool. With the water polo and volleyball we saw several of them smashed.  The pool bar by the other pool did not have beer?  They need better quality plastic cups. It was so hot the thin plastic wasn't sturdy enough.  Also when you get a small plastic cup of beer quite often it was 2 inches of beer and 2 of froth.  Ice and rose wine ran out one of the nights in the restaurant.  Would be nice to have some sparkling wine for a bucks fizz in the morning at breakfast.  Food  Quite repetitive even for 3 days - maybe a theme night would help?    But the good things by far outweighed the negatives above.  Really enjoyed our meal in the Moroccan restaurant that you need to book a day in advance - beef tagine was gorgeous.  Some lovely little touches here. The fruit drinks that the staff delivered to the pool the cooking display and the cocktail party with canapes by the pool.

The hotel was extremely clean and tidy with authentic decor. Both the hotel and grounds are beautiful. There was a range of foods on offer each night in the main restaurant with the option to have pasta and meats cooked freshly infront of you. The majority of the food was the same each lunch and dinner time though. We were allowed to book into the Moroccan restaurant for one night. The meal was delicious! The barmen around the resort were great and very friendly specifically Abdarahim who made us smile every day! The 'Star Friends' had a great impact on our stay and really made the effort to make everybody feel part of the fun. Amine and Jad are great entertainers and noticeably worked very hard.

We spent 11 days here in June.",Having recently been refurbished we were a little apprehensive but when we arrived and was met by Imad Khoudar any doubts disappeared immediately.  He made us extremely welcome asking our names which he remembered for our entire stay of 11 days always asking how we were and if he could assist in anything then just ask. All the staff were extremely helpful and accommodating and never once made us feel uneasy..  We would like to say thanks to all the waiters especially Rashida who served at breakfast and lunch she was always ready to serve drinks and greeted us like friends every day .  Amine and Mimi in fact all the animation team who were always polite and helpful.  Morad on the trapeze…. yes trapeze (which we were unaware of beforehand) helped Rose overcome her fear of heights and completed 2 sessions.  The evening entertainment who were so professional where you could see such a lot of work had been put into the show .  The food was fantastic there were so many choices we were spoiled for choice.  The cleanliness of the rooms where of the highest standard clean sheets and towels in abundance.  We felt extremely pampered and felt our needs were catered for throughout our holiday.  Well done to everyone at the resort.
