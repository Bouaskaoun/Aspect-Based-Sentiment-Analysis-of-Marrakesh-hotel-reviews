Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sajni wrote a review Mar 23,50,"Great family holiday, will be visiting again!",We visited Marrakech to celebrate my sisters 21st birthday and we had an amazing time. The rooms were clean and tidy upon arrival and we were sent a welcome plate of food to our rooms later that evening. The food options for breakfast lunch and dinner at the Atlas restaurant were plentiful with lots of vegetarian options to choose from. There was also a good variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The waiters were polite and helpful and worked quickly in serving drinks and removing plates from the table. The housekeepers did a good job and kept the rooms clean and tidy and the whole resort was very clean too.    The Animation team were great and provided different activities during the day. We did aqua aerobics salsa dancing shooting and took part in a cooking class. They also provided fun evening entertainment which involved the team putting on shows and performing dance medleys. A special thank you to Bouchra and Touria who were so thoughtful and remembered that it was my sisters birthday and made her day/holiday special. Also to Sam Ismail Abdel and the rest of the Animation team for providing great entertainment!    The hotel provided a free shuttle bus service to the Souks which was useful and had to be booked a day in advance. We also travelled to Ourika Valley which is a must visit! We booked the trip via the hotel and had an amazing day out. Thanks to our driver Syed who was friendly and was telling us information about the surroundings as we were travelling. And to our tour guide Mustafa who was patient and helped us as we hiked to see the Setti Fatma waterfalls.    All in all we had a lovely time in Marrakech and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. We'll be visiting again!,Date of stay: March 2023,,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sapar_7

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ken H wrote a review Mar 16,20,"Poor Hotel with awful service - good golf courses, but unfriendly staff apart from a couple.",Golfing trip to Morocco in March with 3 friends originally booked for Kenzi Palace but they cancelled at last minute so had to rebook for Kenzi Club. Check in was unfriendly and we had blue bands put on our wrists for the all inclusive option. Bags taken to our rooms OK on golf buggies. Rooms were tired and in mine there was no bath plug cracked sink and the bath had a patch on it for a leak. The Air conditioning was not switched on the whole time we were there althoughit was up to 35 deg C during the day. Management decided it was not yet hot enough to save on electric !! Food was average at best and service in the restaurant was poor with plates not collected and cracked and chipped crockery. This hotel would only make 2 star at best let alone supposedly 4-5 star. It's also full of French chavvie types beautiful people they are not.    No entertainment at night apart from kids disco until 21:30 in the bar ( whoopee). No Baileys equivalent as in Turkey and the only free drinks were cocktails wine and beer. There was no coffee after dinner in the restaurant. The pool area was crowded and had some horrible boomp boomp music going most of the time so not peaceful at all. Golf thank fully was OK and so we were out most days but even they didn't provide water and you had to buy it in the Golf Club bar even though buggies cost 450 Dirhams ( 35 euros) !! After haveing been to Turkey loads of times we decided we had been spoiled and so would NEVER go back to Morocco again. It's awful.    Golf club ratings were    Fairmont Royal - Very Good nice staff  Samanah - Good staff not friendly  Palmerie Golf Rotana - Very Good nice staff  Al Maaden - Fair ( unfriendly staff)  Assoufid - Excellent with excellent staff  Royal Golf - Good course - terrible staff,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Wokingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenhD6716ZT
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ammi S wrote a review Mar 14,20,Hen Party,Spent the long weekend as a hen party with my group of friends!  Food with great and plentiful & the animation team provided lots of great entertainment! The bollywood night was amazing and loved the effort they made with us! The spa & massages/hammam are worth having as we all loved this experience.  The hotel looks beautiful on the outside however we felt it could have been maintained to a better standard.  We were very lucky that we had beautiful weather on the weekend ; 33degrees in the day and dropping to 17degrees in the night. We were horrified to find out the hotel did not have any aircon in our rooms and we roasted through the night! We begged/asked reception to put the aircon on however they kept on stating it was ‘Morrocan winter’?! We ended up sleeping with our balcony door open hoping insects wouldnt come into the room. We found out they do not put aircon in the rooms until May. If we had known - we would never have booked this hotel in the first place.  We also had a leak in our bathroom (room 630) which caused the bathroom to flood - we asked reception to fix this however we were ignored. We only had one day left so we didn’t wish to cause a fuss. Unfortunately the next day the leak was so bad it has leaked into the bedroom in which I did not see this and slipped on the floor & sprained my right side of the body. When going to reception - we were ignored & told to go to the restaurant to get ice. By this time we had given up & left for our flight.  Overall - i had an amazing time with friends but the hotel needs to rethink how they treat their guests when it comes to housekeeping.,Date of stay: March 2023,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ammis2015
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Nirav P wrote a review Mar 12,50,Beautiful Holiday with Amazing Entertainment,Amazing beautiful & stunning…. These are just a few words that describe our holiday. The food the music & the atmosphere was majestic.    We were truly blown away by everything from start to finish.    A special mention goes out to Ismail(Smiley) for making our stay a fantastic memorable one. Ismail really went above and beyond to keep us entertained and smiling throughout our entire stay. From water aerobics to the special Bollywood night Ismail is a true gem and asset to Kenzi club and we will be coming back because of him. Ismail thank you for birthday surprise…. We love you!!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Chuck V wrote a review Mar 2,40,Would keep on visiting - great place to chill,This is my fourth visit to this hotel. Good facilities lots of grounds to walk in and the heated outdoor pool helped at this time. Our flight arrived late so we got to the hotel late on first night (after dinner in the restaurant had finished) and the hotel arranged a spread for all the late arriving families in the moroccan restaurant which was really needed and appreciated. Staff are very helpful (and more engaging when speaking in French but still fine). Last day leaving was waiting for the transfer and one of the staff ran out to check if I had left my handbag inside hich I did -he was a life saver as it had my passport and it had already been kept securely behind reception. Would keep on visitinglovely place clean and range of food was excellent.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/319chuckv
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Joe T wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Excellent all inclusive winter break,Superb hotel facilities nicely spread out in lovely well maintained grounds. Heated pool a must for February! Weather in the evening on the Baltic side but wonderful 22/24C during the day. Food choice and availability excellent - generally self-service but with added support from friendly staff where needed. Looks like a nice place for children in summer. Special thanks to reception and checkout personnel who were most helpful during our stay. 15 Mins from airport and 20 mins from centre of Marrakech.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Dún Laoghaire, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joetP5064PH
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,otp71 wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Calm oasis in the hustle of Marrakech,The hotel is spread out across several buildings giving a spacious feel to the place with a large area for a heated pool adjoined by a pool bar plus a non-heated pool with water slides which are turned on for some hours of the day. Artwork decorates common spaces and the whole resort has a distinctive and I would say local style that is very pleasing to the eye.    All inclusive meals are served in the Atlas restaurant with quite good and changing variety of both Moroccan and international foods to cater to many tastes. A definite plus was that drinks were by default brought to the table by bottle which cuts down on the hassle of getting more to drink. All in all service was very good overall although information of the resort's services could've been clearer. And bear in mind that since most of the tourists in Morocco are French also the children's club evening disco etc. are mostly geared towards French speakers.    The hotel graciously offers a shuttle bus to the city center and the taxi to and from the hotel seemed to be 50 dirham so quite cheap. One case where the taxi comes in handy is if you want to see Djemaa el-Fna by night as the last shuttle bus leaves at 19.00 already from the city center. We also booked a tour from the tour agent on site and the Ourika valley tour was a great experience even if the climb to the waterfalls took its toll on our thighs.    The thing that we'd like to see improved the most is the Wi-Fi coverage since it varies a lot by where you are in the resort plus also seems to go out randomly from time to time so it definitely could use an upgrade.,Date of stay: February 2023,,"Espoo, Finland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/otp71
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lee m wrote a review Feb 2023,50,"Fantastic hotel, amazing people",I can honestly say this is the best place I have ever been too from the moment we arrived at the hotel your every need was catered for. The staff were amazing and friendly and nothing was ever too much trouble for any of them. You ask for wine you get a bottle 👍 fizzy juice you get a bottle 👍 real cocktails 👍 food for everyone and the entertainment first class. If you wanted to relax you can and if you wanted to join in there’s lots of activities to do. We even decided to go out at night and the security wanted our taxi drivers name and registration (because they care) I can’t name all individuals 1 by 1 but there all amazing yousef in the bar and zweena lol in the restaraunt thank you. Only issue and not really a problem was it says WIFI in every room it was very rare you got it at all.,Date of stay: February 2023,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8569INleem
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Aneta K wrote a review Feb 2023,50,All inclusive 4 days break (4 adults),From the moment we entered the Kenzi Club to our last day we have been truly spoiled. The weather was great 24C in January! As two couples we were welcomed with a smile the staff members were attentive and no ask was too big for them. At times we felt fussed over drinks were coming regularly (no restrictions) and there was an option for non-alcoholic cocktails as well. The bar staff and evening entertainment were superb. The children were at the hotel but the animators were going above and beyond to keep them entertained and happy we could see that the kids really like them. It seems like a great family hotel with two swimming pools and some outdoor areas (eg. exercise bikes). The hotel offers a free bus to the Marakkesh medina we booked our spaces at the reception as this needs to be done in advance The SPA services are also offered at the hotel. There is a small zoo and a veg garden. We have been impressed that most of the staff speaks English French Arabic Spanish Portuguese and German.  Thank you to all the staff at the Kenzi! You are all amazing!,Date of stay: January 2023,,"Fakenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/639anetak
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,catp71 wrote a review Feb 2023,40,Great all inclusive vacation,Had another wonderful stay at Kenzi club Agdal medina where nothing is too much trouble. The hotel staff from reception to house keeping to grounds staff bar staff restaurant staff are warm and friendly. Animations team as always working hard to keep everyone entertained even when the sun isn’t shining. Restaurant staff Fettah Mohamed Youseff and everyone who helped us with food and drinks were amazing. Nothing is too much trouble. Shout out to Simo kids club abdel ismail and Sam. The hotel is having a bit of an upgrade and the restaurant looks fabulous the bar too when it is completed. Only comments - the pool bar cushioned seating has never been replaced post pandemic and it would be good to see this back as the bar would have more ambience. Secondly it would also be nice post pandemic to have the changing facilities restored it was always nice to have a shower if late check out wasn’t possible and travel was late at night. Otherwise another brilliant and enjoyable stay at Kenzi club Agdal medina. We will be returning in a few weeks.,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,guernsey,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catp71
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,D PR wrote a review Feb 2023,20,Definitely not 5 star,We are currently staying in Kenzi club. We have to say this is definitely not a 5 star hotel. We are staying in the premium room with ‘ private pool’ which is actually a communal pool. This is not heated so no point if you are looking to stay in the winter months. The rooms are average poorly lit and the bathrooms are badly in need of an update. The buffet is very limited and a constant repeat meal after meal. We paid for all inclusive but ended up paying to eat outside as we could not eat the same food again and again ! The wi fi signal is poor throughout the hotel. Looking through some previous reviews it appears it is a constant issue but the hotel simply fobbed us off by saying this is a temporary glitch. The buffet restaurant is the only option available for all inclusive and the tables are not cleaned properly after we found many times the cutlery provided not fully clean. The facilities in the room are also bare minimum. They provide you with shower gel and shampoo and that is it. If you are used to other good quality five star hotels that provide you with slippers/ hair conditioner/ tooth brush/ shower cap etc then you are in for a disappointment! There are limited ways to entertain yourself if you are here in winter as the bar area opens only after 5 so we found ourselves stuck inside our dark room frequently. The drinks are average. Oh and you don’t have any room service option. The location and the hotel grounds are fine but these are the only 2 good things about this hotel!,Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee-Aoron2
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Foodie 34 wrote a review Feb 2023,50,Birthday break away,From start to finish we were blown away by how well run the resort is we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was amazingly large and more than enough space for two of us. Every day we had good food in fact it’s one of the nicest all inclusive resorts I have seen every single member of staff from reception to restaurant staff bar staff and animations team went out of their way to ensure each and every guest had the best time at the hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Arun V wrote a review Feb 2023,20,More like 3*!,"I wonder how this hotel is classed as a 5* hotel!    The rooms are quite dated and less said about the bathrooms the better. The WiFi was shockingly bad even in the communal areas (reception bars etc) and was worse in the rooms.    There is only one restaurant that comes included with the ""all-inclusive"" package - this is a buffet restaurant. There is a Moroccan restaurant for which you have to pay a supplement or 3 other restaurants where you have to pay in full like anyone else. The food in the main restaurant ranges between good to acceptable but I wish there were more dining options where you can have a sit-down meal. Like the rooms the main restaurant looks dated and is no where near the standard of a 5* restaurant.    The hotel settings are fabulous though - set in the midst of serene olive gardens with palm trees and cacti you can easily lose yourself to their beauty!    It is not a bad hotel but it could be lot better!",Date of stay: February 2023,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArunV431

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Alex L wrote a review Jan 2023,30,Nice but was nicer before,This is my second stay at the Kenzi and we went in a more quieter season so the resort was a nice level of busy.    We arrived 20-30 minutes before the end of lunch so we were given out wristbands and told to have some food and then come back and they will check us in.    The restaurant was under renovations so the food choices were more limited compared to last time I was there but still a good selection with a different theme every night and on the days it didn’t rain they had a selection of meat cooked over an open flame.    One of the night it seems they had either a coach trip staying for dinner or maybe they take bookings for people to use the restaurant as it was rammed with the staff struggling to keep up with demand.  We had to share a glass but there was no water or drinks available and we were advised to go to the bar if we wanted drinks but the bar was unable to provide us bottled water either.  Clean plates were not coming out fast enough and I did not have a knife for the first half of my meal.  I went to get some of the meat from outside and when the chef put some lamb or beef out the crowds would push and grab with their hands and I was left with a bruise from bring rammed into a table and didn’t get any meat.  The staff did their best but they were under prepared for the level of people.    The room was nice and cleaned daily but the shower hose was broken so it would spray the walls when in use.    The entertainment in the evening was slightly limited with it mainly being Kids disco with the same songs every evening which seems to be all in French but I think most kids wouldn’t care as they can just have a dance.    The daytime activities sounded interesting but when asking several members of staff where to go for the shooting and archery we were told they don’t understand English and even after wandering around the site we were unable to find where these activities were held.    Drinks were as expected of an all inclusive but premium drinks could be purchases in the lounge bar which was a very nice atmosphere and I wish we had gone in there earlier in the week.    I would stay somewhere else next time as I feel this visit was not as nice as the first one and that my ability to speak and read French resulted in a much worst service from the resort and the staff.,Date of stay: December 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Enfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atarisrocks
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,mickeybUK wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Excellent hotel,We stayed for 1 week on all inclusive.  My wife is presently in a wheelchair and the flat layout of the hotel made it very easy to get around.  We requested a room close to all facilities due to the wheelchair use and that's exactly what we got however it was still far enough away that there was no noise intrusion. Luckily we were upgraded to a suite giving us ample room.  Our room was very large with a very large bathroom with separate shower and a further separate toilet. The room was cleaned every day. There were a couple of minor maintenance issues such as a socket which had seen better days and was unusable and a minor damaged door but these did not cause us any problems.  Food was plentiful and tasty with numerous hot and cold offerings at each sitting. We never had a problem finding suitable food and tagines were available at every meal. We were outside in the sun for breakfast outside in the shade for lunch and inside for the evening when it was a little chilly.  Drinks were easy to access either at the pool bar during the day or in the main bar area of an evening. There was plenty of options available although they did run out of gin on one evening!  All staff were very friendly with the restaurant staff being outstanding they could not do enough for us and would help with any issue without quibble.  There were 2 pool areas both very large with one of the pool being heated during our stay (the other was a bit too chilly). Plenty of sunbeds available as this was a quiet time of the year.  Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend.,Date of stay: November 2022,,"Nuneaton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickeybUK

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Francesca G wrote a review Jan 2023,50,Fantastic hotel and team. The best holiday!,We have had the most amazing experience at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina.  Every aspect of our stay was fantastic.  The hotel.  I could take 100 photos of the place and not do it justice I definitely walked around for the first day with my jaw dropped. Everything is designed and kept beautifully. The rooms are lovely with a private balcony (not that you need as there's such a great atmosphere in the common areas). The restaurant bar reception and pool areas are stunning and kept immaculate.  The team.  From the second we walked in and were greeted with Moroccan tea the entire team at KCAM work hard around the clock to deliver a brilliant experience. No matter the job role; front of house cleaning security gardening catering photography entertainment every single member of the team work hard and are so lovely and welcoming. It is a huge team and we did not meet a single person who didn't at the least smile and greet us as we passed which genuinely made it a nicer stay.  The food.  Wow. It was hard to stick to only 3 plates at each meal but my stomach begged me to. The restaurant offers a generous variety of foods for all meals; there's different tagines salad bars stonebaked pizzas pasta dishes sauted vegs fish meats numerous specialities depending on the day's theme and of course a dessert bar. It's so hard to list it all. Everything was so fresh and flavourful.  There is a snack bar at the pool which I thought would just be the basics like crisps and snacks but there were freshly cooked omelettes sandwiches a full salad bar pastries and freshly cooked pancakes and doughnuts (definitely try the doughnuts).    The animation team.  These guys are incredible. They work so hard to give everyone a great experience. From 11am they're putting on activities such as archery aqua aerobics poker dancing darts volleyball and so much more.  In the bar on the evening they put on a different show each night some requiring the odd participant and they all make it such a fun time.  I would highly recommend joining in with some of the activities or dancing on an evening they make you feel so welcome and forget any embarrassment.  We were able to play games and have a great time with other guests without speaking the same language at all thanks to the animation team getting us all involved translating and creating a great atmosphere.    Spider Bouchra Ghany Sam Siham Saad Morad Bankos Xeneb and all the team.

Honestly the best value ever! Without exception every single member of staff was delightful. They just couldn’t do enough for you! The buffet meals were varied and delicious. The ‘a la carte’ Orangerie dinner was an extra few pounds but a great experience. The facility was clean the room nice and bed comfortable. Special thanks to the entertainment team for being fun and friendly without being pushy especially because the idea of participating in anything usually fills my husband with cold chill horror but he also thoroughly enjoyed himself.

There are several pools one of which is heated (awesome thing in January). In my opinion (and tastes do differ) the food was delicious. For dinner there are theme nights - it does not get boring. The cleaning staff (Amen in particular) was also very helpful.    In short would recommend :),Date of stay: January 2023,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jansG8320BG

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sarah K wrote a review Dec 2022,20,Disappointing,Definitely not a 5 star hotel. The amenities may be nice if you’re coming to Morocco to golf or play tennis but the individual rooms are terrible. For reference we stayed at another 5 hotel that was half the price earlier and so much better. First the entrance doesn’t look like an entrance. Second our room had no iron or ironing board no conditioner or no vanity care set (not essential but usually what you expect in a 5 star hotel). Our phone didn’t work. Our thermostat didn’t work. Our room had spotty Wi-Fi at best which was a 10 min walk to the reception desk. Overall disappointing.,Date of stay: December 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahkZ5312LT

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Scott F wrote a review Dec 2022,40,"many positives, one or two minor negatives",First the positives  This is a very comfortable  clean hotel with spacious accomodation. Rooms are laid out amongst beautiful gardens and are well equipped . Rooms were cleaned every day and beds changed towels changed on request.  Food is good and plentiful especially if you want to try the local dishes on offer for the less adventurous there is a good selection of British style food. vegetarians will find plenty of choice also  the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful nothing is too much trouble and most have a terrific sense of humour. this is one of the main pluses of the hotel.  We didn't sample the evening entertainment as we were in the Medina every evening soaking up the local nightlife so can't comment on that however some people we met spoke well of it. the daytime animation was centred on the pool with a lively team.  Any negatives?  If you have mobility issues be warned there is a lot of walking to be done to get around the complex...some rooms must be at least 800 metres from the main buildings if not more. There is a shuttle available  but not always....you have to ask at reception if you want a ride. So if walking is an issue ask for a room near reception.  As the complex is so large it's easy to get lost as well...reception give you a map but to be honest it's not much use and in tiny print.  When we stayed late November) the daytime temperature hovered around the high 20's and the a/c was switched off. Not a huge problem as it gets chilly at night (bring a couple of layers)  the complimentary shuttle into town is bookable a day in advance though we found space the same day. However it drops you near the Katoubia which is a fair walk in the main square the jem El fnah...so again if walking is an issue get a taxi from outside the hotel which will drop you wherever you want to go and cost you about 50 dirhams  though they will ask for more. Agree the price BEFORE you get in and the right price will rarely if ever be the first price they give you...HAGGLE. The hotel is in a pretty isolated spot about 4 kilometers out of town..a 10/15 minute ride.....so if you want to investigate the town which is a MUST...you will use taxis a lot.  make sure you don't lumber yourself with a lot of dirham when you return as you won't be able to change it back in the UK. The exchange rate in the hotel was 11.1 Dirham to the pound when we were there however if you are in town there is an exchange place just off the main square...you can't miss it as it has huge neon lights advertising their rates which are far better. 12.5 to the pound which makes a big difference if you're changing a lot.  When you check out you will be asked to pay city tax....all tourists have to pay this and for one week for two people it was about 270 dirhams...you can pay by card or use up your spare dirhams if you wish. |  Tips...most of the waiting staff porters etc don't earn much so tipping is welcomed though no pressure is put on you. We gave a tip ate the end of our stay to those who had given us good service (which was just about everybody) they were very happy with 50 dirhams each  On the whole we enjoyed our stay here very much.....some reviewers have mentioned the lack of English spoken....I speak French so it was wasn't a problem but English was also understood by reception staff and the animation team and most of the waiters...so no real problem. If you try out a few french phrases or even Arabic they will be delighted. Enjoy!!,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottfD5773GJ

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,flowers403 wrote a review Nov 2022,30,Nice November break 😊,We visited the Kenzi for one week our first trip to  Morroco we travelled with Travelzoo.  Overall pleasantly surprised as it was a special offer. Advertised as a 5 star although I feel this is slightly misleading however for the price we paid it was certainly adequate. Found some of the reception staff a little uninterested particularly when it came to our transfer back to the airport  Which did not arrive!! 😬 Having said that Oussama  was extremely helpful when we need our tickets printing 👍  The pools were lovely with plenty of sunbeds. Entertainment staff work particularly hard  Restaurant and food good 😊 lots of choice and staff very friendly and helpful particularly Youssef  Who went above and beyond and made our stay extra special ⭐️  My husband suffered with “Travellers Tummy” 🤢  can’t honestly say where this came from!  But I must mention Imiele from housekeeping (Room320) who was particularly kind to us in our hour of need a real asset to this hotel 🤗  If your looking for a no frills reasonably priced accommodation this is a good heads up 😊,Date of stay: November 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hertfordshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowers403

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LORNA M wrote a review Nov 2022,50,couples holiday November 2022,Wow this hotel was brilliant I would most definitely return!    Reception - greeted very politely given all required information. Nothing was too much trouble very accommodating and lots of good accurate advice to the guests about travelling in Marrakesh.    Food - We only visited the main buffet restaurant and snack bars. So many fresh food stations cooking various foods. lots of Moroccan foods amazing flavors and so much choice! Desserts again had endless choices and the doughnuts and waffles freshly cooked at breakfast and snacks were amazing! Lots of choices but no kid food such as chicken nuggets (so if you have fussy eaters you may need to speak to the hotel directly in advance)    Waiting staff - all very respectful polite good English and very attentive. They would always take away plates as soon as you had finished would always top up drinks and all done with smiles!    Security - Always present at the front door day and night very helpful and friendly. Would assist with taxis and any issues / problems with transfers or tours not arriving on time for collection. Very approachable staff!    Cleaners - Spotless! the whole room was cleaned every day! floors mopped bins emptied beds changed and made with pretty covers. Bathroom completely cleaned including cleaning glass door for the shower sink toilet and new towels.    Maintenance - Always working hard but would interact with customers and be very friendly. We did not have any issues that needed reporting at all.    Entertainment - Always busy during the day interacting with people (no children were present when we stayed) playing cards dancing aqua pool games shows quiz nights all in English French and Arabic.    Facilities - absolutely first class. Everywhere was spotless! so many swimming pools and endless sun loungers all with thick leather covered mattresses on for comfort. Sun lounger begs with canopy's to protect you from the sun and giant family sized beds located around the pool! You would never have an issue locating a sun lounger here - even peak season.    Restaurant - we stayed all-inclusive and the food was amazing all drinks included. Main restaurant was so big there was never as issue of locating a table. They were all set up for the next guest as soon as anyone left.    We didn't use the gym spa al a carte restaurants or the bar so I can't really comment on these but we did talk to people there who had used them and they said they were fantastic!    Bonus here was the shuttle into town - but you had to pre book the day before and a cash machine on site that did not charge for withdrawals!  I contacted the hotel before we arrived to say the holiday was a surprise for my partner for his birthday. They had decorated the room in roses and made it look so pretty. They also left him a personalized birthday cake and candles and some fizzy bubbles to celebrate!    would no doubt return to this hotel it was by far amazing and the staff were outstanding!,Date of stay: November 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lornamK1830QQ

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jackie K wrote a review Nov 2022,50,Perfect for relaxing winter sun,Kenzi Club was a lovely little resort to stay at. Visited for a week with a friend we were very lucky with the weather being 30 degrees most days we were there with no rain and the odd cloud.    Food:  We only ate in the main restaurant as the variety of food on offer removed the need to try anywhere else. The selection would satisfy any guest that came with different themes each night pasta and pizza always available carvery corner was amazing. Selections of different tagines and cooked meats. This resort also caters to dietary needs with a section of steamed and pureed foods available. Plenty of fresh fruits and salads too. The waiters are amazing and tend to your every need.    Cleanliness:  The resort is spotless cleaners constantly working hard to keep the resort tidy sanitising the buffet area cleaning floors etc rooms always left immaculate. Only downside is for the entire duration of the stay majority of the soap dispensers were empty so bring your own hand sanitiser with you.    Evening entertainment:  The animation team were fantastic people however the entertainment programme itself wasn't the standard of other resorts however the team do work hard to get all guests involved and happy.    Daytime activities:  Activities in the day are very repetitive and there's not much to do in the resort outside of the set timings of the activities. If you enjoy water aerobics and dancing around the pool then great. The animation team regularly go round the pools encouraging you to join in.    Privilege:  Paid extra to stay by the private pool. You get asked to leave if you talk as this is a 'quiet' pool. Not worth paying extra for as it's also predominantly in the shade most of the day.    Staff:  Animation team were lovely and energetic however on observation most are there with 'other intentions' which is a shame as that's not what most people go abroad for.  Huge shout out to our fantastic waiter Emmi who made every single night brilliant he was so attentive and just an absolute star.  Main downside to the holiday was the amount of flies during the day bring plenty of insect repellent as you can't relax by the pool without being swarmed.

We had witnessed them filling up tap water into drinks and another couple has witnessed them putting it into the bottled water !!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,navster183 wrote a review Oct 2022,50,My Perfect Family Holiday at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,"My family stay at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina was everything that I dreamt and hoped it would be. The hotel was idyllic with a perfect traditional and modern Moroccan feel. Clean and well kept gardens and amenities. We went all-inclusive for 7 days and the food and cocktails were amazing with a different theme each night. The rooms were clean and had everything we needed. Our flight from the UK was delayed by an hour and a half so we arrived at the hotel at 11:30pm but the hotel had the foresight to put dinner in our rooms for us on arrival. The weather in October was perfect and poolside was great with towels and sunbeds galore. My 17yr old and 13yr old girl and boy were in paradise. Everyday the Animation team (entertainment) kept everyone occupied with activities. I did water-aerobics and zumba most days and felt great for it but they organised kids stuff ... football shooting darts competitions etc. I watched lots of dads release their inner child very quickly once the games started. We stayed in the cool pool but there is a great heated one for the kids. My wife daughter and I had fabulous massages in the Spa to relax and I couldn't feel my legs when I left (in a good way). Wee took the Hotel shuttle bus to the Old Town. The medina was stunning and gave a great feel for the city and the country. I loved bartering in the shops! Just remember 'Ghali bezaf'!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,John wrote a review Oct 2022,50,A Truly Excellent Hotel in Every Respect,My wife and I spent 14 wonderful days at the truly excellent Kenzi Agdal Club Medina Hotel. To tell the truth we didn't know what to expect when we made the booking despite thoroughly researching Trip Advisor reviews in conjunction with the hotel's website. We're pleased to say that our expectations were wildly exceeded.    Here are my impressions in detail:    1) Location - the hotel is situated in the Agdal district of Marrakesh in what estate agents would call an up and coming area. In other words there are hotels and apartment blocks under development in the vicinity as well as building plots awaiting development. On the hotel's doorstep is an Italian restaurant and an upmarket grocers called L'epicierie. There are a few eateries and coffee shops including a Burger King in a shopping mall about a 20 minute walk away but not a lot else any closer. From the hotel I've walked to the centre of Marrakesh in less than an hour on wide pavements alongside a busy road without any difficulties. For those disinclined to walk the hotel lays on a complimentary bus service which operates several times a day which gets there in less than 15 minutes and this made it very easy for us to go into the city several times during our stay.    2) Reception/front desk – the check in process was outstanding one the of the best we'd experienced in a long time. So what was about it that made it so good? Put simply both members of the front desk staff on duty when we arrived greeted us warmly with huge smiles on their faces and made us feel very welcome. Their friendly professionalism created a very positive first impression of the hotel. We stay on average in 25 different hotels every year virtually all in the major international chains and this experience is not as common as one would think or hope for.    3) Facilities – the facilities are definitely of a 5 star standard. The hotel complex is situated in many acres of beautifully kept gardens with the accommodation blocks known as riads well spaced so it didn't seem like a concrete jungle. There are 3 outdoor swimming pools including one specifically for what the hotel term as privilege guests (identified by orange wristbands as opposed to blue for other guests) who pay extra when booking for a number of perks. This pool is in the centre of Riad 4. There is also a beautiful spa staffed by highly professional lady therapists which is located in the same building as the hairdressers gym and turkish baths Other facilities include a good quality tennis court golf practice links an enthusiastic animations teams offering a good variety of daytime activities and evening entertainment and a gift shop.    4) Breakfast – there should be plenty to keep everyone happy at breakfast. A wide variety of food was offered on the buffet including freshly made crepes waffles and Moroccan bread as well as the usual hot and cold dishes found elsewhere. Pork bacon was on offer though kept well away from other dishes and clearly identified by a picture of a pig. We didn't expect to see this and thought it demonstrated the hotel's commitment to meeting the needs of their international guests. Also on offer on the breakfast buffet was a bottle of sparkling wine for those in need of a glass as a pick me up first thing in the morning.    5) Lunch & Dinner – there was a wide variety of cold and hot delicacies always including a good range of Moroccan and European meat and fish dishes on the buffet. Lunch usually included an outdoor grill and dinner has special theme nights featuring Spanish Italian Asiatic in addition. We very much enjoyed every meal we had in the main restaurant which meant we didn't try the Moroccan and Italian a la carte restaurants situated in the hotel.    6) Bedrooms – it is probably best to say that the photos on the hotel's website provide a good indication of what to expect as opinions on decors can be so subjective. All I will say is that we frequently book suites at other hotels and using these as benchmarks we were very happy with the suite that we were allocated. Suites have a separate sitting room larger bathrooms and an extra toilet compared to ordinary rooms all of which we found useful. We were lucky that ours was on the 1st floor and faced south overlooking quiet gardens which enabled us to sit on the balcony for several hours every day. The standard of housekeeping was high and we particularly loved the way the housekeeping staff came up with decorative creations using the bed trim.    Before finishing I would like to pay tribute to the excellent staff whose helpful friendly service helped to make our stay so enjoyable. The names we have are: Mehdi (porterage) Kawtar (Riad 4 housekeeping) Aicha (drinks kiosk for privilege guests in Riad 4) Mariam Haznedi & Abdelfattah (Main Restaurant Breakfast and Lunch) and Mohamed Ben Ammar (Main Restaurant Dinner). Our thanks also to all the members of the front desk team - we didn't get any of their names - who we interacted with. They greeted us with big smiles every time we approached them and dealt with us in a very friendly helpful manner. The front desk has the distinction of being one of the best front desk teams that we've encountered.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travellingcad

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hannah B wrote a review Oct 2022,40,Wouldn’t hesitate to go again,My friend and I were looking for a holiday for our first time away together and settled on Morocco. It was our first time here so weren’t sure what to expect.    The hotel is a short 10-15 minute transfer from the airport. It is located on a main road however once you’re in the resort you cannot hear any traffic.    Food: The food was varied and there are different themed nights. As far as All Inclusive hotels go the food was better than a lot of places I have been previously.    Room: Room was spacious comfortable and very clean. Our only issue would have been the lighting. It was quite dark and the lights were not very bright. The bed was extremely comfortable and we were left with lovely decorations each day from towel shapes to flowers.    Entertainment team: Without a doubt the best part of our holiday. If you don’t want to get involved in activities the team are very polite but respectful of this. My friend and I however decided to try different things due to not being able to leave the hotel much to explore the local area (I’m sure it would have been safe but it wasn’t advised for two young women alone). The team were fantastic and we actually made good friends with them by the end of the holiday.    Khalid: Thank you so much for everything you did to take care of us. We had such an amazing time in your company and you are excellent at your job. He honestly went above any beyond always involved us with dancing activities and took us to the local nightclub to make sure we were safe.    Smiley / Ismail: You are such a wonderful person and we throughly enjoyed our time getting to know you. Thank you so much for everything you did for us and for making us laugh on a daily basis.    Sam: Sam is such an incredible dancer and such a kind warm happy person. He always took the time to sit and talk with us and made us feel included.    Spider: The entertainment manager- does such an incredible job. The shows are amazing he came out to the nightclub with us and is one of the funniest people we have ever met. Thank you so much for everything.    If you don’t mind staying at the resort for the majority of your stay this hotel is perfect. You can do activities such as quad biking going to the market and various guided walks. We didn’t do any of these during our stay but know people who did who said they enjoyed it.    There is a local shuttle bus you need to hire the day before if you want to go to the market. We went at 9am and it was much quieter. We met people who went in the afternoon who said it was very busy- so bare this in mind if you don’t want to be hassled too much or don’t like busy crowds.    Thank you to all the team for an amazing holiday💛 We hope you liked your presents and remember us through them.,Date of stay: October 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6340ERhannahb

Food was a good quality and with enough variety to keep everyone happy.  Good selection of alcoholic drinks too cocktails and wine. special thanks to barman Amine who was amazing never let our glasses go empty and would refill us without us needing to go to the bar!    Entertainment was first class too I’m not always a big fan of hotel entertainment but this has definitely changed my mind.

We had a wonderful time and wanted to stay longer than the week. Next year we intend to go for longer. The hotel was clean well maintained and the food was lovely. All the staff were really nice and super friendly especially the fun and very talented animation team consisting of Spider Ismail Khalid Ranny Rayan Sam and Youssef. Their shows each night were amazing! A special thanks to our favourite waiters Mourad and Simo.

We had all inclusive as as a group of friends like to have a drink so thought this would be a good option. Their alcohol is not alcohol there is 0% in it. We drank all day and night and get sober still. I had to actually go to the shop next to the hotel to buy Smirnoff to put in my drinks there so I would say if you are going do not rely on the drinks there!  Also the opening times of the food and bars are confusing too and was different most days and you can’t grab any food or drink after 11.30.,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/964andih

Although there are many entertainments in the hotel day and night we particularly want to mention Sam who is a friendly encouraging and very talented break dancer. He along with the other entertainment team kept us dancing the night away. A truly wonderful holiday. for family’s couples and singles.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Chloe M wrote a review Sep 2022,10,"Discriminating hotel, will NEVER come back!",Unfortunately I’m still stuck in this hotel until Thursday never cried so much on a holiday. I have epilepsy and the entertainment play constant strobe lights normal coloured lights is fine but strobe give me full seizure’s  i was unaware of strobes was walking after  my dinner and collapsed into a seizure had one for 1  Minute wet myself and bite my tongue infront of hundreds of guests I was mortified I told reception who laughed and said don’t go to the entertainment then and started mocking me to other colleagues singing “photogenic lights” and were not in the Uk now was an awful way to be treated this was by one male name unknown and Akam.    I spoke to the manager of entertainment who said he’d change the strobe lights turn them off and just have coloured ones!    I then was sat eating my dinner the next night and oh shock strobe lights again I went to reception with two females and told them situation and what had happened and one of them laughed and said I’m one guest the entertainment is for thousands and I’m being unreasonable asking for strobe lights to change even though they can have normal flashing coloured ones it’s just strobes I said this isn’t fair on me and she started getting high rate and lunging towards me shouting and screaming that I’m disrespecting her she was very aggressive when her nice colleague walked me away she was following us and even nudged her colleague flying. I don’t understand why being born with a condition that’s dangerous and has ruined parts of my life disrespects her? And she can be so violent and aggressive! Her other colleague was very understanding but the aggressive female should not working in hospitality! When I was walking away she was telling all the staff that I’m ridiculous for wanting the strobe lights off and laughing about me!    I have had 3 seizures due to the stobe lights and feel exhausted and unwell daily due to this on top of that the service is super slow for drinks and the alcohol is completely watered down the food is awful they repeat the same things daily (pizza pasta and chips)    We’ve contacted who we booked the holiday from to see if we can move hotels for the remainder 3 days which I’ve never had to do and I go away 3-4 times a year a refund would take up to 7 days and can’t afford to move without the refund so we’re stuck in an awful hotel worst stay I’ve ever had and feel mentally drained like I’m trapped in my room because I fear being mocked or seizures!    I hope Kenzi club realise how they’ve impacted my mental health on this holiday and feel ashamed with the treatment… I’ve asked to speak to director and management 3 times and given room number 312 but nothing!! Just sent out an entertainment guy who made a false promise.    The only good thing about this hotel is the man who works in A La carte resturant and the house keeping people friendly and great!,Date of stay: September 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chloemP4395XH

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jane S wrote a review Sep 2022,20,"Second visit, big disappointment",We are here right now coming to the end of our week away here after looking forward to it as we visited first in June 2016. We emailed the hotel several times before arrival as my husband wanted to let them know it was a birthday treat for me (the day after we arrived) and a request for a ground floor room in the Privilege Riad that we had so enjoyed previously. We had paid extra (considerable amount) for an upgrade as the riad has its own pool and is supposed to be a quiet area with no children etc.  on arrival they doubted our booking to start with until we showed them not only our confirmation on our phones but also a hard copy of the booking. No downstairs rooms available we were told but we insisted as I have mobility issues. We were sent for dinner and told to return. We had been given a downstairs room in the privilege area. Great we thought!  The room had not been totally made ready - we had booked a double room but we were greeted with single beds but to their credit they did send housekeeping down to change it to a double bed and bedding. The floor was filthy and our feet were literally blackened by the dirt so asked the housekeeper the next morning for an extra good clean. Only one chair on the terrace and no tea bags milk tissues etc.  The next morning we went outside to the pool area and were greeted by the loudest child who upset all there but was asked to leave by the security agent. Great again! No - more children more screaming.  Lots of people in there that had not paid for the upgrade - you can tell by the colour of the bands. Now we don’t object to people being upgraded due to anniversaries birthdays etc (we had paid for it so obviously no upgrade available- had we known we wouldn’t have paid extra and hope for the complimentary upgrade). But we do object to many people just turning up and making use of the private pool area being noisy etc. We bought it up with reception a few times and were told the security agent would deal with it but his English was not so good and so didn’t bother making anyone leave.  We paid £280 extra for the service and privilege- we got neither and have requested a refund of that amount. Why should we pay when other people can just walk in without being challenged or paying extra? Also dealing with screaming children. We have been told to wait until Monday when the manager is back in. We leave Monday and won’t be back. The rooms are tired and have not been upgraded since we were here 6 years ago - the bathrooms are dirty and in need of a good clean upgraded baths and shower heads etc.  All in all a big disappointment- English perhaps not as favoured as other guests.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woking, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janel33

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mrsfizzle wrote a review Sep 2022,30,"Third time here, possibly the last",We are at Kenzi Club for our third visit since 2018. We have had a nice time however not as nice as previous visits. There is a group of young lads who have been allowed to constantly jump off of the wall from the bar area into the ‘quieter’ pool. They get told off every now and then by a life guard who hangs around for a few minutes until they leave and then the kids come back and do it again. They have no regard for other people who are swimming below and it is a nasty accident waiting to happen!! Why have they not been banned from the pool altogether?! When they aren’t jumping off the wall they are doing back flips right by people soaking everyone’s bags and sunbeds. They don’t listen to other guests and they don’t listen to the staff. Why is there not a lifeguard at this pool stopping it from happening?? There have been quite a few other people who have also jumped off of there in the time we have been here. Adults included.    Apart from this we have had a nice stay. The waiting staff have been very friendly and attentive the food has been good although not as good as previous visits where we enjoyed a larger variety of delicious tagines. The music during the evening entertainment is incredibly loud. We have had to stay the very far end of the restaurant just to be able to hear each other talk. They could turn the music down by half and it would still be loud enough for everyone to hear. It cannot be good for children’s ears especially when they like to be so close to the entertainment.,Date of stay: August 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsfizzle

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Traveler487245 wrote a review Aug 2022,10,Not for everyone!!,If you are vegetarian there is little to accommodate you. You will be stuck with the same limited selection daily and will miss out. Cross contamination is rife and not taken seriously the staff do not care very much about customer service and if you are an English speaker you will find that staff are either very limited or very reluctant in communicating. The guest relation desk was completely unmanned and the lady on the excursions desk had no knowledge of the surrounding area any trips or any suggestions. The cleanliness outside of bar and kitchen settings are very good. The entertainment at the resort is poor and the activities are the same daily. I had a broken lock and it was not resolved throughout my stay technicians knocking on the door in the middle of the night and trying to contact reception or any other extension from your room is a waste of time. The resort is basically decent for French or local dialect speakers who do not have any dietary requirements and are happy with sub standard customer service. Would not stay here again lots of work required to meet even 3 star status. Food area and handling need to be addressed.,Date of stay: July 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler487245

The food in the all-inclusive buffet was probably the best all-inclusive food I have had so far. There was variety in cuisine as well. The rooms were nice and cool and the staff were always helpful especially when I ended up losing my hotel card and my brother lost his bank card at one point.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jen L wrote a review Jul 2022,30,Ok,Me and my friend had a nice holiday the hotel was fine for the price. It was very busy with children when we went therefore we spent more time at the slightly quieter pool which was nice. Rooms were nice and felt spacious and comfortable. Meal times were stressful as there were no where near enough stations to serve people. Help yourself drinks which were hard to queue for very limited table service at all if we ever asked for wine it rarely turned up. The food wasn’t great for an all inclusive. I thought most things about the place was quite average but kept reminding myself it wasn’t an expensive holiday I would rate this hotel as no more than a 3 star resort. Me and my friend suffered with a bad belly on the last day so we presume it was the food we ate for dinner.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464jenl

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,HindHind wrote a review Jul 2022,40,Very good!,We had a good stay in this all inclusive hotel. We booked 5 rooms for a family gathering and it went very well.  Rooms are tastefully decorated and functional. Our mini-fridge didn’t work and got relaxed straight after we mentioned it.  Food is much better than in most all inclusive hotels in Marrakech ( and I’ve been to a few international ones in Marrakech). There’s a lot of choice and it is actually tasty. However if most AI hotels do give a chance to have a meal or two at their «  à la carte » restaurants for free we’ve been asked to pay 15 euros supplement each to have a meal at the Moroccan restaurant. That’s the only downfall.  I liked the quiet swimming pool and it is usually less popular than the bigger one.  I was not really interested in the animation so can’t comment on that.  The shuttle is really a plus and the driver is a really nice guy!  Staff is helpful and professional. You can’t fault them.  All in all thanks Kenzi Agdal for making our stay pleasant and stress free!,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HindHind
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SergandBen wrote a review Jul 2022,50,Excellent for family holiday.,We stayed here for a week with our 3 children who are almost 1 5 and 8. There was always plenty for them to do our 5yr old enjoyed the kids club and the water slides were a big hit.  There is a mini kids disco from 8.30pm with a show on after this but we never made the show as a bit too late for the little ones.  The pool is cold in the morning but you are so grateful for that once the afternoon heat hits!  Food was always lovely with a different theme every night. Restaurant staff work so hard constantly cleaning and topping up drinks.  The pool bar staff in particular are fantastic. The snack bar next to the pool is good if you miss breakfast and afternoon snacks are served there too although it gets busy. The animation team came round the pool in the afternoon handing out ice cream and fruit which was always welcome.  We paid €15 a person deposit to hire beach towels.  We were also lucky enough to be staying whilst the Formula E race was in Marrakesh and the hotel provided us with free tickets - this was incredible!  Fantastic location just a few minutes from the airport we will definitely return.,Date of stay: July 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SergandBen

From the minute we checked-in we were provided with nothing but first-class service. From the reception team to the bar staff and waiters their hospitality was second to none. However a special mention has to go to the entertainment team they’re the ones who really made the stay memorable. From the well-planned activities throughout the day to the entertainment in the evening the team did an amazing job. We regularly took part in yoga and aqua aerobics with Sam as well as dance classes with Simo and Abdel all of whom made the activities super fun and made sure to to get everyone involved. We especially loved the evening shows!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ellie A wrote a review Jun 2022,50,The ambience of Marrakesh,I couldn’t be more complimentary of the hotel and staff. We originally came out for 3 nights and ended up extending our stay twice to a total of 2 weeks. This is my second time at the hotel having been originally in October 2021 it was nice to return and see more people in the hotel.    From the moment we walked in the staff made us feel welcome. The reception desk is well attended. The bar staff in the evening are a little hit and miss but I also appreciate it does get busy and so they aren’t always able to stop and have a chat.    The animation team are incredible they work tirelessly to ensure your holiday is unforgettable. Whether it’s 9am or 9pm they always treat you with respect and kindness and will go out of their way to ensure you’re having a great time. For many of the staff English is their third language and yet they still ensured to say hello and converse with my sister and I. We have made many great friendships with the team because of how fabulous they are. We want to shout out Spider Yousef Rayan Abdel Simo Badar Ismael Namira and in particular Sam he runs so many of the activities during the day he’s patient kind and has a wonderful energy I’d definitely recommend joining in on any of the activities he’s leading.    We have made the most wonderful memories here and I will absolutely be back again as soon as possible!,Date of stay: June 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellieeaimee6

We have faced a couple of issues with our room during the stay but they were resolved almost instantly.  I believe that this hotel has the best animation team and they kept us entertained throughout the whole stay there.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ogunbid wrote a review Jun 2022,40,RELAXED BREAK,Relaxing short break the resort was very clean both inside and out. Accommodating staff we were given an upgrade to the private area 2 rooms with its own private pool bar and dining area we declined as it was too far from the centre of the resort and very quiet.    We asked to be moved closer to the main area due to having a disability which the hotel accommodated despite being full and on the ground floor.  Plenty of sun loungers and umbrella's very big and clean pools aqua aerobics was very good as was the animation team    Entertainment was good too.    The food was nice and lots of different choices they also had themed nights too. Snack bar also    The staff at the hotel work very hard especially the waiting staff and gardeners as the gardens around the resort are well kept.    Observations for the hotel  1. To label more of your dishes  2. The plan of the resort to be bigger rather than on the very small cards in green writing unable to read  3. To be advised on check-in about the departure tax and the cost.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Foxgirl22 wrote a review Jun 2022,40,Good experience apart from the food,Pros:  Very friendly staff they went above and beyond for us.  Swimming pools and surrounding areas were clean.  The room cleaning staff were incredible.  Constant taxi flow outside the hotel to head into town.  Only a 10 minute drive into the main centre.  Our room and balcony was clean and comfy.  Animation staff were very friendly.  Cons:  Our room was down the very bottom of the resort the gentlemen on the golf buggy never offered us a lift outside of arriving. There was a couple of times he drove by us in the rain.  It’s very focused around French speaking we only met one other English speaking couple there and they experienced similar issues.  There wasn’t a great selection of food and there was never any butter left out.  Cocktails weren’t great.

Here they did not there were a handful of lovely staff including waiters and the animation team but opart from this anything we asked seemed too much trouble especially at the bar.  - Great hotel if you are french - they speak very limited english and everything is in french.  - AC in the rooms not great we were quite hot most nights.  - Beds are awfully uncomfortable - so hard!  - Cocktails very limited and alcohol definitely watered down.  - No allergens highlighted so basically no gluten free choices and nothing labelled if it was it was in french only so was unable to understand what meats we were eating.  - Food quality as expected for an all inclusive but was disappointed with all the cold food as there were flies landing on it all constantly so didn't want to risk eating it.  - Had to queue for food and drinks most of the time and guests have no concept of queuing which was rather frustrating.  - Dinner starts late - 7pm which is late if you have young children that need feeding.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,freya wrote a review May 2022,50,Best trip yet,My mother booked this holiday for my 21st birthday as a gift as I had always wanted to visit Marrakech. I would recommend going if you are from the UK as it is the same time zone and the flight is only 3 hours. This is a huge benefit to when you arrive in Marrakech and you can carry on with the day with no disruption.    When we arrived we were greeted politely by courteous and professional reception staff. We found that all the staff spoke English confidently despite the majority of the visitors speaking French. The hotel is beautiful clean and modern - with lots of space to sit quietly and have drinks served. The surrounding area is a beautiful garden display of various flowers trees and green grass and is kept well by the passionate gardeners every day.    We stayed in the Riad with the pool which was beautiful surrounded by beautiful greenery. Our room was spacious clean and most importantly designed well - it is a sophisticated room I felt luxurious in.    We had a wonderful stay at the Medina with lots to do - I went with my Mum who occasionally wanted an afternoon nap and there was a variety of activities to get involved with ran by passionate and enthusiastic entertainment staff who were friendly and active in the activities. Sam Spider Tito Ronny Abdul and NouNou were all incredible dancers and entertainers who worked all day to keep us entertained. I especially enjoyed the archery and air gun activities which despite my poor performance was still really fun.    The evenings were the favourite part of my day - the food selection is vast and is fresh and hot. The food is fantastic and I enjoyed trying something different everyday! The waiters are courteous polite and friendly and kindly refilled my drink. It was a very classy dining experience and my Mum and I would often spend hours sat watching out at the veranda and beautiful gardens. There is birdsong throughout the day which compliments the views.    The evening entertainment was tasteful and enjoyable - all the staff were friendly active and got all of the audience involved and dancing. The atmosphere was relaxed and fun I felt no judgement dancing and enjoying myself. The staff worked tirelessly throughout the day bringing joy to the visitors and put on a fantastic evening variety show. I would look forward to this time of the day every day. Sam especially has fantastic break dancing skills and really put on an unforgettable show with himself Abdul Tito and Spider coming round to us and the rest of the audience to ask about our day and make friendly conversation. Again the atmosphere was fantastic and really welcoming.    There is a lot to do in Marrakech; my Mum and I visited le Jardin Majorelle went quad biking and visited the Souk and main square being greeted by all the locals with kindness. The culture is fantastic as is the local delicacies. You may find yourself not wanting to leave the hotel as you enjoy it so much but we did want to see some of the joys of Morocco!    I hope you can gather from my comments that I would highly recommend visiting this destination and hotel but I almost want to keep it to myself as a secret! I hope to visit again very soon and thank all the staff for your kindness during our stay.,Date of stay: May 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freyasl

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,dr83 wrote a review May 2022,20,I would not recommend this hotel (3 star at best) i am sorry to say,I love Marrakesh and this was the 6th time visiting the city and 2nd all inclusive. My first all inclusive experience at Les Jardins de la Katoubia.  Unfortunately not a great experience here. This hotel is 3 star not 5 star. I will try to be constructive with this review and hope the feedback is taken on board as the check out staff were not bothered about it.  Firstly this is definitely a family (kids) all inclusive hotel and catered for French speaking guests.  As English speaking adults we were basically ignored by the animation staff (although relieved). 98% French guests (some Moroccan and 3 english couples)  There are kids EVERYWHERE!  Perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of the stay was the buffet experience. The selection although repetitive was rather good as all inclusive hotels go however if you enjoy a frantic rush hour experience in London this ordeal is for you. Every meal was stressful trying to navigate the people coning from all angles acting like animals during feeding time at the zoo. No manners and queues non existent. If you like salad then this is probably a good thing as it was the only easy access stress free (go an extent) area of the buffet. Kids and parents and adults pushing in and running about everywhere! So much so we ate out in Marrakesh most days either for lunch or dinner.  The catering staff work very very hard however and i must say thank you and take my hat off to you all as you were under enormous pressure to keep on top of such un civilised and demanding rude guests. THANK YOU. The only thing I will add is the managers need to be stronger at managing the guests and preventing them pushing in and being to greedy taking things that run out and not even eating it.  Thank you also to the super super pool bar staff who were exceptional also. Very very friendly and professional.  The room was never cleaned properly. Our empty water bottles and glasses (and a broken glass) were not taken away when cleaning once. It may sound petty but they build up. It became quite a joke the two of us had in the end as we lines them up in an orderly fashion on the desk waiting to see if they were ever taken away. The coffee and tea and milk were never replaced after being used the first morning. And it was a very on the surface clean (making the bed)  The rooms need updating. They are very very basic. For us though the biggest issue was the rock hard mattress. It was like sleeping on the ground so much so we had to book another hotel for our remaining 2 nights to sleep there using the hotel during the day. We felt more tired having little sleep than when we went out there which is not what you want when going on a relaxing holiday.  The pools shut at 6pm.  We didn’t get a welcome drink of anything upon arrival (we did arrive quite late at about 2100) but we were not told about a meeting the next day to be shown around the hotel facilities and we were given no info on anything of what we can and cant do.  We were driven to the room my the porter in a golf buggy. He took the bags in (i wanted to wheel mine in myself but he was adamant he would do it) and hung about with an odd smile waiting for a tip. I said I had not had a chance to get Morrocan dirhams out he said no problem he would accept English money or could take us to the cash point. It became a bit of a stand off. We just wanted to settle in as it had been a long day of travel and it was late. It was all very awkward almost something you would see in an uncomfortable comedy show. We wheeled our own bags back to reception upon check out which took leas than 4 minutes to walk there. No tip needed in my opinion and not at an all inclusive! Although i am happy to tip and tipped on every occasion i could when it warranted and not forced upon me to do so.    The reception staff would not book anything for us they would simply hand the phone to us (the hotel we slept in arranged taxis and haggled for made bookings for us etc). They were not that helpful with any information.  There is a shuttle bus which is useful to take you into Marrakesh but it has to be booked 24 hours in advance and you will have to get a taxi back as i think the last bus back is about 5pm. We just got taxis in and back as we could go in and come back when we wanted without planning the timings a day in advance.  The spa is a rip off £10 roughly to use the indoor pool which is no e but the walls were peeling away and it was a little run down. We also paid for a hamman about £8 each for 30 mins. No-one came to get us to use it and i presumed someone would rub us down for that price so we went in ourselves sat there wandering if anyone would come in but they didn’t so we left (the hamman itself was traditional and rather nice)  Upon check out (again a guest just push in when we had been waiting and the receptionist served them even though he acknowledged we were waiting to be served to check out) the receptionist didn’t not ask how are stay was. I began to give him some feedback but quickly decided to refrain from doing so in detail as he clearly did not want to listen or indeed care.    I would not recommend this hotel to anyone planning yo visit.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,John N wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Fun in the Sun,We stayed here before in 2014 and so were returning with our now 12 and 14 year old boys. We were delighted to return and just loved the whole hotel. The food was great the facilities are all spotless and the staff are exceptional throughout. We were dealing with Saadia via emails for our bookings which unfortunately due to Covid restrictions changed a bit before our trip. Anything requested was assisted with quickly and professionally. The waiting staff in the restraunt were great Moncef was always on hand to cater to our needs.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Zoey G wrote a review Apr 2022,10,Terrible Experience!,This is the worst hotel I stayed ever in Marrakesh. The reception service was so bad and couldn’t do nothing. I booked the hotel for two rooms and should be provided with two bottles of wines as shown in my booking summary however I have made the call to the reception twice. The first time I made in the afternoon after checking in they said the wine was coming. The second time I made when I finished my dinner they said their restaurant was closed so they can’t provide any wine. And they are five-star hotels I was told that they don’t provide 24h room services. And I asked for the hotel service complaints numbers I was told they didn’t know any number about that. And I asked them to look into why they always ignore my requests they couldn’t tell me when they can give me the reply about that. And their attitude was not good and didn’t want to solve any problems for me. And I stayed here for holidays and wanted to be relaxing and happy. But the service in the hotel ruined all of my good modes. I won’t live in this hotel ever. And I can’t understand why this will be a five-star hotel.,Date of stay: April 2022,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoey619
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Stumo40 wrote a review Apr 2022,50,Kenzi Club - Stay 12 / Apr / 22 Family of 4 - 2 adults kids 9 and 6.,"Kenzi Club is a really very good Hotel and All Inclusive set on a huge estate of lush palms and plants. 15 mins from the airport and 12 mins from the city good proximity to explore the markets historic sites and gardens.  - 2 great pools one heated / one not. Couple of nice slides but not overbearing. There was always plenty of sunbeds and no battles for spots even on busy days.  - Best attribute is the attitude of the staff which is 10/10. In particular Youssif at dinner who was wonderful catered to our every need and made us laugh. Abdel Fetta who was cheerful and fun for every lunch and breakfast. Hamza kept our drinks flowing and was great with the kids. Thank you  - The rooms are clean and comfortable well decorated and accessible.  - The events team and kids club were always on the go with activities such as aqua fit darts football ping pong shooting and archery. Plus a range of shows each evening which at 9.30 were a little late for our kids still on UK time (10.30 gmt)  - Tennis Boules Football Basketball courts were really nicely designed and maintained.  - Regular shuttle to Marrakech was excellent or a 6 euro taxi into town.  - The food was a vast array and varied each day with lots of options we particularly enjoyed the tangines. It may not suit some tastes peculiar absence of crisps ketchup bacon and sausage (obviously).cereals or porridge. But overall there was plenty of choice. Fantastic deserts and lots of space everything was spotlessly clean.  - 3 or 4 additional paid restaurants were also on site which we're very good. 30 euro for 3 bottles of water which was free in the main restaurant seemed a tad gowging. Although a lovely atmosphere a a great evening.  - The bars was well stocked with most ""house"" versions of drinks you'd expect. Beer was served in comically small glasses but bar staff didn't mind deliivering in multiples.  - We did 2 excursions 1) To the Atals mountains and Ourika plus fatima waterfalls an amazing experience well worth it. 2) Desert and Dune - Camels and Dune buggies camels were great to view less enjoyable to ride. Dune buggying was a an unreal experience highly recommended.  Overall a fantastic 10 day holiday enjoyed by all at Kenzi club.",Date of stay: April 2022,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cleveland, Ohio",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stumo40

The personnel were amazing and did their utmost to make us welcome. The food was great and the varied with anew theme every dinner. Two people stand out our house-keeper Amal who took really good care of us and went out of her way to provide us with all that we needed. And the hotel's nurse; an angel called Fatima Al-Zahra who treated my injured feet twice a day with a smile.  One negative point was the WiFi an issue that seriously need to be addressed as it was nearly non-existent in the room but slightly better in other places.

We saw a great deal on coming here for a 4.5 star all inclusive hotel resort. The Kenzi Club definitely lived up to and exceeded my expectations! The food drinks resort and staff were all wonderful. In the Main dining hall we had our server named Youseff who helped us every night and he was awesome. During the apero(cocktail) before dinner we had server Ahmen who was awesome always very happy!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Joy wrote a review Oct 2021,40,Best hotel service I have ever received,As a mature traveller who has visited most of Europe and indeed other countries around the world I felt compelled to write a review about this hotel based on the amazing service provided by all the staff at the hotel. This applies to bar staff cleaning staff and hotel reception staff. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble for them. I had a plug missing from my bath which once reported was fixed within the hour. Several of our group mislaid their room cards and within minutes they were renewed with out any fuss at all. The staff were just so calm about all manor of issues and polite on every occasion.  We were a group of 26 Fully In-clusive which took some managing for booking in etc. But all of it done in a calm manner.  If I were to criticise anything at this hotel  it would be the alcoholic drink provided. I realise this is a Muslim country and as such drinking is not allowed but to water it down to a level where you might as well not bother was the view of most of the group. You could always tell the wine bottles for exampled had been tampered with due to the lables on the caps of the bottles were open when served by waiters. Perhaps it is the hotels way of making sure we didn't go over board. But we were a mature group of people not Club 18-30!!!!!!!!,Date of stay: October 2021,,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyi450

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Wendywoo wrote a review Sep 2021,50,Fabulous September Moroccan Sun,We visited this hotel in February 2020 before the covid outbreak. We loved it so much we came back as soon as possible with family. We couldn’t have been more looked after. The reception staff were so helpful. Covid security was in place and everywhere was constantly cleaned. Masks and hand sanitizer were available all over and especially encouraged at the restaurant.    The room was immaculate the pool gardens and buildings were stunning.    The entertainment team including Youbi Nadiya and Ghani were wonderful getting guests motivated and entertained. I enjoyed poolside in the morning with a yoga/stretch class followed by dancing lesson and then aqua fit. Lots of fun. There were activities in the afternoon but I chose to go to the quiet pool and read with a cocktail 🍹😁    The buffet restaurant was beautifully laid out and inventive with a different theme each evening. Even though the hotel was not at full capacity there was plenty of choice. Youssef who looked after us always had our every need covered with a beaming smile.    We had a day trip rode camels hiked in the Atlas mountains ate at riverside restaurant and visited a pottery.    As far as getting a pcr test was concerned the hotel shuttle bus took us into Marrakech and the test station was a little walk from there. Results came through later that day and we hadn’t had to book and appointment either.    The hotel is 20mins from the airport too which is great. There weren’t many British there but apparently there had been during the school summer holidays.    Easy going restful sunny holiday.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,K-worldtraveler wrote a review Aug 2021,10,Never book this hotel!!!,I don’t understand the positive reviews. This hotel is not clean the food is every day the same cold and the service is bad. We booked a double room for a family and they gave us a room for two persons. They said they don’t have double rooms with two beds. And that the kids has to sleep on the couch! After discussion and a lot of pressure the double room was possible! This was a bad start of our vacation. The room was not clean. A lot of dirt and hair on the floor. The locker was out of order a few times and they had to change a technical part. A family that comes every year told us that this year it was the last year for them because of the bad situation. It was not worth the money. The animation team is great! There is a different in price for guests from Europe and guests of Morocco. I visit Marrakech every year but this was the top of the bad hotels. Every hotel where we stayed was good! I believe that this hotel used to be good but now please don’t book this hotel. The lie about the room was the worst!!! See the dirt of the restaurant on the picture. And the stains on the bed.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mohammed Idrissi wrote a review Jul 2020,10,WORST STAY EVER,My experience is a bit different as I'm here on a 9 days quarantine stay paid by the government it doesn't change the fact that I should be treated just as good as any other guest.  We arrived on the 3rd of July which means I've been here for 3 days so far here's my experience briefly :  1 - A/C : It's 44 degrees as of now in Marrakech A/C in my room isn't working at all I've called several times for the past 2 days to be told that they're working on it nothing has happened since. I've now slept 3 nights with my balcony door open waking up everyday with multiple mosquito bites and dead cockroaches in my room. I went outside to complain and met a guy who I believe is a manager who told me that they have instructions from the government about not turning on the A/C as it's centralized and might somehow cause spread of the Coronavirus. I do respect this safety measure but the A/C in my friend's room who is just next door is perfectly working and he totally contradicted what the lady from the front office was telling me on the phone about it being fixed.  2 - Food : We are served 3 meals a day I've had 9 meals so far 4 out of this 9 were served cold no soft drinks at all was only served an orange juice on the first morning which means no coke or whatsoever for both Lunch and Dinner you can have water only.  The lack of respect these people have for their guests is astonishing I've stayed in hundreds of hotels in my life and have never felt this humiliated.,Date of stay: July 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simoidrissial
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Wolves1962 wrote a review Mar 2020,50,Well done Kenzi Club,I have just returned from Morocco following a short visit with my daughter. We travelled on sat 14th March and we really didn’t have a clue at that time what was ahead of us. In short half way through our break we were told by the Moroccan authorities we had 36 hours to leave the country ! We had a couple of days then of sheer panic with lots of different people telling us lots of panic stories we did eventually get back to the UK safe and sound. What I really want to say is Kenzi club given the terrible situation they found themselves in were outstanding. They were pleasant helpful kind but obviously following their strict instructions. Food was brilliant and they kept their bar open for as long as they could. Well done all and when things get better we will be back .,Date of stay: March 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,Wolves,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wolves1962

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Empsue wrote a review Feb 2020,40,"Big, nice all-inclusive for families",Travelling with two kids this was an easy and well-functioning choice for the first half of our stay in Marrakech.    Food  The food was ok there were plenty of choices. The pizza was the best we have had in a while.    Room  The housekeeping did a good job with cleaning especially Amal and the male housekeepers who took care of our room. Our kids got sick right after we arrived so we needed some special care for the first days and the housekeeping staff helped us kindly.  The room itself was honestly more worn out than we expected and the bed was very hard.    Pools    The tiny children's pool with a slide that was heated well was the best. The kids (ages 4 & 6) enjoyed it a lot.    A good thing is that there are plenty of big sunbeds/booths available all around the pools.    Sadly the big pool with the slides was way too cold even when the temperature rose close to 30 Celsius degrees.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kokkola, Finland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emiliakatariina88
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Wendywoo wrote a review Feb 2020,50,Fantastic February holiday,Our first time in Morocco and we are in love. The people the food the weather the history and geography are fantastic. The Kenzi Club Agdal Medina was a beautiful hotel where the staff couldn’t do enough to make your holiday the best.    The hotel Atlas restaurant is a superb buffet with a different theme each evening the Head Chef and his team went beyond excellence to give everyone something delicious to eat. The quality was definitely 5star. We were looked after in the restaurant by Benammar Mohamed who was so lovely and made our stay extra special.    The day and evening entertainment team worked incredibly hard. During the day the classes and activities around the pool were extensive inclusive and a lot of fun. Ayoub and Racha together with the gentleman who did the morning workout (can’t remember his name) were superb. The evening entertainment was super too.    Our room was a beautiful oasis in Riad Dalia. Spacious and clean and always at the right temperature we slept so well.    The lobby and the resort grounds were stunning with the most beautifully looked after gardens.    One day it was a bit chilly so we paid the extra to use the spa pool I also had a massage which was really good and professional. The masseuse quickly found the knots on my back. The gym was great I used it a couple of mornings.    A couple of other elements that made this hotel ideal was that it was 20mins from the airport and there was a free shuttle bus to Marrakech centre (needed to be booked day before).    We were there for a week and did a couple of outings; a day in the Ourika valley seeing waterfalls Berber House and the stunning scenery of the Atlas mountains (note take suitable walking/hiking footwear if taking this trip) We ate Tagine at a riverside restaurant delicious. We also took a horse drawn carriage around Marrakech. There is still so much to see so will definitely be going back.    Everywhere we went the Moroccan people were so incredibly friendly and welcoming with a great sense of humour. Why wouldn’t they be they live in such a beautiful and bountiful country.    Thank you Kenzi Club Agdal Medina we’ll be back with the family.,Date of stay: February 2020,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendywootravels

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,L0uise2 wrote a review Feb 2020,30,Hit and miss.,We arrived late at night for a short 3 day break. Our first impressions were great helpful reception staff grand lobby and an upgrade to the quiet Riad with its own pool at the end of the complex. A golf buggy took us to our room. Our room was large with simple decor. The bathroom worked as it should with a good shower and bath. Parts of the room were becoming shabby and needed updating. The complex is big with a lot of guests! The grounds are well maintained and we had an amazing view of the Atlas Mountains from our balcony. The dining room is huge but is decorated nicely when the weather was good we ate outside as the atmosphere inside was very chaotic and not relaxing. The variety and presentation of the food was excellent the quality of some of the food however was poor and bland. There were themed nights and the attention to detail was fantastic for example Moroccan night which consisted of the staff dressing up in traditional garments and playing music and Moroccan tea was served in the silver jugs.  There were two main pools but only one was heated which everybody used enough sun beds and there was entertainment every day I joined in with water aerobics which was great fun! Our Riad has its own pool but it was freezing and unused. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus into the medina you need to book a time slot in advance if you want to use it but it came in extremely handy.  The evening bar was extremely disappointing we don’t have children and the evening was mainly a very loud kids disco which we had no interest in. This was the only place in the whole complex where you could get a drink without having to pay for it. There is a lovely quiet bar but you need to pay for drinks. This meant that most evenings there was not much on offer for us we did go out in Marrakech on the final night which was fantastic but surely the point of being all inclusive is that you don’t need to do that every night. Due to this I would not recommend for couples especially English speaking as you are quite isolated. English speaking families were isolated too the staff were only really friendly to French speaking families. I found the reception staff to be helpful and professional. The bar staff were not very friendly and unprofessional sharing private jokes a lot of the time which made a lot of guests feel uncomfortable. One of our main issues was sleep quality the temp reached 30 degrees and the air con was not working. Reception explained that it is not switched on at this time of year and no they do not have any fans. This meant we did not sleep well for the entirety of our stay. Also some of the rules are confusing. You can’t get certain drinks in certain places you need to pay a deposit for pool towels but pick them up in a different place etc. It took us a couple of days to figure everything out. Walking from the restaurant after dinner to the bar to get a coffee for example became tiresome as you can’t get a hot drink or cocktail from the main restaurant in the evening and the quality of the wine and cocktails from the bar was poor. Overall the cons were too big to genuinely give a really good recommendation quite simple things like providing air con a quiet bar that is included in the price you payed or an ironing board were dismissed parts of the complex smelled really bad and were really shabby. Good value for money? Yes. We mostly enjoyed our stay but due to the issues discussed If I had payed anymore then I would probably would have complained. It is defiantly not a 5 star but a cheap and cheerful 3.,Date of stay: February 2020,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L0uise2
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Heather B wrote a review Feb 2020,50,The Perfect Family Hotel in Marrakech!,Our second stay at this hotel - it is the perfect destination for February half-term. Weather has been perfect this week - mid 20s and sunny. The hotel is set in large grounds away from the hustle and bustle of central Marrakech but just a 15 min taxi ride to the centre. Lovely heated outdoor pool views towards the mountains on a clear day a jovial atmosphere with music by the pool. Food in the self-service restaurant is excellent with delicious tagines and also a pizza oven (popular with the kids). The entertainment staff are great fun and very welcoming. Bedrooms simply furnished but clean. We'd love to come back again.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heatherbT8553OK

The hotel was lovely the animation were great and the evening shows fab. The food was really good although you need to be open to trying different things. The pools were nice with the slides opening intermittently but that could be because it was out of season. The small kids pool was popular with our 4 year old and we had a lovely 5 days. However for an English speaking family this hotel wasn’t the best. Our 4 year old couldn’t use the kids club because staff and kids were all French speaking. Everything else was great but I would look for a more English speaking hotel next time.,Date of stay: February 2020,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Keighley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyc562

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,K_Btourist wrote a review Feb 2020,40,"Good hotel, fantastic front of house staff",We stayed for three nights through Voyage Prive. We were really impressed with the grounds they look beautiful and are immaculate. When you walk around the complex it’s lovely hearing the birds chattering away in the bushes. It’s a welcome place to return after a busy day in the Medina.    The staff were all friendly but Zouhair at reception was an absolute gem. He was so polite and did everything in his power to make our stay enjoyable such as extending our check out period when my friend had a migraine. It makes all the difference when hotel staff make you feel at home and not just another customer- this is where Zouhair shined. We were sad saying goodbye to him- he represents his hotel beautifully and deserves recognition for going above and beyond. Shukran bsef Zouhair!    The rooms are well used although clean spacious and comfy. It doesn’t feel five star; we had a fridge that didn’t work and the towels were a little well loved. You’re provided with shampoo shower gel soap and body moisturiser which was handy.    There are two outdoor pools so it doesn’t feel crowded. There are also lots of beds by the pool so you’re spoilt for choice.    Themed nights aren’t our thing although there seemed to be something going on every night. The entertainment staff were friendly but could be a little over enthusiastic in trying to get you to join in when you were trying to relax by the pool or have an evening drink. They need to understand that declining to join in with activities doesn’t make you “boring”- we’re on holiday and looking to relax!    We took advantage of the city tour arranged by the excursions team. I strongly advise that you ask for Kemal to take you around the Medina. He took us to places you would never find by yourself and was just a lovely knowledgable guy. When I return to Marrakech I’ll be contacting him again for more tips on how to enjoy the city.    We ate at the Altas restaurant which is a buffet. We found that the food was really tasty with a great variety. Each night had a different theme. I particularly enjoyed the variety of Moroccan pastries available. I certainly didn’t feel like I was stuck eating the same thing every day. The waiters are very accommodating and friendly. There always seemed to be food available even if you were hanging by the pool. Cocktails were lovely.

When it comes to the rooms its average nothing amazing but it’s still nice room we’re definitely not 5 star. The only thing that’s really off putting about this hotel is how certain staff member treat coloured people different my friends and I are black and they really made our experience uncomfortable. When we were at the hotel restaurant they would completely ignore us and serve the other people (white visitors) around us even if we came 20 minutes before them If we then asked for something e.g a drink they would say okay we will bring it but instead continue to serve others and bring drinks around us this did not only happen once but the whole time we were there. Most of the restaurant staff were nice and welcoming however some were rude you would also see some drinking alcohol while on the job and hiding some wine bottles.The staff members at the reception continuously lied to us if we needed something to be bought to our room we would have to visit them 3 times or more and request again for it to be bought to our room. They would try an engage in conversation with other visitors but not with us if we then asked a question they would speak in a different language and laugh with their colleagues which was very unprofessional. We asked other black individuals who were also at the hotel if they had the same experience and they did. Not all stuff members are like this only a few which is very upsetting as they let the hotel down. If you plan in staying in this hotel just be mindful and ensure you get the service you deserve because just like everyone else you also payed a lot of money to be there. To conclude if your white you’re welcome and if you’re black or coloured maybe it’s best to look else where.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMJama

I’m one of the most honest and opinionated people I know ultra fussy. I’ve never been to an all inclusive resort before but this place is fantastic. The staff are so welcoming and helpful. The animation team are amazing and welcoming and provide hours of laughter. This is a popular french destination so yes there are french people. I found the hotel classy the food to a very high standard abundant in choice and quality. The communal areas are spotless and very well kept. As gay travellers we where not subjected to any issues upon check in we where offered one large bed or two small I found this respectful as we where in public areas. The only thing that annoyed me was none of the on-site cash machines would work. Free bus to city centre was handy. I can’t fault this hotel at all and I highly recommended it to all walks of life.

The staff could not do enough for you they were accommodating and kind I could not fault their dedication to make your stay as pleasant as possible.  The hotel had so much to do and the pool area bar and gardens were beautiful. If you are particular about your food then the all inclusive option isn’t for you its basic good food but the 2 other restaurants on site are excellent.

Food is good plenty of choice. The heated pool has a nice bar and at 4.30 opens a food place for cakes pancakes etc. Couldn't keep my wife from eating pancakes all evening until dinner. Monsif who is at the outside area of the buffet restaurant is really helpful.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Benitachell, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peter_redican

Went with friends for my birthday and was made to feel like a princess. The staff are amazing. Special shoutout to Soufiane and Youness who are in the bar in the evenings. The shows are fantastic and the location is great. The animation team make you feel so welcome and Mohamed Adyani in the restaurant is super. A very short taxi ride away is Almazar Shopping Mall which has a Careffour where you can buy waster cokes snacks etc aswell as having clothing shops.,Date of stay: January 2020,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yazi1

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Fiona A wrote a review Jan 2020,40,Could do better!!,Recently returned from a 5 day stay at this hotel in Marrakesh. It is difficult to know where to start as there was both good and bad things. Firstly it definitely isn’t 5 star they are missing lots of 5 star quality it possibly isn’t 4star. Firstly with regards other reviews I can’t say that the staff were rude. They were friendly at check in and all the waiters were nice even if they were rushed off their feet. Medi the bag man was a star. Bar man in bar blue absolutely can’t do enough for you. Can’t really fault the food. It is what it is buffet style that changed slightly from day to day. But lots of selection and beer and wine readily available and brought to the table. So what didn’t we like. Well first off we paid extra for a prestige football. And premium upgrade. The prestige room was basic at best with pretty old fashioned bathroom and two single beds pushed together and made up as singles so if you want to sleep close to each other you have to unmake them and then end up falling in the gap the mini bar consisted of water soft drink and two beers. There were plenty of hanging space a safe and a kettle. The only good thing about prestige always the lovely private pool area that was nearly always empty and the lady who served drinks. You could also order lunch here but due to lack of information and knowledge at reception we didn’t find out that lunch had to be ordered 24 hours prior!! The down side was the pool was freezing so you couldn’t use it at all. I mean I am taking ice bath. Surely they can heat the pool in the prestige area. So on to the rest of the resort. Well we didn’t have any interaction with the animation team at all they seemed to only speak to the french speaking guests or maybe it was because we didn’t have children and there were hundreds of children!! Mostly uncontrolled scootering around the Buffett restaurant or running around the bar and grounds! Regardless or whether you are premium or not there is only one bar and children run around it all night. We couldn’t stand it which meant we had to use bar blue which was lovely but had to pay for our drinks. So defeated the object really of paying the extra. We did use Gusto the Italian and the Moroccan which were both very good. Toney one of the big pools was heated which meant again that this was heaving with kids as was the snack bar where the service was slow. Went only once and never went again. We booked a massage which was good even if a little rough for my husband I enjoyed it. However as we hadn’t been able to swim due to the freezing water we paid extra to use the indoor pool this was about £0 each and you could use it all day. We got in and it was cold not freezing but not even luke warm. So you couldn’t stay in long and when you came out you couldn’t get warm unless you went in the Hamman which they wouldn’t let you in unless you had booked. We did complain but they would give us our money back. Again disappointing. I would say that despite another review the New Years gala dinner was excellent. The food really good. Perhaps they were the last served or something but we couldn’t fault it. The show was good considering but yes kids were on the stage but we thought on the whole it was a really good night and enjoyed ourselves. We used the shuttle to the medina the driver was miserable and unhelpful but it got us there. We went to the Atlas Mountains but asked our cab driver from the airport who then did us our own bespoke private tour which was great and again well worth it. Have lots of small notes so you can tip regularly to everyone. So overall an enjoyable break but they have a long way to go to declare themselves 5 star.,Date of stay: December 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FionaA723

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Chris D wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Not 5 star hotel,Overall terrible experience food either cold or raw keep away from the kebabs these were raw when we were served them. Alcoholic drinks watered down. Entertainment was watching the entertainment team dancing with the female guests most of the time. Wasn't for the English guests as everything was spoken in French and staff had limited English even the receptionists. Husband had an accident coming down the Atlas Mountains I visited the so called nurse on site as my husband couldn't bear weight on his leg. The nurse couldn't even be bothered to go and see my husband to see if we needed a doctor or even go to hospital. Don't book a tour going up the Atlas Mountains with the guy that comes into the hotel we weren't told it was like mountain climbing and you needed a guide we also had a driver who only spoke French which made it difficult. My advice to anyone thinking of booking here is don't waste your money.,Date of stay: November 2019,,"Guildford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawson_p7

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Rips2 wrote a review Dec 2019,40,"The Good, The Bad and The Great!",Overall a good experience and I would definitely revisit. Worthy of mention are the Service Staff who really cannot do enough to make your stay enjoyable. The food was very good excellent range and many dishes cooked fresh in front of you. There was something for everyone and I particularly liked that they didn't 'stint' on the ingredients good quality beef lamb and fish the prawns were particularly good so I cannot agree with any of the previous negative comments on this site and everyone we spoke to was of the same opinion. Also they were very generous with the drinks and appeared to only use branded items such as Coca Cola Sprite etc. The alcohol selection was good and freely available the wine was more than acceptable plenty of choice of spirits and nice beer.  Our room was a Deluxe although what what gave over others I cannot say but it was nicely appointed large bed flat screen TV with a good channel selection. I would have preferred better quality linen and pillows but that is being picky. The shower was powerful and hot and the bath was a welcome addition. Disappointingly missing was the provision of Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room which was a bit of a pain its many years since I had to bring my own kettle! Also of note is the woeful lack of hangers in the wardrobe (8) which for 2 people for a week meant hanging clothes on top of each other which is something I really dislike. Note these can't be expanded because they are fixed to the rail.  Overall the site was attractive and well presented but some areas could have been smartened up (paint work etc). Both pools were lovely and at this time of year the heated one was very welcome. Rather shockingly we were charged a £24 deposit for two (fairly poor quality) pool towels something I have never experienced and frankly unacceptable in a hotel claiming 5 star status. Whilst this is refundable its a bit pointless when you can only retrieve this as you are leaving and Dirham cannot be taken out of the country so we ended up bringing it home. We also found some of the Reception staff rather sullen and unhelpful in total contrast to all other staff on the complex. We were also unaware of the City Tax which had to be paid so that was a bit of a shock it would have helped if that had been made clear at check in. We paid 283d for 7 nights so be aware.  We didn't use the spa because there was an £8pp charge to use the pool (for an indeterminate period) and nothing else would have been of interest to us.  The shuttle was useful but always seemed to be an issue with too many people trying to board the bus without tickets so it was invariably late whilst the driver tried to sort out who had and hadn't booked.  I would really have liked to have seen more effort made to recycle. The water bottles which were freely handed out were not recyclable plastic and there were so many wasted by people only part using them and then leaving them on tables. More water fountains would be a much better solution and no doubt cheaper.  In summary therefore this is not a 5 star hotel by European standards but is very pleasant. Food was great Staff were lovely Room was OK but could improve some annoying charges which should be rethought otherwise a very enjoyable week other than the weather which was awful!,Date of stay: December 2019,,"Brandesburton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rips2

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Martin W wrote a review Dec 2019,30,Good stay but hidden cost.,The place itself: Kenzi Club  Good stay but ask questions to be sure.  The hotel was lovely and very clean. Staff are polite and get you sorted very quickly. The room is okay nothing special but we didn't spend much time there so it was okay. The pools were nice and plenty of space.  Some issues:  - There are extra costs for the indoor pool (bit silly if you ask me)  - You have to 'book' to use the steam room which could fit a lot of people so once again silly.  - The spa staff are not as polite as the front of house. It's okay but you'd expect better.  - The gym is okay they need to repair the smith machine as that is very squeaky.  - They advertise they have 4 pools only two are open to everyone for all inclusive. One is private and one requires extra payment. (I think they need to make this clear in their advertisement very misleading)  - Snacks at the Oasis bar is okay.  - There is a free shuttle that takes you into the city however once you get off you are greeted with 'tour guides' that claim they are with the hotel. DON'T fall for this. They do charge. This is where I think the hotel need to do a better job as these guys just approached us as we got off the shuttle and the driver said nothing. This is the main reason I gave 3 stars and not 4 as you'd hope the staff would provide a warning/pointer to their guest.    Overall it was okay may be the small points I mention above is the same all over? If so then I guess my expectations were just too high if not then there is room for improvement.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sue M wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Winter escape,We visited the Kenzi Club in November for a few days to escape the British winter weather before Christmas. The hotel staff were so friendly and the activity agenda for the guests was really full. Enabling you to do as much or as little as you wanted. The two pool areas were separated to highlight this. My favourite point was the outside heated pool. The weather was early 20s - so the non heated pool didn’t get warm enough to entice you in - so the heated pool was a brilliant facility. There is a well appointed gym (which I saw but didn’t use!) and a spa. High end equipment and clean. There is also a petting zoo which was great for adults and kids alike. The all inclusive food and drink was ok. The pool side bar was not well stocked nor did it have premium brands. The blue bar which we paid for - had great homely atmosphere and premium brand drinks. The best of the food was the deserts - tasty and beautifully presented. The mini bus to the centre for the souks and market ran regular and on time. This was a free service. I certainly enjoyed my stay.,Date of stay: November 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stafford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517SueM

But its just a quick one for people that enjoy there food do not come here!.  Every pot and tureen is always empty its cold i even asked for some scrambled egg that had run out they just ignore you and i was waiting that long the restaurant actually closed. The queues even for an orange juice stretched around the restaurant.  I wasn’t going to mention the rooms but have to. We booked a prestige room but please don't bother if your thinking about it not worth the money. Also you do not get any sunlight or for that matter much light in the rooms as the hotel is covered in olive trees that block out any light its like sleeping in a Dungeon.    We are as i type or the wife is looking for flights and hotel somewhere else.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Cindy D wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Visiting again soon,My husband and I visited Marrakech End October for 4 nights. We stayed at the Kenzi club Agdal Medina Hotel 5 star (all inclusive) and had a lovely time.    The ladies at reception seemed preoccupied but were still helpful and I had a tinge of disappointment when I first saw our room it seemed dull but it soon passed when I realised that was the colour scheme. Room was clean with a very modern bathroom.    As part of our inclusive package it was great to have a themed large variety of exotic foods in the dining area combined with universal foods like chips and pizza and such helpful and friendly staff. ‘Kudos’ to the head chef what a lovely chap who takes so much pride in his work and so he should they are doing a brilliant job - the dining area team work very long hours but always with a smile.    We were advised not to drink the tap water so the hotel provided us with 1 litre bottled water at every meal and also in our rooms. I would recommend the hotel provide smaller bottles as well for options and to avoid wastage.    The service provided at the hotel included all inclusive meals/snacks/drinks all day activities 2 x swimming pools (wifi didn't work at the bar near the pool area) water aerobics Zumba darts archery gym & spa (not included additional charge) evening entertainment to name a few. I was very impressed with the evening entertainment team ( the dancers) and the bar staff (Jet Team) Outstanding!!! They were very inclusive drawing people in - they made the whole experience very enjoyable and fun.    I was from the UK so struggled with the French announcements and French songs they played In the evenings. Lots of the guests were French speaking.    Outside of the hotel you can visit the vibrant market with at least 4000 tiny open fronted stores lots of bargaining don’t go for the first price but be reasonable they need the money and most of the stuff you see is handmade. The market was like a maze I would recommend a tour guide it worked really well for us.    You can go 4 x 4 quad biking in the desert camel riding is also on the menu with dinner and show or if you are brave enough air ballooning or staying overnight in Nomad Tent and breakfast. Amazing!!!    The Moroccan people are very approachable and hospitable and the weather at its best is amazing - hot and sunny - temperature can go as high as 46 degrees. Don’t forget your sun cream and hat. The mornings and evenings can get quite chilly though so take a cardie or jacket as well.    We are hoping to visit again soon.,Date of stay: October 2019,,"Bromley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyD790

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sweet wrote a review Nov 2019,40,Away with friends,Break away with friends celebrating a special birthday. 3.5 /5    On the whole the trip has been lovely the resort is beautiful with two swimming pools and plenty of entertainment.    The resort itself is advertised as a 5 Star but I would say its more of a 4 Star with a few short comings in service room facilities and accommodating requests. For example prior to arriving I had emailed informing the hotel that we would like a twin bed for 2 people and a twin and a single for 3 people. The front desk were unable to communicate which room was for whom. I also informed them that we were celebrating a special birthday and whether they could decorate the room. This was also not undertaken on arrival. Whilst they do try it isn’t hard enough and we felt we were putting them out.    There is no kettle in the room no ironing board and in general service is slow when requesting house keeping items. We had too few towels in our rooms so repeatedly had to request more.    The Animation team on the other hand were fabulous. Energetic entertaining friendly and couldn’t do enough. In particular Hanane has been a delight to be around such positive and vibrant energy. Hanane we love you!  The team work so hard and ensure they provide plenty of activities.    The buffet was fine better than I expected given the reviews. A range of good food with different cuisines on a daily basis. The only downside is that allergies are not labelled and getting gluten free food was very challenging for our friend. Not many waiters understand the concept of allergies. That said the chefs are knowledgeable as are a couple of waiters.    A thank you to Faradh and Younis in the entertainment bar and restaurant.  In general I would come back but with realistic expectations.,Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Excursion68066

The rooms are very nice big and well decorated with a nice garden big bed and big bathroom.  Swimming pools are nice and there is a good spa.    Overall the hotel is very nice if it wasn’t for the food and service they really don’t have any idea of what they are doing.    You can wait hours to get a fork knife or a glass from a waiter.    They prepare a basic set up on every table but no one regulate the seating and everyone is taking everything from each table .    The food is bad or very avarage and the same every day lunch and dinner.

This time things were different... standards in the rooms have dropped... not the cleanliness.. but little things water not replaced every day shower heads desperately need descaling and very oddly all the plugs have been taken out the baths so you could only shower!?    Food was pretty much the same...    Our welcome was lovely with our usual mojito. But this was the first time we’d actually walked to our room. May sound petty but when you’re usually taken my the buggies it was a bit strange that you suddenly are made to walk?    We also asked for an iron 3 times to be taken to the room... it never appeared    Entertainment was the main change this time... it’s lost some excellent team members!! Which means most nights was just a dancing show which was good but very repetitive! It’s a shame the ones who have left have not been replaced with the same standard. The ones who are there are trying their best but it’s just not how it used to be it’s such a shame.    Also a lot of English always moaned about everything being geared towards the french... I never agreed with this before but I’m afraid this time it was.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tookstein wrote a review Oct 2019,40,All Inclusive Week,"The hotel is a 15 minute taxi ride from the airport and the English speaking reception staff were friendly cheerful and informative. We were told we were being upgraded to a riad accommodation and were taken there with our baggage by a porter on a buggy.    The accommodation consisted of a riad courtyard block with a long cool ""quiet zone"" swimming pool at its heart. Drinks service was discreetly provided by a poolside member of staff and if you have the appropriate level you can arrange for lunch to be delivered poolside.    Everything at the complex was within a five minute walk and the large comfortable well furnished buffet/dining area was very nice. There was a wide range of food to choose from with several other bespoke restaurants to choose from if you don't mind paying extra.    The staff are very friendly most speak English and those that don't always respond to a friendly ""bonjour"". There is waiter service available for mealtimes and musical entertainment next to the restaurant area in the evenings.    We had several treatments in the spa which were of a good standard and reasonably priced. The only downside to the whole stay was the lack of wifi signal in the gym at the spa.    Our accommodation room itself was airy solid nicely air conditioned and comfortably furnished with tasteful decor.

Apart from one or two men on reception the rest were pretty awful. The female staff especially (sad to say) were unhelpful and inflexible. The bar staff were downright rude and the restaurant waiters seemed to basically want to kill us if we dared to ask them for anything (eg. salt & pepper). Another bugbear was that our rooms (group of 13) were a VERY long walk from the restaurant/pool area. I have moved on to Agadir today and the hotel here is excellent ( Iberotel Founty Beach) so it's clear that our Marrakech hotel was not ""ok for Morocco"" but was inadequate in many aspects.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SteSteWood wrote a review Sep 2019,40,"Delightful, relaxing stay",Me and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel in mid September. The aim was to have a very relaxing holiday with doing the absolute minimum being the objective.    We couldn’t have asked for a better hotel in all honesty. It was clean spacious and modern whilst retaining the Moroccan charm. Staff were all very friendly and informative including a good buggy ride to our room! - please sure you’ve changed your money at reception prior to leaving for your room else you’ll be faced with the awkward encounter we endured when the guy was waiting for his tip and we had no money on us at that time 😂    ROOM was spacious clean and comfy with black out curtains that blocked out the morning sun allowing for a much needed lie in.    POOL - there are two outside pools. One which catered for predominantly adults only and the second one catered for a mixed aged range but there was plenty of room.    FOOD was absolutely fine. You were provided with an array of different choices every night so it never got repetitive. There are three connected restaurants just outside of the main complex and we treated ourselves to Gusto restaurant where the food was incredible and we were entertainment by a band dance act and a trapeze act.    STAFF were all friendly and helpful. The entertainment guys worked tirelessly both in the day and in the evening leaving me questioning how they had so much energy and enthusiasm.    ACTIVITIES are aplenty. You have the option of football basketball and table tennis. There was also the chance to join in with the daily water aerobics and water gym. They also have a SPA facility which we took advantage of as you get a complimentary hamamm which is a session in the steam room. There are plenty of treatments available at a fee.    In summary if you are going to Morocco for the first time then stop your search and book with this hotel!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Telford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteSteWood

The hotel itself is ok clean and well catered. Our room was cleaned daily however the sheets weren’t changed at all. For us the biggest issue was that we were pretty much ignored by most of the staff. We often ate our whole meals without the offer of drinks or had to get up and ask for them. My partner got ignored at the bar a lot which definitely put us off spending time in the bar area at night. Approach the food with caution! As mentioned in a few reviews the hygiene wasn’t great and I was ill for most of the week. Also stay away from the shop which is super expensive. Overall not a great impression of Morocco.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,soxxx wrote a review Sep 2019,40,Great holiday!,Thoroughly enjoyed our holiday here. We was a little sceptical choosing Morocco because either of us haven’t been before but the hotel staff really made us feel welcome.  We decided to pay for the privilege riad which had its own private pool. Everything about it was lovely. Our rooms was cleaned all the time and the housekeeping staff was always around if you needed them. There was also a lady who will sort your drinks out throughout the day whilst relaxing by the pool. Everyday they had a different cocktail.  The food was okay I don’t really like to explore with food and very picky where I eat so I lived off pizza and chips the whole holiday. My boyfriend enjoyed it but we sometimes didn’t feel great afterwards.... the levels of hygiene is different in Morocco than UK!  The boys in the restaurant are great especially Yousef he was amazing he made sure we had our own table and poured our drinks before we even got there. I do believe he and all the team work very hard to give everyone a good service but can be seen extremely busy at times and sometimes the personal touch of service is lost.  I do think the hotel needs more staff everywhere. The staff work so hard all day.  The entertainment in the evening was okay mainly in french but cope-able. The best night being Michael Jackson!!! The bar was very busy all the time at the entertainment also. The entertainment team was lovely also.  We visited the blue bar that was very relaxing even though we had to pay for premium spirits I believe they should be part of the all inclusive band.  The reception staff was great they helped us with everything we required. We booked 2 restaurants away from the hotel which was the tapas and the Italian. I strongly recommend the tapas! It was amazing. For the price you pay it is brilliant value for money.  Overall I would recommend this hotel and I will defiantly come again if in marrakech!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soxxx

We arrived on the 28 august at the hotel at around 11am and were welcomed with a wonderful non alcholic mojito. The reception staff were fantastic and even though my husband speaks Arabic they made a big effort to welcome me in english to the hotel. We had our all inclusive bands put on straight away and told to go and have some lunchand to come back once finished and our room was ready. We were taken to our room by golf buggy which was fab. Our room was set in a lovely ryad  due to mobility problems we had a disability friendly room with a lovely wet room the room is great and we have a great seating area in the courtyard. I have seen from other reviews that the staff do not speak English all the staff i meet spoke english and of course its always good to learn a few words in Arabic the entertainment team do a short arabic class daily. The meals our all served in the Atlas restaurant and our a buffet style. There is plenty of food to choose from and the chefs and waiting staff our very helpful. There are 2 great pools to choose from and also plenty of sun beds avalible. The snack bar oasis(all inclusive) is between both pools and is open from 10am till 6pmit does food there as well if you wish to have a light snack. The entertainment team our always around and do aqua aerobics everyday in the bigger pool which is great funplus lots of other games. They also have a great club for kids and a baby club as well. There is also a little petting zoo as well. The entertainment team also do shows everynight for all the familywhich take part outside the main evening bar. I have found the hotel to be very clean our housekeeper was amazing and so helpful so big thankyou to ameI.wish i could name all the staff who helped and looked after us but i would like to mention youssef the manager of the snack bar who is just an amazing man and so very kind and helpful Adil saidomaiwaabdatlif and all the team there for there kindness and great service.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ellen wrote a review Sep 2019,10,DO NOT STAY,We are currently staying here and I have to say this was the worst holiday I've ever been on. There have been so many issues it's hard to count now. The first has to be the food it's the same every night which is to be expected to some degree from an all inclusive however it's usually cold apart from the tagines and it is all crawling with flies. Nothing is covered it's all out in the open and the same tongs are used for vegetarian and meat dishes. Every time we ate at the hotel we were very sick and ended up having to travel out to get food which is very expensive at 100 dirham (£10) each way minimum.  The second massive issue we had was the poo on the wall! There was some diarrhea splashed up the wall by the toilet and a hand print of poo above the bidet it was there for 4 days before they cleaned it! There is no hygiene here everything looks great when you come into the lobby but it goes downhill after that.  The staff started off as being very friendly but quickly stopped if you don't tip them and you become invisible almost.  The plus sides is that the bed is big it's extremely firm so good for bad backs but not for comfort and also the hotel looks beautiful the grounds are stunning and it is very well kept around the resort.  This was my first time outside of the EU and I was so excited but on our 5th day out of 7 we have booked flights home early. My boyfriend almost collapsed due to lack of food. If you value hygiene and don't want to get ill please don't stay here!    I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy.    I have attached pictures of the food not being covered one tong for meat and non meat dishes and also flies on the cucumber. I have also attached the pictures of the unsanitary poo on the walls!,Date of stay: September 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellengbu
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kreez D wrote a review Sep 2019,40,"Helpful staff, Good hotel",The start of our stay with this hotel was really awful to no fault of the hotel. We booked our stay in this hotel via Global Hotel Cards - Expedia. To our horror when we got to the hotel we were informed that we don't have a reservation. I appreciate the help of the staff in this hotel in trying to help us sort things out. We didn't manage to sort out the issue with Expedia and ended up booking the rooms again and paying again. Its peak season so they are fully booked but they really tried to make a way for us so in the end we were able to stay 5 nights instead of 6 because the last day they really couldn't find a room for us. They even gave us a good rate because they were sympathetic to our situation.    The rooms were really nice and well appointed the bathroom needs a bit of sprucing though the mirror is like a cheap plastic mirror not something that you would find in a 5 star hotel. The pools were really nice and i like that there are a lot of sun beds that you can always get one.    The food was nice but as most have already commented its not 5 star hotel quality. the grounds are well maintained and lovely. The free shuttle that takes you to the city center was not air conditioned which is not great specially if the temperature is 45degrees.    I also had a massage in their spa but it was so-so didn't go back for any other treatments.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Terri L wrote a review Sep 2019,30,Lovely Hotel....Definitely Not A Four Star!,The Good:    Friendly staff from entering the hotel to check in and throughout stay. Yes there are some who only give better service if you tip them however this was not a deal breaker.    Location wise it’s 10-15 drive from the airport. Not far from the Square about 50 Dirhams one way  - they also have a free daily shuttle which you have to book in advance.    Rooms are big and spacious but lack luxury feel to them.    Housekeeping - well here is where things go a little South. Rooms are not given through clean daily and sheets changed. You have to specifically ask for this.    Food - Let’s just say typical Buffett without the charm eat variety at your own risk.    - I will say here there are several violations of hygiene so get there early as food is being placed and remember people coughing and sneezing into their hands then touching the spoons cups and classes at random. If you like bread be very careful as on a daily I see people picking up and replacing the breads.    Grounds - very well maintained with Hotel surroundings kept clean and tidy. Staff here do stellar job.    Entertainment - depends what your seeking! They try....  - kids and young ones well catered for they even have a petting zone ...ahhh!    Cons:    None really just lower your expectations and have a good time!    Oh now I think about it the wastage of water and fizzy pop bottles is quite frankly appalling then the lack of recycling said plastic just takes things to another level of wastefulness.

We stayed in the so called privileged riad The Rose with the private pool. The room was outdated with mould in the bathroom and never had any warm water.  The pool while it looked nice had tiles missing at the bottom so you'd cut your foot. The 2 other pools where cloudy from so much chlorine added.  The buffet restaurant was like a bun fight with same food served most days. Hard to get a table and always struggled to get cutlery and glasses and drinks with ice. The waiters did their best but obviously they needed more staff as well as more dining ware. When you did find a table to sit at you'd go off to the crowded buffet to return to your table being taken by someone else. The whole restaurant was complete chaos.  Entertainment forget it unless you speak french or enjoy outdated shows (animation team dancing to Elvis or Michael Jackson and french karaoke)or watching the kids club.  Reception was also awful with no real understanding of English language. Trying to communicate in person or by phone was a nightmare.  The best part of our stay was when we went out of the hotel. Marrakech and surrounding areas wonderful such a shame to have to have our holiday spoiled by staying at kenzi Club.    Do not fool yourself this is a 5 star hotel if you go there think 3 star and catering to a totally french market with an awful restaurant service!!  This hotel and management get a 1 star from our family.,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shinegirluk

Breakfast was ok but only one main course during dinner and lunch besides pasta station and pizza station and they keep repeat the same dish twice or three times a week food was not tasty at all if food are important for you it is definitely not the right place for you,Date of stay: August 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jawhari
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jasmine B wrote a review Aug 2019,10,Awful don’t go!,I have been asked by trip advisor to write a new review as my review contained a few different places in - so here’s the second review.    By the time we have travelled and got delayed we just wanted to get to the hotel and relax but what we had coming was something else... we got to the hotel at around 1pm in the afternoon to find our room wasn’t ready so we had to leave our luggage in the lobby/busy reception area and the receptionist told us to go and get some lunch and come back and that the bags would be put into a side room out of the way by a porter. To our shock the receptionist spoke bare minimal English and had to try and fumble through her words and get another staff member to translate for us.The food was not what it was all cracked up to be either. Flies were all around and I daren’t eat and this was the first day we got there within an hour of us being in morocco.    After our first eventful meal we went back to the reception and we were shocked to still see our luggage in the same place and not locked away as we were promised. We managed to get the room key cards and get taken to the room via golf buggy by a man called Rachid who was very nice until we arrived at the room and he expected a tip from us for a ride on his buggy. We didn’t give him anything because we felt this should of been part of the service to which he got abit annoyed and shut the door promptly on his departure – which we thought was very rude to say we had just got to the hotel.    Kendi club Agdal Medina hotel had awful food  flies landing on everything and none of the staff weren’t bothered ... the eggs were green in places whether it was scrambled egg fried egg or boiled and all the food smelt like rotten rubbish ... I struggled so much with the food that I lived off Chips and pizza and not only that but both me and my partner have come back Ill with contagious diarrhoea and I am actually now on antibiotics very poorly!    For the first three days of our holiday we tried to just relax however this was very hard with the language barrier and also some of things we experienced weren’t very relaxing to say the least. We were in the area of the hotel that had a private pool and for most of the time there was a lovely lady that monitored who came in and out of the area as well as drinks and food as everyone had different wrist bands for what parts of the hotel they could and couldn’t go into we suspected. However on one the days we were relaxing and there was three French younger boys probably around the ages of 20-21 who came into the private pool for our area and it appeared they were being very sneaky and quite trying not to get caught and they sat in the pool talking and picking the small tiles from off the pool surface! And no one said anything to them. Not only this but they were generally messing around and still no staff said anything to them – even trying to slice trees with their room key card. Absolutely disgusting behaviour for what was meant to be a quite area of the hotel. Not only this but I then realised that I had cut the underneath of both of my big toes on the tiles on the bottom of the pool – which made it very hard for me to walk very far for the rest of the holiday and I couldn’t wear some of the shoes I took. The tiles were still missing by the end of our holiday    We were in room 402 near the private pool and it was a lovely room fitting to the hotel however we had to get the mechanic man out twice to fix the awful smell coming from our air conditioning! And he came bad both times all he did was put abit of mint syrup in it so it smelt like mint for about half an hour and then after that the smell came back with a vengeance! Most of the holiday we couldn’t use the air con because the bad smell was so strong it was making us feel sick - and I think everyone knows that dodgey aircon can make you sick anyways! So we decided to sweat for the majority of the holiday with the door open slightly onto the garden at the back! Not great...    Thursday came and Dean( my fiancé) became ill at the hotel... he started with diaharreia on the Wednesday evening late night into the Thursday morning and we were forced to stay at the hotel for the day and cancel the rest of our excursions on holiday. This was the last draw for me and we were ready to come home! We had quad biking booked on the Thursday morning and I got up to go to reception to cancel the excursion an hour before so they could let the taxi know so that they didn’t expect us on the trip out of courtesy. Because my partner we suspect gotten ill from hotel food and pool water or even the trip to the waterfalls I asked whether we could get the money back due to illness. This was the most difficult thing yet again I was stood at the reception desk for about half and hour trying to get our money back whilst I left my fiancé in the hotel room. They said they needed to speak with the excursion man to get my money back and to go back between 3pm and 5 pm when he was back. So after spending most of the day in the hotel room looking after my fiancé  I then went back to the reception. Again I was turned away saying they couldn’t get hold of the guy – two of the staff were calling him trying to get hold of him even asking me to look at some pictures of who it was that sorted out the trip for me and showing me pictures on their phones. It was all abit of a nightmare to be honest and no one wanted to own up to who owed the money back. In the end I was told AGAIN to go back on the following morning the Friday at around 9 to get my money back. I felt really exhausted by this time!    Lots of people have brought up the fact that everything is french and for the french! That is absolutely correct! We found ourselves translating things into french so that the reception team and other staff members could understand us and all the entertainment is in french! Not once was entertainment repeated in English... which was really bad when kids could not understand anything that the entertainment team were doing or saying. If they repeated the entertainment in a few languages instead of just french it would of made our holiday a lot more relaxing and better - overall very frustrating!    We won’t be going back here - over all we need a holiday to get over our holiday at the kenzi club agdal medina!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hackneygonelarge wrote a review Aug 2019,30,Summer 2019 (avoid room 622),Never been to a large resort before but found it generally nice with welcoming staff. Stayed for a week all inclusive and the buffet selection was good with replenishment of items ongoing this meant everything was fresh. The hotel is run professionally all except the pool bar where I noted that a couple of male members of staff were a bit discrimatory in their approach as to who they served.    Towards the end of our stay we began to experience problems with ants entering the room (622) and it was impossible to work out where they came from. The worst experience was when we woke up on the last day to find a load of ant carcasses near our beds. I did advise the reception staff that they needed to investigate and ensure that any access points were blocked up before letting the room out again.    For my liking it was a little too far out  and although there is a shuttle bus to the medina I felt it stopped a little too early (8pm). I am not someone who enjoys sitting around a hotel all day so ended up taking the shuttle then caught buses (40 dirhams) to other parts of the city and cabbed it back. There is no public bus service to this part of the city.    Yes the main language used is French and the majority of visitors are Francophiles. I didn’t really mind this but it did deter me from accessing the Children’s club as from what I observed at the time my daughter would have been the only English speaker. That being said at 5 years of age she did enjoy her interactions with other guests and putting her limited French to use.    The rooms are comfortable decent beds and good quality bathrooms. In respect of being an North African country they are representative of the star rating. Our television was little used but for anyone travelling from England you are limited to CNN and BBC rolling news channels. Germans fare better with Comedy Central being their offer.  I do take issue to resort fees in general such as being charged for using a safe more so when the guidance given is that the hotel does not accept liability for losses but it is what it is.    The two main pool option is great leisure pool for families and a quieter pool more suitable for swimming and quiet time. My daughter loved the slides which were very well managed. The younger children’s pool although a good offer more so as it is in the shade did look like it needed some TLC and was not used.    The grounds are very well kept and enhanced by the pieces of artwork scattered throughout.    The Animation team do a good job in keeping people entertained but I did think there was too much reliance on using the Children’s Club to perform during the evenings. Nice as a one off but there was a bit of overkill.    If you are in to resorts I would say that it is a nice place to stay great for hanging out in with children.,Date of stay: July 2019,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sususush2017
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,teruliii wrote a review Aug 2019,50,EVERYTHING PERFECT,After some breakdowns that we had before our vacation because of its unexplained cancellation by Booking a few days before a trip that you reserved in a february... Well yes we almost collapsed. Everything turned to be okay when we finally successfully called this hotel and they told us that they will keep our reservation no matter what. (DON'T DO YOU RESERVATION THROUGH BOOKING ANYMORE!).  As we got a cheap package deal & it was our first experience of an all inclusive holiday we didn't know what to expect. EVERYTHING WAS GREAT! It was probably the best moment of the whole vacation week when we came exhausted to the hotel and were taken on a buggy to our room. The guy carried all our cases and was really friendly! We felt like in a dream! The whole resort and all the rooms were modern and clean. The staff was soooo friendly. The food was very tasty plenty of choice. Drinks were perfect! The best thing about this resort was the fact that we had our own pool right in front of our room. And that's not everything. We had also our own bar with the nicest waitress on the earth thanks to AISCHA! A lot of entertainment for kids. The desk had a facility to change money for you to book a free shuttle to the city centre and to print your boarding passes at the end of your vacation. The taxi to airport was 100DH but we took the bigger taxi. We visited some nice buildings and parks by walk and it was okay. The only bad thing about this week were running kids in the canteen and oh also the second bad thing is that it didn't last longer!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Coz2013 wrote a review Aug 2019,50,Excellent place to visit,My Husband and I went to this hotel to find it was gorgeous. The hotel is really clean and the staff are amazing. They are so friendly and can’t do enough for you. The food (especially the Moroccan) is delicious and there is always plenty of choice at every meal. The wine is given out by the bottle and there are cocktails lists with most cocktails on it. The entertainment was good but they should translate in English more. The Michael Jackson show was great and the Fire show display was very professional. We were impressed. When going as a couple I would recommend paying a bit more for a Rihad (one with its own pool) as it was so quiet (except the housekeeping staff who were a bit loud when cleaning the rooms and the trollies were noisy) but the rest of the time it was amazingly quiet and you can get drinks there from 10am to 6pm which is great.

They ran out of towels at the pool the WiFi is spotty the shuttles to town get filled up and the people arranging tours are generally clueless. The “all-inclusive” thing is a myth.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lala210790 wrote a review Jul 2019,40,Fabulous stay - couple of niggles that made it 4 star rather than 5,I stayed here as a couple in the privilege upgraded rooms in June 2019.    The welcome on arrival was fabulous with a lovely refreshing drink brought to you and the actual hotel and grounds are stunning. I will group together the different aspects of holiday:    Room  The privilege room is lovely beds were huge and very comfy if you upgrade we paid about £160 extra when booking which enabled you to have access to minibar at no charge (see negative points further down) bigger room and a private pool in centre of Riad that was lovely if you want a bit of quiet time away from entertaining larger pools.  Food/restaurant  Can not complain about the food at all always a good variety and chefs at every station cooking and serving was a nice touch.  Youssef in the evening at restaurant was fabulous and looked after us every night saving us a table knowing our drinks and chatting away absolute credit to the hotel!!  Entertainment  Absolutely fab always stuff happening throughout the day to join in with but also not pushy if you don't want to and then the same staff do the evening shows which are great to watch especially the fire show! All the male entertainment staff were fab but the one lady entertainment staff member who seemed to make 2 friends and spent most of her day sat talking to them and not interacting with anyone else the whole week we were there.  Pool area  Fab pool area very large with 3 slides and loads of sunbeds at all times in the day and also a smaller (but still large) pool next door to the main pool which is a slight bit quieter. Snacks are throughout the day at the pool bar.    Negative niggles!!  Restaurant - morning breakfast was a real pain to try and find coffee cups or cutlery which is quite frustrating  Room - bed slats were broken when we first arrived at hotel but took 2 days of complaining to reception at various points and then demanding a manager twice before it was fixed  Pool bar - the only disappointment of the staff as they are never happy and if you don't speak French you get ignored point blank sometimes waited 15 minutes to be served  Also the privilege room we paid extra for which entitled us to free minibar should be restocked everyday was not and we requested numerous times at reception. they only replaced twice the whole holiday.    The only other advice I can give is not to book your trips through Thomas Cook they try to scaremonger you a little bit about only going through them and you really do not need to book direct with hotel and save yourself a lot of money!!    We went on the Quad biking trip and also free shuttle to the Medina both well worth the trip but have your wits about you at the Medina its crazy!    All in all a great trip and apart from the niggles which have knocked this down a star I would stay here again as its beautiful and the entertainment staff and Youssef were brilliant.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chesterfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lala210790

The bar staff were all lovely made an effort to speak with us and asking how we were our main problem was entertainment it was all in French had we known this prior we would have booked another hotel hotel is predominantly french tourists and they seemed better catered for than the british at the end of the day we have paid as much money as them to stop there but we couldn't join in on any of it...,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharongL5771IH
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Elke wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Mooiste vakantie tot nu toe gehad !! Wij komen heel graag terug !!,We came with 3 children (13.11 & 6 years). Nice and well-kept hotel. Big rooms. Friendly staff especially at the meals and the evening bar.  Great food and wide selection. Super tasty drinks. Here too there is a wide choice.  Nice spacious and well-kept swimming pool. For each his own.  Overall we were not short of anything. No comments for improvement or it must be the somewhat inadequate Wifi. Super animation team who provide classy shows in the evening. Our heart goes out to Mehdi in particular!  A major plus is also the location of the hotel in relation to the city itself and the foreseen transport from the hotel.  We were able to do nice excursions through the sympathetic tour guide of our travel organization.  None of us wanted to return home after 10 days.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kaz S wrote a review Jul 2019,30,Lovely Hotel but not 5*,Lovely hotel and friendly staff but definitely not 5* possibly achieve a 4* rating. However lots of issues with the dining facilities. The actual food is good however the main buffet restaurant is chaos at meal times. Staff appear to do their best but the overall running is poor for a 4/5 star rated hotel. The supply of plates cutlery and glasses is constantly running out leaving you searching or waiting! The food whilst nice is very repetitive and not replenished quick enough and not kept very hot. Whilst being a family hotel there appear to be no rules about the age of children allowed to the food collection area which resulted in small children placing their hands on hotplates to grab food and diving under your plate to get in front of you or to run back to their table. (Perhaps a parental issue here too). The pool bar snack are is tiny and no where near adequate enough to handle the volume of people and offers the same snacks every day.  Having visited this hotel previously out of season a few years ago and been impressed by it back then I was disappointed to discover they clearly are unable to cope with the volume of people in high season.  Location is great only a short journey from the airport and the hotel runs a courtesy bus to the old area of the town rooms are spacious and cleaned daily.,Date of stay: July 2019,,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Titchwood

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,shazp2018 wrote a review Jul 2019,40,Good value for money,Just got back from a long weekend staying here for our wedding anniversary.  Check in was great. We arrived about 10.45 am and were expecting to have to wait a few hours until the room was ready but one of the ladies on reception rang housekeeping and they said half an hour. So we had a wander round the grounds and got a drink at the pool bar. When we returned the room was ready for us and they had also upgraded us to their privilege riad for our wedding anniversary. We got a golf buggy ride to our riad and the room was lovely clean and spacious and housekeeping had done the bed lovely with petals and heart shaped towels. The riad has its own private pool and is at the far end of the complex. There is a waitress poolside where you can get drinks. There are tables and chairs out and we saw people eating there a couple of times. Can’t comment on what they served as we didn’t eat there.  The breakfast and lunch had plenty of choice and didn’t disappoint. The staff always seemed to be running around busy.  The main problem we had was one night sitting at our table for 10-15 minutes waiting on 2 glasses so we could get our drinks but they never materialised. For that same amount of time we were up and down to the hot food area waiting on plates as there was none. This was at 8.15 pm and the restaurant only opens at 7.30 pm so it’s not like they even had an hour of service. In the end we decided to go to the tapas bar 3 doors down and wow we were so glad we did the food and service was amazing!!  On our last night we went back to the restaurant but there wasn’t much we fancied so decided to give the Italian 2 doors down a try and it was lovely. The food and service was great. The hotel can ring and reserve for you in either of these restaurants and they have menus especially for Kenzi guests if you choose to order from them.  The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels as required.  We had a very relaxing time at the hotel and enjoyed our stay.  A tip for you at the airport even if you only have hand luggage you have to go to the check in desk so they can stamp your boarding pass otherwise they won’t let you through. Make sure you take a pen with you too as you have to fill out a form on arrival and the same on departure and the airline don’t give out the forms.,Date of stay: July 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Llandudno, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazp2018

The room needed renervating. Sink and mirror was cracked the toilet brush fell of the wall the fridge wasn't cold and the aircon was not that cold either. There were marks all over the walls and doors would defiantly benefit from painting.    Some of the food was edible but nothing to write home about very samey and I mean samey. It didn't matter what time you went you were always waiting for the food to be cooked however I must say the pizza was very nice.    The thing that really killed it for us was that the French got preferal treatment. Served first for drinks and the staff always spoke to you in French first but once found out you were english they smiled and walked off (not all staff but most).    The lager and wine was ok (had a lot worse). The spirits were terrible couldn't drink the vodka tasted like detergent.    This hotel is nowhere near a 5* more like a 3.    The entertainment was ok... but would be better if you could speak French.    It wasn't a bad holiday but I would save your money and go somewhere else. This was a relaxing last minute get away for us so it didn't spoil our holiday too much but if it would have been our main holiday I would have been deeply disappointed.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,J8901JGrobl wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Brilliant family holiday,We have just returned from this hotel. A family of 4. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds the staff are always very helpful food was great both from the pool snack bar and restaurant. We tipped one of the waiters and from that point on he had saved us a table every evening and made sure we had cold drinks on our table ready. The hotel is predominately occupied by french travellers we didn’t find this a problem as the entertainment staff also speak English. The evening entertainment was absolutely brilliant especially the last show we saw which was the fire show (a must see) I would definitely staff at this hotel again.,Date of stay: June 2019,,"Rhyl, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J8901JGrobl
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,chrisP wrote a review Jun 2019,30,10days Kenzi Club Agdal Medina.,10 days in Kenzi Club Agdal Medina    - We spent 10 days in this hotel  Certainly not a hotel that should have 5 stars Maximum 3+ !  I was in many hotels all inclusive in the world and this is no different than 3+ stars    Eating almost every day is the same.  At the  restaurant very hot and feel the food.    Food of the lowest quality. Although you pay a lot of  cash for your stay.    Animations are  simply nothing special. I thought that  in Cuba in a 3 star hotel the animations were weak  but here the tragedy.    The evening bar service was very rude and slow.You  need to rebuke for a few times to get something.!!! If  you give them money you'll get faster!!!  One of the employees said that to me!    The hotel certainly does not deserve 5* Stars.This 5* IT'S A JOKE!!! You pay as a good hotel you get 3 stars.    - People working in the pool bar are very nice and  helpful.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Helenka S wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Three Star at Most,My husband and I took our granddaughter on her first holiday. We chose this hotel because of its excellent reviews however for us it didn’t quite live up to our expectations.  The hotel itself is modern and clean.  The pool area and kids club were good for children but don’t rely on the ‘life guard’ for any assistance at all. He seems to spend his day looking at his phone and ignoring the potential dangers in the pool.  The bar staff were extremely poor. Very slow and miserable a real disappointment to be honest. The drinks were fine but don’t expect luxurious cocktails or service with a smile.  The lunch food at the ‘snack bar’ seemed to be food from the previous evenings buffet and the metal cutlery is left in the sun to make gathering it up an adventure of its own!  The evening buffet is varied and mostly okay but steer clear of the ‘cooked to order’ chicken skewers which we found to be completely raw in the middle....and for all that’s good and holy if you manage to locate a teaspoon - keep it!  The rooms are ample. There is a hairdryer and safe and as we had a privilege room we had a fridge which was stocked daily.  The person who cleaned our room wasn’t great we’d come back to the same litter on a daily basis and extremely tatty towels.  There were plenty of sun beds and they’re extremely comfortable.  The entertainment staff save this resort. All really friendly and hard working. The evening shows are mostly good.  In my opinion there are some areas of this hotel that need vast improvement. I would visit Morocco again but not at this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenkas2014

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Speaks32 wrote a review Jun 2019,50,5 night stay Solo traveller.,I am currently 4 days into my 5 night stay back at Kenzi Club. I am staying in a prestige room which benefits from a very quiet and peaceful private pool. This is my 4th time staying at this hotel. Personally I love it. My check in at reception was warm and friendly and I was able to check in an hour early. My request for a first floor room made before I arrived was granted.    Staff have been warm friendly and super helpful from pool service from the lovely pool waitress to the cleaners and restaurant staff. Always a smile and a hello. I have not had any problems with service whatsoever.    My room is immaculately clean and tidy no cockroaches as someone previously mentioned. Drinks topped up in the fridge and abundance of towels and a fruit platter on arrival. My tip would be to bring a bottle opener for your room drinks. Towels slippers and robe in my room. Plenty of shampoo and shower products toilet rolls spare pillow etc. Only thing missing from the room is milk for the tea and coffee in the room. But collected a jar each morning at breakfast or the night before.    Breakfast is fab. Especially the fresh made omelettes. Coffee delivered to my table is hot and tasty. I have only had to ask for a coffee up once.    The grounds are immaculate clean and tidy. The drinks included are fine especially the soft drinks. The alcohol I have had at the blu bar and paid extra for premium and are delicious.    The shop is very expensive should you want any bits so advise to purchase from outside the hotel. I would come back here in a heartbeat.,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speaks32
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,BramhallHatter wrote a review Jun 2019,30,"Let down by cockroaches, poor service and poor all inclusive drinks!",I was really looking forward to visiting this hotel after reading the mainly positive reviews. Unfortunately the reality did not live up to the expectation.    Positives:  1.) The hotel grounds and pool area are very pleasant/well kept.  2.) The reception staff are very helpful.  3.) The food is of a decent quality (albeit a little repetitive).  4.) The rooms are a good size and the decor is pleasant enough.    Negatives:  1.) We saw cockroaches in the Conference Centre during our welcome meeting and in the toilets at the Atlas Restaurant. We then saw several cockroaches in our room and called reception to have them dealt with on 2 or 3 occasions. This really was a negative experience and does make you wonder about the cleanliness of the hotel.  2.) The all inclusive drinks were very poor. Small glasses of poor quality beer dreadful Irish coffee soft drinks with lots of E numbers etc.  3.) The service in the Atlas Restaurant was very inconsistent. Sometimes we were left to source our own cutlery glasses and drinks. At other times the waiters were very attentive. The only consistent experience within the restaurant was the arguing between the waiters outside. At each and every mealtime the waiters appeared to be in conflict with each other.  4.) The all inclusive bar in the evening is an uninviting and dull place with large queues. It's dark lacks atmosphere and has the glamour and appeal of a northern working men's club.    Overall we shall be revisiting Marrakech but not this hotel.,Date of stay: May 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bramhall, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BramhallHatter

Checked in about 11am missed breakfast but was directed to the pool bar where snacks were being served croissant and pan au chocolate.  However hard I tried I couldn't find Alfred Hitchcock but his birds were everywhere! Mostly on the food...  The most annoying thing this hotels Achiles heel... the dining hall.    No glasses no cutlery no salt and pepper sometimes no food!  There is definitely something amiss when you sit down and the tables are bereft of everything you need waiting staff would pounce on the clean glasses being brought out from the kitchen.  Every team member cooking fresh whether on the wok pizza oven or pasta station struggled with demand.  1 pizza at a time 1 domestic sized wok being utilised 1 frying pan etc etc etc.    Lack of attention from waiting staff shame but too many managers bossing them around some didn't know whether they were coming or going.    Our riad was Rosemarie nice and quiet private pool.    Nice place shocking dining room... breakfast was less of a shambles.    Top tip!

Towels left on sun beds all day despite sign saying hotel will remove towels they don't! Our wedding anniversary 30th may. Whilst I don't expect freebies other hotels have given us a visit to a la carte restaurant or a surprise cake or even a better room. This hotel? Absolutely nothing! We emailed hotel pre arrival telling them it was our anniversary asking for a quiet room. Our room is overlooking the main pathway from reception! FURTHER UPDATE! Had call from reception invitation to a la carte! Maybe someone reads Trip Advisor? Spoke with manager told him my niggles and got moved to a quieter not better room in privilege block. Own swimming pool and drinks from the bar. Nice but room in slightly worse condition needed better cleaning. Balcony small. Mirror broken. TV has 1 English channel BBC news. Safe has to be paid for only water in fridge shower screen lets water onto floor! Restaurant no glasses to get your own drinks from machine if you want to.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kalps69 wrote a review Jun 2019,10,Avoid at all costs. Sub standard hotel,I have travelled extensively throughout the world and booked this hotel as a quick getaway during half term with 2 children.    From the start everything was a let down - landed late no welcome drinks offered. Then being shown a room that was up a flight of stairs - bearing in mind we had a buggy? Concerns that the management had a lack of planning or insight starting to show.    The room we had was awful. Dead cockroach on the porch of the adjacent room lots of mosquitos too. Room was horribly dark and was obvious that it had not been updated for at least 10 -15 years. Bathroom was from the 90s mould and hair in the bathtub no loo roll holder. Smell of sewage when walking in to the room.    Deposit needed for safe? Deposit for towels? I have never been to a hotel that asks for that.    Pool area was nice but sunbeds get reserved very early despite signs saying they can't be reserved. Pool is absolutely freezing even in 36 degrees weather. Again hotel not bothering to heat in early mornings stinks of cheapness.    On the second evening I was feeling sick and actually vomitted. I had bad diarrhoea all day with fever and could not get out of bed for 24 hours with an accompanying fever . This was 100% due to the dinner I had that evening which ruined the rest of the holiday. The management lied and said it's never happened before despite reviews on this website (albeit older ones) of people reporting the same thing.    My daughter son and wife all had the runs a day after we returned too    The hotel itself is poor - nowhere to go during the day when it's too hot. There was no shaded bar area and not much to do except lay by the pool. The gym closed far too early (6.30pm) but the music some nights was on til 11.30? Very strange behaviour. The hotel is catered for the French who seemed to love it one pool bar waiter gave me attitude when I asked to turn on the fans and his pal blamed it on him fasting - again another let down for the hotel.    Every day my wife and I found something that we noticed lacking for example no kettle in the room no alarm clock either. Views were obscured in the balcony area making the area very dark and occasionally hoards of ants would show up for no reason.  One night my daughter got bitten by something not a mosquito but a spider and the bite became infected. Luckily the nurse gave us an antibiotic cream and it is only healing now after 8 days. Another night my daughter woke up to use the bathroom and found a huge cockroach on the floor - we had to call housekeeping to get rid of it absolutely disgusting.    The staff were pleasant the wifi good and the pool area was decent but nothing else positive to say about the hotel.    The hotel is dated and stuck in the past needs an urgent revamp and change in management. I would seriously reconsider if you are travelling to this hotel,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalps69
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DenisePatt wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Great resort with minor niggles,We stayed for one week from 29/5 2 adults and 2 children in a family room. From arrival the reception staff were efficient and courteous despite many families arriving at the same time. Our room was very spacious and clean but did have a consistent drain smell from the second toilet. It was not severe enough to complain though.  The pool area is great; plenty of comfortable beds and the fun slides. The pool bar staff were hit and miss service wise except for the young lady who didn’t show preference to serving the French above British guests. Pool toilets are kept clean all day. The children enjoyed visiting the snack bar for chips/burgers/pancakes/doughnuts etc.  We thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant food with plenty of tasty choices at all mealtimes. The service could be slow to prepare tables and drinks due to being very busy at times. The hotel ought to have a larger supply of crockery to solve the problem of running low (this wasn’t only during busy periods). However the restaurant staff work very very hard and at an impressive pace considering it was during Ramadan! It was off-putting when the lady on the meat section would use her hands to place food on your plate - gloves or appropriate utensils would be better as her colleagues did ;)  The grounds are lovely and well kept but the small farm was quite disappointing. The animals didn’t seem to be well cared for. The peacocks wandering freely around the resort seem happy enough in my inexperienced opinion.  We didn’t use the indoor pool spa or pay-to-visit restaurants but did try the blue bar which we found lacked atmosphere and the toilets were unclean.  The entertainment staff are brilliant giving 11/10 at everything they do without harassing guests. In fact many were more than happy to be involved in games exercise and dancing because of the genuine fun attitude they showed.  Most afternoons we experienced a sudden gust of wind with umbrellas and towels flying around like in The Wizard of Oz. On one occasion a double bed as shown in the images was lifted by the wind and somersaulted into the pool. Luckily no one was hurt just damaged possessions. What was concerning was that guests retrieved it from the pool and no staff seemed to held - I felt health and safety were lacking at this point and the lifeguards also spent more time on their phones than watching the slides! Maybe sandbags would help avoid this type of incident in future???  In conclusion I can recommend this hotel. Particularly as we paid a very good price so was great value for money. Also kudos to the Thomas Cook representative Andrea for her warm welcome knowledge and advice about the area!,Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenisePatt

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Susan B wrote a review May 2019,40,Relaxing break,This was my fourth time of travelling to Marrakech the previous times travelling with friends and staying in a traditional Riad in the walls of the Médina. On this occasion however I was travelling alone and as a solo female thought it wise to stay in hotel. My intention was purely to rest read a few books and enjoy the sunshine. I could not have chosen a better hotel for my stay.    I emailed the hotel directly before booking as it was Ramadan and wanted to clarify that there would not be any restrictions. I received a reply within minutes of sending and as such booked through BA holidays.    I arrived early but my room was ready and the reception staff talked me through the facilities and what I needed to do. I was allocated a beautiful room with a comfortable bed and also had the luxury of a private pool specific to the residents staying in this part of the complex (I think it was for residents who were maybe looking for some solitude). However I did not use this pool as I prefer to be where the action is (not to join in but just to watch). All the pool areas were beautifully kept there were always sun beds available and no panic to find one. It was good to see a sign that stated reserving beds was forbidden although this would not have been a problem as there were so many available. The grounds were also immaculate and watered every night.    The animation team worked tirelessly and kept up a brilliant programme of activities and entertainment. They did not pressurise anybody to get involved but it was interesting to see that they remembered where you were from and your likes and dislikes.    I did not pre book the Moroccan restaurant as I would have felt rather conspicuous dining alone however the Atlas restaurant offered plenty of choices throughout the day. I am a fussy eater and cannot therefore comment on the quality of foods relying on salads and grilled fish most of the time but there was certainly enough of a selection I would imagine to satisfy most tastes. I have to say a big thank you to Moncef (Terrasse?) who was on the ball and noticed that I dined alone every night. He went out of his way to ensure that I was ok and kept his eye out for me not with any other intent other than to ensure that I was comfortable and enjoying my stay. Thank you Moncef it was good to know that I was looked after and I felt reassured knowing that you kept an eye out for me. He is a credit to the Kenzi chain and this should be recognised.    I did venture into the Médina for a spa treatment (the hotel spa was good but not comparable to my previous experiences in the Médina). I booked a taxi outside the hotel and was safely transported to my spa the driver parking up and walking with me to ensure I did not get lost.    I have to say that every time I visit Marrakech I am mesmerised by the place. I don’t think I will ever tire of it as there is always so much more to see.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Travellingnurse32 wrote a review May 2019,40,great stay,We spent 5 nights here in May during a heat wave. Temperature was 42 degrees most days.    Rooms - although booking a double room we were allocated a twin room. We asked immediately to change to a double room but this seemed to get lost in translation and as we were only there for 5 nights after starting to unpack and being tired from traveling we decided not to ask again. Beds and pillows were very comfortable. TV in room all arabic or French channels only one or two English news and film channels. On a couple of occasions I needed to see the nurse (Painkillers for heatstroke and a plaster for a cut foot) and on both occasions she was unavailable which was disappointing as there is no pharmacy nearby. On site shop very expensive if you want to buy crisps for the room these were around £4. Housekeeping - very friendly and came daily to make bed and change towels. Minibar refreshed daily with beer water and soft drinks.    Food - vast array of food personal preference meant we were not keen on breakfast - catered to the French guests (90% of the guests at this hotel are French) so more continental pastries fruit pancakes quite greasy - Cooked breakfast was not to our taste (eggs very greasy no pork beans and scrambled egg not awful just not to our taste) however there were fresh omelettes available which was nice. Lunch was the best of the 3 meals huge selection of salads pasta pizza cooked in pizza oven (delicious) and lots of desserts. Dinner was a bit hit and miss again it just wasn't to our taste as catered more to a French palate. Always had moroccan tangine salad and a meat dish. Pool area - excellent Plenty of sunbeds pool large. We stayed in the privilege block with our own separate pool which was a nice touch. Staff - very polite and welcoming. Gardens - absolutely stunning - staff worked so hard to keep the gardens beautiful it really was a pleasure to walk around the grounds. Spa - had a massage which was fantastic but seemed rushed which was a shame. Location - 10 minute taxi drive to centre we arranged two excursions with our rep which were excellent - walking tour of city and souks and then the next day camel ride quad biking in dessert followed by dinner and a traditional show.

We arrived around 12 but checkin wasn’t until 2:30 we were given our wristbands and allowed to enjoy our all inclusive straight away.    The food was absolutely amazing having stayed in a few all inclusive hotels we were a bit cautious but we were pleasantly surprised there was so much choice! I tried so many different dishes I would never eat in England and I’m glad I did! Each mealtime had the usual things such as bread salad and fruit but that along with themed nights for dinner we were never bored one of the best food selections I’ve seen in a hotel. The staff are very attentive and a few of the staff even remember what you drink. Youssef was one of the best restaurant staff I came across while staying here every time he saw us he had table for 2 waiting and the bottle of rose wine was on our table in no time we didn’t even need to ask. The rest of the staff were brilliant but he really stuck out!    The room was large and spacious although a little dark but as we were out most of the time this wasn’t really an issue. The pool area was kept very tidy and there was a large number of sun beds we never had trouble getting one.    We never ate at the pool bar as the meal times were enough for us but there’s no chance of you going hungry. Some of the cocktails at the pool bar are to die for and again the staff remember exactly what your drinking.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,joostwaeterloos wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Superb hotel near Marrakech,Really superb hotel. The rooms are in Riad style blocks. Our Riad had a private pool which allowed us to either go for the central 2 pools where there are more folks and where the animation is or to go for our Riad pool which was quiet and peaceful. There are plenty of pool accomodation. Rooms are up to standards. Food is great with a central theme in the evening (even gluten free was present). Service is outstanding. As the hotel is just outside the city it enables to get away from the busy center but there is a complementary hourly shuttle to the center so one can have both worlds.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leuven, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joostwaeterloos
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LadyC15 wrote a review Apr 2019,30,Pleasant trip,We stayed for a week in a privilege room. Room was ok but we had minor issues with broken hairdryer leak in the bathroom and thought the general decor was a bit tired. Also we love to sit out on a terrace/balcony but as hard as we tried the metal chairs provided ensured that it wasn’t a place to sit and relax.    The main bar in the evening was haphazard in both getting a drink and also anything of a high standard. Poorly prepared drinks mixer drinks were often flat as they’re poured from large plastic bottles so really missed my evening G&T! The house wine was drinkable so generally stuck to that.    The main restaurant had lots of variety but gave up trying to find out was gluten free and stuck to the things that I knew would be ok. One example they ran out of GF bread and when I asked the restaurant manager would they be getting anymore he said he didn’t know and pretty much just walked away..    We also ate in the Italian and Spanish restaurant where things were much better so would recommend if you fancy a break from the buffet.    Pool areas were nice and never any problems getting a sun bed. The hotel grounds were immaculate and you can see how hard the grounds men work to keep it that way.    We had a few trips out and about tour of the Atlas Mountains walking tour of Marrakesh and a visit to the Jardin Marjorelle. All of these were very enjoyable.    I would rate our stay as average.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyC15

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Malika H wrote a review Apr 2019,50,"Very nice hotel, very good food and excellent service",Just came back from one week at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina and had a very nice time there.  The hotel is perfect for family with kids or teens. They offer so many activities and the swimming pools are big enough with one with slides and the other one heated.  the deckchairs are very comfortable.  The food is very good and there is enough choice every day for everyone. We loved the pancakes and the 'beignets' served at the bar in the afternoon.  The staff is absolutely excellent always happy to help.  There are plenty of activities for all ages even a tiny farm!  The rooms are clean and the beds feel hard at first but got used to it. My husband did not complaint and found the bed very comfortable so depends on the person.  The entertainment staff is lovely. Good shows in the evening.  I would recommend this hotel to any family who wishes to spend few days to relax!,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalikaH199

The all inclusive was really just that so cocktails were included too very good service everywhere in the resort you could easily go there for a week or more and not need to leave the resort. There are 3 other restaurants linked to the resort Italian Spanish and Moroccan we tried all three all very good. It has 3 pools plenty of places to relax eat drink and chill out. The evenings entertainment was great too This really is a great place for a relaxing holiday We did go out to eat a couple of times and the staff on reception were so helpful in helping me book the places we decided to eat.

Room was a great size with balcony and mini living room plus two bathrooms :)  Security  Money change and atm in lobby  FREE bus to the mall with a daily schedule loved it!!!  Close to night clubs :)  Hotel staff was very politehelpful and kind :)    Cons:  The food was not good. Mostly European with a few authentic Moroccan dishes.  Guests were mostly above 40 needless to say there was no entertainment except for 1 night during our stay. The music was for old people. We were told it was due to the season.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,bbaker1946 wrote a review Apr 2019,40,A lovely hotel where we were made very welcome,We visited in March19 for two weeks. The room was spacious well set out and comfortable. The only issue with the room is that there are no free coffee and tea making facilites. So if you want your morning cuppa take a travel kettle with you.  The food standard and choice was generally good and one could always find somthing to tempt you. I have two criticism firstly there was no cheese choice as an alternative to deserts. Only one night was chesse available. I found this strange as I would always go for cheese rather that sweet deserts. Given the number of French visitors i remain very surprised that cheese was not avalable each evening/lunch time. the other criticism is for me more important. There is a large open outside area for eating as well as the inside facilites. We could not eat ouside because the entire area was dominated by smokers and I for one do not want to eat my food surrounded by other peoples' smoke. The area is big enough to section of a non - smoking area from the smoking. We could then at least enjoyed the outdoor experience ( big problem for us)  I was surprised that the use of a gym cost 8 euros/day Why not free or cheaper? I intended a daily visit to the Gym but I am not prepared to pay that much.  We really enjoyed the heated outdoor swimming pool...... a must for us.  The staff were very good and friendly they went out of their way to please.( all except one reception staff woman who was rude and aloof) as with other staff the Entertainment Team were excellent too. The all inclusive worked well for us and good value for money.  Perhaps worth saying; we would have liked a quite area to have a before/after dinner drink. But other bars were either shut or the blue bar was not included in the all inclusive package. One had to sit in the bar or just outside the bar where all the entertainment was going on........not quite/ unobstursive.  We used the shuttle bus on a number of days and this was a good service. WIFI was fine in our room and other areas of the Hotel.  Okay there were a few of problems for us but overall the stay at Kenzi was most enjoyable and we would recommend it.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Gloucestershire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbaker1946

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,xeross wrote a review Apr 2019,30,3 plus stars,Just returned from a weeks stay with my husband at the Kenzi Agdal. There are some things I really liked about this hotel. We paid extra to stay in the ‘privileged ‘ area with its own pool. This was a good decision by us as the area was quiet with families with children staying around the main pool areas. You could get drinks served by the private pool but it was a shame that you couldn’t get snacks from there. The privileged area is furthest away from reception and restaurant. The room itself was good with a really large bed and modern bathroom. The outside balcony area was a massive disappointment with 2 cheap metal chairs and just about enough room to stretch your legs with concrete walls and a view of a construction site. Kettle coffee and sugar provided in the room but no milk so bring your own powdered milk if you like your coffee white. The mini fridge is stocked with soft drinks and 2 beers which seem to be replaced sporadically. Large bottle of water a day and free safe use also included in the room price.    Now for the big negative for us was the food. We found pretty much every dish to be bland and void of real flavour. I appreciate that they have to cater for all tastes but I feel they have taken the overly safe option of keeping everything mild. The worst example being the deserts which all look deliciously appealing but somehow manage to all taste exactly the same shade of bland. The one star of the show was the guy who served the pasta who was always really friendly and made fresh pasta to your own preference which I practically lived on by the end of the week. The red wine and beer was good but cocktails not so much. Service was hit and miss often items missing from the table but the staff were on the whole very friendly and helpful.    I can’t really comment on the entertainment as we only went the once about 9pm at night and the dance floor was like a scene from a family wedding ( kids running around the dance floor whilst an older couple slow danced and the “entertainer “ walked around the room singing a love song). Everyone seemed to be having a good time but it just wasn’t our thing.    The majority of guests staying were French and we enjoyed trying out or basic GCSE French to talk with other guests and staff. Everyone very friendly to us( apart from the staff in the spa but that’s a whole other story).    In all this hotel seems to rate well with most visitors according to other TripAdviser reviews but sadly just wasn’t for us. I think the “All inclusive” hotel is perhaps not for us but if you do like them then this hotel is a safe choice.,Date of stay: April 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barnsley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xeross
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tania H wrote a review Apr 2019,40,Lovely holiday!,We stayed at this hotel three years ago and loved it so much that we booked again for 2 weeks with a couple of friends ... 2 of us were celebrating our 70th birthdays. I emailed the hotel asking for the same rooms we had previously with an Atlas Mountain view but on arrival we were allocated inward facing views. The next day I went to reception to ask if we could change rooms when one became available but the receptionist Nihad was very rude and unhelpful and said “we sell rooms not views” and refused to help. The next day I asked another receptionist and she was so kind and helpful and offered to move us to room 938 the same day! What a difference in attitude! Although I found this encounter upsetting it didn’t spoil the whole holiday and we plan to return every year for a winter break. All staff bar this receptionist were lovely from housekeeping waiters to the wonderful animation team. Food is delicious heated pool in winter ... bliss! Free shuttle to and from Medina!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Priya wrote a review Apr 2019,10,"KENZI CLUB AGDAL MEDINA, MARRAKECH",Utterly disappointed at the fact that you have to pay per day to use the safe provided in the room. Also we were all inclusive the bar staff were miserable at times and refused to serve us more than 2 drinks each which is ridiculous when you have paid for an all inclusive service. Also for a late checkout option it’s a flat rate of 400 dirhams per person which is absolute nonsense having travelled to many destinations I have never heard of being charged per person for a late checkout it is done by room normally. For pool towels you have to leave a deposit of 150 dirhams per person which will be refunded at the time of checkout. It’s silly and you’ll be left with the local currency at the end of your trip forcing you to use it in their shop etc as the marrakech airport does not take dirhams. Would not recommend this hotel at all they’re just taking money from you for anything and everything.,Date of stay: March 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Priyapatel123

Activities were really good (aqua gym aqua bike etc) and staff were super friendly and helpful. Plenty of food choice offered for breakfast lunch and dinner plus Spanish Italian or moroccan restaurant at a small extra charge. The only thing I would suggest for improvement would be to replace a few of the covers on the loungers by the pool/ bar as they are a bit tired looking.

The rooms are nice we had to move rooms due to a leak. This was a little difficult to communicate with the maintenance eventually we got moved and sorted. But I think the reception moved us as they didn't seem to believe there was a leak.  Rooms and the overall hotel were very nice.  The entertainment staff are brilliant with kids and do alot each day and evening to keep them entertained.  The food is overall good with lots of choice it is a buffet each day with different themes each evening for dinner. From experience take care with some of the meats and different foods hygiene standards are not the same as Ireland so do take care. Thats not to say they are bad just different.

We danced the night away most nights and it was down to some special boys called Vitamin Medi Pechu and of course mohrizoz . Apologies if. I have incorrectly spelt their names but they know who they are. Such talented and friendly boys we really enjoyed their company and extrovert personalities. The management should be very proud as these young men certainly are an asset to the hotel and I’m sure that guests return purely because of them.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jimmychap wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Fantastic week 20 to 27 February,I agree with the other reviewers who have described the service staff and facilities as “excellent”. I thought they were impressive.    I was also impressed with the food - the variety and the freshness as well as how well cooked and presented. I particularly liked the tagines steaks and cakes and very much enjoyed the Moroccan rosé and beer.    It’s a 20 minute into the old town on the hotel courtesy bus and a similar distance to the airport so well positioned.    It’s not what I imagine a 5* hotel is like (I’ve never stayed in one) but I thought it was a great place to stay and to relax for a week as well as great value for money.    We will definitely return to explore more of Morocco and I would be very happy to stay here again when we do.    Couple of tips you might find useful -    The exchange rate was good in the hotel and a lot better than I could find on the high street.    The excursions are a lot cheaper than I could find when I looked on the internet before our holiday.    Tip the porter who carries your bags to the room (we didn’t have any small notes. It was... awkward)    As a lot of the other guests are French/prefer to eat later if you get to the dining room towards the start of the mealtime you will get the best choice of seating and food in a quieter (less busy/bustling) restaurant.  It was a little too cold for us to eat breakfast or dinner outside but it’s lovely sitting outside in the shade having lunch    On a clear day you can see the Altas mountains and in the evening you can see the storks nesting in the mobile mast (disguised as a palm tree)    The main (big) pool was cold. I mean COLD. That’s because of the time of year and the fact that it doesn’t get hot until the early afternoon so the pool doesn’t get chance to warm up. The other (smaller but still large) pool is a comfortable temperature    Some other guests were quite loud when they returned to their rooms after a night out but that’s only to be expected (young people!) and I was only disturbed a couple of times but think a pair of earplugs might be a good idea.    If you can’t speak Arabic then try French (although most of the staff speak pretty good English).,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmychap

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Michelleorf82 wrote a review Mar 2019,40,"Great bit of winter sun, all on one complex",Booked as a package through Thomas Cook 2 adults and a 6 year old. The plan was to stay on resort and have a chilled week as previous holidays have been busy and that's what we did. On arrival at midday our rooms weren't ready so we checked I and had to go back at 2pm to get the room key. The main restaurant had just opened so we got some lunch while we waited. The food was the area that was very much the same stuff day in day out despite 'themed' nights but I didn't feel they were very imaginative. Saying that the food was fine but a but repetitive especially for my 6 year old. Main positives:    Pools fab freezing but my daughter managed to get in the 'slightly heated' pool a few times and baby one but sadly not the main pool with slides but I can imagine in the summer months it would be amazing. Things to do in the afternoon were fresh boules petting zoo rifles shooting belly dancing and darts to name a few. My daughter didn't go in the kids club plus it was dominated by French customers so she struggled at times to communicate so wouldn't have enjoyed it.    Mini disco was good but wasn't on every night. The entertainment were the best part all their own stuff all individual and all had something to bring    Be aware there's a shop on site bit with very little day today stuff more like clothing etc...    Drinks were good measures and you didn't have to wait too long to be served. Rooms were cleaned daily and the rooms were big enough. We were on the ground floor which we've never had before and are unlikely to want again I just love a balcony.    During the UK winter months the mornings in Marrakech are pretty pool wearing jackets hoodies and even Jeans. This can also be the case at night so take a cardio coat or hoodies as well as long trousers.

The grounds well keptas it has been said before one pool is heated the other which we tried was freezing but once in was quite refreshing the weather was hotter than expected which was great.we found all the staff to be excellent and hard working.although we didn't get involved with the animation team they were very freindly extremely hard workingand put on some excellent shows.the bar staff especially Moon looked after us so wellhardly had to go the bar.we booked the free bus into marrakesh centre and found the square amazing well worth the trip.so to sum up I would love to return to morrocco and the Kenzi Club the management should be very proud of all your staffthank you for a wonderful stay.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Liverpool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garryeverton
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Floridabride2015 wrote a review Mar 2019,50,Wonderful winter sun break,We came not expecting much after a great low price break. I cannot praise the staff of the hotel enough.  I have never been so thrilled with the service from start to finish.    We stayed in the privilege section in block 4 yes the pool is cold but it was extremely hot and we paddled and was truly grateful for that private pool - you cannot do serious lengthy swimming due to the temperature - however we just dangled our feet in and thought of it as a plunge pool: this has one person privately serving for drinks which is lovely between the 10am -6pm we had the pleasure of the lovely and lovely extremely hard working Aicha she looked after our poolside drinks all day.    The rooms were spacious and very comfortable’the bathrooms were spacious and nice. The housekeeping were great.    The food there is as always something to eat lots of variety and we never went hungry.    The service as second to none - I have never experienced such great a great price.    Marrakesh we went in one day if you want to see a more low key centre go early in the morning and it’s a lot les busy.    In a taxi from the hotel agree the price first it’s 5 pounds although a free bus is available w never used it as you have to pre book.    If you want a really relaxing Hotel I cannot reccomed this more. Such wonderful service water service in the evening from Mohammed and aiche and of course manager sofiane.    Wonderful and we will truly be returning next year thank you 😊,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rochdale, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Floridabride2015

Buffet resturant ran out of items before the session finished etc. Bread for toast butter salads. Other eaterys all carried a suppliments. Spa too pricey.  Hotel room basic the outside space had 2 hard dining chairs no comfort. Heated outdoor pool still cold. Had to pay a suppliment if you wanted to use the indoor pool.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,springburst wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Amazing!!!,We had a great time in kenzi club hotel. Our room was very spacious with a bath and shower great wardrobes with plenty of storage and tv. It also had a separate room with another tv and seating area with wardrobes. Housekeeping was excellent a special thank you!! to KARIMA and her great pals Halima and Ilham who went that extra mile to make our room which was spotless every day with a different design of swan or flowers on our bed every time we walked into our room. towels were changed daily and shampoos gels replaced as was drinking water. great work girls a credit to the hotel.    Reception staff were polite and helpful when booking the free bus shuttle service to medina (15 mins away from hotel) taxis were about a fiver to there as we missed the bus by a minute so make sure your on time coming back from medina.    Restaurant staff were very attentive with drinks and clearing plates as can busy at time. A good variety of food to please everyone with themed nights from Italian to french!! Desserts were to die for with a great selection every night. We enjoyed the indoor heated pool and spa facilities but was little disappointed that we had to pay 100dh per person a day (roughly about £10 per person a day) just to use pool.    Entertainment team were brilliant to keep everyone entertained during day and evenings in the lounge i don't know were they get the energy from!!    Although some bartenders prefer to serve french than other people tho!! Excellent facilities plenty of sun loungers and beds to relax and take in the sun with a snack bar close by for drinks. Anyone going to marrakech I would highly recommend this hotel!!,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/springburst
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,jemayhew09 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Review from a Black Brit Female - Fantastic hotel,This hotel is fantastic!    1. Staff: They are more than happy to help from the reception to maids to porters and waiting staff. All were very polite and gave service with a smile.    2. Food: Always a vast choice. There were: fresh salads fruit egg station at breakfast pasta station available at lunch and dinner. There were always a regular number of carbs to choose from at any one dining session e.g. fries rice and mash.  Ice-cream available (chocolate vanilla strawberry and mint). Speaking of sweet things you must try the fried donuts! and the ice-cream at the Menara mall which was delicious.    Whilst they have options to eat in the specialist restaurants on the hotel; I was not overly impressed with the Spanish one which costs 20 euros each per person. Furthermore smoking was permitted which was a bit disappointing.    Food is also available most of the day through options such as the snack bar.    3. Check out the spa which was great. Each guest is entitled to a free admittance to the steam and sauna. Within the spa there is an indoor heated pool which costs 100 Dirham per session. It is throughly relaxing and I would recommend.    4. There is a free shuttle that runs approx every two hours to and from the main square which is handy!    Would I return to this hotel?

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Escapes123 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Winter sun,Had an amazing week at Kenzi Club.  We received free Upgrade and the suite was modern stylish and classy.  Staff at the hotel were very helpful polite and very professional.  We enjoyed the food and there was plenty of healthy choices.  The Animation team were very friendly and brightened up the guests stay. A little farm and heated swimming pool for adults and children. Plenty of day time activities included. Spa treatments available as well as a modern gym which is extra.  Reception were helpful and if we requested anything we received a prompt service. Daily shuttle bus available however we caught the local buses for 4 Dirhams one way equivalent to 30p if you don't want to catch taxi.  Thank you Kenzi will definitely recommend your hotel to family and friends. Hoping to make another trip soon with family.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Phil wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Fun in the sun,My wife and I have just returned home from a fantastic week at Kenzi Club.  This was our first visit to Marrakech.  We found the hotel and grounds excellent.  Rooms were large and comfortable.  Only problem there wasn't a kettle to have an early morning drink.  The staff were really great friendly and helpful.  I was disappointed about the extra charges for the gym and indoor pool.  BREAKFAST I thought was ok. Plenty of choice although fresh fruit choice a bit limited. Maybe because we came in low season when some fruits are probably not available.  We were disappointed that some of the cooked choices were cold or luke warm.  Also we always had to wait a long time to get coffee.  LUNCHTIMES were very enjoyable as you can sit outside under the olive trees in the sunshine. Food choice excellent.  The waiters work very hard and are friendly and efficient.  EVENINGS in the restaurant had themed nights with Italian Spanish Asiatic Moroccan Fishermans and World cuisine. Always a lot of variety to choose from as well as wine.  THE BARS  During the day the pool bar is the place to be. Lots of activities organised by the animation team.  Unfortunately we didnt get much time to do these as we spent most of our days out on excursions.  However when we did get the chance we had great fun joining in.  THE ANIMATION TEAM are a very hard working bunch of young talented people always there to keep you entertained day and night if you want. Especially Pitchou who always made us laugh with his antics.  They do not insist on you joining in with them if you dont want to.  If you do want to join in they will keep you company at the table give you a smile or high 5. All great friendly bunch. The shows they put on in the evening are amazing.  The EVENING BAR  We went to the Gnawa bar every night after dinner for drinks and were always greeted by charming and helpful bar staff. One in particular whose name I cant remember was always chatty.  There was always a small buffet of snack bites laid out in the early part of the evening before the entertainment started  The entertainment amazing. Various themed nights including Karaoke Maroccan Michael Jackson tribute acrobatics disco mostly all performed by the animation team. During the evening they would invite the audience to join in.  Only one criticism was that the only played the same songs every night.  We would like to give a big mention and thankyou to the team Sania Mehdi Mohriz Vitamine Simo Mido Mamado Pitchou Sarah and the boss Magic for a very enjoyable time.,Date of stay: February 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funinsuntraveller
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Alan_Reid2014 wrote a review Feb 2019,50,Lovely Stay at Kenzi,Taxi from Airport should be about 100DH according to a few Taxi drivers I asked during our stay. We had already booked transfers - but will prob just grab taxi next time. Although that 100DH is probably a daytime price.    We enjoyed a very nice stay at Kenzi Club. Check In was quick enough. Very nice staff behind the desk. Deposit of €35 required for 2 towel cards - refunded at checkout. Room Safe needs to be rented. Think it was €3 a day. Room had air conditioning. As we were there in Feb we needed the heat on at night. TV had about 20 channels. 3 or 4 in English.  Only other money we really needed to spend for the week was for the gym use. Think it was about €25 per person for the week. Decent enough gym. Good selection of free weights 4 treadmills 3 bikes and the usual weight machines.  Two big unexpected pluses where the free shuttle to the Medina everyday - plenty of times to chose from but you need to book a day in advance to be sure of a space.  And one of the big outdoor pools was actually heated. At this time of the year this is a godsend. The main pool unheated was freezing. Didn't see anyone in it all week :-)  But the heated one was plenty big and very nice.  Plenty of day activities going on as well. We did a few and they were fine to kill a bit of time.  Night entertainment was enjoyable as well. We didn't go in every night but when we did we were entertained. The staff work hard and always have a smile.  Food is very tasty. Tajine stuff was my fav but plenty of variety for everyone. It has the most amazing deserts of any All Inclusive we have stayed at. We've done A.I in Turkey and Mexico and Portugal and the deserts are usually just dyed variations of one another. Sponge with some sort of coloured fake cream etc etc. Here they were genuinely good.  Our waiter for the week Moncef was very helpful and cheerful and made sure we were always topped up.  If you miss the shuttle a Taxi is about 50DH from the hotel during the day. At night its about 100DH.  The desk also has a facility to change money for you. Real easy.  All in all it was a very enjoyable stay I would say very good value and we would certainly consider staying here again on our next trip.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gourmet Globe Trotters wrote a review Feb 2019,40,Great value,As we got a really cheap package deal & it was our first experience of an all inclusive holiday we didn't know what to expect.    This place did not dissapoint. The food was really good with different themes every night something to suit everyone. Only slight problem it was sometimes luke warm. There was a constant supply of food & drink all day long. The cocktails where nice a little weak but this was expected. Enjoyed the local beer.    For all inclusive there was only one restaurant & one bar (plus the pool bar) so would have been nice to have another option. There is another restaurant & bar on site & 2 restaurants next door but you pay extra for those.    The Animation Team were fantastic always so happy & friendly. There were plenty of activities to do all day including Boules Archery Shooting & Golf. Also there are 2 tennis courts. The heated pool was lovely especially as we visited in winter!! If you are there in winter make sure to take a warm jacket as the mornings & nights are very cold.    The entertainment on an evening was fantastic especially the Russian dancers. The Animation team speak mainly in French when introducing the shows on a night so didn't know what they where saying as we can only speak English!!    Room was a good size & clean but annoying that we had 2 single beds pushed together instead of a double. The walls are quite thin so can hear your neighbours! The rooms are all set out around courtyards to get the authentic riad style which was nice.    The hotel offers a free shuttle bus throughout the day which drops you off & picks you up near the medina.    Overall really enjoyed it & we would stay again.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,458dee wrote a review Jan 2019,40,I bought a tagine!,Kenzi hotel is on the outskirts of the busy town centre~ ten minute drive away  They provide shuttle buses to and from the town centre which you need to book in advance. These are free but if you miss them there are plenty of taxis available for ~ £10 one way.  The accommodation was good for a 5 star hotel in Africa and cleaned on a daily basis.  Staff tended to vary - some were very friendly and helpful ( particularly Ishmael and spa receptionist)while others could be a bit standoffish particularly in the restaurant where we frequently had to wait for a considerable length of time to be seated ( and not because there weren’t any tables available).  Food was good but a bit repetitive.  They have facilities to change money to Dirhams but make sure you are certain of the value of the notes you handover as mistakes can happen eg being told you have given a $5 note when you actually gave $50!  But all in all an okay stay with nice facilities plus I did buy a taginethough not from the hotel!,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/458dee
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sugarandspice2 wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Simply the Best,I think that the Kenzi Agdal Medina Hotel is better than all the rest that I've visited in Morocco & that is why we keep coming back . The hotel & grounds are excellent  the staff are really great which added to the fabulous food and attractive prices makes it a place to come back to again & again . We recognised abought 30 other couples from previous visits  so it seems we are not the only ones to keep coming back . The reception staff do their best to upgrade repeat guests & this time we were given a room in the Privilege riad to our great delight .  The Privilige Riad has its own swimming pool & bar . We really appreciated having a glass of mint tea or coffee after our siesta or nipping down for a cocktail to watch the sunset before getting ready to go out for the evening .  BREAKFAST  6.30 -10am  I was really pleased to see my favourite detox fruit & vegetable juices are still being served . As always the orange juice is freshly squeezed  not the powdered stuff available in so many hotels . My favorite is the beetroot which I mix with carrot & I felt very healthy during my 3 week stay . There is no longer any fizzy white wine available for breakfast sadly  but there was some very nice bacon if I was tempted to make a BLT sandwich as a morning treat . There were healthy salads  fruits ( my favorite was the grapefruit & melon ) pancakes & doughnuts with a drizzle of honey  omlettes with a big choice of fillings  cereals  cheeses & real ham ( which was a pleasant surprise to see in a muslim country ) yogurts  jams  breads  cakes & croissants  baked beans  grilled tomatoes etc . Tea was served by a young man making it in the traditional way & the waiters will get you coffee in a thermos flask .  Lunch 12.30 - 3.00  The best meal of the day for me . Always a delight to sit under the olive tree outside in the sunshine with a bottle of red wine from Mekness & sparkling water . The freshly made salads (artichokes my fave) tasty homemade soups for starters (creamy cougette  carrot & coriander spicy star anice in the wonderful fish soup were amongst my favourites ) Then a choice of grilled meat & or fish with a large choice of vegetables  chips  rice etc .The Kenzi Agdal has gone organic & uses organicly grown fruit & vegetables in its kitchens ( see photo ).The pasta counter looked very popular & the pizzas made in the woodfired oven were a delight & I was often tempted .Every meal had a choice of tajine dishes  couscous  even puréed veggies for those on diets or babies .The desserts were a delight with creamy delicate cakes  coconut & almond pies  chou pastries  fruit purées  fresh fruits  ice creams . My most memorable dessert was an icecream cake which I only found once but will never forget  delicious !  I cannot praise enough the chefs who provided the fresh  tasty  healthy food at every meal . I didn't get fed up even after three weeks as it is so varied .The wines are very good & there is also coke  fanta  beer sprite on offer .  The waiters work hard & are charming and effecient so I am loathe to name any favorites  as I really appreciated them all . I never mention management usually  but even the maitre d's are a delight in their suits at the restaurant entrance with their smiling welcome .  Dinner 19.00- 21.30  Themed nights most evenings  with Moroccan on Fridays  my favorite Fishermans supper on Thursdays  Italien  Spanish  World cuisine  Asiatic . Foodies will love the dishes on offer every evening . At the fishermans supper night we had calamares squid  prawns the most wonderful fish soup  fried fish & I saw an enormous tuna being cut into fillets for grilling . The Spanish evening was a giant paella and look out for the jugs of sangria by the beer pump as I only noticed them on my last week .  The minestrone soup on the Italian night is highly recommended . My husband loved the nems & Chinese soup on the Asiatic evening  while I chose the tender roast chicken portions in the spicy accompanying sauce .One evening a week is a large plateau of cheeses which I really appreciated with fresh salad leaves & sweet purple onion slithers with a hunk of baguette .The turkey breasts on the grill were very juicy & tender with a sprinkle of fresh rosemary - memorable as were the entrecote steaks .  THE BARS  During the daytime the pool bar is the place to be . The animators organise belly dancing  darts matches  cooking lessons every morning before lunch . Lots of laughter and fun while sunbathing or drinking a gin & tonic or cocktail . The snack bar opens at 12.30 with a great selection of snackfoods  salads  olives  pizzas for those that want them . The bar staff are all very pleasant & hardworking  they even remember your preferred drinks & bring them to your table . Once again I will not mention my favorites as they were all fantastic & this review would become a list of names !  THE ANIMATORS  A very hardworking team of young talented staff to keep you entertained day & night if you want it . They do not insist you join in the games or dance with them if you do not want to  but they are there if you do want to have fun .I laughed so much at the cooking lessons that it hurt my tummy . They will keep you company at the meal table  give you a high five  a compliment  a cheerful smile & greeting . All wonderful young people . The shows they put on in the evenings are amazing !  The EVENING BAR _  My husband & I went to the evening bar at 6.30 pm till 8.00 every evening for a couple of drinks before our dinner . Once again the barstaff are simply excellent  charming and helpful & make sure you always have a full glass if you show your appreciation with a small tip now & again . They will bring olives  nuts & popcorn to your table or sometimes there is a buffet laid out for you to help yourself to titbits . I noticed some carrot & celery sticks with a dipping sauce & some toasted bread tapas with delicious looking toppings but didn't want to spoil my appetite for the evening meal .  The entertainment in the bar was a live singer most evenings with either the talented Emanuel or the amazing Sidney from Cameroon who replaced Jean Claude with his just as fabulous voice . My husband asked for a request one night & Sidney learnt the song & sang it especially for us 3 days later  Candle in the Wind . We were nearly in tears as you can imagine! Their songs are appreciated by the guests who get up on the dance floor to have a dance .  At 8.30 every evening there is a mini disco which is popular with all ages and at 9.45 the animation team start their shows . These are amazing & well worth staying up for . There is a discotec which takes over when the bar closes at midnight for those that have the energy .  The gardeners all worked hard keeping the luxurious greenery neat & tidy . There were roses in flower even in January . The weather was exceptionally mild & we had 21 days of sunshine at about 20° during the day but of course colder in the mornings & evenings  so do bring some warmer clothes along with your swimsuits .  The cleaners are very good & kept the hotel & rooms spotless . We especially appreciated our cleaner as he cleaned our room in the mornings as he knew we had a siesta after lunch . The reception always smells lovely of orange blossom with the floor wax the cleaner uses .  The Reception staff are on duty 24 hours a day & are very pleasant & helpful . They will book you a place on the free shuttle bus  or reserve a place in one of their 3 new restaurants ( supplement of course  unless you take the VIP pack ). They gave us an early morning call on our departure day . Their rate of exchange is good & we used them to change our money often . The reception staff are great & will help in any way they can  even upgrading the room if they possibly can .  The Porters / baggagistes are also a great team & remember their previous guests with a big welcome & a trip in their buggy to your room with the suitcases .  We will be back hopefully as it is a bit of Paradise on Earth & even happiness is included in the all inclusive !,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Languedoc-Roussillon, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sugarandspice2
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,N S wrote a review Jan 2019,30,"Beautiful hotel, food isn't great",We went mid January 2019.  Hotel was beautiful the room was lovely and the staff friendly. The facilities were great (spa pools poolside loungers etc).  Weather wise it was cool morning and evening but once the sun was out (between 10am and 6pm) it was lovely and warm. The heated outdoor pool also helped with this.    The food unfortunately was not great. The main restaurant had pretty average food that was basically the same for lunch and dinner each day. We only stayed 3 night's but we're getting a bit bored by the end.  We decided to pay for one of their speciality restaurants (free on Premium All Inc ~£9-£18 each on standard All Inc). We chose the Moroccan (~£9) but left during the main course and did not pay as the meat wasn't cooked (mince koftas and chicken skewers). The staff were okay about this the receptionist looked mortified when we told her and there was no quibbles about us paying for it.    The restaurant was also pretty busy at meal times with queues for some parts (pizza and grill mainly). We were off season and the hotel was generally very quiet so I can't imagine it during high season!    We got this holiday cheaply through a deals website and I'd say I was happy to pay what we did. I wouldn't pay full price though.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179ns
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,baldy_83 wrote a review Jan 2019,20,This hotel is not what we expected,On arrival we was told our room was not ready not a problem on returning to reception we was given a room on entering the room it was already occupied. Someone was in the bed room how embarising. On returning to reception there was no apologise the staff found it funny we did not. In the restraint I had some chicken which was pink inside under cooked. We had booked a ala carte Moroccan meal for the next day. I had eggs for breakfast they was burnt on the bottom . We had a light lunch on going to the morrocan restaurant I felt rather sick I had to leave returning to our room . I was very sick not a good start to our holiday. Tuesday I went to breakfast after not eating the evening before I decided to have a omlet I was shocked on returning to the table to find it was not cooked in the centre I did not eat it I was not well as it was I did not want to make myself worse I had already been sick one day. The bars are very poor I have felt that I am invisible at times as staff tend to serve anyone other than English speaking people they leave you standing there getting rather frustrated. I don't want to be complaining whilst on holiday the drinks are of a very poor quality you can ask for 2 drinks the same and they will both be totally different in taste. We was led to believe you could get a drink from 10 am until 12 am well the pool bar closes at 6.00pm then the other bar does not open until 6.30 PM. We was also told from the staff this bar closed at 11.30 PM so along with poor quality food and drink then you can get a poor quality drink from 10am until 6 PM then from 630 PM until 1130pm this is 1 hour short somewhere. Likewise as the snack bar supposed to be open until 6pm today it was closed at 5.30 PM very poor alround . I found the bed to be very hard the sunbeds are more comfotuble . If you want a reasonable holiday the go somewhere else the food at best is warm nothing is hot here including coffee tea best is like warm not my opinion of good atall,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hyde, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baldy_83

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sayitasitis2018 wrote a review Jan 2019,40,"Good value, would recommend",We booked this hotel as a Package through a well known internet discount company it was an all inclusive deal.  On arrival on room was ready it was a good size well furnished clean and had a good size bathroom but was very dark. The Hotel has all low rise buildings and is spread out over a large area. there are 3 large pools and a smaller paddling pool for small children. We spent a few days here in January what I would class as the adult pool must of been heated to 30 degrees it was a delight to be able to get in the water which was warmer than the outside temperature. A tip for you if going out of season like us take plenty of warm clothes and some slippers or flip flops as the floors in the rooms are freezing under foot. The weather during the day is sunny but the air is cold if you find a sun trap or are lying around the pool it is hot but in the shade it is very cold and the evenings are freezing so plenty of jumpers and coats required. The food at the hotel was good quality and freshly cooked at different service stations. There was a good variety plenty of choice Buffett service however the down side for us was it was always Luke warm. The reason being was not because it had been standing a long time but the restaurant wasn't particularly warm and all the China plates were freezing cold hence putting hot food on a icy cold plate by the time you got back to your table it was only Luke warm there was plate warmers there but they were not in use. There are a couple of Speciality restaurants that you can also use on the complex a Moroccan Italian and French all at extra cost and you have to give 24 hours notice if you wish to use these and rebook your choice of meal. We tried the Morrican and it was very good food hot and tasty. There were good facilities at the hotel plenty of activities arranged if you wished to take part. Plenty for youngesters Tennis Basketball table tennis etc. The grounds are well kept and clean & staff friendly  although please don't expect everyone to speak English as French is Morroccos second language. But you will get by. The all inclusive drinks package includes plenty of Water Soft drinks wine and local brand drinks. To be honest most people tend to stick to the water and soft drinks the local drinks are fine But remember this is a Muslim country. The one thing that really surprised me was that we had to pay to use the Gym I have never come across this before in my travels the gym was well equipped but at 80 M DHRS a day (£8) or 250M DHRS for the week (£25) I found this a bit extortionate. We love to use the gym on holiday so had to pay but it was very expensive and the most under used gym I have ever come across.  This is classed as a 5 star hotel I would say it's a 4 star it lacks the finesse of a 5 star hotel for the following reasons there are no robes or towering slippers the toiletries in the bathroom were missing hair conditioner body lotion and shower caps. No tea or coffee making facilities on the rooms. But as a summary it's a very nice hotel and great value for what we paid. And no upset tummies.,Date of stay: January 2019,,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sayitasitis2018
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,nicband wrote a review Jan 2019,50,Amazing new year,Arrived here Boxing Day for a week and can say we had the most amazing time ever. From the offset the staff couldn’t do enough for us the rooms were had were prefect and the beds were soooo comfortable. The meals were lovely after I few days we found it hard to eat any more. Was lovely to find branded pops and tonic waters. The animation team were so friendly and everyone off the team spoke to us daily even though we wasn’t French or with their travel company the Thomas cook rep was also lovely and very helpful. I found the little animal farm a lovely place to visit were the sun beds warmed up. New Year’s Eve was made so special by the staff a lot of organisation went into it and nothing was any trouble for the staff the little rose display which was left in our bedrooms new year eve was a lovely surprise. The fresh bottle of water which was left in our room daily was a great help too....over all couldn’t fault this hotel at all 10/10,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,notts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicband

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Johanna L wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Pretty hotel but not 5*,When we arrived (and throughout our stay) we fell in love with the landscaping and room design - the environment is really beautiful and the rooms tastefully decorated.  The staff is amazing and the second big plus in this hotel.    The room was correct and we liked the interior design however we missed some amenities usually found in 5* hotels (nothing in the fridge no welcome pack no watercooker to make tea or coffee in the room and no vanity pack with cotton swabs etc in the bathroom). Bathroom had soap/shampoo/shower products that were nice on the skin. It also seemed a bit odd that the safe was paying. Those are all smaller points which wouldn't be make or break for us.    The buffet was a let down food was often lukewarm and bland and also very repetitive. The dining area is a big hall and feels a bit like a canteen some dividers would make a nice addition.    The bed was unfortunately extremely uncomfortable; I felt like sleeping on concrete even after using the big duvet cover on top of the mattress. After the first night we asked the reception to add a surmatelas which housekeeping promptly provided (as mentioned above the staff is great).  With the extra cushioning we had better sleep the nights after but still below average. This was amplified by the fact that we could hear other guests through our door; maybe a second door after the short hallway would help (we didn't hear anything from the balcony door which was well insulated it was only from the direction of the entry).,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Velizy-Villacoublay, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johannal688
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Pamela L wrote a review Jan 2019,40,Kenzi Agdal A beautiful all inclusive resort,This was our first all inclusive experience as a family of four with two children under 4. The staff were friendly attentive and welcoming. English is the third language so plenty of opportunities to brush up on our basic french but communication wasn’t an issue. The resort is geared towards a predominantly french/Arabic speaking clientele.    The grounds of the hotel are immaculate and beautifully landscaped. There are 4 pools including a children’s pool outdoor heated pool and indoor heated pool. A gym (daily charge) and spa. There is also a small children’s play ground and petting zoo along with two clay tennis courts basketball football volleyball and table tennis - so lots to do. Oh and I forgot to mention the two bars and additional a la Carter restaurant. A free hourly shuttle to Marrakesh old town.    A warning the Souk can be a bit overwhelming if you have very young kids the Menara Mall has a small souk as well as play area and a 4th floor cafe with amazing views of the Atlas Mountains    Our room was situated in a Riad style complex and it was perfect perfect and the beds were amazingly comfortable. Baby Cot was provided at no extra charge. Our fridge was broken but someone was sent to bring us a replacement.    My only slight complaint was the time it took for our room to be made up by 3 members of the housekeeping team who took long to tidy on account of the fact they were chatting which frustrated us as we ended up longer out of our room pre dinner with a baby and toddler.    The buffet was good although I appreciate that it’s difficult to have masses of variety and so there was repetition. The desserts in particular were amazing. They also provided purées for babies too which was an added bonus. All drinks were included in the all inclusive package. Fettah and Kabu were exceptional in there service and so we looked forward to meal times as a family.    I have definitely been converted to all inclusive holidays with a young family and that is down to the superb facilities and staff at the Agdal.,Date of stay: January 2019,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frecklesandfro
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ski15 wrote a review Jan 2019,30,Nice hotel let down severely by the buffet and restaurants,"A lovely looking hotel. The rooms were good clean and relatively spacious. The pool areas were good and with one of them being heated. The staff and entertainment were very good. They try and make sure you're having a great stay.    The only let down was the food. The all inclusive buffet was pretty much the same everyday. Quite often the food was bland and boring. Occasionally the Tajine section had something nice but usually the meat was ""fatty grissely and boney""! On a few occasions certain items were stone cold as they were brought straight out of the freezer and left to warm up under the heating lamps or underneath food warmers. When challenged about this the restaurant's assistant manager couldn't care less. The alternative restaurants were lovely with their decor and ambiance but again let down by the quality of the food. A shame and you pay extra to dine at these so not fully all inclusive.",Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ski15

This year I chose Kenzi Club Agdal Medina and I enjoyed every minute of it. The staff is incredible so professional. Excellent entertainment team. All the guys and girls in entertainment team are very energetic and always make sure to keep everyone entertained.    Food variety is goodfrom Moroccan cuisine to the Italian one so delicious. There is plenty of lovely fresh food all day from the meals in the restaurant to the snacks in the snack bar by the pool. Drinks are also free flowing.  One can always find something to eat if not everything. Tumbs UP to the waiters who work very hard making sure everyone's happy. The rooms are recently decorated and spacious the beds are comfortable.    A special mention for the lovely warm gentleman who truly made my stay special Hicham Mellouli the director of the hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Barbs25 wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Fantastic week break,Read all reviews before booking and overall the ace really is perfect.  As everyone mentioned the entertainment team are fantastic not ever overbearing they understand if you want to be left alone but you won’t be able to help chatting to them they are so friendly and work so hard.  The room we had was great really big with a sofa chair balcony mini fridge great air on and the bathroom/ shower was brilliant.  Good choices were different everyday lots to choose from from authentic Moroccan food to chips/ pizza and everything inbetween.  Best thing here was the big bottles of water they offer out which you need as it’s so hot (and drinking water can’t even be used for brushing your teeth) ideal compared to other all inclusive which are stingy.  Alcohol selection was great and they give as many drinks as you like unlike other reviews we never found them to be tight with drinks at all.  We booked a half day city tour through reception private and very well priced. Our guide Sala took us to the YSL museum/ majorelle gardens/ Bahia palace and the markets - absolutely fantastic morning to take in the real Morocco.  We also did a trip to Essaouira but I can’t advise to avoid that enough 7 hour round trip and not worth it at all smelly fishing town with nothing really to do.    Overall could not fault this place the staff were always so friendly and we never felt threatened being 2 women alone.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sugarplum B wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Short break - 5 days,This hotel is fantastic lovely friendly and helpful staff very clean top notch food - so much variety and caters for everyone. The spa room was amazing. Highly recommend having a hammam and then a massage after so relaxing. The entertainment in the event is more for the kids (from when we were there) but even then the bar room area is spacious. The drinks are also tasty and live the 'punch' cocktail refreshing and not too alcoholy- if there is such a word. They also had a warm and a cold pool. And numerous sun beds so no need to claim a spot. Weather was in the 20° in the day but at this time of year the evenings are very chilly so take a warm jacket and adequate footwear . If you can do any excursions then try the horse and carriage ride in the evening as the hotels all have colourful illuminating lights. The main square is also vibrant and so much to see and do... so much souks and market food is delicious. Didn't have enough time to do the camel ride body Atlas mountain or do quad biking so defo worth another vist,Date of stay: December 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sugarplumb2014

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Shashikant P wrote a review Dec 2018,20,Accommodation passable.,The room had two single beds put together to make a double bed. Which means if as a couple you want to hug together and sleep the bed separated and one person would fall off the bed. On the second day the fire alarm went off in the room and it took more then 15 minutes before someone came and took the fire alarm off the ceiling and went which means there was no alarm in the room for the remainder of our stay.  The food was pretty much same menu everyday my wife being vegetarian found it really hard to notice what is what although there was some sign the utensils were used to take meat items were also used to take vegetarian items. The dessert was the same everyday. There was no spices ie chillies in food. They had world food one day but there was nothing from Indian continent. The atmosphere was very good great aromas in the foyer.

The hotel is pretty and presentable the room was lovely and had everything we needed.  We mainly ate in the buffet apart from One night in the Moroccan restaurant. Food was lovely with a lot of options.  The pools were massive with one of them being heated for the chillier times of the year.  We had a couple of massages in the spa which were great too.  What made the hotel even better was the entertainment team with Magic leading that team. Magic was absolutely brilliant he really looked after us. We had plenty to take part in during the day. Then at night they put on a show. One of the shows for me was one of the best I’ve seen in a hotel. We had a contortionist as well as a very talented man doing cirque du soleil moves!  Part of that team some members were exceptional Magic Mohriz (contortionist) Sarah Mido and Pichu.  All the staff in the hotel were friendly and great.

First the hotel is exceptionally clean and our room comfortable with all amenities you could need. Bottled water and towels were replaced everyday and the house keepers made the beds in a different style every morning which was a nice touch!  Having stayed all inclusive numerous times I know that food can usually be hit and miss but at the Kenzi hotel the food is just amazing! There is always something to eat no matter what hour and a huge selection that really is cooked beautifully. A full bottle of wine or pop is always given with every meal and u can take this with you to your room afterwards if you wish. It was especially nice of the staff one restaurent member in particular named Mustafa who would take our drinks and an ice bucket outside for us should we wish to sit out in the ambient outdoor area after out meal.  The staff really do go beyond to make you feel comfortable and well taken care of and although I do not know the names of all a select few such as Simon Medi Moris and vitamin were always on hand to make us feel welcome and happy during our stay.

Arrived late check was quite easy presented with a welcome drink cocktail. Took a very short drive by golf cart to our room which was upgraded to a Junior Suite which had way more room than we needed but it was lovely just the same ground floor and just a minute away from the pool and main restaurant.  The grounds and hotel are spotlessly clean and well maintained the restaurant serves a variety of continental and local dishes you will always find something to eat here.  We took the free mini bus in to the center you have to book with reception but it was well worth it.  The pool bar was set back from the pool service was hit and miss here if was busy forget it you would be better to go the bar by the entertainment stage.Drinks are very week especially cocktails beer and wine were fine.  Animation team were very friendly and put on a good show and had something going on day time and in the evening this was not expected and made a difference to our break as although it may be a bit cheesy it was fun to watch and join in.

From the start of the week to the end the place was kept clean the staff were amazing and friendly the food was all spot on with great restaurant staff and the resort itself was peaceful.  A lot of all inclusive hotels put on just the basics for dinner & lunches. Not here! Going all out each meal time! Really enjoyed every meal didn't once eat away from the hotel.  The rooms are huge and kept clean daily. The bed was very comfortable.  The entertainment in the evenings was also amazing.. The dancers were so good! Professionals I'm sure.. Along with great bar staff too.    Overall I couldn't fault the place at all.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Louise8818 wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Absolutely beautiful,What a beautiful hotel it is without fault!!    The hotel is set over a large amount of ground and is well built and absolutely gorgeous. Upon arrival VERY IMPRESSED!    The hotel offers a free shuttle to the media markets - it is required that you book it one day before (we managed to book on the day as there were 2 available seats)    The hotel has several pools one is absolutely massive complete with slides (which are separated) we went off peak so the slides were not on however when a child and parent asked to use them the life guard situated himself at the slides and turned them on for the child and his mother's use. There is also another pool of a fair size which is heated. You'll also find a children's pool should you have infants. You can use a pool towel but a refundable deposit is required.    The hotel also has a farm with a few farm yard animals which all looked very well looked after. The farm is not anywhere near any of the rooms so there are no smells or sounds distracting you.    The Atlas restaurant (all inclusive option) was incredible. There was so so so much choice and to make it even more of a wonder there were chefs cooking before your very eyes at breakfast lunch & dinner everything fresh and very well cooked. The hotel has plenty of olive and orange trees growing the produce is used during meal times which is absolutely incredible. The evening meals were themed 'Spanish night morrocan night fishermans dinner' each theme has food to correspond aswell has restaurant décor napkins etc. There is options to sit in or outside.    The staff in the Atlas restaurant will bring you anything you need. We would like to mention Hamsa he was the best waiter we encountered. We had the pleasure of being served by Hamsa two nights in a row. He was clearly very passionate about his job he served with a smile and made sure we we're well looked after.    The entertainment team were phenomenal. They came round at about half 10 and said hello to everyone around the pool. They occasionally invited us to join there dailt activities to which we declined. They understood we were there to relax and didn't want to be bothered so didn't make any attempts to lure us into there activities which to us is excellent. The entertainment team 'jet club' put alot of effort and passion into there jobs it was amazing.    The rooms are light and airy (our room had a bath as well as shower PERFECT) each room comes with a safe (which apparently you are supposed to pay for - we we're never asked for any money for it) our beds let it down slightly as we're two singles pushed together which wasn't ideal for us but was not a problem either.    We made use of the spa is was very reasonably priced (80dh for spa pool use about £8) the staff were very friendly pool very nice.    We we're overall very impressed with the hotel & staff.    Please be aware that the people of Marrakech like tips. The bell boy who took us to our room requested a tip this wasn't a bad thing just was quite surprised however it's important to tip where a tip is due in any country.    I highly recommend this hotel as it's truly a brilliant hotel.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Louise8818

The garden as extremely well kept as is the whole area. The swimming pools are extremely large and they even give you free transport into the Medina throughout the day.  I found the food nice enough but I am not a lover of self service whilst on holiday. They do also have 3 other restaurants for you to go to but you have to pay here. The Moroccan one is only 10 Euros each though and I enjoyed it there. I can honestly say that we thoroughly had a great time and we would both re-visit.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lozza wrote a review Nov 2018,50,A fab hotel with dedicated staff,After reading a lot of mixed reviews before and after booking we wondered whether we'd made the right choice before we arrived. This hotel absolutely smashed and surpassed our expectations and this was pretty much down to the wonderful staff. They work long hours and so hard to please every body. We didn't meet a single person who didn't speak great English and they all had a great sense of humour and went out of their way to chat with you and offer their help. The rooms were not exactly 4 star but they were comfortable and we were happy with it. We didn't really have a view or a great balcony/outside area but we didn't need it as the pool and restaurant/bar facilities were fab. There was constant food and drink available with all inclusive and the whole place was always spotlessly clean. The animation team are on the go all the time from breakfast to bed time and are all really great with guests ensuring they are ok and having a good time. We were so happy we chose this hotel it was a relaxing home away from home for our time in an otherwise hectic city!,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loz87p

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Travel_girl_bee wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Great facilities and top standards,Fast check in and nice spacious clean room on arrival. Welcoming staff and good quality food. Great facilities for sport - several swimming pools - one really well heated a separate kids pool with slide and a large non heated pool too keep fit and aquagym several times a day and tennis courts golf driving range..  there is also an indoor pool and sports centre but you have to pay for them (about 8€ per day for the gym and 10€ for the pool).  The rooms are recently decorated and spacious the beds are comfortable.    The cocktails in the all inclusive are nothing to right home about but the restaurant buffet really makes up for this - fresh tasty food that is well replenished and varied.    A good place for families as there are lots of things to do and also a baby and kids club. The baby club is not included (about 60€/day) but the kids club is free (3yrs and up),Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Paris, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_girl_bee
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mike C wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Overall very good,I have just come back from a 4 night 3 day golf trip with my adult sons. I have to admit I made a bit of a mistake as I intended to book the kenzi palace rather than kenzi club. However this wasn’t really a problem as the hotel is very clean and the rooms excellent . We had a very welcome free upgrade to the privilege area with a private pool and our own bar / waiter. We didn’t use the all inclusive too much as the main restaurant wasn’t really for us and we preferred to eat out in the town on 2 out of the 3 nights we were there. When we tried the food the fish themed dinner was ok to good although I would class the breakfasts as just ok. I can’t fault the staff at all. Re alcohol .. beer was very very nice and always cold ( not what I read before we came) white wine ok but rosé lovely . G&t whiskey&coke etc a bit hit or miss.  Needless to say we didn’t experience the much vaunted animation team but everyone else with much younger children than me ie 4 to 5 year olds seemed to be having a ball!  The hotel is in a good location 10 minutes via free shuttle from the medina and about 8 quid in a taxi home.  Would I recommend ? For a cheapish all inclusive stay with young children in would say yes . For golfers who want to combine golf and the wonders of eating in some fantastic restaurants in an amazing city I would say no or at least don’t pay for all inclusive - although we did try to drink our way back to break even pre and post dinner.  Overall thanks to the upgrade to the privilege area we had a lovely stay with no regrets about the hotel other than paying for all inclusive that we didn’t use,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/58MikeC58
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Darren Ferguson wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Very nice Hotel,This was our first time in Marrakech and stayed at this hotel after reading some reviews I wasn't sure what to expect but I was delighted with this hotel. The hotel is very clean and tidy we paid for the Double Deluxe Privilege room which gave us access to a private pool and also paid for all inclusive. The hotel is situated around 15-20 minutes from the airport. The hotel runs a free bus shuttle to and from the Market Square which then you decide where you want to go and do. Our room was very nice and have no complaints.  My only two negatives for the hotel is that some of the staff on reception could be a bit more welcoming and friendly. We asked for a iron and had an issue with the kettle in our room and we had to ask them 3 or 4 times to get it resolved. Rooms are cleaned every day which is nice.  The food in the restaurant is OK a mixture of different things to eat from pasta spaghetti meat chicken salad fish etc...You MUST try the Moroccan mint tea it is absolutely beautiful. The hotel is on beautiful grounds and very quite and peaceful. Overall we had a great time and would stay back at this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrenfergs

The rooms were large clean and very comfortable. The pool area was good and the food was nice. There was always a good variaty so you could find something that you liked. The only thing that was a bit of a let down was that the beer and alcohol ran out on most nights we were there. Ok it happens once but then you should make arrangements for it not to happen again the next night. If traveling to Marakesh again I would consider going back to Kenzi Club.,Date of stay: October 2018,,"Akranes, Iceland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hjordis112

We arrived early so rooms weren’t quite ready  however we were able to get a meal while we waited and afterwards our cases and ourselves were taken to our room by a porter on a truck. Our room had had a view of the Atlas Mountains. It was cleaned each day and fresh towels provided . The food was beautifully presented with lots of variety and lovely deserts . There was even pizza and chips for the kids . There was lots of choice including Morocan dishes and overwhelming variety at each meal time. Some food was cooked fresh while you waited particularly at.breakfast time . All the catering staff were always peasy to and helpful including those who waited on and cleared away . All the staff were always courteous without exception. The pools and outside catering facilities were also very good . The entertainment team were without doubt exceptional and the jewel in the crown for this hotel. They were all amazing. They worked so hard throughout the day either with sporting events dancing  pool aerobics darts and activities for the children. They did so with enthusiasm and with a real passion each of them really appeared to love there work and oh those dancers  incredible. . The shows in the evening so atmospheric and so much audience participation it was thoroughly professional and enjoyable they all worked with infectious enthusiasm that you really just had to join in. They really seemed tocare that we all had a good time. They were all so very friendly  welcoming and warm that they felt like family. They were also very skilled in their profession.  it was a holiday like no other and ourselves and the children were very sad to leave..

Not only did we have stained bedding with hairs in it the pillows were lumpy the bathroom grotty (with 1 small towel provided). We paid for full board with meant alcohol and food included. The food consisted of a buffet which was very average- the deserts were sickly or bland as could be there were flies everywhere and birds within the indoor eating area. The food wasn't awful but not that best- I would advise sticking to the Moroccan themed food as it was easily the nicest out of everything! The alcohol included were disgusting cocktails and the pool bar which is again rather grotty beer and wine ( the beer was warm and served in dirty glasses and the wine was just about as cheap as it can get) of course I know the hotel is affordable and going full board means it isn't exactly going to be bottles of champagne at the ready however 5 star is simply hilarious for this hotel to be selling itself on... it is 3 star at a push!,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mobile39324324911

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,djsamjames wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Lovely holiday,My wife and I have just got back from a weeks stay here with out 6 year old and 2 year old. After reading some of the other reviews we were a little worried but we can honestly say we had a fantastic weeks holiday but would we stay again...? Possible not and this was only because the extras that you need to pay for did get a little annoying and the drinks weren’t amazing quality.  My wife and I were planning on using the gym and training together as we don’t get to do this at home so out 6 year old wanted to go to the kids club while we went and we planned on putting our 2 year old in the baby club. But when we arrived it was 80 dirhams (£6.50) each to use the gym each day and also we had to pay for the baby club at either a cost of 600dirham (£48) for a full day or we could pay half for half a day. First of all we only wanted a hour to ourselves not half a day and certainly not a full day.  Food was really quite good decent choice every night and very good quality but there was one station where all the food was cold the hot plates just weren’t good enough to keep the food warm which really let it down.  The staff were all amazing 5* all round we thought. Yes some of there English isn’t great but everyone was very help full and friendly. We both really enjoyed trying to remember our French from school which made things a lot easier.  Our room was amazing! Huge bed a sofa bed and a travel cot and there was still plenty of room for all 4 of us. Bathroom was very nice as well.  The animation team were amazing!! They work so so hard with very long hours at no point did they pressure you into taking part in activity’s and were all so good with the children. My daughter especially liked a couple of hours a day in the kids clubs where she had great fun.  Pool area was lovely with very comfy beds though the water was pretty chilly!! And our 2 year old screamed every time we tried to take him in the water.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djsamjames

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Louise M wrote a review Oct 2018,50,When can we go back?!,Recommendation for Kenzi Club Agdal Médina in Marrakesh.  I’m just back from a fab week with my wee family at this great 4 ⭐️ all inclusive. It was highly recommended to us by friends and we decided to give it a go and chase the illusive October sun. There’s nothing as concrete as a recommendation from friends.  We had to fly via Gatwick but the flights were straightforward.  My kids are 9 & 7 and we were in a family room which they loved. (Like something out of the Waltons!) the food was great the wine surprisingly so and the resort was exceptionally pretty. Set in an olive grove with lovely lanterns and twinkly lights and the weather was just glorious. We sat outside for every meal under a canopy of olives and canvas of an evening while the kids rampaged with their new friends and they loved the entertainment and the mini disco. Marrakesh too was a treat and we experienced a quite incredible trek in the Atlas Mountains as a private day excursion followed by a traditional lunch in Kasbah Toubkal which is a National Geographic Iconic Lodge of the World.  The resort had bags of space and wonderful plush day beds by the pool with plenty of entertainment should you have wished it. I dipped in and out of it and experienced my first (and last) “aqua spin” class!  6 nights all inc and flights £2200. For those seeking a cheeky wee October break I was super impressed and that is not always achievable!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,pedrito65 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,6-13 October 2018,Firstly you are in Morocco the first language of Morocco is Arabic please stop whining on about how the staff don't speak English. Many of the staff do indeed speak some English. The hotel is mainly geared to French clientele so if you desperately need to speak to someone in English take a holiday in England.    The hotel is clean with well tended gardens.    Reception. We were the only 2 people checking in and out and both times reception staff were excellent.    Pool Bar. Staff work as fast as they can to serve their customers. The problem they have is that the beer pump is very slow to pour and high beer consumption means the barrel is frequently changed. More waiting time. Also they ran out of beer a couple of times. A management issue. Staff are very friendly try a few words in Arabic give them a laugh.    Gnawa Bar. Plenty of seating. TV's showing live football. Waiting on staff are good but very busy. Service at the bar was good. Friendly bar staff once again. Ran out of beer a couple of times.    Lively Pool. Clean. Refreshing. This is where the Animation staff ply their trade. Music was awful. I think the same tracks were played every day for the whole week we were there. Decent songs rerecorded in a jazz fashion. Plenty of sun loungers with mattresses. Three short water slides.  Pool towels can be hired for a returnable deposit.    Animation team. What a great bunch of guys these are. Cannot fault.    Room 428. AC. Cleaned daily. Towels soap etc daily. Decent shower over bath plenty of hot water. Hairdryer. Bed was enormous very enormous reasonably firm but no overly so for us. TV with English French Arabic channels. Fridge payable safe small balcony plenty of storagevery quiet part of grounds. This block has a pool that attracts the afternoon sun.    Food. We only ate in the main buffet restaurant and did not try the payable restaurants.  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Staff inside and outside were excellent.    Food. Fresh pasta pizza cooked meat stations. Plenty of choice of veg tagine rice etc if a little repetitive [typical All Inc]. Different theme each night. The white wine was a local Moroccan and not very good.    Small petting farm and children's play area.    Communal toilets were always spotless and must be cleaned every 30 minutes.    Evening Ents. Reasonable singer to start us off then the Animation/Child Minding staff dancing to themed music on stage. All looked like they were having a great time doing it. Especially when they messed it up a bit.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Karla O wrote a review Oct 2018,20,Meh...not a 5 star hotel.,I don’t understand why this place has better reviews than Kenzi Menara Palace. After staying at both I just can’t seem to understand that. Every time I read reviews I wonder about the person’s credibility and knowledge of what they’re about to write. I can tell you I have 50 countries under my belt have stayed at some of the best hotels in the world (Four Seasons Casa De Camp etc) and have dined with Thomas Keller Jose Andres Chef Maido and Chef Virgilio (Central in Lima Peru) from the Top 50 restaurants in the world to name a few. I love food and travel! This is not to sound pretentious but to give some background and perspective on my review. Upon arrival I could immediately tell this was not a 5 star hotel. The staff barely speaks...anything...we tried English Spanish and German (all we can speak) and it was horrible to try to communicate with anyone here I kept hearing this as a complaint from non-French guests. They charge extra for pool towels and security boxes among other things (are guests stealing towels?) and the facilities are meh... the AC in our room never worked properly. The rooms need some TLC but that’s the least of my worries. The food was bland as hell. I understand they cater to all people when it’s all inclusive (which is why I don’t really like all inclusives) and it’s easier to add salt than to remove it but cold dishes when they’re supposed to be hot and tasteless food is not appealing to me.  The drinks were horrible!!!! Wow!!!! That’s all I can say about that. We decided to stick to water. I had many glasses with lipstick brought to me and dirty plates in the buffet areas. We asked for our room not to be cleaned and left the “do not disturb sign” on but came in to a clean room and no towels... this is not to sound negative or to be super complaining. I always make the most of things and enjoy myself but this was nowhere near our expectations especially after reading the reviews. It’s jusy not a 5 star hotel it’s an ok hotel for a decent price. Nothing that will leave you wanting some more.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mounty90 wrote a review Oct 2018,40,Late Summer Break,I really wanted to give 5 stars but there were a few things that let it down.  We'll start with the good though. The food was lovely with plenty of variety. There was Tagines every night for people who wanted to try something new. Grilled meat chips potatoes and veg for the less adventurous and pizza and pasta for the kids. There was also a carving station every night and a themed section in the middle ranging from Asian food to Italian. Anyone who said they couldn't find anything to eat clearly wasn't looking very hard!  The room was fantastic we had the superior room and it was a really good size with a large bathroom an extra toilet and a lovely little balcony area.  There were 3 pools so you could choose whether you wanted to be round the slightly noisier pool with all the activities and music or the quiet pool for a more relaxing atmosphere. It was always really clean and never an issue for sunbeds.  The staff were all polite helpful and friendly and the animation team were amazing. I was reluctant at first but by the end of the week even I was getting involved with their activities!  The couple of bad points there were areas of the buffet where the food was consistently cold every day of the week maybe the hot plate wasn't working in this area? Also the lounge bar was a bit odd... more like a cheesy disco than a lounge and it was hit and miss what drinks you could get. My husband asked for a beer which he was told they didn't have in that bar only to later see another guest with a tray of beers?  Overall though i enjoyed my stay and I would return.,Date of stay: October 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mounty90

This review is completely non bias and fair.    If you are reading this review do not book this Kenzi! There is another Kenzi that is roughly 5 minutes drive away. It is called Kenzi Menara Palace it is a great all round hotel.    When we arrived at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina we was greeted by security we then checked in everything was good. Beautiful room and surroundings area. However the food is awful lack of variety and hygiene. On the third day of our holiday we went to have a Hammam. The steam room was awful it smelt like damp and felt unclean! The staff were extremely rude they left us in the steam room for over 25 mins we called for assistance no one came so we came out the steam room after 30 mins of being alone. We then had the scrub while the staff spoke between themselves and we was told to wash our own hair.    Poor food quality not much variety and lack of hygiene. Kenzi Menara Palace has much better food and general hotel quality.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/489akb
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CrisZ64 wrote a review Sep 2018,40,An overall good experience,I just came back from visiting Marrakech. I went for a bridge tournament which was in the hotel so we decided to stay there. The rooms are very spacious and as far as I could see all have a terrace. The staff is very very friendly and extremely helpful. The facilities are great and very adequate. As it is all inclusive you will find the room fridge empty. I think basics could be put in the room like some soft drinks and a bottle of wine which is included in the meals and soft drinks. My safe was closed when I arrived but within half an hour a technician came and fixed. The food has an ample choice and there are 3 restaurants to choose from as well as a great bar which nobody seems to know exists. 2 great pools but extremely loud music when they have their aqua gym sessions which really destroy the peace for those who just wish to read by the pool.

In our room there were no kettle facilities and the mini bar was empty and despite many calls to reception to request either a kettle or warm milk we were ignored . The grounds were nice but disappointed with the facilities and overall standards.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Steveemma007 wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Not as advertised,Would have been a 2 but the grounds made it a 3.  Nice reception area but at check in you soon realise that English is very limited here.  The room large and well furnished but the bed is dreadful so hard making a good nights sleep impossible. Room was cleaned on a regular basis and no problems there. All inclusive?? Read the small print first pay for gym pay for towels pay for restaurants all makes this a limited experience.  All the entertainment is geared towards the French speaking entertainment was ok but nothing spectacular. They advertise a golf introduction each morning to me this is someone teaching you basics etc far from it. Few golf balls and shoddy clubs just handed to you no instruction whatsoever.  The food was ok but I was ill after first night with upset stomach this put me of it throughout the stay.  My wife was rudely spoken to by a member of bar staff after a drinks mix up. This again was another small issue which made the stay not great.  On a good note the grounds are awesome. Have noted on here that the hotel management only responds to positive reviews?

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Georgie W wrote a review Sep 2018,30,Holiday to celebrate sons 18th birthday,We visited from 5th September for a week. Beautiful gardens and grounds beautiful complex. Unfortunately on the second night we were awoken by vomiting and severe diarrhoea and my son was unable to leave the room until the day before we left. The hotel infirmary were very helpful with providing tablets and the waiters brought water and omelette to our room. Sadly having looked forward to the holiday so much my son was barely able to leave his bed. We didn’t eat anywhere else apart from at the hotel All through the holiday and were perfectly well when we first arrived. My son is still ill back in the UK and is under medical care.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Natasha C wrote a review Sep 2018,20,I wouldn’t stay here again!,Myself and my friend visited Marrakech for the first time we opted to stay at this hotel as the photos looked great on Booking.Com. Upon arrival at the hotel we were amazed at the hotel it is a very clean modern hotel with spacious rooms. However the look of a hotel is not what makes the hotel worth visiting again we found the staff at her desk to be very rude and not attentive especially Adel a member of staff who was very rude to us.    We had a phone call at 10pm on our first night (we were asleep) to see if everything was ok. Surly this could have waited until we woke up the following morning.    The food is very poor we went all inclusive only to find ourselves eating at the restaurant 3x in our week stay. We ended up eating out at the restaurants next door.    Our friends visited from another Zenzi hotel only to be told they were not allowed to enter.    To top it off we went for a Hammam (a Moroccan scrub) on our last day. The hammam was meant to last 30 minutes we were told to sit in a steam room we were left in there for 45 minutes we had to get out to call someone to see what was going on. Then we had a 15 minute scrub which was not pleasent. They told us to wash our own hair when this is apart of the experience and then they poured shower gel on our heads instead of shampoo leaving our hair dry. We complained only to be told there is nothing they could do we still had to pay.    This hotel is nice to look at but the customer care is appalling! We visited our friends hotel which was around 10 minutes walk Zenzi Menara Palace we wish we had stayed there. The hotel was stunning food was delicious and the service was great! We weren’t staying at the hotel however the staff were very welcoming towards us and allowed us to eat at a discounted rate.,Date of stay: September 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natashac260

It is located only a short drive from the airport so you can be in the pool 15 minutes after you get there!  I found the hotel to be very clean and well maintained. The gardens are beautiful full of orange trees and roses.  I was with 2 teenage children and we shared a double room with pull out bed there was plenty of room for us all. The rooms were serviced each day and kept spotless.  There were 2 pools both nice and large and around them there are lots of loungers available and covered cabanas so no problem finding a comfortable places to relax.  There is plenty of lovely fresh food all day from the meals in the restaurant to the snacks in the snack bar by the pool. Drinks are also free flowing.  There is a free shuttlebus to take you into Marrakech which we used.  The animation team were great and kept evryone excercised and entertained.  We really liked the hotel and would reccomend it.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ca944652 wrote a review Aug 2018,20,Beware - NOT a true all inclusive resort,I have just returned from a 5 night stay at this resort with 2 friends. We were looking forward to a relaxing all inclusive holiday however experienced quite the opposite.    1) Unhelpful reception staff - warning to english speaking tourists all staff at the hotel spoke extremely limited english and we found it very difficult to communicate with them for even basic questions. Reception staff were unwelcoming and would give one word replies to question and had a general unwelcoming attitude.    2) NOT A TRUE ALL INCLUSIVE - Despite the hotel advertising 3 restaurants at the resort only the buffet restaurant is included in the all inclusive package you had to pay 200 dirhams per head to dine at either of the other two restaurants. We were also surprised to find there was a charge of 8 dirhams/day to use the gym and 10 dirhams per day to use the indoor pool. There is a charge of 2 dirhams/day to use the room safe. Surely this defeats the purpose of an 'all inclusive' package?    3) We had to pay a deposit of 400 dirhams at check in to secure 3 pool towels which we received back at check out. This wasn't a huge issue however 400 dirhams for 3 towels is slightly excessive?    4) There were no bath towels in the room on arrival. We had to repeatedly call reception every single day to ask for bath towels as housekeeping did not replace used ones. It took over an hour for towels to be brought to the room every day as we had to call reception multiple times to remind them.    5) General hygiene of the buffet restaurant is very poor. We found the chairs and cutlery to always be dirty with dried up food. Food is very repetitive and there is a different theme every evening however there were only a couple of dishes actually relating to the theme everything else was the exact same daily. There is always a selection of tagines as well as a pasta station however VEGETARIANS BEWARE! On multiple occasions the labels on the tagines were incorrectly placed and I had to swap them myself. One on occasion I ate tagine thinking it was vegetarian however the label was wrong and it was fish! The restaurant staff did not seem to care.    6) Wasp/Bee problem - despite being indoors there were a large amount of wasps flying around the buffet restaurant. There is also a huge wasp problem at the snack bar and poolside wasps absolutely everywhere we even saw a couple of dead wasps inside the juice dispenser.    7) Spa - We found the staff at the spa to have a bad attitude they were constantly giggling and speaking about us in french making us feel quite uncomfortable. The lady at the spa reception also lied to us on one occasion when we tried to book ourselves in for the hammam telling us it was full. When we went down and saw the hammam it was completely empty. The massages in general were of a poor standard and made me question whether the staff were even trained.    8) WiFi - only available at reception and in the rooms. There is no wifi at poolside or in the restaurants    Despite the experience we had with the service and all the hidden costs the hotel grounds are absolutely beautiful and clean and were probably the only positive thing about this hotel. We decided to complain about our experience to the reception manager who was very friendly and we ended up getting 300 dirhams taken off the final bill.    If you are looking for a family friendly resort there is plenty of entertainment and activities for young children however if you are looking forward to a 4-5* luxury all inclusive holiday this is definitely NOT the place.,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ca944652

There was no problem getting a subbed each day. Pools are cleaned every night. Restaurant had plenty of choice. All around the hotel they are cleaning all the time. The only thing lacking is a room / place to go in the day if you sit inside. You can sit in reception but it would be nice to have a library area. I would like to see some hand sanitizers in the entrances to communal areas / restaurants. We did have a problem and they were very quick to resolve and compensate with a treatment in their lovely Spa.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Verwood, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eleanorasnora

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,wandanafaheem wrote a review Aug 2018,30,A big Thank you for the animation team,Great 👍 Family Resort especially good for Halal Holidays with all facilities with in. Chosen by chance & selected by choice & attracted by special offer really great 👍 for full family & kids friendly environment really worth money 💰 spent.    Pros 😃  - beautiful interior & exterior  close to airport  “please check the price of taxi 🚕 before ride - 50-100 dirhams maximum !!! I was asked 300 dirhams”  - great staff from door 🚪 to check in friendly helpful & easy going  smiley 😃 faces all around.  - Beautiful designs & decors  the idea of greenery outsides the rooms the gardens & trees 🌳 outside the rooms gives the looks of little jungle- really pleasant in hot weather.  - spaceous room with sofa 🛋 bed 🛏 & small little gallery with chairs for outside. Electric kettle missing !!! But with limitless drinks wasn’t missed.  - lovely outside decors with snack bars at hours of Resturant closed limitless drinks 🥤 snacks  food 🥘  Very good at cleaning & domestics cleaning any food on floor in seconds  great chefs & Resturant staff  - pools great separate one for kids than for families & for adults clearly marked with depths & areas  life guards in duty clearly visible.  - Entertainment team was great & amazing 😉 Peechoo & Mahmadoo are great entertainers. Starting from morning Aquagym belly 💃 dance  Zoomba & evening entertainment- amazing 😉 no match for it !!! Bravo 👏  - Kids club - one of the best & of its kind. Baby club for babies  mini club for kids & maxi club for teenagers from start to finish including arranging lunch & food & snacks & swims - my daughter loved it & she wanted to stay for another week with them !!!! 👏  - outdoor activities like beach volleyball 🏐 tennis 🎾 archery 🏹 etc mini zoo really had good time with kids.  - unlimited drinks 🍸 at bar  snack bar & staff really good in accommodating alcoholic & non alcoholic drinks.  - porters in typical Moroccon dress in their mini electric cars carrying all luggage    Cons 😞  - Reception very friendly but slow & Check in not possible before 14:30 🕝 😢 tough for families with screaming kids in hot environment please be courteous to families & kids.  - slowest house keeping team I don’t know if they limited staff or the staff they have works limited but by the time they start our room would be late afternoons & by the time the towels & bedsheets arrives separately would be evening  - Air conditioning was great only at reception hall but poor at room & requested reception who said technician coming which didn’t happen till we left. Terrible at night after midnight there wasn’ any Cooling till early hours of the morning & poorly kids & baby were screaming  - Resturant was great but long ques for Grillades  pizzas 🍕 & pasta bars - need some extra staff n space for these areas. Food quality can be further improved with some added spices and salt. Different theme every night but please be courteous to Halal eaters as I spotted Pig 🐖 meat with picture highlighted in the breakfast. Also be courteous to people who doesn’ Eat fish 🐠 so they can have alternatives available as on one occasion it was fishermen dinner and everything had fish in it  i dont like fish so only option i had was chips? I wanted to get some salads to find even they had fish in them and tagines had fish too :( so you can get some variety so incase if someone doesmt like fish they can ahve any alternative  - spa - I can understand the charge for massag  Hamam etc But this is the only place where they would charge for using gym !!! Only place where they charge for using indoor pool 🏊‍♀️!!!! Only place where they would charge for sauna 🧖‍♂️ after initial use !!! Terrible  After all these activities who would bother using ur sauna n indoor pool than ??  All in All Great place for families to have fun time together with Kenzi Club team 😃  One more advise please do something about the bees in snack bar ? I am very sure there must be soemthing that can be done ? I have seen quite a few kids getting stung by the bees ? We really wanted to relax and enjoy our stay rather then worry every minute about my kids getting stung by bees,Date of stay: August 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandanafaheem

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Pam S wrote a review Jul 2018,20,What a shame...,Positives first: food is good and don’t agree with the ‘not enough variety’ comments. Yes it’s true that the pasta station is always there as is the salad bar etc... but I don’t tend to want to eat tagine and pizza at the same meal..    Grounds are beautiful. Swimming pools nice. Lots of entertainment for kids and activities for adults too. Rooms are spacious.    Negatives: not a true all inclusive resort. Any opportunity to make money from guests is grabbed. Why do we have to pay a daily rate for the room safe? Surely keeping our belongings safe is a pretty basic ask...Why do we have to pay to use the gym? Why do we have to pay a ‘deposit’ for pool towels yep the cash is returned to you on the day you check out but why do we have to hand over cash in the first place? I have been to numerous all inclusive resorts where they operate a towel card system that doesn’t require cash up front. Seems to me that it’s a handy way for the hotel to utilise free money for a week or so... room cleaning.. have had to phone reception every day to ask for bath towels for the room... water is not replenished daily.. have had to ask for that too.. had to move bed to look for a dropped key card and found opened biscuit packets and sweet wrappers there - pretty yuck. Queues at bar to get drinks of any description is tedious and if you don’t speak French then you definitely have to wait for longer!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Cinders28 wrote a review Jul 2018,40,Great for the price,My husband and our two teenage boys 18 and 16 years stayed here for a week at the beginning of July.    We had heard and read conflicting reviews of Morocco and Marrakesh so went with an open mind and the opinion of it was just a week so even if it was terrible we would cope. Well we were pleasantly surprised with what we found. I always give an open and honest review so I hope you all find this on useful.    We booked the holiday package with BA and paid around £500 each for the week that was flights transfers hotel all inclusive; the boys are classed as adults so based on this we thought we were getting a pretty good deal.    The flight was great and the arrival was swift. The Moroccan airport is a very long wait in the security queue; we were there around hour and 45 mins just waiting to have our departure cards reviewed and then allowed out of the airport. Your bags are also scanned many times even as you are leaving the airport which I found very strange but security is just that so as long as you expect the wait then that's fine.    The transfer was great and within around 10 mins we were at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. There is security at the door but this is nothing to worry about you then have a swift check in with extremely pleasant staff and are then taken to your room. There is a tall man wearing a fez and typical Moroccan dress that insists on taking you by buggy with your cases to your room and then waits for a tip; if you don't have any money as we didn't at that point then he walks off muttering and cursing you. Given theat we could have easily walked to our room within 2 mins (we were Riad 1) it all seemed a bit pointless and as if it was all done just to get the tip.    The room was clean and spacious and ideal for what we needed we had rooms 103 and 108. The keys were easy to use and we even had a card that you could use for the air con to be left on during the day instead of having to leave your room without it. There is a big bottle of water left in your room every day and a fridge to keep it cool but if you ask at the restaurant they will happily let you have more water if needed. Ladies there is a hairdryer provided which is in the bathroom but if you use any other hair styler like straighteners you will need to take an extension cable as the plugs and mirrors are not near each other. There is a safe but this is chargeable at the reception area. They will give you a code and then you can use the safe.    We only went to the buffet restaurant and found the food to be plentiful and something for everyone. Breakfast lunch and dinner were always good. Sometimes the food wasn't always hot but we found this was if we went in later in the evening / afternoon nearing closing time. Usually we went in around the opening time and everything was always fresh and at the right temperature. We found the wine to be ok and often had a bottle of red with our dinner usually it was a glass of beer with lunch and always still or sparkling water. There was also the choice of bottle of coke fanta and lilt so something for everyone. The staff were really friendly if you were with them we found. We don't speak much french but the odd 'Merci' goes a long way. Yes they are busy but that would be the case in any restaurant. They do try their best though and I find that if you treat people how you want to be treated it usually works out well.    The pools are either the activity pool with the water slides water polo etc or the 'quiet pool' which actually isn't quiet as it is right next door to the activity pool but it just means that there are no activiites there :) We opted for this pool on the second day and really loved it there. The boys went on the water slides the first day but soon tired of them and took to sunbathing and taking a dip in the pool for the rest of the holiday. Sunbeds are plentiful and you do not need to be up at the crack of dawn to get a decent seat. If beds are left unattended for over an hour (unless it is breakfast / lunch time) the pool staff can come and remove the belongings so this does stop alot of the reserved sunbeds and no one on them all day scenario. The sunbeds are also really comfy and well made which made a pleasant change too. There are also plenty of umbrellas to keep people shaded in the heat of the day (in the sun it was 66 degrees c when we were there and 48 in the shade). Something I have never soon before is that they had fan attached to poles which also had small jets of water that were sprayed out of them to add moisture to the air dotted all around the pool and bar and restaurant areas. This was a welcome sight and really did help with the heat. Pool towels are available to rent for the time you are there and can be changed on a daily basis at the pool hut to the back of the activity pool. make sure you return your towel cards when you check put and your deposit can go towards your Moroccan city tax which is payable per person per night on check out. This works out about £18 per two people for the week.    Bars - well the pool bar is the only place to get drinks during the day which is a shame as if you don't want to be around the pool for whatever reason you really have no choice if you want a drink. People mention quite a lot about wasps they are not wasps.... they are African bees and there are quite a lot around the pool bar mainly because of the sticky sweet drinks like cola and grenadine that are being served. It is not something I have come across previously but the staff do their best to keep it under control with electric zappers and cleaning the areas frequently.  The evening bar by the restaurant is a bit hit and miss regarding service but once you find your feet with the waiters they are more than happy to make sure you have good service; a tip in advance is always a good way to get this. We usually tip for good service at the end of our stay but found here you needed to tip in advance to get good service it wasn't needed repeatedly and therefore we didn't tip at the end of the stay.    The hotel is mainly French and Belgian guests with a splattering of English families which was fine for us as when we don't mind who we are holidaying with. We also found everyone to be very pleasant and friendly.    Checkout was swift and tranfer again was very smooth. The airport however takes a good 2 hours to get through before you are in departures. There was a queue to get in to the airport as you put your luggage through a scanner then you queue to drop baggage there was a queue again to go through the departure check scnner for hand luggage where all shoes are removed even flip flops then you need to fill out another departure card and have your passports checked and then you go through to departures. This airport you can purchase goods in Euro's or Dirhams but it is very expensive. Oh I forgot to mention that you also get checked / searched at the departure gate!    All in all we had a great time the only trip we did was to the medina and the souks and we hired a guide to take us through the souks and we went to the Moroccan side not the tourist side so we saw the traditional side of the area. It was really good and I would certainly recommend doing this and not going on an organised tour as we saw many of these 'human trains following a red board held above someone head'; not fun in my opinion as we could go wherever we wanted to. We also walked to the shopping centre which was about 20 mins walk away by the cinema this was quite safe and it has outlet stores like Adidas which were really good. There is also a Carrefour if you want to take snacks for going back to the airport :)    Would I go back? Yes I would as we had a lovely time and especially for what we paid. The weather was amazing and the hotel was good and as a family we spent some quality time together. Yes there are some issues but it is what you make it.,Date of stay: July 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinders28

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,HottottyLondon wrote a review Jul 2018,30,EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED :(,"Where to begin...... Unfortunately this hotel was well below standard! We didn't get off to a good start as unfortunately my daughter left her passport at the airport at the Bureau de change. The female receptionist (Long hair in a pony tail bright orange lipstick) did not want to know was extremely unhelpful and told us to go back to airport as she couldn't check my daughter in. She was most unhelpful and just turned away from us. Very long story short after three visits back to the airport with the help and advice of a hotel guest after the Bureau De Change saying they didn't have it then on the 3rd visit me demanding to see CCTV and call the police they found it at customer services thanks to the Head Of security a man named Jad. We had travelled through the night and were exhausted. When we got back to the hotel totally for the 2nd time without her passport the female receptionist told us we could go to the room now but only gave us one key. When I asked her if we could have two she signed and just threw another key card at me which wasn't even programmed in!!! We were taken to the room which was a disgrace!!!!!! The bed was falling apart the balcony was a cesspit cubbyhole and we were miles away from the pool and everywhere. So we went back to reception and I explained that we are two females and don't want to be by a private pool we want to get involved with activities and be somewhere with atmosphere plus the room as was disgrace! She merely said OK then turned to her colleague and started speaking in Morrocan and looking at us and laughing!!!!!!!! The man receptionist saw what was going on and came and took over. He was so friendly and helpful and apologised and told us it would all be ok. I was disgusted by her unprofessional and disgusting behaviour!! You never bite the hand that feeds you!!! And speaking to other hotel guests they also said she was rude and unprofessional. Thankfully the man was fantastic and made sure we were good. I must stress that at no point was I rude to her for her behaviour towards us. Secondly the chambermaid kept leaving us ONE towel only! When I asked her two she looked at me and said ""I come back later"". Did she???? Did she hell.... My daughter and I had to share a towel for two nights! Breakfast was a whole other tribulation.. We sat down and 15 mins later one coffee cup would appear. (There was 2 of us having breakfast!) When I asked for another cup 10 mins later we were still waiting.... When I got up to ask again he gave us a cup and no teaspoons!!!!!! The food was hit and miss and on the last night was so inedible that I had some French bread with raw onions! I could go on and it was the little things that were so frustrating that in the end I just wanted to go home... The animation team were amazing and worked sooo hard but I don't speak French and that is the only language they did the sports in so I didn't bother. But they were a great team and a credit to the hotel for how hard they work. The grounds were fabulous and well looked after. Our room was clean despite no towels. All in all would I got back to Marrakesh? Yes it was beautiful and the tours were fab. Would I got back to that hotel? Never!!!!! For us to be treated like a piece of rubbish by that receptionist when we needed help I have a bad taste in my mouth now and next time it will be The Sofitel for me!!!!",Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HottottyLondon
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,mariemurray wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Unimpressed,Positives: good size room Clea Nice shower nice food reasonably priced.    Negatives: charged a daily fee for the gym which I was appalled by so I didn't go! Juice/snack bar was swarming with flies so we couldn't eat there. The seemingly adult pool was overrun with children and the security guards did nothing about it regardless of how noisy it was. staff were unfriendly with limitwd english. There were no floating devices provided for the pool. guests had to buy them at the shop.    Overall I was very unhappy with all the hidden costs of the all- inclusive package. I woulld not stay in this hotel again. The reason we returned to Marrakech for a second time was because of the wonderful time we had in the pullman hotel. Wanting to try somewhere different did not serve us well. I regret that we didn't return to the pullmam this time.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariemurray
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,buckley88 wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Great 4 day break,Arrived at the hotel and we were sent to dinner by the receptionist with our wristbands so we wouldn’t miss it and then could come back to check in after dinner. This was great as if we had to check in and then go to dinner we would have missed it.    I forgot my toothbrush and so rang reception to send me up one and they didn’t have one which I thought was strange for a 5 star hotel.    The pillows in the bed were rock hard. But beds were made each day and room tidied. Tv was limited to 2 English channels. My main issue was the fact that my room had no WI-FI. However my friends who were next door had perfect Wi-Fi. It was extremely frustrating. No Wi-Fi in the bar or at dinner. Very limited Wi-Fi which really is not good enough.    Food was fantastic big range for children non adventurous adults and then food for the very adventurous individuals.    Drinks during the day included wine spirits (local) and soft drinks and some cocktails. Nighttime drinks were a little better and the entertainment was your typical cringe holiday rep entertainment but a good laugh once you had enough free wine consumed.    The jet team (reps) were so energetic and amazing. They really made the holiday that bit more special and added a lot to the resort. They are so friendly and helpful.    Overall I loved the resort with some small changes it could be worthy of its 5star rating.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buckley88

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jade wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Lovely break,First time visiting Marrakech and we were not disappointed. Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Kenzi Club for 5 days and we really enjoyed it. Our room was gorgeous very modern and plenty of room. The grounds around the hotel were kept very clean and the gardening was very lovely.    The only thing we were slightly disappointed with was the food. Not very much choice. We are not fussy but I can imagine if you are then it’s not really the place for you. Most nights it was traditional Mexican. Not many themed nights or choice to choose from.    Not far from the centre of Marrakech. We got a cheap taxi ride to the market which only took 7-10 mins.    Overall we had a lovely 5 day break.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Neil R wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Lovely hotel for shirt stay - food dissapointing,Stayed here for 6 days June 2018 hotel  grounds  room and pool brilliant. We were ulgraded to suite and the rom was great clean spacious and 2 TVs to watch world cup :-).... The hotel is let down by two key factors :  1. The restaurant - as others have stated the food is repetative Im a very easy eater and some days struggled to make a decent meal out of what was on offer for evening meal.... food was often luke warm and sometines run out of fresh cooked meats etc. Having said that there were plentiful salads freshly cooked pasta (which was really nice) and freshly cooked pizzas.. which wre lovely but often meant queing with people filling their plates meaning you had to wait for next batch...  One annoying point in the restaurant was that the waiters took ages to clear used plates from your table if i had soup then went for next course the soup bowl was always ther so we often ended up stacking plates on tables...however the waiters were always on the ball with drinks and ther was no problems with providing bottle so wine water beer and soft drinks at the table.  Final point... since returning my wife has been quite poorly with gastroenteritis..... im fine  but she is still unwell and to be frank she puts it down to either undercooked food which is then not kept to adequate temperature or the many hands that touch all the food in the restaurant !  2. Pool bar - drinks were not really good just poor quality draught beer was ok but mixers not too good. And the WASPS i know its hard to control but something needs doing for the bar staffs safety and guests.  The lounge bar was realy nice better quality drinks and the outside cinemas screen for football went down well.  Entertainment team worked hard day and night evening shows so-so would be good to just have a decent singer and leave at that !  In summary must fix the food and daytime drinks then you have a good short stay hotel but because of this would not return.  Last year we stayed at the Riu Tikida Palmarie in Marrakech and in contrast the food and drinks were good but the rooms were jaded....but i would have returned there !,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilR533
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,loubie2018 wrote a review Jun 2018,10,Accident involving the hotel hair dryer!,When we arrived on the Friday morning the staff were very friendly and we were upgraded to one of the rooms that had access to a private pool which we thought was nice! However on the first night I was drying my hair and had the hair dryer in my right hand up just above ear level. Then all of a sudden the hairdryer started sparking and an orange flame I let go of the hair dryer and then saw that my right wrist was black and burning....    We called reception to report and they sent a guy up to the room he picked up the dryer and turned it on and it sparked again! He didn't ask how I was I thought someone would come and see how I was as I had been injured... Another guy then turned up (maintenance) and changed the hair dryer still no-one asked how I was?    I put my wrist under running cold water as it was burning... Then got dressed and went to reception.. The receptionist explained that the first aid room was closed but she would get someone and we were asked to wait we asked to speak to a Manager but were told there was no-one around at this time (7:30pm).    The gentlemen then turned up and took me to the first aid room for treatment he put some burn cream on my burning wrist but there was no bandage to cover up! He did log that he had given treatment.    The next morning we went back to reception to speak to the manager but we were told at 10:30am they were not available! The following morning we checked out at 8am so never actually got to speak to anyone!    I have since emailed the hotel but heard nothing hence my review on here! Nice facilities and in general we had a nice time but lack of any compassion or responsibility when an accident happens! Have attached some photos!    All I wanted to do was to let the Manager know that the accident had happened and what poor customer service I received!,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Greater London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loubie2018

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Filipa wrote a review Jun 2018,50,Summer break,I was a bit concerned with previous reviews about the restaurant/ staff/ outdated rooms.  Well I had a lovely relaxing stay in this hotel!!  We have stayed in the last Riad with a private pool which was really nice (Would be perfect if we didn’t have French guests laughing and speaking loud not respecting the silence notes however can’t faulty the hotel for that).  The downside from the main pool and mainly the pool bar are the amount of wasps there however not sure how could the hotel improve in that matter.  The restaurant had a lot of variety and quality food and would consider in this point one of the best all inclusive that we have been. And the staff had really good English and a special young gentleman hard worker made our visit even more enjoyable.  The hotel provides buses to the city and in 5 min you’re in the famous square.

There is one large restaurant that serves the meals with a terrace that you can sit on too the food is plentiful well cooked and plenty to choose from soft drinks and wine are available and the wine it’s quite good but as the hotel caters for a mainly French clientele I’m not surprised.  Rooms are within the different riads and are large comfortable and air conditioned cleaned every day and ours was spotless.  The spa offers different services we had the hammam which was fab.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,James M wrote a review Jun 2018,30,Good place for a short break - not enough of interest for a longer break,Stayed for a 4 day break last month. The first thing to say is if you even consider coming to Morocco be prepared for a long wait coming through passport control - I will not bother again so please Moroccans have a word with your immigration officials who seem to think they're James Bond- totally awkward behaviour for the sake of . Anyway the hotel is immaculately kept incredibly clean lovely tended gardens and great staff. The bar and restaurant staff are fantastic - special shout out to Moncer (sp) in the restaurant and Youssef at the pool bar. The food in the main restaurant is a great selection -best salad choice and freshest I've had in an all-inclusive- the breakfast includes everything you'd ever want including fantastic fruit choice. The only downside food-wise was the Moroccon speciality restaurant which was quite poor - small portions of quite bland food - avoid - you can get moroccan food in the main restaurant every night anyway.. That said there's not a lot to do here on site - just one bar open at same time (evening bar did great cocktails but often opened late) the only food at main buffet place and one small shop. The rooms were lovely very comfy beds - we came for a couple's leave kids at home short break and it was ideal for that. Bringing kids here older than 5 for a week would result in total boredom I'd say .... good for both ends of age spectrum but not for family holiday ...it's too quiet.... good but needs to expand and also explain to staff that all inclusive means you don't give better treatment to staff who tip ...even though we happily tipped some very great staff ..perhaps others just expected it .... thank you had a great time,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woking, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8256FMjamesm
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hann2403 wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Not quite 5*,Had 3 nights away on a hen do consisting of 14. The hotel was good but sadly there was room for improvement in a few areas. I wouldn't say it was average so have rated very good overall.  The staff in general are OK could be a bit frosty at times though (not sure if it was the fact we were 14 younger women all drinking) Reception staff could do with some extra logistical training as the standard again wasn't what you would expect from a somewhere claiming to be 5 star. Had a few issues with payments and getting our return taxi.  Location was good only 10-15 mins drive from the airport. If you book through the hotel make sure you look around at prices. I got a 40 euro reduction on ours!  Food again was just OK the lunch and breakfast was better than the dinner which was very samey. They did also run out of things very quickly so I would worry what it would be like in peak season.  The snack bar was a favourite for us during the day they did run out of beer and wine one day which was really disappointing! We did notice LOTS of flies/wasps buzzing around but not something they could do a lot about.  Rooms we lovely and spacious we had 7 rooms in the 900's. We were really pleased we could all be together.  We booked a guide to take us to the market which I would recommend.  Overall we all had a great stay and for what we paid it was really good. Sadly I wouldn't stay here again unless some changes were made to bring it up to a 5 star (would happily pay extra for this).

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Taylor F wrote a review Jun 2018,20,Not a 5 star hotel.,I recently visited this hotel and it was one of the worst hotels I'm not sure how they have been awarded 5 stars.  The food selection at the buffet was exactly the same every night. Waiters were rude and unhelpful and did not care about keeping the tables/cutlery clean.  The selection of drinks were extremely poor and there was no option to upgrade like in other all inclusive hotels.  If you can't speak French this can be challenging as this is really the only language spoken there.  I stayed for 5 nights and only saw one night of entertainment. It was meant to be a cabaret show however it was just some of the hotel staff performing some dance routines it looked as though they had learnt an hour before performing.  Reception staff were rude and unhelpful - not even telling us what time meals were as they were only interested in taking payment.  When I expressed that I was unhappy and wanted to speak to a manager I was told to come back later then to come back the next day then again to come back the next day as if they were hoping I would give up.  Also our room was quite far away from the reception and the restaurant and the pathway was quite dimly lit which made us feel uncomfortable and I would't have felt safe walking back to the room on my own.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sandyjanefranklin wrote a review Jun 2018,10,This hotel is a dump. Cockroach in the toilet.,The hotel is closer to a 3 star hotel.  The restaurant food and standard of hygiene is poor.  The tables were never set you had to keep asking for cutlery or glasses and when they did turn up they were not clean - we experienced hair in our food and hair in our glasses. The waiters never offered you wine or water with dinner. We had to keep asking for it - and it was like they were doing you a favour when they did bring it.  The food choice is poor and cold.  The drinks choice throughout the resort was poor. The hotel bar was not an inviting place to sit and have a drink.  There is an influx of wasps at the pool bar - they are everywhere including in some of the drinks machines and how those poor waiters don't get stung is a miracle.  The sun beds by the pool are stained and dirty. The pool towels (which you have to leave a deposit for are thin and threadbare).  We moved our rooms a few times. The first time was because the stench of sewer/drain was so bad. The 2nd time was because our room was full of ants and the door did not lock. The reception staff are apathetic and rude.  There was a cockroach in the toilet of the hotel reception.  I complained the hotel manager - he wasn't very apologetic and just shrugged his shoulders.  Compared to other 4 and 5 star hotels in Marrakech this hotel is inexpensive but reason being is worthy of a 3 star accreditation.  We went on a 3 hour tour with a guide. He showed us the palace square and tombs but was more interested in taking us to shops whereby people tried to sell us things. When we asked for the tour to be but short (we had already paid in advance and didn't want our money back) he got quite aggressive.  I would strongly advise you do not visit this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Buckhurst Hill, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandyjanefranklin
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,michellefair82 wrote a review Jun 2018,40,Great hotel for the Price,Very worried about staying at this hotel after reading some reviews beforehand but we didn't need to worry. With very very limit3d French I did think we would struggle but almost every member of staff went of their way to speak to us in English with the exception of a lady at the pool bar and one very miserable and rude man at the lounge bar of an evening. We did tip at most meal times which meant we were very well looked after ( again most of the time) There were times were the staff were busy and we had to wait a few minutes for things like glasses and cutlery but that probably happened 3 times in 10 nights. MONSEF looked after us for the whole time we were there and he is one of the hardest working people I have ever met. He seemed very over worked yet always did it with a smile on his face. The food can be lovely breakfast was our favourite. Evening do get busy and you can be stood in a queue waiting to just see what is on offer which does take away the restaurant feel and make it seem more like a canteen. Food repetive of an evening but could always find something and some of it was delicious. Again for what we paid this hotel was fantastic. The room was lovely very clean never had a single ant in our room and they were cleaned every day by a lovely lady who always dressed our beds in a different way (which the children loved)  The pool was freezing but once in the pool it was fine. Kids loved the slides but no notification of opening times of slides and timings for lots of things were very hit and miss. If you want food or drink always best to double check each day around the pool bar and snack bar as they seem to open and close whenever they feel like it. We made use of the sports on offer basketball table tennis and football and towels around the pool you can hire for €15 each for the duration of the stay. The safe is chargeable at about 30dh per day. Very close to the centre we had a driver we trusted who picked us up from the hotel and took us on trips or to the shops. All in all this was a great hotel for the Price food was nice drinks were not so good maybe the beer and wine were ok and the facilities and rooms were great.Would recommend for a budget break definitely.,Date of stay: June 2018,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellefair82

Arrived early to a fuss free check in & then we were taken to our room by buggy.  Our room was on a upper level with stoned steps leading up to it . Our bathroom had a shower that wad over a bath i have MS but I'm mobile and sometimes use a walking stick . Do was a little worried how I'd manage for the wk. However the next day I politely explained to reception & realising my situation without hesitation kindly moved us to a ground floor room that wasn't to far away & that also had a wet room bathroom. The bathroom even had extra grab rails & a fold out seat for the shower. FANTASTIC 😃.  The service from all the staff was fantastic & all we met were very pleasant & helpful. .. apart from one a young bar girl with glasses who served in the top pool bar would turn her nack on us eje3n we went to the bar ! She never served us once but would happily serve the French.. hhmm obviously had a problem with the British. This didnt spoil our holiday as everyone else working there were utterly brilliant. But perhaps this young girl should be made aware of her attitude to management as most of us spend a good deal of money to go on our holidays & work hard to do so !  The all inc drinks wete find cocktails available & the Rosè wine VERY drinkable.  The restaurant was one of the nicest I've seen & waiter service for drinks.  One particular waiter who's name im afraid can't remember really went out of his way to help me. Once he saw that is selected my food he would take my plate to my table this really helps when you have muscle weakness in both arms & legs ! He truly went out of his way for me & we was handsomely tipped at the end of our stay.  The gardens are gorgeous & full of roses & well kepted. Pool area lovely and clean and always managed to get a bed without a problem. The pool has steps entering into it with a hand rail whivh was great for me  Food  a huge variety on offer. Plenty of wonderful salads fruits meat & fish selections. They have a different food each theme night . All was good  occasionally could have been hotter.  We met up with friends on this holiday & at night we would drink outside a few small tips went a long way ad the bar staff would see we always had a drink available without having to go to the bar. Sometimes our bar man would bring us nibbles like peanuts or samosas to eat.  So for us we had a fantastic relaxing wk & would certainly return again.  Everyone there from the cleaners to bar staff to Gardner's would say a cheery hello & i certainly felt wrll looked after 😊    *little tip for the ladies*  If you can't live without your hair straighteners there is no available plug near a mirror as they wont work in the bathroom plug  so if you need to use them take a mirror.... or just go frizzy lol,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Penrith, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alibella28

Zahira and rochdi were also very very welcoming and nice. Food was good and there is a wide variety to suit everyone’s needs.  The animations team were excellent as always weather was a little overcast but there was always something to do from 10am until midnight. The evening shows including the “fire show” were fabulous. Magic and his team do an amazing job however Adele made our stay truly fun.  The chap in the animations box greeted us every day with a huge smile and was very helpful as were the bar staff. Nothing is ever too much trouble in this hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Poopyscoop wrote a review May 2018,40,Lovely long weekend break,What a fabulous long weekend break. We usually do a lot of short weekends where we’re sightseeing & walking everywhere. This was very different for us and we loved it.    With the fabulous weather a huge huge pool separate to the children’s pool so you can really swim great food & drinks on tap - it’s a wonderful relaxing experience.    The buffet food options are vast and if you do want done healthy salad at lunch they gave lots of great choices. With good wine & even a cheese board one night - I was really pleasantly surprised how good it was.    We did the Moroccan restaurant one night. It’s no better really than what you get in the main restaurant but it is nice and peaceful.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poopyscoop
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Speaks32 wrote a review May 2018,40,Fabulous Long Weekend Break,This is my third trip to the Kenzi Club Médina. My last trip was back in October. I have just returned from a 5 day break 15th May 2018.    This time I stayed in a privilege double. These rooms are situated at the far end of the hotel complex. Note if you find it difficult walking you are the furthest away from the main hotel facilities.    The rooms themselves are no different from the other hotel rooms but are very quiet and you do get access to the private pool which gets the sun till 4:30pm. There is no music or noise at this pool so create for those who want peace.    There is a pool side service at this pool but is patchy. You can also get limited food but no idea of what as no menu or visible choices. ( we are at the main restaurant)    You are supposed to get complimentary drinks and fruit. Apart from a plate of oranges on day 2 and bottles a bottle of water each day we didn’t see any drinks. So my score is marked down for that.    The grounds are gorgeous and I have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Never rude and speak good English.    Shame to see the wasps back at the pool bar this was a big problem on my first trip last June but when I returned in October was sorted by water mist jets installed at the bar. These have gone and the wasps are back. I am allergic to wasp and bee stings so this caused me stress when getting drinks at the pool bar.    Food is plentiful the breakfast is the best. Large choice. Some of the evening food can be a little tough but large variety of choice. The wine sadly isn’t good. So only had a glass. The mixers at the pool are also incredibly sweet.    Hotel has entertainment each night but finishes quiet early. We went out most nights so not a problem.    I would return to Kenzi. In fact I’m coming back to Marrakech in September whosever the prices at Kenzi are very expensive ( unusually) so this trip will be returning to another visited hotel.    I fell in love with a cat who lived near the privilege rooms going to miss him.    Hopefully one day I will return again.,Date of stay: May 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speaks32

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Trim3 wrote a review Apr 2018,40,5 night break April 2018,Hotel staff here are really friendly. I was slightly worried after reading some reviews but found no problem at all ordering drinks at the bar (some had commented that there might be a problem with women at the bar) but i did not find this. Paid for all inclusive and the double room with private pool - was worth it. Most days the staff came round and asked if we wanted drinks. Loungers really comfortable and there are covered loungers if you want to get out of the heat for a while. Not all drinks available here like the main pool but I liked one of the cocktails served at the main bar one day and they made them for me every day after (like a sangria so easy but nice all the same)  Food was really good for a buffet - there is something for everyone including veggies. Even though we were on all inclusive one evening the waiters were topping up our wine even before the glasses were empty which was good.    Room was nice no complaints - we had a slight issue which I don’t feel is fair to mention however once the hotel were informed they were in our room within 10 minutes and completely resolved the problem.    Cannot really comment on the main pool but the bar area was good and looked like lots of sun loungers - no one really putting out towels to reserve them. We also didn’t see much of the entertainment as weather turned slightly colder in the evenings during our stay but one singer everyone was loving.    Only down side was that the private pool in April was not heated and I personally found it too cold to even get in.    If you go to Marrakech I would recommend getting a good hotel as you cannot drink out and didn’t see many people on holiday eating out. Only took one trip out to the markets - worth seeing but would recommend having a guide (and yes they will take you to all the places they probably get commission) but when we didn’t want to buy we weren’t felt too pressured and people were still friendly.    All in all I was glad we picked this hotel.,Date of stay: April 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trim3
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lisabjork wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Perfect for a budget break in the sun,Great value hotel for a bit of fun in the sun. 10 min from the airport and 10 min from the Medina free shuttle every hour to Medina and back. 1 minute drive from Kenzi Palace.    Huge hotel but all low rise so you don't feel its size. One large heated pool and one huge non heated pool with a couple of waterslides. Plenty of loungers with mattresses so very comfortable. Service really good and fast reliable WIFI for free. Got upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was very nice double balcony walk in shower and seperate bath two toilets. TV in both rooms although mainly in French. Beds incredibly comfortable.    Spa is super cheap nice indoor pool with waterjets 30 min massage cost only £20. Not the best standard but for the price you don't mind.    Entertainment during the day and every night catered to children and families. All inclusive is recommended due to nothing else in the area although the food was the only part that let the hotel down. Very repetitive and not always fresh (you'd see breakfast bits by the pool bar later that day etc). Mainly fish and carb dishes hard to get meat or chicken. Always plenty of fresh fruit veg and bread though. Drinks all bottled and strong - no premium brands or liqures.    Safe hire was cheap and you pay a deposit to get daily towels by the pool but get this refunded at the end of your stay.    For those that want just All inclusive on a budget in the sun this is perfect. Solid 4* hotel.    Credit must be given to the staff especially the gentleman working in the lobby (I didn't get his name) that works on the suite/safe/towel hire side. He really went above and beyond and we thoroughly enjoyed our short but sweet stay.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Rebekah D wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Magical Marrakech,We stayed here as 3 adults plus 3 children for 7 nights in late March.  10 mins from airport easy transfer in SUV shuttle.  Hotel is lovely reception is bright clean and welcoming Bags taken on arrival by the concierge team dressed in traditional Moroccan outfits.  Check in easy and pleasant our rooms weren’t ready but we were given our AI bands and full use of facilities (we headed for the snack bar and pool )  Pools are beautiful and clean. The main pool is a little on the Baltic side but can see that being a welcomed cool off opportunity in the 40degree heat come August!  Smaller pool by the bar is heated and is where the Aqua Aerobics takes place.  You can participate in everything from Archery to Zumba!  Entertainment team are brilliant. Magic is the captain of the Animation ship but the whole team are enthusiastic welcoming and encouraging. Marmaduke Halima Mario Hari and Younus stood out with a surprise addition from a new team member ‘Poochi’ later in the week. A talented professional juggler who was quick to use his talents to entertain for an impromptu show poolside!!  The shows at night in the Gnawa Bar are largely dance based but are of a good standard and the lead male dancer is hugely talented as a dancer and performer ( Mookie? he looks like Hank Azaria!) The Caberet show was bemusing and hilarious in equal measures but a lot of fun!  Food is fabulous they cater for everyone regardless of any reviews to the contrary. Theme nights are great and staff get dressed up in costumes relevant to the nights theme to welcome you. Waiters take drinks orders and are friendly and always cleaning to ensure free tables.  The choice is staggering yes they have recurrent options every evening but it’s freshly cooked.  Sometimes the heat plates aren’t as hot as could be but you can have fresh cooked in front of you.  Salads are amazing and the desserts are of the highest standard of a hotel I’ve been. They are French patisserie style and are beautifully presented.  The hotel is predominantly French but staff speak very good English they appreciate any use of French anhelps with pleasantries and atmosphere to simply greet the grounds staff and housekeeping with a French greeting as they do their work.  Hotel is immaculately kept grounds are beautiful. The farm is a nice touch which is well kept and the children loved going to see the little white pony each morning.  We used the free shuttle to the souks with no problem at all we were met with a guide called Najib who would thoroughly recommend he was like a mystical being that everyone knew and respected in the medina and souks. He gave us history tips and genuinely warm friendly man who made our morning out shopping a fabulous one.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jonathan C wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Great all-inclusive hotel, nice pools, decent buffet, lovely staff on the whole but watered down drinks","I stayed at Kenzi Club for 4 nights with a friend.    The hotel itself was a blissful oasis away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakesh with the centre of town around 10 minutes away by cab.    We were made to feel welcome straight away upon arrival by the lovely reception staff who offered us tea and gave advice on the best way to explore the city. They were a friendly source of information throughout the trip.    The hotel is more of a complex with several buildings across the premises than one large building. This actually meant that our room was located quite far (3-4 minute walk) away from the entrance to the hotel which was one of the few negatives.    The buffet was decent with a variety of food- pizza tagine seafood salad. The waiters were friendly and attentive with water and wine. The deserts were by far the stand-out dishes here with cakes being at the level of a high quality french patisserie.    The grounds were nice with plenty of areas to relax and sunbathe in privacy and there is an indoor pool spa and gym although these all cost extra. There are also 2 outdoor pools one which has slides and another for adults. The pool with slides unfortunately wasn't heated but the other was.  There is great entertainment put on in the evenings in the main bar with music and dance lessons that are mainly put on for families.    The main negative aspect of the hotel was how watered down the drinks were in the main bar in the evening. One of the barmen (bald) appeared to be the main culprit for this and put close to zero alcohol in rum and cokes that my friend had just ordered. When I asked him if he could add a little more I was informed that ""they're massive already!"" when I said that they were not he begrudgingly poured more rum in before aggressively barking ""happy now!?"" to which I replied that I was. Just as I was leaving with my drinks he again poured more rum in I can only imagine out of aggression or spite so that it was almost overflowing and there was now more rum than coke ruining the drink. I would question why the hotel management would employ someone so aggressive and lacking in hospitality skills. I was made to feel very unwelcome and did not return to the bar again after this incident.    Overall a nice hotel but I would deduct half a star for the distance of my room from reception and a full star for the watered down drinks and rude barman which blighted my experience.",Date of stay: March 2018,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathancM8624FG

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,B888S wrote a review Feb 2018,30,Very average hotel,Booked a last minute 3 night trip to this hotel for my husband and I and our youngest son who is 12. We thought we were visiting a 5 star hotel and it really does not class as 5 star. The staff were OK but just did not anticipate things. In the restaurant we had to ask for glasses salt and pepper every single visit. Waiters did not come to you without you indicating. So you had to request every little thing. If they gave you a wine glass you didn't get a water glass etc. The food was not good and nothing was served hot. Except for the tagine which was excellent  The beds were very hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom had a trickle for a shower and no plug for the bath - not very 5 star! The rooms were very gloomy with inadequate lighting.  Pool area was beautifully kept with very comfortable sun beds. Great slides for my son. These went into an unheated pool but he was unfazed by this. There was a heated pool also available.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Rachel C wrote a review Feb 2018,40,Great hotel with fantastic staff,We stayed at the Kenzi Agdal Medina hotel in the first week of February. Not sure what to expect from the reviews we were pleasantly surprised on arrival.    The hotel is the Agdal district (the tourist area where most of the large modern hotels are located) but it is a short (10 minute) drive to the Medina on the hotel's free shuttle bus. Book your place on the shuttle the evening before - they get busy and you may not get on without a ticket. The buses run every hour to and from the Koutoubia Mosque (right in the centre next to the Place Jemaa al Fna).    On arrival you are greeted by the gorgeous aroma of orange blossoms (for me the smell of Morocco) in the reception and given a glass of thé de menthe (Moroccan mint tea). Hotel reception staff speak very good English and French. To activate the safe in the room we had to pay 30 dirhams (£2.50) per day - a small price to pay for peace of mind.    Our room was large with a chaise longue and armchair as well as a superkingsize bed. We had a couple of issues during the week with our heating not working but once reported to reception it was fixed within 30 minutes.    The hotel restaurant was nice - fairly basic and repetitive but tasty enough! The restaurant staff though were fantastic! In particular Adil and Moncef who looked after us all week and were very friendly.    I can't comment on the entertainment or bar as we rarely ventured in there - we were too tired from our days out exploring the Medina or the surrounding countryside. A day trip to Essaouria and into the Atlas Mountains are must dos!    On one rainy day we used the spa facilities - 250 dirham each (just over £20) for a hammam including black soap scrub and body wrap. We also paid 100 dirham each to use the indoor heated pool for the day.    All in all a fantastic week with such friendly staff - we would definitely return! I have stayed in the centre of Marrakech before (in a Riad) and so realised that this may be too 'full on' for a whole week's stay. The Kenzi Club Agdal Medina gives you the best of both worlds as you can get into the madness of Marrakech easily and then retreat to the peace and quiet of the hotel.,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/907rachelc

From the moment we walked into the hotel  the head porter welcomed us as old friends .The reception staff either remembered us  or the computer did  as to our delight  they upgraded us to a suite !  A lot of the staff are the same as last year  Spider & his team of animators are still the best we know & they work hard at keeping everyone happy  as well as entertaining us with their superb shows which are good enough to be on Broadway .  Jean Claude the amazing singer should be working in Las Vegas with his wonderful voice .  Cooking lessons are still hilarious with "" Ratatouille "" who has such a great sense of humour that he has everyone in stitches .  Chef Ali is still in charge of the kitchen & ensures that everything is perfect for the guests . The soups are all great  but I especially enjoyed the fish  the lentil and the courgette which was so tasty . My husband loved the freshly grilled fish every day & the steaks were heavenly  as were all the vegetable accompaniments ( carrots  spinach  courgettes  cauliflower & many others ). We started our meals with artichokes every day & couldn't resist finishing with the selection of desserts on display to tempt us .  The breakfasts now offer an even larger selection of detox  veg & fruit juices . My favourites were the carrot / orange & the beetroot .  Every evening different themed with fisherman's supper  Italian  Spanish  Asiatic & of course Moroccan . The headwaiter Hashasha & his team of first class waiting staff also made our holiday a memorable one . Everyone doing their utmost to make the guests feel special & spoiled  remembering which wine & water you preferred & trying to seat you at a good table when they could .This was not always possible however as the school holidays made the restaurant quickly filled with the locals & their children on holiday for the last couple of weeks . I will try and avoid school holiday dates in future when I return as it was busy & noisy .  The Barmen too make this hotel exceptional . I don't think I have ever been served so nicely in any other place . They quickly get to know your favourite drinks & have them ready by the time you get to the bar  or if they are busy  they will tell you to take a seat & serve you at your table  along with the olives  peanuts & tasty titbits . We were bowled over by the professionalism of the bar staff in both bars  I cannot praise the entire staff throughout the hotel enough .The hotel's slogan is "" Even happiness is included in our all inclusive holidays ""  which is very apt .We are already looking forward to our next holiday with this amazing team & will advise friends & family to try it too .",Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Languedoc-Roussillon, France",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sugarandspice2
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,agatabb wrote a review Feb 2018,30,A few things that the hotel should consider improving,We enjoyed the stay and I will write about the pros in a second but first of all a few things that are still fresh in my mind for the hotel to consider improving:    - Safe - if you want to use the safe you need to pay 3EUR / day for that privilege.... It's the first hotel I've been to where you have to pay to use something like a safe!    - Gym and Indoor pool - you will need to pay extra to use these. One of the reasons why we booked this hotel was exactly the gym and the indoor pool (travelled 1-4 Feb so expected the weather not to be great). We were so disappointed to hear that we need to pay for both especially since it wasn't clear on the website that this was extra.    Pool Bar - plastic spoons coupled with a deco that requires a bit of renovation was enough to make us think that a bit of work is required and fast    Bar - not enough heaters outside. It was about +2C so those who couldn't sit around one were forced to go inside    Bathroom - a bit on a cold side but nothing to really complain about as the rooms were really warm and heating quickly    Quality of wine - we couldn't bring ourselves to drink it... better avoided    Other than the above we did enjoy the stay...    The buffet food was varied and really enjoyable the water in the outdoor heated pool was kept at a good temperature the shuttle to the Medina worked really well.... The entertainment staff eat with the guests which surprised us a bit but they were very courteous so more of an unexpected occurrence rather than anything else    Good to know (we wish someone had told us):  - you will need to pay local tax at check out  - the airport is a proper nightmare - even if you're travelling only with carry on luggage you will have to queue up to check in so that they give you a boarding card (mobile boarding card won't be accepted) - they don't have a printer so actually have to write it by hand and stamp it :) all of this takes a long time so don't think you will be able to just show up at the last moment... this hotel was only 10 min from the airport so we thought getting there about 1.5h prior to the departure time would have been fine but we were up for a surprise. luckily the agency we travelled with challenged us and said we needed plenty of time regardless.    hope this helps and enjoy,Date of stay: February 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agatabb
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Natalie D wrote a review Feb 2018,40,"Nice hotel, a little on the chilly side, great animation team",Just returned from 4 night trip here with my mum (end of Jan 2018)    Hotel: beautiful layout lots of gardens quite spacious (clearly built for large numbers in the high season). Gold buggy from reception to Rhiad style blocks of rooms split with gardens/walkways. Not too much walking in my opinion as other reviews have mentioned but guess it depends which block you're put in. Petting zoo/animals at back of resort - bit strange a lot of goats/sheep/chickens cooped up. Large area for sports (basketball/table tennis/play area) behind pool bar. 20 mins from airport and 10 min free shuttle bus to the city of Marrakech.    Rooms: clean well presented. Our view was over a building site but didn't use balcony much. Beds comfy. Would have benefit from tea/coffee/bottles of water in room. Fridge a bit smelly! Only 1 channel in English which is the news.    Food: beautiful restaurant lots of choice. Main downside was that all the plates were cold as was the restaurant (nearly everyone ate in their coats/scarves) which meant the food was always luke warm by the time you got back to the table - shame as it tasted delicious. Service up and down some days you'd ask for coffee/cutlery and they would run off to get it never to return other times they were so helpful and top up your wine glass as soon as getting low.    Pool: two main outdoor pools (one with slides not heated) and a lovely large heated one by the pool bar - one of the best pools I've been in. Nice and warm for winter season empty large and very clean. Lifeguard and security always present. Good service at pool bar. The BEST sun loungers I've ever been on!! You can hire towels for ~£12 which you get back on return. Also small childrens pool.    Animation: best animation team I've seen in an all inclusive holiday....a lot of effort had clearly gone into shows which start at 9:30pm. Very funny. (again they don't seem to heat the bar/dance area so on the cold side). During the day they put on lots of games/events even a cooking class which appeared popular by the pool bar. However a lot of things were based on French audience less focus on English.    Spa: we used the indoor pool on colder day but is extra ~£8 each to use each day (doesn't include steam/sauna etc). Gym is additional ~£6.50 a day looks very smart but some machines were broken. Only used once. Had a massage which was nice but quite similar to English prices (~£27 for 30mins). They offer lots of other treatments.    Other: free shuttle to the souks well worth a trip we were very lucky and stumbled across a guy named Omar who said he was official with hotel ...(?hmm) and gave us a brilliant tour of the souks (would've got lost without him) it helped as we didn't get bothered by everyone trying to sell things. He was free of charge - but we tipped him as he was fab and spoke very good English (maybe ask the bus driver to see if he can meet you at the bus stop if interested - not sure if we just got lucky?!)  We also didn't realise until there that we had gone in the Morrocon school holidays - a lot of Morrocon families were therefore in the hotel. Appeared very good for children.    Overall nice hotel be nice if heated plates/restaurant/public areas in winter (take a jacket if going similar time - very cold at night!). Rooms could be better with tea/coffee facilities. Lovely outdoor heated pool.

Very low quality the pork was still bleeding tonight! Hot food is cold served on cold plates. Standard overall is very low.  There are no bars except the main entertainment room which is a zoo! No place for a quiet drink away from the noise except your room!  Room is nice and warm frequented by ants in the bathroom! Bathroom very cold!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,cma_6 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Loved my stay here,I stayed at the Kenzi hotel for four nights with my husband. We took a taxi there from the airport for 110 dhs (£9 approx) after some haggling which took around 15 mins. The lobby was large airy and smelt lovely. We were welcomed with and a towel. The check in process was smooth and we were then taken in a buggy and shown the different parts of the hotel.    The room    The room was clean and well kept. There was a lovely view of the pool area and the mountains in the backgrounds. The only improvements I can suggest is they have the option of a kettle and English channels on the TV. The only English channels were the news channels.    The food    For an all-inclusive hotel there was a great choice of food every day from spaghetti pizzas salads juices and main dishes. There was also traditional Moroccan food. I am a vegetarian and when it was Moroccan night I did struggle for choice. A couple of other vegetarian guests said the same as there wasn’t the usual pizza and spaghetti options. Having said that there was enough to get by. The veg soup was especially nice. The snacks available between lunch and dinner at the pool side were also nice.    The entertainment    The highlight of my stay was the entertainment every other night. The team work really hard to put on great performances espcially the choregraphy director who was a great dancer.    Misc    There was a shuttle bus nearly every hour which you book in advance that drops you off at the beautiful Koutoubia mosque. This saved a lot of taxi fees. It leaves dead on time so make sure you arrive slightly early. If you have time to spare whilst waiting for the bus check out the nearby Mamounia hotel on the main road. The gardens and reception are stunning.    There is a farm at the back of the hotel which farms some lovely animals. The baby goats were especially cute and running free which was nice. It’s a shame there other animals didn’t have a large grass area.    Overall I really enjoy my stay here and will definitely return.,Date of stay: January 2018,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Leicester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cma_6

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sheikhoo B wrote a review Jan 2018,30,Nice resort but can be improved,I stayed at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina in November 2017. The hotel is nicely located and not very far from airport. The hotel is a huge resort with different restaurants serving 24x7 service.    Check in was not fast and they took time to provide me the room key. The room was not ready even when I reached at 4:00 PM in evening. I waited for 20 minutes and then I got the room. Room was nice and clean with balcony with a view of olive trees.    Bathroom was clean but hot water taps were not functioning properly. I reported at reception two times and they told me that the issues will be solved. But even at time of check out the problems didn't resolve. They should pay attention to the demands of guests and should resolve this. Even to take water bottle I have to go to restaurant as they don't serve water in rooms.    Breakfast area was huge with variety of options. I didn't face any issue there. The food was good and tasty though vegetarian options were limited. But I would rate food at 5 star over all. Wines were also of nice quality and I was satisfied.    The hotel has many entertainment programs running throughout the day to keep guests busy. I was impressed with the fire show in lounge area.    Spa was good and they provide excellent service.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheikhoob

There is a bus which takes you to the old city which is very handy free of charge of course.    WiFi is weak but u get that in a lot of hotels in Marrakech. Rooms are big and spacious but would need a lil updating. As we had an all inclusive deal food and drink was free at the hotel the buffet had a lot of variety and couldn’t fault it however the drinks very watered down but guess you would be getting that a lot with all inclusive packages.    As I went in December the weather wasn’t the best but the hotel did have 2 pools one of which was heated which was perfect. The other wasn’t and was closed with it being this time of the year.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,skerly1 wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Great Family Fun in the Christmas sun,Just arrived back after 2 weeks at the Kenzi having spent Christmas and new years with them.    4 stars for the whole holiday we thoroughly enjoyed it although come the last few days thought the choices of food on offer caused a few raised eye brows.    First and foremost its a french hotel 90% of the guest are french or are speaking french for us that wasnt too much of an issue we stumbled by and tried to pick up a few more phrases along the way but if you were less adventurous with your guest interactions then it maybe a pain. all the staff spoke english if you spoke to them in your mothers tongue of course all the kids just got along via play.    Kids club / mini club mini disco was great and id like to call out their team Asma / Adel and Jiji for their running of the club and making our little english rose welcome.. she loved it loved the activities and by the end of the two weeks wanted to spend more time playing with them than she did with us. Thanks mini Club!.. the hotel as said before is well kept there are a few pools the main one by the bar is heated as is the l small kids pool at the back left of the hotel there is also a small farm with a horse peacocks goats lambs ducks and various other animals the kids loved to go and say hello and whilst we were there two baby goats were born.    evening entertainments were good as before the ents team really do trying to bring the party.. if thats your thing mind. i am sure some people may want a little more peace and quite. hence the private pools and private bars etc.    christmas eve was all out family fun big games set up in the entrance square bouncy castles father Christmas on a camal.. the kids loved it as did the adults.. great was to spent christmas.. although for us brits we were left bemused by the lack of anything going on chrisrmas day. (its a european thing so we understand).    Sara who handled the oliver RAID housekeeping was another gem having two kids we threw all sorts of additional requests for more towels water tissues odd room keeping times and she was always so helpfull.    weather was early 20's for the christmas weeka little breezy which made getting out of the pool a little quicker but over new years its been 26 and really lovely. sun goes down around 6pm but its pretty cool from 4pm owards.. the locals are running around in jackets all day and the tourists in their swim stuff..    all in all we enjoyed the stay the hotels staff were great the hotel was immaculately kept bother grounds/gardens/room. food was good the first week we enjoyed every dinner the second week it faded on us a little.. but was all included so you cant complain even the waiters in their were awesome.. a few days we had breakfast bought to our rooms.. nothing was too much trouble    on the bad - and it maybe just our experience - the golf pro. mousse was a bit rubbish we tried twice to get a round booked through him and 4 days in the trot he said he couldn't get through or had lost his phone.. we called directly and git straight through.. poor show mousse .,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"West Byfleet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skerly1

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,dann n wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Very good,We went to this hotel from December 5th to December 9th. Paid around £15 quid for a taxi although you can haggle for a better price.    We arrived early and they said the room would be ready within 30 minutes. So we had a look round. To our disappointment the main pool with slides was closed as they was doin some maintenance. Just unfortunate for us and bad timing. I don't understand people who would rate the hotel 1 or 2 stars because somethings closed due to maintenance how to the thin these things get done?    Anyway the hotel and grounds are beautiful and immaculately kept. Clean tidy and the staff are very helpful and friendly.    The drinks were good a lot on offer including a few cocktails. Whiskey brands gin and malibu are on offer and included. The food is average but thats my opinion as i dont think ive ever been blown away by the food at any all inclusive. The orange juice i have to say is the freshest and nicest i have ever tasted.    The room was huge we had a big double bed abd a spare single. Everyday our room was cleaned and even left the sheets and towels decorated.    The weather was averages of 24/25 in the say but chilly at night around 8 or 9 degrees which is a nice change making sleeping at night more comfortable. Id just advise to bring a coat or jacket for evenings.    The entertainment was brilliant dance shows quizzes ect.    They also do a free shuttle to marrakech town (the market)  Tip. When you get off the shuttle there will be people stood there not from the hotel offering to show you round and they will expect money off you after just be firm and tell them no thanks.    Also if you ask for directions in the market from some locals they will show you for free then pass you onto some who owns a store or show you some other things and then expect money. Dont get pressured into following them as they can be pushy. Apart from that the market was incredible to see snake charmers monkeys. The people who own these animals will alsp expect a tip for letting you take a photo with them.  You have to book the shuttle at reception and we booked two seperate times to catch it back because we didnt know how long we would be.    I would definitely advise this place for a short stay everything was so relaxing and i couldnt find any real negatives.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/791dannn
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,8aroundtheglobe wrote a review Dec 2017,40,Nice all inclusive Resort,Can't really fault anything except maybe the food not always being warm.  After being welcomed with a nice cup of tea and checked in by a very friendly receptionist you are brought to your room in a golf cart as the Resort is pretty big. Rooms are spacious and clean with nice garden views and a balcony or terras. There is something to do for everyone during the day and evening. You can either relax in the Hammam or be more active in the swimming pool area. Of course you can go into Marrakesh as often as you like with the free shuttle bus (I would also recommend to take a day trip to the mountains!). In the evening there is a lot of entertainment for both kids and adults. The restaurant is big but the staff is practically flying around to accomodate everyone always with a smile. Food is divers tasty and plentifull but as mentioned not always warm. The wine is actually pretty good too for all inclusive standards!

Uppon arrival at the hotel it is visibly very clean glass doors in reception look out onto a beautifully kept plot of grass and flowers. A gentleman welcomes you with mint and lemon water for refreshments.    Check in wasn't until late afternoon which wasn't handy for myself and my partner as we had a very early flight. After a couple of hours waiting in the aircon filled reception we was upgraded and allocated to our room by kart.    Luckily we had a private pool with a private bar which was a lot more peaceful and cleaner than the main pool by reception.    The room was freshly cleaned. It had a modern style with a hint of moroccan architecture aswell as our own private patio out the back equipt with a small table and chairs. The room was cleaned and fresh towels were provided every day.    The restuarant was unfortunately quite a walk from our room. At lunch time the hotel turns into butlins children running everywhere music blaring definately for the young hearted. Wasn't my cup of tea at all. There was a wide selection of food every day ranging from chinese italian morrocan and american myself and my parter both fell ill due to the food which put a damper on the holiday mid way through.    The evening entertainment was good unfortunately i didn't understand a lot of it because they all spoke french and ofcorse i dont.    A wide range of Excursions are bookable at the oppoaite side of main reception. We only done the camel rides as the weather was 45° and i wanted to do nothing more than lay in the pool ALL day!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SarahRose wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Fantastic stay,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week in the middle of November and absolutely loved our time here. The weather was nice not too hot but warm and pleasant. As we went out of season the resort was quiet and we didn’t have to worry about finding a sun bed at all and meal times weren’t too busy.    The staff were really friendly and helpful. Upon arrival everything was explained to us about the meal times and the free shuttle into town and we were driven to a room on a gulf buggy and our bags taken inside for us.    We were surprised at the amount of entertainment and activities put on at the hotel. Quite a wide range. We took part in a few of them and really enjoyed them. The language barrier doesn’t get in the way too much as my boyfriend who speaks no French at all was able to understand and take part as all the animation staff speak English.    A special mention to the animation staff who work from morning until late at night with a smile on their faces. They’re very welcoming and friendly and make an effort to chat to you whilst your chilling by the pool or having a drink in the bar to make sure you’re having a good time and to encourage you into the vast range of activities. Special thanks to Yousaff who noticed we were newbies on our first day and gave us a warm welcome.    The food is nice with a wide range of cuisine. The themed nights is a nice touch so the food doesn’t get too samey. The wine at dinner is very nice we recommend it. Oh and make sure you have the mint tea too!    The alcohol does taste watered down as it does in most of these kind of places but it’s not terrible. Just stick with the wine if you’re that fussy.    Our room was really nice and the maids decorated the bed differently every day; once we had rose petals another time they created a heart shape from the bed covers. We were given bottled water most days and once received a bottle of wine. Sometimes though they forgot to give us water but we took this from the restaurant when we didn't have any in our room.    The smaller pool is heated so we stayed around there. The larger pool isn’t and is quite chilly but this wouldn’t be an issue in the summer heat.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Emma R wrote a review Dec 2017,30,"Good, but definitely not 5*",We wanted a relaxing week out of London and it was definitely chill. Good things: our brilliant super-smiley waiter at breakfast and lunch who always found us a table and remembered coffee order etcthe dinner at the Moroccan a la carte (SO MUCH FOOD not to mention the excellent Royal Couscous plus great service and a lovely musician) the peaceful Privilege riad (and amazing service for drinks and food there too). Beautiful gardens. Good sized rooms large bed house wine okay. Not so good: room not serviced until 5/6pm of a night one day ran out of loo roll hit and miss as to whether mini bar would be topped up or not! Food average variety of food very average and when it was Prophet’s Day... feeding frenzy comes to mind. A ten-minute wait for an egg... And kids running around everywhere! The ‘cocktails’ at the pool bar didn’t have any alcohol in them. No matter what you see poured there ain’t no alcohol in there! Shuttle bus to Medina good but be aware of the touts that accost you as soon as you step off the bus they are not from the hotel despite what they suggest (and it is a little annoying that the hotel themselves don’t do anything to warn you of this fact). If you can brush up on your French before you go it is not a necessity but we found it helpful. The spa - well the spa was more of a hustle than a spa! We booked relatively expensive massages (£50/50mins essential oils massage) and still had to pay another £10 on top to use the cold swimming pool with a few jets. It was not that comfy in there or the threadbare robes and man-size crocs (I am a size-4-wearing woman and had to take them off to avoid slipping down the marble stairs) and the customer service on the reception desk left a lot to be desired. Therapists were excellent however. All in all we got what we paid for in this holiday deal great for a cheap last-minute break but don’t expect actual 5* treatment.,Date of stay: December 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmagE6216ZB
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,rappers100 wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Winter Sunshine at Kenzi Club Hotel,"I have just returned from Marrakech having stayed a week at the Kenzi Club Hotel Agdal Medina in the last full week of Nov 2017.    The hotel is located about 15mins from the airport in Marrakech.    The weather was still good no rain all week 25C during the day getting cooler around 6pm and you definitely need a jumper or coat after 8pm this time of the year. Most of the locals are wrapped up warm at this time.    You won't have many worries with this hotel. It is quite a large complex we stayed in the Roseaire Riad which had its own pool and snack bar but found the water too cold  for us so we used the pool next to the snack bar which was heated.    There is also an indoor pool within the spa which is heated but you need to pay extra for this. 100DH's onto your bill.    The room was large enough with a balcony although the view wasn't exactly breathtaking. We could see the planes landing at the airport in the distance but don't worry there is no noise issue with planes taking off.    The staff were friendly and would greet you in the morning and were very helpful if you needed something.    The food in the restaurant was nice well presented and cooked but get there early as it got cold quick. Only the tajine delicacies are kept heated whilst on display. But you did seem to get a lot of the same for lunch and dinner. They also had themed days. i.e Italian night Moroccan night etc..    Tip: The coffee in the mornings was usually barely warm. You need to specifically request a hot one or you will just get a jug off an empty table!  The best coffee is available from the pool snack bar.    Outside of meal times you can get drinks and snacks at the pool snack bar but food is limited to omelettes crepes ice cream small pastries.    The hotel has a majority of French guests so French is the main language spoken but this was not a problem as most of the staff spoke enough English to understand what you wanted and menus and notices are in both French and English.    The main bar doesn't open until 6pm (whilst we were there anyway) but the cocktail drinks tasted awful. Other drinks are OK if you can do without alcohol.    At this time of year the entertainment is in the bar rather than on the outside stage. The entertainment team work really hard during the day and night to keep you amused. They put on a show each night although the routines were a bit samey on some days.    Not much to do otherwise at night. Only 2 English speaking TV channels one was sky news. We went 10-pin bowling at the Opera Plaza Hotel 40DH's per person per frame. It opens late so worth a visit. There is also a go-karting track opposite the front of the hotel. It looks closed down but it isn't. Costs 250DH's for a 10min session. Cheaper if you book more sessions at the time. Opens from midday until 8pm at this time of year.  Definitely worth a visit if you are into motor sport.    The Souks are best done at night for the visual effect. Lots of haggling and bargaining over prices. Never take the first price seriously and offer less than half to allow wriggle room for yourself. You'll be amazed how the price drops when you start to walk away!  To get there just take the free shuttle bus outside the hotel which drops you off behind the Koutoubia mosque just a short walk away from the square and souks.    Yes people will hassle you and some will even follow you around as your ""guide"" leading you to certain stalls in the hope of some financial reward. Always be nice and just be firm with the no thank you's if you don't want to buy.    There are many restaurants around and worth doing to avoid the eventual monotomy of the all inclusive food at Kenzi. Menara Mall is worth checking out. It has a number of well known restaurant chains in the front and a plush but small shopping mall on 3 levels inside. I believe it shuts at 6:30pm at this time of year and 11pm in summer.    We used the excursions available from the hotel. Pricey but way more convenient. The agent is in the lobby from about 09:00 and there is also an ATM in the lobby to get the cash to pay for your excursion as he only does cash!    Camel rides Quad biking Guided City Tours Atlas Mountain Tour a visit to the Waterfalls and more are all on offer here.    Overall Kenzi Club Agdal was a very good choice even in November. We enjoyed our stay there and would return although it would preferably be in the summer.",Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,Barton,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rappers100

Also Fatima Zahra who looked after our room (434) was always friendly and the room was immaculately cleaned each day (I particularly liked the rose petal touch). As others have mentioned most of the guests at the hotel are French and therefore the entertainment was generally in French but the animation team translated the main points and the rest was good practice for us!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Cathmac wrote a review Nov 2017,30,Average at best,I booked this trip based on the reviews on this site. This is my 3rd visit to Marrakesh. I have stayed in the medina the previous times but I was keen to go to a resort and relax thus time. We payed extra to have a privelege room. The amenities for this were good with a private pool for this riad with poolside service. The rooms were disappointing. The runner at the end of the bed was frayed the bed was so hard it was like sleeping on a rock and I awoke with my back aching every morning. The bathroom was dated with big chips scratches etc. We were left one night with no toilet paper (there were 2 rolls in the morning). Bizarrely there is an extra charge to use the inroom safe.    The overall setting of the resort is lovely. The main pool area is perfect and the heated pool was great for swimming in November. The service at the pool bar was very friendly and they served a decent cup of coffee.    The food and drink was very hit and miss. 3 glasses of wine were off. A horrible dark yellow colour with bits that tasted of vinegar. The cocktails in the bar were tasteless. The food at the buffet was average. I had to find the head chef one night as I was served a chicken skewer with raw meat inside. The coffee for breakfast is very weak and you are better off heading to the pool bar. All the staff were attentive and friendly though.  The shuttle to the medina was great (and was perfect to escape for some decent food) Be aware you need to prebook. The spa offered a hammam at similar prices to what you can find in the medina but the staff were friendlier here. We came out glowing. Overall this is more like 3.5 star accommodation and not what was sold via the online travel provider.,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cathmac07

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,TheOxfordMassageCent wrote a review Nov 2017,50,Highly recommended,My husband and I have choosen this hotel to celebrate our 5 years anniversary and because we saw lots of very good reviews. We stayed 7 nights all inclusive.    When we arrived someone took our luggages and while we were waiting to check in they served us with a cold drink & fresh mint.    Afterwards we were taken to our room.  The room was very clean and nice decorated.  The food was amazingly good and lots of different dishes that you could choose from. Breakfast snack bar by the swimming pool  lunch  again snack bar before dinner time  dinner every day from 6 am to 11 pm.  Every waiter /waitress wearing a white clean & iron shirt very polite and responsive to our needs.    One advice is that you Always should drink water from bottle and they are available to pick up from the restaurant or the bar area.  Second advice have with you some cash (dirhams) to give as tip. You will be looked after 10 times better than if you do not give anything.  The tip is an important must to do or to give. Due to the low wages a tip makes a difference in their lives.    2 big swimming pools and plenty of sun beds (single or double bed).    Activities every day such as Aqua bike darts belly dancing etc.    All entertainment Jet Tours TEAM were amazing!    A Big Thank you to Faycal and Yoyo to make us feel welcomed and looking after us.  Each evening we were delighted to see and take part of different entertainments  karaoke dancing...    Plenty of activities for kids during day and evening time as well.

No shower caps so ladies bring your own. Shower doors weren't great and resulted in lots of water on the bathroom floor.  Lots of food options and food was available at different parts of the hotel throughput the day.  Staff were superb and the entertainment team jet tours were excellent.

I visited during November the weather was lovely and warm the hotel not too busy. The food was delicious with plenty of choice and good value for money.

The highlight of the holiday was however the friendly and attentive staff who work hard are great fun and went above and beyond to make the stay an absolute pleasure!

Good entertainment for adults and children food and drink for all inclusives but shame bar closed at 11.30 prompt. Quite a ride from the medina but a must for any tourist to visit.  Everyone is very friendly but be careful they always ask for more money even after giving you a price or bill in a shop or restaurant.

It’s massive!    The pools are lovely and one is actually heated to 28 degrees so i was able to actually get in - it was October and although the weather was perfect the other pool rarely got to a temp where I could do more than dip my toe in.    The evening shows were great - something I thought I would hate. The animation team work very hard throughout the day - I had so much fun playing French bowls with Samsung - again something I never saw myself doing. In the evening they make sure everyone gets involved - yes I danced and enjoyed myself I have Samsung to thank for this too.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jenny H wrote a review Nov 2017,50,For all inclusive - this outlived our expectations!,We were not sure what to expect with 'all inclusive' but we were pleasantly surprised! Having stayed at the sister hotel to this (Kenzi Menara Palace) which is definitely more luxurious it would have been easy to compare it unfavourably. However the pool was never noisy and we could always get 4 sunbeds together in a sunny position. There is a buffet for all meals with some things made to order (i.e. omelettes at breakfast). There was plenty of choice and something for everyone. For my personal taste I wold have liked to food to be a hotter so I just avoided the dishes which had been 'sitting'!. We drank the rose wine and it was perfectly fine. We would the staff in the restaurant to be very friendly and accommodating and they quickly learned that every meal we had rose and it was at the table along with still and sparkling water before you could blink! We were a party of 4 - and had 2 rooms - 619 and 621. They were in a nice quiet setting with twin beds in each. The bathrooms were a little tired but perfectly functional. We staying at the beginning of November and the weather was still lovely and hot from 10.30 to 4. The clientele is mainly French with English and German. My tips would be to avoid the poolside bar which could get noisy stay on your sunbed and get to all meals early for best choice!,Date of stay: November 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyH366

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,rgoold wrote a review Oct 2017,30,It’s ok...,I am not sure whether my expectations are unrealistically high but my experience wasn’t in line with some of the other reviews and overall rating for this hotel. Our two boys (11 and 9) did have a great time though and this obviously makes a big difference. The key things that could have been better included:  - more friendly staff on reception at check-in. It felt that we were a bit of an inconvenience and when we had to call them having got to our room they didn’t answer.  - the International Buffet was ok although I had to point out that the chicken wasn’t cooked on the first night. In sunset lighting it was a good and lucky spot so early on in the holiday.  - whilst all inclusive the drinks were more limited than I would expect and the quality of spirits was poor (and very cheap). There were premium brand bottles behind the bar and when I enquired was told that they cost the equivalent of £85 to buy!  All of this said the pool and activities staff were friendly and you could always get a seat around the pool.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kay1234567 wrote a review Oct 2017,10,Poor,Food poor. Drinks poor. Entertainment poor. Not much variety food wise you get the some for lunch and dinner chicken with everything very poor choice. Don't bother dressing up here as there is nothing to dress up for. Asked for a brandy and coke and was told they had run out and if I wanted one I had to pay for it I was on all inclusive so ended up going to the shop and buying a bottle. Rooms are big and comfortable but could do with a makeover. Beds are comfy. Staff are very friendly and the pool boys are most helpful. The ladies in the spa are lovely and the treatments are good. Coffee /juice machine was closed off after breakfast you had to go the bar for coffee and juice which was shocking as only one member of staff on and only got half a cup of coffee. The drinks are not the best tbh cheap alcohol. It would be a lot better if the coffee machine were left on during the day so you could help yourself. One evening my friend and I were sat in the restaurant and saw a member of staff reset the table next to us and reuse the cloth napkins. This hotel could be so much better with a few changes. I did enjoy my holiday and meet some lovely people round the pool. I wouldn't return here.

The availability of complimentary and unlimited drinks at the bar and restaurant was a big positive. The Moroccan wine was of excellent quality.  Issues;  1. Pool towel rental was bureaucratic and inconvenient. You don't want to get back a deposit of £45 in a non convertible currency on the last day!  2. Food breakfast was not very good. No bacon lukewarm coffee. Otherwise food had good variety but quality and quantity of meat items very limited.  3. No tea/coffee making facility in rooms.  4.

The room was tidy  but could with a few improvements like the hole in the bath filled with what looked like polyfilla holes in the bathroom floor where the door stop had been etc ...  The buffet was great lots of variety and loads of it. Never had an issue with the food however i have never drunk so many double vodkas in my life and still went to bed sober. Its not a bad thing because i could imagine what it would be like if they served real Vodka.Is there such a thing as non-alcoholic Vodka ?  Had a meal at the Orangery Restaurant and paid an additional 100din per person for this privilege save your money. It was the worst meal of the trip.  Thought we would try the Spa so booked a Hammam (50min) it was a waste of time and money  spent more time waiting and resting in rooms than anything else.  The hotel bus into the town was excellent just book at reception.  The animation staff were excellent and to be honest made the holiday they were always cheerful and engaging.  The evening shows were fun although it would have been better to watch them without the alcohol free beer.  lastly .... a tip on getting your pool towel and returning it. Get a token from reception for 150din and take it to the pool side shed for a towel. On returning your towel you get the token back take this to the reception for your money back (Now ... make sure you kept your receipt as the token is not sufficient enough to get your money back)  It was a fun trip overall 3.8 stars.,Date of stay: October 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rickmansworth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UKKingi

Our biggest gripe is that we paid extra to stay in the ""private"" priveledge area with a private pool - this is supposed to be a quiet area for those guests who have paid for the peace no shouting games in the pool waiter service for drinks and a private cafe area for lunch. This visit this had all changed peace was shattered constantly by (and I will say it) FRENCH and GERMAN guests who obviously cant take heat and drink shouting loudly dive bombing into the private pool using inflatable toys and being a massive pain - even the security guard couldnt make them understand ..... the waiter service is hit and miss at the private pool as is the cafe area.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Warren W wrote a review Oct 2017,40,5 day stay in Marrakech,We decided to treat ourselves to a short break in Marrakech having been recommended by a friend. Morocco was not a place I had ever thought of going before the recommendation. We found the package on Voyage Privé and liked the look of the hotel. When we arrived there was some confusion with reception over our booking and the checking in procedure. There was also no welcome pack advising locations of amenities so we had to explore ourselves to find things. The hotel is stunning though there is no denying. The room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable. The only downside to our room was the shower wasn't great with the tap having the difference of about a millimetre between boiling hot and ice cold. My favourite aspect of the hotel was the pool. We never had any issue getting sunbeds and the pool bar and water slides are a nice touch. The restaurant and bar were ok the food was decent considering it was all inclusive 'buffet style'.

We generally do not go back to the same place twice but after a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing stay last time we thought with just a few hours flight it worth another visit and have not been disappointed. The hotel and our room was clean fresh and well maintained the staff attentive and always at hand when required. An upgrade placed us at the furthest point from the restaurant and bar areas… however this Riad had its own small quite pool area with staff on hand with food for lunch and drinks available all day although you don’t get the variety of the main area it was still a good choice. The hotel has plenty of activities running throughout the day for allsorts of people. A small practice area for golf by the tennis courts was my gravitational point for about an hour each morning. MOUSS the local golf rep [amongst his other jobs] made the short game practice great fun with language being no problem as the French German Italian and British players all of varying standards able to have a laugh [mostly at our continental friends at expense!!!] and vie for the “free week” that Mouss offers for a hole in one?. Once the golf was over with it was time to retire to the pool area meet up with the wife and go for a few beers and a local cookery lessons before lunch. The pool areas have got to have the most comfortable sun beds ever!!! Food at all meal times is plentiful and choices there for most peoples tastes. This visit it would appear that they had more of the local fare on offer. Some of the dishes being of a very high standard in both taste and presentation. Staff in the restaurants are attentive and most we found speak a modicum of English with some [YOUNIS] I would say being fluent and along with most peoples basic school French [even I who left school almost 40 years ago] can get by.  The evening entertainment is done by the resident Animations team who work hard to entertain all age groups and genders with a variety of shows and endeavour to gat the audience to participate where and when they can.  Overall a very enjoyable stay for us both and we will be returning again as I understand [from MOUSS] they are now to start/include golf trips from the hotel etc.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chippenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bxley

We didn't mind waiting for our room to be ready as we arrived quite early but had to wait 30 minutes extra to what we were initially told. When we arrived at our room it still was not ready (rubbish and sheets still from the guest before). When we went to use the toilet it was locked and a member of staff was actually using the toilet!!    Everything else however has been great! The food everyday is delicious and there is lots of choice. The free shuttle to old town is really convenient too if you want to explore. It's a shame you have to pay for the gym (which isn't equipped at the level you would expect for the money).

We arrived at the pool and tried to get towels refused as we had no tokens so we had to walk back to reception to get tokens which we were asked to leave a deposit after a fiery encounter they begrudgingly let us have three towels seriously if I am going to steal anything it won't be some manky bright orange towels!!!  Pool area is nice.....WARNING..... the pools(yes all 3) are freezing to the point you can not really take an 11 month old baby in unless you want them to catch a cold!  The rooms once we got to it was very nice good space although beds were like plywood!  As mentioned we booked on an A/I basis so we made our way to restaurant for evening meal..... this is disappointing the staff are rude in adequate and only speak to you if you can speak French!  The French residents do get preferential treatment and waiters go the extra mile to please them!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Conor D wrote a review Sep 2017,50,Great stay,My stay at the kenzi club was overall great. It was only a short distance from the airport and from Marrakech which was ideal. Although the resort had everything you needed so there was no reason to leave. The staff where amazing. Very helpful always polite there was one member they called him MOUSS who stood out the most. He was the on site golf instructor which at the start I couldn't imagine myself playing but by the end of the holiday I was actually getting the hang of it and starting to enjoy it. Now I'm playing in my own country😃. He was also around the pool area chatting and playing cards with anyone that would sit at his table with him 😂. His over all friendless and good character definitely made the whole holiday experience more interesting and fun. Reason enough for an extra star in my opinion. The food was great. There was a new theme every day which for an allinculsive package deal I though was perfect. The bar would serve all day and till I think 11 where then there was an on site night club. ( drinks not free however). I would recommend it for a couple or a family 100% not really a party location though. I'm hoping to go back and visit in the near future.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691conord
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RichnSemrs wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Is it really a 5 star hotel?,My wife my 11 month old son and I stayed here for ten days. (11-21SEP). Let me start with some positives.  The room was a standard which was very spacious clean and tidy.  The pool and surrounding areas were also very clean tidy and a welcome dip in the afternoon sun. The pool temperature seemed to be a tad cold but if you entered via one of the slides it didn't really matter. The dates we were there it was not packed out and there were plenty of empty loungers. Which were replaced with brand new ones two days before we left.  YoYo Hassan in the restaurant and the animation staff were very friendly and welcoming. They were not pushy if you did not want to get involved with the activities they accepted a simple 'no thank you' graciously.  The grounds of the hotel are again well kept and there was always somebody on hand to sweep away anything that looked out of place.  My wife packed breakfast and lunch for our son. I reminded her that we were staying in a 5 star resort with a restaurant and that there would be food for him to eat. Good job she did pack it. I wished she had packed every meal for him. The options were puree mash carrot apple & bananas. Maybe he is a fussy eater and others would have managed.  The restaurant I can been best describe as a canteen with a variety of menus. Again this is where I question if this is a 5 star hotel. The restaurant staff were very good. Our bottle of Rose wine and a high chair were already waiting for us when we entered. (Thanks Hassan). I chose the freshly made omelette where you could pick & choose the ingredients for breakfast and a similar style for the pasta at lunch time.  My wife was very disappointed that her 'Ralph Lauren' jumper disappeared from our room and is adamant that it was stolen. I felt the cost of the transfer from the airport which I booked through the hotel is overpriced at 25 Euros for what is a ten minute drive. (my mistake) Wife haggled with a taxi driver outside the hotel for the return trip for a lot less. I would have liked to have a kettle with tea & coffee in our room. I would have also liked tea and coffee in the restaurant / canteen at lunch and dinner time too.  The weather was almost perfect. We had one cloudy day with some rain otherwise it was hot and sunny with 35 degrees. At least Ryan Air did not cancel our return flight. If I could do it all again I would spend the extra money on a better hotel. Other guests that we met up with had stayed at the hotel before and they stated that the restaurant food had not been to the usual standard.If you know a few words of French that goes a long way with the staff too. Even if it is just Bonjour & Merci...,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bexley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichnSemra

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Alison N wrote a review Sep 2017,40,Great escape from bustling Marrakech,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kenzi Club Agdal and cannot see why there are so many negative reviews. Firstly the staff (particularly the animation team and waiters) were incredible so friendly and really got everyone involved. Not sure what the complaints about poor service for non-French speakers is about. The staff spoke great English and seemed fascinated by English people! A simple Merci and Bonjour go a long way (you should always make the effort in a foreign country).  The hotel is located really close to the Marrakech centre and offer free transport several times a day. Also very close to the Airport and costs about 10 pounds transfer (cheaper to go with a taxi than through the hotel).  The hotel was immaculate pool area great so much entertainment all day to entertain anyone from any age.  Fabulous food so much for vegans/ vegetarians which is often so hard to find. The restaurant and out door eating space are well laid out and doesnt feel like a zoo/canteen which can be found in other hotels. Mixture of traditional Moroccan food and salads etc. The chef even made my sister and I a vegan pizza one night!  Only complaint can be about the rude reception staff no matter how hard we tried to make conversation and be friendly they were positively hostile in particular a lady called Hela (or Hala not entirely sure) she was deliberately difficult. The check in and check out process is also quite slow. But this is the only thing that lets the hotel down.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ripatel wrote a review Sep 2017,40,"Overall, a very good holiday!",We booked a weeks holiday and stayed in the Kenzi Riad that had a private pool. This was a very peaceful place to stay with waiters and security guards who would make drinks and assist in any way they could. Ismail and Aisha were very helpful and kind to us.    The rooms are clean and spacious. The main pools and bars are clean and have a lot of seating. The entertainment team are always around usually around the kiddies pool but at the bar in the evenings. Some water classes happen in the adult pool - book in advance.    Dining is fine. There is enough choice in what to eat for you to not walk away hungry. Breakfasts are continental with eggs omelettes other veg options etc. Lunches and dinners always have a tagine station pasta and pizza station and other cuisines (burgers rice dishes chinese kebabs veg dishes fish dishes etc). There is the usual breads salads dips and the best of all the dessert bar! We would like to say a huge thanks to Moncef who looked after us during mealtimes. He was friendly spoke good english and was very attentive. Moncef - thank you very much!    Security is good - they check what cars and drivers you are taking on your trips. Guards are all around the resort.    It was a great stay. Quiet as we went during off-peak season. I recommend a few day trips to the Atlas mountains camel riding evenings and definitely the Souk. The receptionists will help you organise things (but I wouldn't always trust their restaurant choices as they try to encourage you to use local places that may not be great).,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ripatel
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,S R wrote a review Sep 2017,10,Awful hotel,Absolutely awful hotel.    Do not come here if you're an adult seeking peace. The place is overrun with children.    This is no way a 5* hotel there isnt any tea or coffee in the bedrooms the showerheads have mould on them they don't even serve cappucino's at breakfast. I have stayed at many 5* and to be constantly told 'no' by hotel staff to the most simple of things its appalling.  The restaurants are like dining halls - not a nice experience at all. Bugs flying around and sitting on your food.

There was a huge variety of food at each meal time. it is a complex rather than hotel but we loved the walk from black 7 each morning and back and fourth during the day.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,seema_babes wrote a review Sep 2017,10,Not impressed,This is my second visit to Kenzi agdal and I was not impressed at all... first time was bliss unfortunately this visit it seems that the reception staff have a chip on their shoulder massively.... even when I asked to speak to a duty manager they refused to call one it's like they stood as a barrier this happened twice on our arrival lucky a manager was walking around and he approached reception when she was refusing.... the only positive to say about this hotel is the lovely management who do try to go the extra mile for you.  Bad points were  Their check in was rubbish they didn't explain anything to us in terms of meal times until we asked.... Check in time was 2:30pm but they didn't give us all of our rooms till 4:30pm they had the cheek to tell us people have paid for a late check out which isn't really my problem I've paid to have a room which I didn't get and nor did they compensate for...  girls from other rooms called down for an iron for 20-30mins and got no answer but when we reached reception they were both standing having a chat saying lines have been extremely busy... I can't see that being true....  Cutlery in restaurant (more like a canteen) was sticky dirty and even had lipstick on it whilst one member of staff was happy to take it away and replace another member was saying in their language to put it back on our table but luckily the other guy shouted at him and called him stupid...  Also the food in the restaurant was very repetitive bland and always running out before end of meal times...  Drinks... they apparently run out of beer on our first day according to staff but according to management it was available all day and they don't understand why we were refused it...    Overall I would never return again I'm currently in another resort in another country and it cost roughly the same but the service is a million times better...  Kenzi your standards have dropped I wasn't the only guest complaining I met many people in reception carrying the same frustrations even a taxi driver said that most of the guests he drops have been complaining about the reception staff... and that everyone is saying they were good before but not any more...,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Mayland, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seema_babes

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,trevelyon wrote a review Sep 2017,30,More like a large apartment complex,Just wrapped up a 4 night stay with friends. The place is massive. The walk to my room from the lobby or the pool was very very long. Didn't really like the hotels set up. The pool area was nice and had waterslides for kids. The adult pool had a bar that was swarming with yellow jackets and guests smoking cigarettes. Just not my thing. This isn't a traditional all inclusive in my opinion. Food and limited drinks are available during certain hours. Expect to pay for premium brand vodkas or other spirits. The restaurant was a cafeteria and server the same food almost every night. I struggled with the food. The staff were kind and there were a lot of guests who looked happy. There was a disco for adults and one for kids that was empty each night I stayed. I would stay somewhere else next time. Not that this place was bad just not my type of hotel.,Date of stay: September 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,oakland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevelyon
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jonseypc wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Outstanding hotel and staff,Our first holiday to Morocco and we were not disappointed.. this hotel and complex is beautiful and five star through and through. The grounds are lovely with plenty to do without even setting foot outside the hotel fabulous pools first class spa (thoroughly recommend the Turkish Bath treatment - wow!) tennis and various sports plus organised activities around the pool side everyday.  Amazingly safe for children too so great for both families and adults myself and my older daughter went as two women travelling and we never felt unsafe.  All inclusive and the food was great plenty of choice but all very good quality (we are fussy foodies!) freshly cooked to order in front of you we enjoyed a variety of cuisine throughout our stay and all very healthy too.  I have to give an enormous big mention to the entertainment staff they really made our holiday extra special.. a fantastic team who are both talented and great fun! They put on great shows in the evening and spent all day getting everyone involved around the pool with hilarious games.  Absolutely lovely people and the same can be said for all the hardworking staff at the resort nothing is too much trouble.  Rooms lovely and we had the extra bonus of a private pool right outside ours superb.  I really can't recommend this place enough we will be going back without doubt hopefully many times Marrakesh is an incredible place to visit and of course guaranteed lovely weather all only 3 hours from the UK.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mandy C wrote a review Aug 2017,50,First time family holiday to Marrakech,We were a family of three (child of 10) and we stayed at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina from 19 August.    The trip was booked months in advance.Having read many other reviews I was a little concerned about some of the comments but took everything with a pinch of salt. Not everyone is the same and we are very much a family of 'hail fellow well met'. We love people and have met some lovely ones all over the world. So we came here with an open mind and hearts and this is our personal experience.    Menara airport is lovely. Clean efficient and everyone in it was friendly. Well apart from the man at passport control he was a little stern but no more. Certainly not as grumpy as the passport control guys at Boston Logan anyway!    We had booked a private taxi through hoppa.com and the nicest man was waiting for us as promised outside the terminal. He spoke fabulous English engaged in conversation about our trip to Morocco and wished us a happy holiday as he left.    Check in was fast I knew we had to pay for towels and a safe but at about £2 a day for the safe I didn't object. Small price to pay for a safe I think. Towels are soft and clean and you get the money back at the end of the stay. Not at all uncommon in many other all inclusive hotels we have stayed in.    We had room 447 which had access to its own small shared pool in the middle of the block. The temperature of the water was perfect for a 35+ degrees afternoon and a dip in the pool before dinner was most welcome. The room had air conditioning a great shower plenty of hot water a balcony and most importantly of all was perfectly quiet. Absolute bliss.    The Atlas restaurant where the all inclusive meals are served is large clean well staffed and considering the amount of people never felt too full. Our waiter most days Younes spoilt us. The food was plentiful and as far as we could see fresh and well cooked. The wine was ok not my particular taste but drinkable for sure and the water was plentiful.    The animation team put on a great show every evening. We're not big on that sort of entertainment but you could see how hard everyone worked to make sure that the guests we all having fun. The overall choreographer is an incredible dancer I haven't seen body popping like that since the 80's 😊    The grounds are immaculate. Everywhere is spotlessly clean. There are enough people around to ensure everywhere is clean and tidy and kept that way as long as possible.    Here are a few points to address some concerns and raised points from earlier reviews...    Water - we never found an empty water fountain and there is plenty of water available to take in bottles at lunch and dinner. We had a fresh bottle of water in our rooms every day.    Shuttle bus - easy to book runs many times in the day and was on time always.    Wasps and bugs - we didn't see any but doesn't mean they aren't around. Occasional fly but nothing more sinister.    Food - certainly appeared well cooked and fresh. I checked all the poultry we ate and it was always cooked through. The bread is fabulous so hard not to eat it all. I think there is always a 'canteen' ambience about all inclusive buffets. So many people so much food. It's not 5 star a la carte so dont expect that.    Drinks - well we had a couple of cocktails and they compared with every other all inclusive we have had. Sweet because like most cocktails they contain coconut milk and sweet syrup. These ones weren't too bad (I hate anything sugary) but I couldn't manage a second. Gin and tonic was very strong and tasted fine. My sons mocktail was fab. He was happy....    Pools - all clean and lots of lifeguards about. The temperature of the water is great not too hot but certainly not too cold which in 40 degree heat was so welcome!    People - most of the people here are either French or perhaps Moroccan/Arabic. I did French at school (30+ years ago) but nevertheless tried to use it and it was appreciated by all. Most if not all the staff speak good English and everyone else we met staff or guests were very polite a 'Merci' never goes a miss from either side.    Medina - well worth a visit. We took a chance hiring a guide at the drop off as opposed to one of the hotel recommended guides. Same sort of price (100 dirhams per adult) though. We usually like to wander ourselves but decided that if we had one visit only it was wise to do it with help. We went to the Berber apothecary and bought Argan products we bought leather goods tagines and a spectacular lamp. Our guide was happy to take us to 'the best places for everything' and waited patiently whilst we bargained and browsed. We finished with mint tea at a cafe with a terrace looking down on the snake charmers in the main square. Totally recommend you visit. A few hours is ample but it is addictive!    Money - two ATMs at the hotel. We changed some money at the airport and some as we needed it at the hotel. The rates varied slightly but not significantly. The Moroccans will take most currencies.    So all in all we had a fabulous time. Loved the Kenzi club loved Marrakech. Go experience the atmosphere of an amazing city with incredibly friendly people and above all for use British warm sunny weather 😊,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Redhill, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandyb48
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Shaun663 wrote a review Aug 2017,50,A great all inclusive resort for relaxing or as a base.,I booked this place online for a good price. It's always a leap of faith when one books a hotel direct but I needn't have worried. This resort/ hotel is beautiful and clean. The food whilst not the very best is very good and varied. Very few British people on site whilst we were there but the staff speak English to a high standard. Rooms are fairly basic but clean remember that this is a resort rather than a hotel!    I struggle to find negatives about the resort but here's all I can think of:    1. Lots of bees at the poolside bar and I do mean LOTS! but they are the most placid relaxed bees I've come across.  2. Poolside music a little loud for my taste.  3. Cocktails not that good to be honest.  4. They often ran out of glasses not for long but they need to sort that out.    Positives:  1. Free shuttle bus into town but a taxi is only about 60 to 70 Dirahm each way.  2. The staff are very friendly and accommodating a special mention to Moncef in the restaurant outstanding.  3. Plenty of sunbeds if you're into that sort of thing.    The positives definitely outweigh the negatives and I would consider returning.,Date of stay: August 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaun663
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Alix Dunstone wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Fabulous relaxed atmosphere and the staff are fab.,This was the second time that we have stayed here ( the first being 2015). We love the relaxed atmosphere and the kids (12 & 10) had a long list of things that they could get involved in (Maxim at Maxi Club is particularly good and welcoming especially as there weren't lots of English families). including rifle shooting dance show football table tennis darts board games.... the list goes on.    There are cultural differences which I've seen other people pick up on - it isn't England or London and they are a bit more mañana than Spain but everything comes eventually and with a smile. At the bar the men are served first then the women and then the kids and yes it gets busy but the staff all work very hard to get through the customers and will often be making several orders up at once. But hey its a holiday not the west end does it matter if your beer takes 5 mins or so to get to you? Their English is very good but making an effort in French or even trying some Arabic will result in a smile a laugh and build rapport - by day 4 I didn't have to order my drink when they saw me at the bar it was poured for me and put in front of me with a smile. The entire bar crew but particularly Mehdi Soufiane 1 and Soufiane 2 ( their idea!) and Mohammed were all fabulous. Professional efficient accommodating and friendly and didn't laugh at me too much when I was trying out my arabic!    The food is good varied and fresh and there is a different themed night every evening. I could have eaten totally different meals every night for 2 weeks. They also have stations where the chefs will make up the meals fresh for you - pasta omelettes pizza etc. Yes it can get busy but if you time it well its not an issue.    Moncef is the real star of the dining room he recognised us on our return and we would always choose to sit in his sections. He is professional efficient friendly and brilliant with the kids - they knew that if they sat in his section he would look out for them much like an older brother would. Nothing was too much trouble and he is a real credit to the hotel.    The other people I have to mention are the fabulous Animation team - another credit to the hotel. They didn't tire of us turning down invitations to aquabike or aquagym (aerobics) and were always smiling energetic and friendly. There are lots of activities that you can join in with throughout the day if you want to from amusing team competitions to more structured volleyball/ petanque etc. They work long days 9am- Midnight and every evening is a different show - again we didn't see the same show for 2 weeks. They absolutely dance their socks off on stage for nearly an hour and then once the show has finished do all the resort dances for the by then tipsy clients to join in with. Magic Hassan Spider Machine and Sihan were all fabulous and deserve a name check - they really made us feel like we were part of the hotel and their enthusiasm was infectious. Magic even got my son to sing karaoke - unheard of! ( thank you darling!)    I was hoping that I wouldn't have the holiday blues this time but they hit good and proper on Monday. We have had 2 fantastic holidays here and are already contemplating a 3rd! The set up is good and the people are fantastic.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jamie Newman wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Morroco..,My partner and I stayed at the Kenzi club agdal medina for 5 nights in the middle of June 2017.    Upon arrival our room was not ready so they gave us our wristbands and told us that we could still catch breakfast in the main restaurant if we were hungry. We then Sat around the pool for a bit whilst our room was prepared but we cannot complain as we did arrive at 10am.    As mentioned in other posts the pool bar does get a little busy with flies however I feel it's hard to blame the staff for this type of pest. Pools are generally clean and the quite pool was always nice for a morning dunk.    I'd recommend drinking wine/beer if you do drink alcohol. I found the cocktails very sweet. The white wine was actually very nice. Food is varied and each evening is themed. My vegetarian girlfriend and myself (meat eater) were never short of options and we were both pleasantly pleased. The main restaurant does get busy though.    Staff were also very helpful and approachable. Entertainment can be repetitive but it was entertaining none the less.    Rooms were very spacious clean and comfortable.    We were slightly apprehensive due to some negative reviews but from our experience the hotel was of a high class    We really enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend this property to friends.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Amy B wrote a review Aug 2017,30,Bar Issues.,We turned up at the hotel and the room wasn't ready. No problem we went for lunch and returned at 2.30 as requested. Got to the room.....it was not ready!!! Did I add that I had a poorly 7 year old with me. In the end I had to lay her on the grass in the shade outside of the room. The cleaners were lovely and wet large leaves for her forehead. Room was lovely. Clean and tidy. 'Infirmary' were lovely and got prescription for my daughter. Buffet and waiters were lovely and accommodating. Food was fresh and something for everyone. Major issue for us was the hotel pool bar. First it's covered in wasps. Secondly they never wanted to serve us. Any one of us could go and we would get ignored in favour of the French. They were not friendly. We could not be bothered to get drinks. On holiday you normally have a drink around 5pm.....too much hassle here. Really sad. My advice is to order lots of water at lunch and collect bottles in a large bag. There are water coolers by the pool but they're often empty. On the last day my husband did venture for a sun downer. I was by the pool and asked to give my drink to the pool glass collector because it was 6pm and the bar was closed now. I refused and told him I would take my glass to the bar! You get a bloody drink and they want to take it away. The Kenzi has good points: kids loved the pool entertainment was good wine was more than palatable. Personally I wouldn't go again BUT the rest of the family would.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,emmasmiles wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Second time around,Our second trip here to this clean comfortable relaxing hotel. We went in June this year and found the heat a bit of a struggle but there's always the pools to jump into any time of the day you'll find sun loungers we went in September last time and the weather was a lot more bearable. I will say the pool bar in June was still awash with wasps/bee type bugs and would often bother the bar staff most of the bar staff were ok but I do think they had a problem with single women at the bar and more than once I was ignored/overlooked by the short fat one with buggy eyes ( conveniently his name badge was scrubbed out) but Mohammed or mustapha always helped out.. By far the most outstanding person up there is saad who runs the poolside snack bar  a big Tottenham fan ( tell him Emma from England sends regards) he's always smiling and cooks great fish. Evening times there is always entertainment and the animation team do a great job magic and spider make themselves known 😊.    The atlas restaurant offers a great variety of food  themed nights are most enjoyable and I can't see that anyone would be stuck to find something to eat. For your breakfast monciff will serve you coffee with a great smile as you choose from breads cereals ful english.. Continental fruit and juices.. Not forgetting Moroccan tea. Evening time enjoy the attention of Tariq as you choose from the many delights we found the drinks enjoyable but the cocktails rather sweet but got through a fair amount of white wine.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,earlywurly wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Brilliant Hotel,My wife and I went away for a couple of days escape.  We didn't plan on taking our two children with us so we looked for something cheaper.  Shuttle from the airport was awful waited around for 45 minutes with the driver(?)  Very friendly staff upon arrival and although our room wasn't quite ready we were pointed in the direction of a poolside late breakfast bar.  Swimming pools are fantastic clean and we never struggled to get a sun bed.  Poolside bar staff very friendly and waited no more than a minute to be served if at all.  Food - what a choice. I could have stayed there a week and tried something different every night. Great food and good choice of drinks. No issues with service or product quality.  Overall we had a great time and would definitely return.  We both said afterwards that though the hotel felt very safe we wouldn't take our children.  From the moment we landed at Marrakesh we didn't feel comfortable unsafe somehow.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Addlestone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earlywurly
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,AMK306 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Great hotel!,We had an amazing stay at the hotel. The reception staff are extremely friendly. We arrived a few hours before our check-in and even though had to wait a little bit for the room to be ready they provided us with our all inclusive wristbands and showed us to the area where the breakfast was being served.    Great place for families or someone looking for a relaxing vacation. Not the youngest crowd but it did not change our experience as the staff were able to advise us on the selection of bars and restaurants in the area. Extremely safe environment. About 10 minutes away from the airport and not far from the City Centre either. The free shuttle bus is very useful.    There is a wide selection of tours available to book from the front desk. The all inclusive food is nice and there is always a good selection however if you are staying longer than a week it may get a little repetitive. Loads of activities to get involved with during the day and in the evening and entertainment staff are a pleasure! Yes it is mostly catered to the French audience however everyone communicated in English well including the tour guides! Also I have seen a few complaints in regards to the bugs in the rooms - that only happens if you leave your balcony door open which is not much of a surprise considering that you are surrounded by vast gardens.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMK306

I could not fault Kenzi Club in any way!    The facilities are excellent enough room around the pools and restaurant even during busier times. Also a really clean spacious complex with plenty to do!    The waiting staff were amazing in particular Hassan and Monceif. They would set us our favourite table with our favourite drinks before we'd even arrived! They made our stay really special all of the staff at the hotel simply couldn't do enough to please ud!    Also the animation team really made our stay special and enjoyable. Hassan machine and Siham always encouraged us to get involved and would even sit and talk to us when they had chance! Having a team that is so focused on making sure the guests have a good time really does make a difference. The evening entertainment was also very good! Never a dull moment.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Justintime wrote a review Jul 2017,50,50th celebration weekend for the girls,Amazing long weekend at this all-inclusive. 15 minutes from the airport.    We had such a good time. We stayed for 3 nights and couldn't have had a better time. The food had a great choice - different themes on different nights as well as regular options. First night was French night with some French dishes and delicious French cheeses. Next night was Moroccan night - giving us different tagging selections. Breakfast and lunches were plentiful too. Third night we booked into the Moroccan restaurant where you pay the supplement - that turned into a bit of a disaster because they couldn't cater for the vegetarian and the gluten free in our group - even though we made it clear when we booked. So whilst it was lovely atmosphere please note - don't go if you can't eat the set meal. Also we all chose menu 2 - menu 1 on the other table looked delicious. Our main course was a lump of meat on the bone in a watery gravy. The couscous royale on the neighbours table looked so much nicer.    Our waiters in the main restaurant were fantastic - Moncef and Tariq. They looked after us so well- morning noon and night!    Pools were great. Drinks flowed. We had a water bottle in our room on arrival so we were never short of water.    It was mid to late 30s temp but the dry desert heat is not too oppressive. We found the nightclub on the last night but you have to buy drinks there but we had a great laugh.    Good shuttle service into town. Need to book this at reception.    We spoke some French and that may have helped but we felt very welcome and safe in Marrakech and in Kenzi Club.    Would we go back again?

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ChalkyB8792 wrote a review Jul 2017,50,Great week with friends,"First of all lots of harp on here from people saying ""not 5* don't be fooled"" etc.. no it's not 5* but neither is the price paid for this hotel so let's be realistic. Lovely hotel and most definitely 5* in comparison to what is expected at a local standard.    Pros and cons:  + check in nice and efficient with very welcoming staff at the desk  + easy to change money at the reception so no need to worry about exchange at airport (which appears to be closed between 5pm-9am anyway)  + great choices with food. You get your standard sections e.g. Salads pastas tagines etc but these vary each night and there is a different theme 7 nights a week .. restaurant staff were excellent  + plenty to do as animation team are awesome and have lots of activities if you wanna do that sort of thing. Shout out to Siham who was awesome and welcomed us from day 1!  + a large kiddy pool with slides and a quieter deeper pool gives best of both worlds .. pool always clean too! Lifeguards always nearby  + wifi good in most areas  + housekeeping visited every day  + despite being busy always sun beds available  + golf buggy at hand when you arrive to help you with bags to your room also when checking out too  + comfy beds and nice decor throughout  + tourism desk for excursions as well as a free shuttle bus to the town    - lots of wasps at bar often had them following me when taking drinks to poolside but expected in the hot heat with sticky sugary drinks so not sure what they could do about this anyway  - bring your own suncream!! So expensive at the shop..300ml equates to nearly 20£ in Stirling..  - hard to taste alcohol in the cocktails when made by certain members of staff. Samir was great with looking after us and putting alcohol into an alcoholic beverage .. stayed off the cocktails and ended up drinking vodka lemonade in the end    My tips:    Stock up on bottled water at breakfast and dinner to keep yourselves going throughout the day    Bring your own beach towel unless you're ok with exchanging money to leave a deposit    If booking transfers separate look up marrakech taxis and drop them an email - €25 round trip and great staff    Bring your own essentials rather than relying on the shop .. suncream and shampoos etc were around the 250 dirham mark same with Lilos which were popular with the kids    In restaurant don't sit towards the far left upper corner - the birds love that area    Get to dinner and lunch early as the rooms fill up very quickly!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,NPbrod wrote a review Jun 2017,40,First visit to Morocco,First visit to Marrakech Morocco and very impressed. Brilliant city and the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina was exactly what we expected. Super service brilliant pool facilities and great food choice.  You need to remember you are in North Africa and not Europe if you have this mindset you won't be disappointed.  Our room was extremely clean and the daily maid service was very good.( No need to take anything for your room all toiletries are provided.)  The Pool has a Snack Bar that is open for most of the day where you can get drinks all day and food in the afternoon. As described by other visitors there is a lot of bee's around the sugary drinks but the staff do their best to keep them away. Good cocktail selection and all soft drinks are named - Coke Fanta etc.  2 Pools - one family with slides and the other more Adult friendly. Both are really clean and the sun beds are really comfortable (especially the double beds)  Atlas Buffet Resturant is were we ate every night however their is a Moroccan Restuarant that you can book (we just never got round to it due to the good choice in the Atlas restaurant) The choice in food was very varied on every sitting. Mohamed (waiter) made it personal and looked after us every evening thank you. Also the Chef on the pasta was a superb His food was amazing in flavour and presentation. Both of them took real pride in their work.  The animation team work endlessly throughout the day / evening to keep all residents happy varied shows but the fire show (wednesday) is very impressive.  Very good Daily free shuttle service (10mins) in and out of the city - every 30 mins  Overall it's a very good hotel with staff that want to help. Yes the first language is French but as soon as the staff know you are English they change to suit.  Marrakech city is fun confidence is the key I would say. Yes you get pestered as you would expect in a country like this but if you are polite and firm then you will have no problem. The market and Souk at night is definitely a must do along with the Palaces and YSL gardens in the day. Ensure you haggle I would say they are usually looking for 40-50% of their original starting price (also its good fun and can't wait to do it in Tesco's)  Overall an excellent 10 days in Marrakech and a brilliant hotel.,Date of stay: June 2017,,"Stowmarket, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NPbrod

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,littlefreckle2017 wrote a review Jun 2017,50,The perfect 4 night break for 2 friends,I went last week (19th - 23rd June 2017) and I couldn't fault this hotel. Perhaps not a 5* hotel with regards to the decor throughout but certainly with regards to the variety of facilities on offer. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful the room and hotel itself was spotless and there was so much to do (spa pool archery driving range fitness classes language classes dance classes cookery classes)! The buffet at each meal was so varied and served lovely fresh food (my tip would be to go down early as if you came down at the end of a meal time there was slightly less available - but that is totally normal and what I would expect). We also tried the A La Carte restaurant for my birthday meal and it was a less varied menu but wonderfully traditional Moroccan dishes. The staff also made me feel really special - singing to me and bringing me a birthday cake at the end of the meal. I couldn't have felt more welcome. The spa was lovely and I very much enjoyed the massage I booked. There was music playing by the pool all day but as 2 friends in their early 30s we quite enjoyed the atmosphere this created and it wasn't intrusive if you were trying to read a good book at the same time.

Not being a huge fan of big hotels and resorts as it doesn't have that homely feeling I was a bit sceptical however this experience and every single member of the staff we encountered proved me wrong!  Everyone was so helpful kind smiley that we felt treated as guests in their home. We were positively impressed as everyone was fluent in many languages such as french of course but also English Italian and Spanish!  I work in a small hotel in England my self and I admired the hard work training and genuinely hospitable attitude that the whole staff (reception animation restaurant spa housekeeping...) had during our stay although it was Ramadan period which is said to affect the atmosphere - I wish I could show my colleagues what the staff at this resort pulls together every single day for so many guests!    In regards of the facilites:  Needles to say the rooms are comfortable and divided in small Riads so you don't really feel overwhelmed by the vastity of the structure.  The restaurant serves a huge variety on nice food through the day: breakfast lunch snack bar and dinner with themed nights when they prepare some dishes from different countries. The Orangerie the moroccan restaurant has been for us one of the best experiences in our short holiday aided by the lovely sunset surrounding and perfect attentive and not intrusive service from Mustapha  Spa swimming pools the guys and girls of the animation team.... I could go on and on for pages the main idea being EVERYTHING FROM CHECK IN TO CHECK OUT HAS BEEN PERFECT!    There is also wide selection of trips and excursions available to book on site which are very good value.

Always spaces around the pool with a bar near the pool for drinks.  The shuttle bus was really helpful for transport to the main square then you can walk to see the sights and the souls. The room was big with air con and always cleaned well.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,EllieKirk wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Good Short Break Hotel,"We stayed as a young couple for a short 5 day break    Firstly as many have said this is by no means a five star hotel and there are areas that require improvement but I will start with the good points first!    Pro's  - Amazing and friendly entertainment team- They work so hard day and night keeping you informed of all the activities going on and then do a full show/entertainment at night. They are a real credit to the hotel    - Lovely layout and hotel gardens this makes the hotel! The hotel and accommodation Riads are lined with olive trees climbers and roses. When you're on your balcony its really secluded and private.    - Clean and Comfy large hotel rooms albeit slightly basic with no facilities ie Irons Tea/coffee safe. These facilities could be obtained but for a refundable deposit.    - Pool area was spacious and always clean. No problem getting a sunbed but umbrellas are slightly limited.    - Hotel was happy to arrange drivers/excursions through the voyage prive Rep (Siad) He was great and arranged us a good driver who spoke good english to take us to the atlas mountains at a reasonable price. He sent a bottle of wine and a cake to the room on discovering it was my partners birthday which was a lovely gesture.    - Shuttle Bus was a great edition allowing you to get to the medina and souks without having to pay. although your place had to be booked 24 hours in advance    Con's  - Food The food was hit and miss each day. There was not much variation in choice either especially breakfast which did not change. Each night had a different cuisine theme but the choices were very similar to that of the night before.    - Pool Towel Charge on arrival you had to pay 150 Dirhams per person (£12) for a towel this was refunded to you at the end of your stay but for a hotel claiming its 5• this is very inconvenient as you've forked out money that you then end up with quite a few useless dirhams when you're leaving the country- slightly annoying!    - Requires another restaurant/bar to accommodate size of hotel - This hotel only offers the ""Atlas"" Restaurant in the all inclusive package which is your standard buffet For a longer stay this could get extremely boring. There was another Moroccan restaurant that was open for dinner on certain days of the week although me and my partner did not eat here its 150 Dirham charge per person for a set menu that did not change during the 5 days we were there. Frankly i think you had a choice of Moroccan tagines/cuisine each night at the buffet restaurant that was probably just as good. There needed to be a a la carte option. As for bars there was only one open during the evening that also hosted the entertainment so there was no quieter relaxed environment in the evening for drinking.    Not a complaint/con as of such as we both accept that we were in a country were english is not the main language. But for a hotel that advertises with english travel agencies there was a little bit of a language barrier and french was understood better at this hotel. I would consider this as more of a french resort.    To summarise great for a inexpensive short getaway in the sun it delivered exactly what we needed for a five day break but we both agreed that we would require more variety if we were to stay longer than a week.",Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Exeter, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieKirk

The grounds and atmosphere are undeniably quaint  you can roam around in complete relaxation in quite an extensive and varied area within the grounds  The pools and communal areas are very nice with water slides pool bar and plenty of seating/shade  Paying the extra for the Spa pool (not much money) is totally worth it for those too hot to bear days it’s a lovely indoor pool with water jets etc and you can still sit in the sun if you want to    The bedrooms are roomy clean and air conditioned (and boy do you need this at night)  The food is what you would expect in this region a mixture of lovely sun ripened fruit and locally inspired cuisine all cooked very nicely and with pleasing varied flavours    I have to mention the entertainment also (Animation Team) surprisingly good and varied for a hotel I have to give credit to them for this they really are very professional and entertaining  The bar staff in the indoor bar are friendly and have good banter which was brilliant    The pool bar is the resorts only slight let-down  A few more staff a ‘Post Mix Bar Gun’ and a few mixology classes would be a worthwhile investment I think; that and a some bamboo/gazebos to make it look the part and it would be ideal :o)    A few words about Marrakesh (not hotel related) -    The excursions on offer are varied but beware that once you leave the solitude of the hotel the world outside is not for the faint hearted; try to keep a low profile and don’t make eye contact or take a picture unless you wish to engage in a heated haggle this is not like wandering round Camden market :o)  I would advise If you feel the need to shop for souvenirs then take a guided tour to pre-selected outlets tours are available from the hotel or use the hotel shop it’s a much nicer experience and worth the extra money trust me    ** WARNING **  I would not recommend entering the Souk at night for a family with children also I would not recommend the horse carriage excursion at night its starts out nice but the driver eventuality wanders where he should not my wife and I had a very horrible experience with this which kind of ruined our holiday to be honest,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rayleigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattGwen

The foods is varied and fresh every meal time.  Facilities are good and as stated on the website.  We have two complaints.  1 .we were told that or booking involved a free steam hamam ..  Which we decided to try ...the lady in the spa took us into the hamam .  We were told we had a 30 minute booking .  Time went by ..we waited for somebody to come and get us.  My wife became dizzy and faint.  So we came out of the hamam ..then we realised we had been in thete for an hour .  I asked the last why didn't she come and get us ..her English was very limited and reply was nonsense.  We raises this point with the staff on the front desk ..a day later they informed us the spa staff claimed they had taken care of us .  It's really poor service when staff lie .  Bit disappointed with that.  2. We booked an excursion to the Atlas mountains which was fantastic .  However the restaurant meal included in the excursion was below par .a sub standard tagine with rubber chicken .  Others on the trip also complained about the food but no notice was taken.  The spa issue ..the hotel should have resolved it better.  The excursion was operated by an independent company that is tired with the hotel but not part of it .    So all in all we had a good time ..nice rooms ..good food . Nice pool area and entertainment every night .

It was fabulous - his n hers basins his n hers loos a massive bed! We would eat early have a drink in the bar and then retire at about 9pm to relax and make the most of such a lovely room.  This gesture was especially appreciated having just been told by Iberia that our luggage was in Madrid and that we would have to return to the airport next day to fetch it!  The staff were all so friendly despite the scorching temperatures (45 degrees when we arrived) and the fact that it was Ramadan and therefore more of a challenge for them.  The grounds are so beautifully maintained with its pomegranite bushes olive trees and orange trees.  My only suggestion is that there should be a second bar open during the day not just the pool bar - but that is just a minor quibble.  Lovely food - we adore the vegetable tangines! - and a beautiful cool reception to sit in with the very friendly Zouhair at the Currency desk!

A refreshing welcome drink was served on arrival whilst completing the necessary paperwork and our bags placed in the luggage room until our room was ready. We were given full access to the resort for the short time we had to wait. It also gave us chance to book our very reasonably priced excursion to the Medina and receive so good advice from the staff.    The room was wonderful air conditioned and clean. Lots of space too. The maid came in every day to freshen the room.    The pools have plenty of sun beds and parasols so there was no need to rush in the mornings.    All main meals were served in the Atlas restaurant. There was a vast selection available to suit everyone's needs. Each evening meal was themed to a popular cuisine. The poolside snack bar was available in between the main mealtimes so you would never be hungry.    The staff were all friendly and couldn't do enough to help you.    A real pleasure to be there for the low cost of this break I would recommend you give it a try.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicNak876
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Stuart D wrote a review Jun 2017,50,All in all very good value for money,For the cost of our holiday this hotel has been excellent. It's probably 4* in England but we have thoroughly enjoyed our time here. The staff are great and always willing to help. The room is clean and equipped with a fridge tv hairdryer. The double bed is very comfortable and spacious (not two beds pushed together).    The activity team are great be it in the pool for water aerobics or with Mouss teaching my partner how to play golf! There's lots of other activities on offer too.    I've been on a few all inclusive holidays and I've always experienced 'small glasses' you just have to refill them more often (not a big problem) and you'll need the exercise with all the great food your eating! Grilled fish steak as well as traditional dishes are on offer and changes slightly each night as they do a different theme each day.    The quality of the spirits however has been our only real issue. They're not the best quality and we often find ourselves sticking to the beer or wine.    All in all a great hotel and well worth what you pay for. If you want a real 5* holiday you'll need to pay a bit more money to get what you're looking for.    Pro's  - Friendly happy & helpful staff  - Great buffet food offer  - Variety of activities to get involved in  - Couples and family friendly  - Plenty of comfortable sun beds/parasols  - Clean spacious air con rooms  - One good sized swimming pool and one huge pool with water slides  - good free wifi if needed  - Fridge and TV in room with balcony  - Free transport to the city centre daily    Cons  - Cocktail drinks could be much better although wine and beer are good until they run out,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuartD1285

Rooms were cleaned daily.    Upgraded on arrival as boyfriend mentioned anniversary - entitling us to a private pool huge room and separate services. Security was always visible which was fab.  Otherwise there are two main pools to use.    Buffet style food as expected with all inclusive. The food was great. Good variety and themed nights ensuring a good mix of foods available. Lovely seating available outside with fab atmosphere as well as inside if the heat was too much.  You can never go hungry here. With breakfast snacks lunch snacks and then dinner available its impossible!!    We had booked a couple of excursions all taxi collections were made to the hotel perfectly. Would recommend using the free shuttle bus service into the markets - very useful!    Don't forget city tax is to be paid at end of stay - you are able to get cash transferred in the hotel which was great!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tottie O wrote a review Jun 2017,20,Very Very Poor for all inclusive,I agree with a lot of reviews that say this is a nice clean and welcoming hotel.  However for an all inclusive hotel it is very poor.    Mostly due to the real issue with drinks as previous reviews state the drinks are small flat and mostly syrup related. This hotel does not do cocktails or ice creams or lollies for children. And most drinks are flat.    Even in temps of 100 plus a pregnant guest was refused a bottle of water.    On the whole the staff are pleasant and the hotel is clean. Food satisfactory for a long weekend but much longer I think you would be bored of the choices.    Wifi poor.    Having to pay a towel deposit just bad on an all inclusive holiday and the same for the safe.

I'm going to give bullet points to make it easer for people to decide!    This is supposedly a 5 star hotel....    * Hotel grounds are lovely very nicely maintained    * No kettle in room (the hotel advertised they had kettles in the room) - you will have to ask for one after signing a document which states you will be charged 1000 Dhirams if you don't return it!? Seriously!??    * Ladies don't bother bringing your hair straightners - the electricity is shocking! - my hair straightner wouldn't even charge up. Your phones will take ages to get charged up.    * There was a loose electric socket in the room which gave an electric shock.    * You have to pay to use the safe    * The water temperature of the shower kept changing from hot to cold.    * Not enough vegetarian food - the food is hardly changed so you'll get the same food for lunch and breakfast    * Fridge had a light in it but wasn't working. i.e. not cold at all. I complained 3 times nothing was done about it.    * Rooms dirty (table tops had loads of dust) not dusted. Bed was made up floors sweeped and that was it.    * Customer service at the front desk wasn't that good they seemed somewhat miserable to talk to you.    * French is the main language some 'staff' couldn't speak in English?...    Some other couples complained of cockroaches in their bathrooms!?    This is NOT a 5 star hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Speaks32 wrote a review Jun 2017,30,Could easily be a 5 star review.... but....,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Kenzi Club. This is my 9th time to Marrakech but my first to Kenzi...    First the Pros:    The hotel it's self is gorgeous lovely grounds and decor.    The rooms are cool and clean and are a good size.    The staff mostly are friendly and helpful.    The pool is lovely and divine to swim in and the sunbeds and umbrellas were comfy and available in the sun and the shade.    The food was varied and fresh. I'm not sure what the rotation is like if staying longer but was fine for a long weekend.    Taxis were easy to get (right outside) and our taxi guy was amazing (we used the same guy each night and he was reliable punctual and friendly.    Gorgeous surrounds and grounds.    The Cons:    The drinks is what let's this hotel down and dulled our experience. It's hard to get drinks and when you do finally get a drink you will be massively disappointed.    During the day there is only one bar to get drinks. 3-4 staff it is often 3-4 deep so you will be waiting. The drinks listed are soft drinks beers cocktails and coffee etc. In reality the cocktails are the same concoction of sugary mix with syrup added to make it Strawberry or lime. They are super sweet and make your teeth go on edge. Couldn't drink them. The beer ran out often!!!! You are served your drinks in small plastic cups. The same size as you swill your mouth out at the dentist. ""Tiny"" you can't get pint cups and they won't fill up bottles or cups that you might have brought with you.  No bottles of water available unless at lunch or dinner. Despite it being 43 degrees and several pregnant ladies requesting. Most you will find will ask for bottles of drink at lunch and stash in their rooms for during the day. There are water coolers round the pool the water gets warm quick and runs out often. The other down side is the amount of wasps around the bar!!! Hundreds. I am allergic to stings so after day 2 gave up going and simply had water from the cooler round the pool. It's such a faff and effort to make multiple trips to get tiny drinks you will simply give up and wait till lunch or dinner. It seemed to be the most common complaint. No ice creams or snacks like crisps available that many families were making trips to the super market for supplies. Which is a great shame. It was so hot but you literally felt like you were on rations. Tip would be to stash drinks from lunch and dinner in your room. You will need them. No ice buckets either so keeping drinks by the pool cold impossible.    You will need to pay a daily rate to use the safe. Which again is a pain.    You will also need to pay a deposit for the pool towels.    We arrived at 11am and our room wasn't ready till 2pm. In fact we managed to get in at 1pm so we were lucky. We had to change in the meantime in the toilet. We decided to kill the time by the pool. However couldn't get towels until we had checked in and had a room number. Which was also a pain.    Cocktails in the evening were also horrific. The same sugar mix plus shot of spirit in a small glass. We couldn't drink them. The wine available at dinner was ok. In 4 days all inclusive we had 4 drinks. We went out for drinks to another hotel on Saturday and into the souks to get a decent mojito.    The hotel could easily address this issue and gain itself a 4/5 star review. The drinks situation as it is and the level of discontent from holiday makers around the pool would likely put me off returning. Though if this was sorted I would return in a heartbeat.    I am booked to return to Marrakech in October and currently not planning to stay at Kenzi club.    Please sort it out.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Luxuryforlife wrote a review Jun 2017,20,"A 3* resort, don't expect 5*",I have just today returned from a 3 night stay. Firstly we booked a transfer through the hotel but arrived at the airport to find that they had forgotten and simply told us to just book a cab.  We booked a 2 bedroom suite through last minute.com but arrived to be told they don't actually have a 2 bedroom suite what they were putting us in was family room which consisted of a double bed in a bedroom plus a living room with what can only be described as window seats which they would like one of us to sleep on. We insisted that this simply wasn't an option and after a full day of battling them they finally compromised with us and put a single bed in the living room which wasn't ideal but we didn't have it in us to battle any longer and just wanted a room.    The dining is not great flies EVERYWHERE! All over the food and birds flying around the dining room! I witnessed a bird land on the bread whilst I was there.    But the worst part is the pool bar! Shocking service really awful drinks the cocktails are a joke! And wasps are a major issue the hygiene is just terrible.    I would not recommend this hotel unfortunately I would prefer to pay just that little bit more and have a better experience for my short break.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bushey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luxuryforlife
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Anthony M wrote a review Jun 2017,40,Kenzi Club Agdal Medina 03/06/2017-10/06/2017,Reception/welcoming: We received a warm welcom (literally)...around 30°C...coming into the airconditioned lobby was very nice. Immediately we were served with a fresh alcohol free mojito which was very pleasant. During our check-in we were informed of the fact that we were given an upgrade to the adult-only area (Riad Roserie).    Room: We had room with number 440. The room was of a decent size containing a bath tub shower small terrace a double bed etc...Everything you could expect of a normal 5 star hotel. The room was clean and pleasant. The bed itself was of good quality but not excellent. The matress was one with springs in it no ''pits'' were found in the matress indicating it was relatively new. Also the room was provided with a good air conditioning system and the curtains were good to block out the light resulting in a good night's rest.    Swimming pool of adult only area: The swimming pool was nice and warm (around 30° C to my estimation) contained fresh water (not salt water). The size was about 4 meters on 30 meters and had a dept of 1m50. Within the pool there were 2 places were the water was around knee deep so you could sit in it and tan while enjoying the cool of the water. The seats and beds beside the pool were never all taken (although people tried to put their towels there quite early). Parasols were present if you wanted one. The people were respecting the calm and serenity of the adult only area. If someone made too much noise the security guard (who was present 24/7) came and explained that the calmliness of the area was to be respected. During our stay of 03/06/2017 and 10/06/2017 a lady named Aisha was present in the adult only area. She was the one who served drinks to everybody at the pool together with her colleague of security they did an excellent job in keeping the guests content. Special thanks go to both of them.    The regular swimming area was quite crowded and the people of the bar were quite occupied. No proper review could be given by us about them since we did no go there often.    Food: All in all the food was good. The typical morroccon dishes were very good. The pizzas fries and pastas were of a less quality to my personal opinion. But taste differs from person to person. The buffet was too limited for people staying over a week. Although the taste was good the variety was too limited. On the fish themed evening there was also too few choice for meat lovers. Since I don't like fish it was a disappointing evening.  The food in the morroccon restaurant was nice and the side animation of the singer was good however sometimes a break would have been nice to have a good converation.    Cocktails and Drinks: The cocktails with alcohol from the bar in the evening were not so good. It tasted like syrop with alcohol and was far from being a nice cocktail. I did not even try another one due to the poor quality. The alcohol free mojito however was splendid with fresh mint and lime it was really good. Also we drank a lot of hot mint tea to cope with the heat. The tea was also of very good quality and contained fresh mint.    Excursion: We only did a camel ride. It came down to 25 EUR / 250 Morroccon diram. Normally the ride should have taken 90 minutes as said in the brochure. In reality it only lasted 45 minutes. It was fun but overprized. The guides however were friendly and willing to take photos.    Overall the stay was good and we were able to relax. Special thanks go to Mrs.Aisha and the security guard in our Riad during our stay.,Date of stay: June 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E4767DNanthonym

Initially the water was replaced but after the 2nd night this was not replenished which was a pain.    Cleanliness - the cleanliness of the hotel it's self was fine couldn't really fault that.

All the staff spoke very good English including the animation team on a one to one basis but for the evening entertainment they hardly translated what was going on. Every night the animation team did some lovely dancing. We had a couple of problems with our room but the maintenance team repaired quickly. the food was very good. My husband went out on a day trip arranged by the excursions team. I telephoned the reception to find out what time I might expect him home but the receptionist was adamant that there had been no excursions booked that day even I though I had waved him off. I found this very worrying. the day before we were due to go home I went to reception to find out what time our transfer was due. The receptionist telephoned for me and wrote it on my transfer document. It said our transfer was due at 8.45 we were up early enough to go and have breakfast before left. Just as we were about to leave the telephone rang and it was the receptionist saying our transfer was waiting in reception. When we went to reception we were then told we had to pay tax. We had not been told of this we paid the money which was lucky we had money as being all inclusive we had not taken much money. By the time we had paid the receptionist and gone outside the transfer had left. We went back to the reception but the receptionist said we had been told the wrong time even though we had it written down. He couldn't help as the office did not open until 9.00 and his only advise was to get a taxi.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ann31-11

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,PHE22 wrote a review May 2017,30,Dissapointed,I was expecting much better.  1. The housekeeping was poor even after complaining to Reception about lack of toilet paper and towels only towels arrived and outside their promised half hour. However after a complaint to management later that evening standard improved for rest of holiday.  2. The balcony on our room was unusable in hot weather as there was no form of shade.  3. Breakfast was very repetitious and not kept topped up. Only two varieties of Yoghurt for example and the same each day. Coffee was impossible to obtain in the mornings on every day but one we had to accost a member of staff to obtain the pot. Its quality was varied as was the temperature (this could be explained by the fact I noticed on the last day the staff were filling up flasks with the left over from flasks returned from tables half used)  4. Lunch: Would have been nice to have more cold meats in order to have a light salad lunch (The actual salad selection was exceptionally good).  5. Dinner: Pork joint was undercooked to a point of being risky other nights by 8:30 there was only chicken left (problem as my wife does not eat poultry) as she said the hotel was making her a vegetarian. Most of the cuts were extremely poor and meant considerable waste. The speciality restaurant was a joke looked great but only offered two menu options (the same two throughout our stay). Both options had the same chicken main course always seemed empty I wonder why.  6. Drink service away from the dining room was unavailable so had to go to the bar. The drinks themselves were of poor quality I even picked up the bottle of whisky from behind the bar to look at its strength (25 instead of standard 40).  7. There is a policy about leaving towels on lounges around the pool even in the privilege rooms that has attendance from early hours it is not policed or enforced.  8. In the long walk from the privilege rooms the overhanging trees are not trimmed and I was constantly hitting my face on them. Even worse when taking bags to rooms as you face backwards in their carts.  9. Good shuttle bus to centre of city.  10. The snack bar/pool bar was infested with wasps some sort of pest control needs to take place.  11. I believe the main problem is over egging the hotel. If you advertise 5 stars you expect 5 stars. The hotel was more like a 3 star.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PHE22

Airport has had a major refurb which made our return journey a lot more pleasant!  Staff all fabulous as always although a new bar manager seemed very aggressive towards some of the bar staff and felt the need to point and shout in front of guests which I thought was unprofessional.  Restaurant and bar staff always very helpful and for a small tip will treat you very well.  Entertainment team superb as usual going out of their way so you enjoy your stay. A couple of new additions to the team who are doing a great job! Magic and Spider you are amazing!  Food as usual was of a high standard salads are beautiful.

We did see quite a few cockroaches this time but I guess when it's 40 degrees you can't expect anything else!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Maverick300 wrote a review May 2017,30,Ok but not a 5 star resort,If this resort was say a 3 star then I think that you would probably be happy. However as it's claiming to be a 5 star I have to say I can only rate it as ok at a push.    Check in was a very long drawn out affair and after being up since the early hours and travelling we just wanted to get to our room and relax. When we finally did the guy who took our luggage was somewhat unimpressed that we couldn't tip him as we only had large notes having just arrived into the country. He even said he had change! Not the best of starts so far!    The room was ok but again far short of what you'd expect from a 5 star resort. For example the paintwork was very shabby in places and there wasn't any coffee/tea making facilities or robe/slippers. The bed however was lovely and comfortable and huge!    The safe in the room didn't work and after speaking to reception they said somebody would look at it but this didn't materialise. Incidentally there is a daily charge for the safe which brings me onto the subject of pool towels where you have to leave a deposit of 150 dhrm's per person. Odd I think for a supposed 5 star resort.    There is one main buffet restaurant and one a la carte restaurant if you want to pay out of your A/I package. Food in the buffet restaurant was just about ok but repetitive and limited choice. There are 2 bars - one by the pool and a bar that opens in the evening. Somebody else mentioned it too but there are lots of bees at the poolside bar which can be off putting.    There are two good sized pools with a fair amount of sun loungers but I suspect not enough for the total number of guests as these got taken pretty quickly leaving not much choice. Entertainment and music by the pools was excessively loud and went on through most of the day. Not ideal if you wanted a nice relaxing sunbathe by the pool.    Staff at the hotel were ok but I'm afraid nothing more. Again for a supposedly 5 star resort no where near that level. Having said our housekeepers were excellent and our room was spotless and made up nicely each day.    In summary if you're expecting this to be a truly 5 star resort then you'll be disappointed as it falls well short however for a cheap A/I break that would be around a 3 star resort then this is it.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,West Sussex,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maverick300

Certain items are cooked and then left under heat lamps to keep warm and cook further. The problem is that as the dining hall is so busy people take food before it is fully cooked / the chef didn't cook it well enough in the first place and then get ill. Chicken kebabs for example. Food is very Mediterranean not traditional Moroccan which i was hoping for. I would say 90% French occupation at this resort.

Good points    We never had any trouble finding free sun loungers as there were always a few available.The weather was lovely. It averaged around 32 degrees for our stay which was perfect.    The bar staff were great to us. Having said that we did tip them quite heavily the first couple of days we were there this may have contributed to them always seeing us first and making our drinks very quickly. The alcohol was watered down somewhat but this is remedied by drinking twice as much.    The Spa was great if a little on the steep side price wise expect to pay UK prices for massages or any treatments. The heated spa pool was 100 Dirhams to use per day which was nice to do for one day instead of being by the pool outside.    Animation team were brilliant constant entertainment catering to children and young people. They also put on Tennis table tennis and some exercise classes for the adults which was much appreciated.    Room was clean and simple although like I said earlier it wasn't the standard of a 5 star.    Bad Points    Buffet food. Oh god some the food was super carb orientated! If you don't eat meat you are a pigeon-holed for choice. Basically chips/plain cous-cous or a plain pizza. The breakfast was probably the best meal and the omelette bar is a great idea. Lunch is passable but by dinner you are a bit sick and tired of the same food again and again. They do open a snack bar in between meals and this is always busy. This is where they make crepes/donuts but expect a wait as kids usually want to take at least 5 more than they can eat. Even though it is all inclusive we were so sick of the food by day 2 we ordered domino's to the hotel and ate out the other days. This made the holiday a lot more expensive than we budgeted for which was a little annoying. If you like spicy food i recommend bringing some hot sauce with you.    Expect to be hounded by everyone and anyone for basically nothing. If you go to the markets and ask for directions the person giving them to you will expect to be given some money which is fine initially but can get really annoying. We just ignored them and carried on our way thanks to offline google maps! This is not really a fault of the hotel though......    Expensive. Everything is expensive. When i say expensive I mean things are usually the same price in the UK if not more and you do not get as much for your money. An example of this is chocolate in the hotel shop. A standard pack of malteaser's are about 4/5 quid! Another example is on the last day we asked for a late checkout which most hotels i have been to usually do for free but these guys wanted to charge 400 Dhirams just to stay for a few hours longer! This was per person! which is about 35 pounds. Generally speaking expect to pay for anything ""extra"". The hotel were kind enough to keep out luggage in a room and we could stay by the pool until we had to leave so which was at least something!    Overall its a nice enough hotel with decent amenities I would not call it a 3 star personally but i can see how it would be classed as one. I would say its more geared towards people with children rather than couples. I cannot fault the customer service we got as everyone was nice and polite to us but nowadays you would expect that from hotel staff. I would not come here again but that is not saying its horrible I just think I could get more in a similarity priced retreat say in Spain or Portugal.    In conclusion if you like super carby plain food negotiating a price for everything hot temperatures and watered down drinks this is the place for you.",Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesaP4995XE
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Paige0812 wrote a review May 2017,50,Great little holiday,Hotel is very nice and we'll kept around the grounds.  Food was ok not anything special and the themed country nights were also good for dinner. Breakfast was the usual fruits cereals pastries there was omelette made to order then fried and scrambled eggs. Weird sausages and no bacon which we thought was bizarre.  Drink were good also not a huge variety of cocktails so we all tended to drink the same 1 or 2 we liked.  Snack bar was crazy busy and ypu questions for so long and people are just greedy.  Plenty of sun loungers around the pool which was good.  The event show was very entertaining to watch every evening dancing to singing and all sorts.  Room cleaned very well too each day.  The shop on the complex needs more as there is no shop nearby and the shop in the complex is lacking a lot of stuff just general stuff and gifts but it needs so much more.,Date of stay: May 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Harlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paige0812
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Seb-Fo wrote a review May 2017,40,Great family get away,We went here for a 10th birthday with the family and it was just right for the occasion. One of the staff members called Hasna helped us arrange a fabulous restaurant called Riad Dar Anika (definitely go)! she was really attentive and followed up to make sure we had a great time. The hotel was great at feeding you you never went hungry and the food was absolutely amazing!! Great variety of cuisine. They offered regular entertainment too whether it be aqua aerobics archery shooting table tennis belly dancing and more. The hotel rooms were basic but had good TV channels in the evening. Cons of the adult hotel would be the entertainment at night didn't start until 9pm which is quite late when you've been out all day in the sun (especially to put a towel on a sunbed early enough). Think upmarket Butlins in terms of entertainment harmless enough. Watching the amount of gluttony and small children eat donuts pancakes mountains of sugar fizzy drinks was rather distasteful. Children would have 10+ pancakes or donuts at a time and some of the adults weren't much better so a lot of waste...but that's not the hotel's fault. The local square market was awful and there were horrible aggressive henna ladies who forced you to pay £10+ for a rubbish tattoo that brought us all out in rashes don't go! Overall loved the hotel and would go again for sure.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seb-Fo
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,southbank10 wrote a review May 2017,20,Disappointed 😡,So the bad.    1. Bland and quite repatative food - lots of carbs.  2. Sun loungers ( perhaps unlucky but managed to find 5 of them)  3. Staff range from awful to excellent - which is a shame 😡  4. Room in block 4 - verging on very tired.  5. Check out was way too painful and sort of rude.  6. Staff at the all day bar - literally every drink was wrong - although I enjoyed the surprise.    Was the children's mini disco fun at night - of course. Was the sun hot yes was breakfast ok yes. Was the local wine drinkable yes.    Was the evening entertainment ok - yes.    Would I return - absolutely not would I really recommend no.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Shazzyb37 wrote a review Apr 2017,30,"Beautiful grounds & staff, some small improvements required",A group of 5 female adults have just returned from a 4 night break at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina we had a fabulous time but feel we need to mention the good and the bad points.  Lets start with the good -  Fantastic Grounds beautifully kept.  The staff in the restaurant were fabulous although we did tip each waiter on our first day (2 different waiters depending on time of day) we then were rewarded with their fabulous service and attention to our table.  Special thanks to Tariq our evening waiter and to Samir the evening restaurant manager.  The evening entertainment was fabulous especially the fire man.. Again the staff were brilliant getting everyone involved.  The all inclusive food was good and varied although the restaurant could get a bit hectic at times.  A very secure hotel with security guards everywhere.    The bad bits -  We booked through Voyage Prive and the way it was advertised was a quiet relaxing retreat. Upon arrival we were greeted with what looked like 'French Butlins'. Lots of children and loud music coming from the pool area. So we requested to upgrade after we discovered there was a separate smaller pool which was strict on noise levels.  Although there was meant to be pool service at this pool it was not often enough. We often had to get up and find a member of staff to obtain a drink and choice was limited.  Housekeeping - rooms were clean and tidy but seemed to be cleaned in a haphazard way. Towels in the morning bed being made in the afternoon.  Be careful to ensure that your meat is cooked before eating - one of our group got food poisoning after eating the chicken kebab. (she was the only one in our group who ate it) She was out of action for over 24 hours which was such a shame as we were only there for a limited amount of time.    I feel that with a few little improvements the hotel could be a fabulous one.  A great hotel for families but do not come here expecting a quiet small hotel unless you upgrade to the quiet end.,Date of stay: April 2017,,"Deal, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shazzyb37
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Elmocaroline wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Fantastic 2nd visit,This is the second time at the kenzi club agdal medina. We were again given a room upgrade and stayed in the privilege rooms. Again the staff at the hotel were friendly and very helpful. Food at the all inclusive buffet was extremely good. Lots of choice and unlike other people who have reviewed i always found the food to be of a good temperature. Lots of choices for desserts. The waiting staff were very good we had the same waiter every night and he would our table waiting and ready for us when we arrived complete with our wine and water. Entertainment wasn't the best but all the kiddies there seemed to enjoy it and its not something that I'm ever bothered by so wasn't too worried about it. The hotel was clean and our room was well looked after. We used the shuttle bus to the medina which was a good service.

The pool area is pleasant and the heated pool was nice even though in March we were enjoying 30 degree heat each day. The unheated pool was a bit chilly when coming down the slides. The room was clean and the house keeping kept the room clean although the patio door wasn't always locked properly. The reception staff were efficient but unbending from the rules of check out. The pool bar staff would favour some people over others when waiting for drinks.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Boorette wrote a review Apr 2017,30,A mixed bag,We have recently returned from a week at Kenzi Agdal two adults and two children. As it was the Easter holidays the resort was full but it didn't feel crowded. There are good and bad things that we experienced.    Positives:  Food - we found the food to be very good for an all inclusive. Always something for adults and kids to enjoy.  Animation team - wow these guys work hard and we never saw them anything less than 100% enthusiastic. Entertainment every nights and fitness classes throughout the day. They are especially good with the kids. In fact Morocco generally is so welcoming to children.  Gardens and Pool - the gardens are lovely and the pools themselves were kept really clean. Many of the tiles around the edge of the pool are chipped and my toddler very much enjoyed picking out all the loose pieces of grout! But I'd see the pool guys working each morning and they did do their best.    Now negatives:  Housekeeping - our room simply wasn't clean not at the start (dirt previous guest hair and crumbs in drawers and under desk/sink and behind bathroom door) and barely a day went by where we weren't missing water or towels. Our baby's cot was not made up with the rest of the room. Outside terrace was never cleaned. Pillows felt like they'd been stuffed with bundled up socks.  Room - nothing fancy bare necessities. Holes in curtains uncomfortable bedding and noisy AC.  Pool bar - I think they must have installed a bee hive under the bar. The bar is swarming with bees and if you're allergic to bee stings DO NOT stay at this hotel. Even away from the bar the bees will seek you out if you've got a drink or any food by your chair. First time I have ever been stung!  Bar staff - had a couple of problems with the bar staff. One guy would deliberately ignore me (he made it quite obvious) preferring to serve male guests and presumably those that had tipped him. Another would help himself by hand to the food that was put on for guests next to the pool bar. I always think it's a bad sign when staff are permitted to eat and drink among the guests but to simply stand by the guest buffet and pick food directly out of the dishes with your hands is another level all together. Couldn't believe it really.  Main restaurant - good food let down by poor service. I don't think there was a single occasion where we were able to sit down at a completely set table. Anything you requested would take an age to arrive. We had to get our own high chair (rarely cleaned during service) at every meal. Despite there being many children at the hotel there was never enough plastic beakers meaning the kids either didn't drink or you had to somehow enable them to drink out of a wine glass (not easy for either our 5 or 1 year old!).  Furniture around the hotel - it's all pretty shabby old and clearly not looked after as it is pretty dirty too.  Guest relations - I would have been quite happy to give all this feedback directly to the hotel but they don't offer a customer satisfaction questionnaire and when I visited the guest relations desk during the advertised hours nobody was there!!    Overall it wouldn't surprise me if this hotel closed down soon as there is clearly a lack of investment in facilities and some of the staff really don't appear to care about the guests. But kitchen and maintenance staff and the animation team are clearly working their socks off so for their sakes I hope management can turn things around.    Unfortunately we won't be going back.,Date of stay: April 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boorette

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Steve M wrote a review Apr 2017,50,Wow - this was a FANTASTIC hotel,Brilliant. Say no more.    If you want to know a bit more then...    The bad bits? Barely any -  - maybe the fact that you have to pay about £9 (April 17 rates) to use the sauna/steam room etc which wasn't that obvious at booking (via British Airways) in my own opinion.  - maybe the fact that the sunbeds were in short supply (and not remotely policed despite the signs everywhere).    But these are minor gripes.    The good bits so far outweigh the bad bits:  - The rooms are superb and spotless (we only had a standard room and it was excellent)  - There are sunbeds but also quite a few double-bed sunbeds some covered and some open to the elements. It's a fantastic idea which isn't that common to see.  - The bushes/flowers/plants are so pretty  - The evening entertainment was comfortably the best I've seen (and I'm 47 and well-travelled). It's different every night for 2 weeks..  - The food is pretty varied for an all-inclusive (the whole hotel is all-inclusive..). Not amazing but good.  - The drinks are plentiful and even the local wine is tasty.  - The kids: quite a few there but they were well behaved.  - The people who work there are so friendly (Ok one or two barmen took the p*** out of my French but I got used to it!!)  - The location : 10-15mins taxi from the airport. and 10-15 mins from the main square in the city.  - Even the shop was OK priced for souvenirs if you don't want to haggle in the souks. AND IT'S MUCH CHEAPER THAN THE AWFULLY-EXPENSIVE AIRPORT  - The staff speak English French Spanish and a whole swathe of Arabic dialects. No doubt they speak German & Dutch too but as I don't I can't swear to it!

We were ""upgraded"" to a room in riad 4 with the separate pool which we used every day as the bigger pools got so busy. The room was fine although the the tv hardly worked. Rang reception 3 times over 2 days for an iron each time being told one who be delivered right away then asked directly at reception then ended up asking housekeeping when they cleaned our room who produced on right away. it was nice to have drinks service by the pool. It was good walk to and from the restaurant but that was our only exercise whilst there! Had a massage at the spa which was good but the therapists were about 15 mins late with no apology and at the end they just left the room with us wondering if it had actually finished. All a bit bizarre. They'd booked us in for a couples massage after I asked for 2 massages at the same time. Never mind we just laughed.    Food was ok I don't think I'd have wanted to do all inclusive for much longer as it was all very much the same even though there were different theme nights. Tried to Moroccan restaurant one night which I don't think was worth the extra £10. The rose wine by the pool and at the Moroccan restaurant was nice but in the restaurant it was awful. We both had bad stomachs on a couple of mornings.    We had great weather whilst we stayed which helped. Was a good hotel choice if you just want to chill out for a few days.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,clacket75 wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Half good half bad,I'm so torn by this hotel. We've had a lovely week away in the sun. The rooms for a family of 4 are brilliant. Very spacious and comfortable. We stayed in a family suite in block 4 which has its own quiet pool which was lovely to sit at at the beginning/end of the day. The main pool area is great especially the water slides! However beware that at busy times it's hard to get decent positioned sunbeds as other guests bag them very early! Kids enjoyed the table tennis and basketball court.    So that's the positives... equally important as the room and pool to me is the dining. We don't usually go to all inclusive resorts and after this stay I doubt we ever will again. The food and drink is just not good enough. It's the way it's presented that's a problem. There's choice but it all just is a bit lacking in quality. Every plate I ate off (when I could find one) was chipped. I struggled to find glasses at every meal even next to the drinks machine. I had to argue with the waiting staff (in French) to get a bottle of water. We actually ate dinner outside of the resort three times during our stay as it was all a bit depressing. The 4pm snack is good but some fruit and ice pops on offer would have been nice. And I can't believe I'm saying this but the Moroccan mint tea was the worst I've tasted and I've been to Morocco five times! Revolting and sometimes served in a cup and saucer! If they can't get that right then it shows the problem!    Would I return? Definitely to Marrakech.

On arrival we were upgraded to a large corner room and the reception staff were their usual helpful selves. The waiting staff in the Restaurant were always attentive and do not expect a tip they thrive on polite and positive interaction. The animation team work tirelessly to entertain and put on 3 Shows in your time there all well choreographed and great fun. The weather was warm enough to sit outside in the evening. On our departure we had a problem with our transfer company and the staff at reception went above and beyond what I could have expected calling all sorts of numbers to try and get our pick up to the airport.(we eventualy took a Taxi only 200MAD). We will definitely be back again as it is always a pleasant experience.  The food over the week was again a good variety and my wife who is not a fish eater and can be slightly picky on what she eats always and a full plate and left satisfied. The Moroccan red wine is lovely and I would recommend it.

Great tasting wine at lunch and dinner and they leave the bottle for you. Bottled water always available.

A big thank you to the coolest guys Mohcine and Ayoub for all the fun activities (Dartz Mini-Golf Beach Volleyball Cycling in the pool table tennis and many others) and not letting us getting bored in such a Paradise. The entire team was very friendly and entertaining especially Sali who above all was great with kids too. The last but not the least the Spa centre is something you shouldn't miss. The girls will offer you an unforgettable massage with their magic hands.  I could keep on describing this Paradise with its marvellous gardens but the best thing is to try it yourself. I totally recommended for all types of ages.    John the Doctor!,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IonutzN5
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Christine E wrote a review Mar 2017,30,"Pack a pair of walking shoes, you'll need 'em!",Large sprawling complex. Don't leave anything behind in your room because it'll be a good schlep away from wherever you are. The room itself is spacious and clean. There was no bottle of wine on arrival (part of our offer) nor did it ever materialise. As we were all inclusive so the wine anyway was free it was no big deal but arriving at 10pm a bottle in the room would've been nice because - yes - the bar was a good schlep away. On the plus side all you need for a holiday is here - lovely grounds large pools comfortable loungers massages in the spa souvenir shop ATMs kids club nightly entertainment. The food is laid out in a bewildering buffet and trays are not provided so it can take some time to find what you want and bring it all to your table. They haven't a clue about making tea! The food itself is typical canteen fare and looks better than it tastes but is OK. The breakfast omelettes individually made are well worth the queuing. A little tipping at the start of your stay pays real dividends throughout the rest of it. All the staff are helpful and charming - as were all the Morrocans who acted as our guides when we ventured forth into the great outside world. Weather at the end of March very hot and sunny. Easily 30 degrees.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/85christinee
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Rafeyel wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Friendly Staff / Average Hotel,Stayed here for 4 days with 2 of my brothers we had a double room with a sofa bed that made that made the 3rd. Room was clean but no ironing board. The TV also hardly worked but luckily with only 4 days there there wasn't much time to watch TV. The overall compound is very well maintained and aesthetically gorgeous.    The food; in Atlas restuarant which is buffet style was varied and they tried to accommodate for everyone. The only issue is that it hardly changed from day to day and mostly remained on either end of the spectrum of bland or too salty however salt and pepper shakers are provided on tables to accommodate the bland aspect. The restuarant staff were brilliant and tentative. Always on hand to top up glasses or provide the bottle of your favourite beverage.    The nightly entertainment hosted by the animation team was always a treat and provided something to do as well as an insight into local entertainment. As part of the animation team I want to give a special mention to Sali who looked after my brothers and I and was always on hand to help us with everything; from learning local phrases to pointing us in the direction of the best clubs and restaurants to experience a real sense of Morroco. Thank you Sali you made our stay at Kenzi a very welcomed one.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafeyel

Biggest downside for us as adults was there is no separate place for just adults and kids in the evening. The bar lounge in the evening is like a Butlins resort with kids jumping up and down with their entertainment.  Restaurant food plentiful and lots of choice. Wanted a coke and there were no glasses asked the waiter and he said find one on a table.

We used a taxi at the airport which was 250 morrocon currency. That was for 6 people and bags.  We got currency at the airport but I wouldn't do that again. It's easier to get it at Gatwick.  The hotel had a lovely feel to it. Very spacious and the rooms are lovely.  Food was plentiful and the drinks are of good quality.  The doughnuts were a dream but not good for the waistline!  The pool was lovely and warm even if the weather wasn't great in the mornings so for early March take a cardigan.  There was lots to do for kids and adult only groups so it appeals to everyone.  There were loads of sun beds and even though it was low season I think there would still be plenty of beds.  They had football and table tennis on offer and lots of activities.  We didn't use the spa but they had lots of treatments and it looked very tranquil.

Food- was OK. Everyday we could find something for out taste. Freshly squeezed orange juice was the best part of my breakfasts!! Pools- cleanand not so busy. One heated and large one with water slides-lots of fun! There were 2 others pools which we did not used. Animation team delivered entertainment during the day and night which was good fun!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lnicholson94 wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Nice holiday but definitely not 5*,"We enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Kenzi club but this hotel definitely should not be sold as a 5* hotel. It is 4* at absolute best.    The food in the all inclusive was ok but fairly bland. And it gets very very busy with lots of kids running around and dropping things. Service was very poor at mealtimes and we weren't able to get a drink other than the bottle of water on every table because we couldn't get anyone's attention and nobody came over to check on us.    The bar was very poor a massive room full of empty space. All entertainment was on the other side of the complex and so the bar did not provide a relaxing evening environment perhaps with music or something of that sort.    The pool bar was very good and the heated pool is excellent. The grounds and rooms were very clean and well looked after. Also very comfortable. Although housekeeping did ""forget"" to give us towels every single day when the room was serviced.    Overall it was a pleasant enough trip which ticked standard boxes for a february short break. The hotel is well located and has very nice views of the mountains. It is also extremely easy to get into the city and there are a number of good tours.

The room was amazing & the staff kept leaving me wine pastries & fresh flowers in the lounge!  Even though the pools weren't heated I didn't mind as I'm happy swimming in freezing water and had the main pool to myself every day. I'm guessing the pools would be fab in season when it's warmer! They were clean & beautiful. The spa was great & I had several massages a facial & made use of the indoor pool.  The food was delicious & plentiful.  The staff were incredibly friendly & helpful.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jorna B wrote a review Mar 2017,30,The reception killed it,Seriously was going to give this hotel a faultless 5* rating everything was nearly perfect lovely room lovely facilities etc. The reception was annoying from the start because there were just not enough people working there I think the longest I waited was 25 minutes... which was ridiculous! They really don't provide anything you can buy what you need in a little shop don't forget to take toothpaste £3.50 for a sample size one... free bottle of wine that was on our package that never came until the last day even though we asked for it everyday from the first of 4 nights. The biggest issue I had was at check out... the ladies at reception are all lovely but it was a man that checked us out. This particular guy was short and asked for us to pay for our room charges and the city tax I didn't have enough money so I asked if I could change some currency the man said no £1= to 10 dirhams I said no (i exchanged money the day before so i knew that wasn't right) but then another taller gentleman came over they proceeded to speak to eachother in Arabic and laugh about it all (really rude by the way) I ended up just giving in and just giving the extra £3 for the 28 I needed.. I was so embarrassed! I wouldn't have cared for such little money but his attitude was disgusting.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jornab2014
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mr M. wrote a review Mar 2017,30,"Ok, did the job",Stayed here in February 2017. Weather was a decent 20 degrees in the afternoon but chilly in the mornings and evening.    The hotel is large and spacious but lacks the amenities to make you feel comfortable.    The food hall is one big room it gets very busy and chaotic and you will sometimes be waiting around. The food is tasteless and bland and never above a luke warm. Definitely not 5* quality. Tip: use the microwave to heat it up.    The bar is dreadful dingy cold and uninviting. That said outdoor is lovely lots of tables and chairs.    The pool is good two good sizes and one is heated. Lots of activities onsite that you can book up to.    Service is good we needed to move room and they were very accommodating.    Walking distance to a small shopping mall and a short taxi ride to the centre and they also provide a free shuttle but you need to book your space the day before.    Overall a good hotel that you get what you pay for it is misleading to call it a 5* let down by poor food uncomfortable bed and less than inviting bar and restaurant. I'd say more 3*. Good for a base to explore the area or a couple of days cheap get away.,Date of stay: March 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mph284
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,mintcream wrote a review Mar 2017,30,3* hotel advertised as 5*,Stayed here for 4 nights and unfortunately not a great place.    Firstly we were given a ridiculous room (4 single beds!) for a couple beds were incredibly uncomfortable very hard and the sink and bath was blocked. The next morning I Informed the staff of the issues and was asked to return back at 2pm and request a new room. Came back at 2pm and was made to wait in queues of people waiting to check-in after 25 mins in the queue we were given a new room then waited 20 mins in our old room to be transferred into the new one by a member of staff. All in all about an hour of my holiday wasted trying to sort out a room.    Second room was okay will had a blocked bath plug hole but the bed was a double and marginally better than the first.    Unfortunately it wasn't a good start and didn't get much better.    The food served in the hotel is average there is a huge selection but it is mostly tasteless. And worst still the food is freezing cold. I booked into the paid-for restaurant for one evening whilst again the food wasn't great the service and atmosphere was incredible and made up for the extra we had to pay. Side note: we were informed at reception that we had to book a day in advance for this restaurant so they could order the food stock; I noticed that we were served some beef kebabs that were served in the main all-inclusive restaurant the same day. Bit annoying considering I was paying extra. But as mentioned above service and atmosphere made up for it.    Next up - the bar. Horrendous!! The styling is like an airport waiting room and the TV screens are the size of my iPad. Also there is no wifi available in the bar. Very poor.    Spa - very nice and service was good. The Hammam in particular was amazing. Though there as a charg for the gym and the gum is not good. Very basic with old machinery. The gym should be included in the higher charge for it is not special and frustrating you have to pay more.    This is strictly a 3* star hotel if you exp car anything more than this then you should book elsewhere.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mintcream

Very clean attentive Staff and will return.    Upon arrival it was lunch time so we checked in and the went for lunch and returned after and was taken to our room. The room is very spacious with a 7ft bed and was clean and kept clean every day. The staff don't stop cleaning the place to be fair.    In regards to the food there is plenty of choice and regularly topped up and freshened up. Some people have suggest cold but not something I would say I found it fine. The quality of drink is good if you have wine ever or soft drink you will not have an issue.    The entertainment team keep you entertained during day and night but are not pushy at all which was refreshing because in other hotels I find the team relentless but this team is great and very good. Magic is a great guy as is the whole team. The evening bar staff are very attentive and friendly especially Mohammad who waited on us every night.    You will not go wrong staying here and the people who moan about this place have issues that they need to address the self nothing wrong with this hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,John Charles C wrote a review Feb 2017,50,"Terrific ""all-inclusive"" hotel for a family visit to Morocco.","My wife daughter and myself had a wonderful week in Marrakesh staying at this hotel. Our room was very nice and very clean. It was spacious with air conditioning and heat a modern bathroom television unobtrusive daily housekeeping a nice desk and good closet space.    The grounds are beautiful and well kept. The hotel is actually a campus of smaller buildings for rooms and for facilities like the spa. (BTW book ahead for the spa as slots for the various services fill up.)    There is quite a bit of security and we found it a completely safe environment.    There are multiple pools both heated and unheated. We never had a problem getting loungers or found the pools too crowded. There is a poolside ""bar"" for sodas lattes beer drinks etc. and limited poolside food.    The food is more than ample with lots to choose from. For an ""all-inclusive"" resort it was very good. You choose your own food in a large pleasant room and then sit where you like. From custom made omlettes to children's fare to daily tangines to freshly fried donuts to incredible fruits and vegetables there are choices to please anyone. The servers were pleasant and efficient. Tip: if you find one that is particularly good sit in that section of the dining hall regularly to get more personalised service. We'd also recommend paying a very reasonable fee at least once and dining in L'Orangerie an intimate and elegant candle-lit restaurant on the hotel grounds with two excellent traditional Moroccan menus live music and attentive service. You need to book in advance at the reception desk.    The hotel has a regular shuttle to an entrance to the Medina the old city. Cabs are around $7 to the Medina or the new city. We had a licensed guide take us around the Medina which is a hectic maze of crowded streets and alleys. We hired him at the entrance to the hotel and were glad we did.    We also took a guided day long tour to the ""mid-desert"" and the snow-capped Atlas Mountains. Our guide Khalid Amor was phenomenal! Strongly recommend Marrakesh-Best-tours.com.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LadiTala wrote a review Feb 2017,50,AMAZING,From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were greeted by friendly hardworking and helpful staff.    The hotel looks amazing. Where ever you walk there are things to see and all well maintained. Lots of art and lovely decorations around the gardens.    NOTE: the exchange rate at the hotel was VERY GOOD. Much cheaper than the airport (UK & Marrakech) and banks in the town. My advise would be to have enough for the taxi there and then change money there.    GETTING TO:    We got a taxi from the airport for 250DHS which was a lot as on the way back it cost us 150!    ARRIVAL:    Check in is at 2 and lunch finishes by 3 so when we arrived after a delayed flight the ladies at reception quickly noticed our sad faces and gave us our bands took our luggage sent us to eat lunch before going back to check in.  Check in was quick and easy and they then took us to our rooms.    ROOMS:    We were in 2 duplex double bedrooms. Very spacious with private balcony desk sofa TV bathroom.    They provide towels and spare duvets if needed. They leave bottled water in the rooms daily with fruit and some sweets. There is also a mini fridge which you can fill up if you go shopping.    The TV only had 2 English speaking channels but that was not a problem at all as there is so much to do in the hotel we were only ever in our rooms to sleep!    I had read reviews that they don't change the beds daily but if you pay attention there is a note identifying the hotel as environmentally friendly so unless your towels are on the floor and you request bed changes they wont for 3-4 days but still clean the bathrooms make beds and provide water and fruits etc. I think this is great!    Wifi is advertised for most communal areas but we were lucky and picked up a good signal in our rooms.    FOOD:    Its true what some people have wrote about the food being similar every day but there was always at least one new thing to try. We found going earlier the food was better. None the less it was ok and plenty to choose from.    Breakfast 6:30-10:00: standard breakfast items. They had these special eggs and tomato thing... which was lovely with fresh Moroccan tea and squeezed orange juice.    Lunch: 12:30-3    Snack: 10-11 & 4-5:30. pool bar snacks are lovely. Moroccan doughnuts pancakes cakes and pizza.    Dinner: 7-10    POOLS: 3 outside and one inside.  - 2 are for kids really  - 1 is heated but as it was still a little cold in Feb we chose to use the indoor spa pool for 100DHS per day. It was AMAZING! It was heated and quiet.    Plenty of seats and beds around the pools for sun bathing which was lovely.    OTHER ACTIVITIES:    So much to do!  Basketball archery volleyball table tennis pool mini arcade mini farm bowling and classes by the pool. There is also a gym but we didn't use this.    There are also evening events but we were out most of the night so didnt see this.    Lots for the kids too and the staff working with kids were so active we couldn't stop hearing the kids laugh out loud which is lovely.    SHUTTLE BUS:    The only thing i would change about the hotel is the frequency of the free shuttle bus to the market.  NOTE: you have to book times the day before but ask as they may have availabilities on the day. The taxi is not too expensive so this is not a big deal.    CHECKOUT:    AMAZING!!!! We were so pleasantly surprised to find that even after checkout at 12 we could leave our bags in reception somewhere safe and continue to use the hotel facilities for free!!!! So after checkout at 12 we spent the rest of the day sun bathing and enjoying the pools. There is a cloakroom with towels in the showers so we were able to take a shower before leaving 6. WONDERFUL STAY. Will definitely visit again.    ADDITIONAL:    You can book a Desert Safari Tour in the hotel. THIS WAS A LOVELY OPPORTUNITY. It was cheaper and more secure compared to the ones we saw advertised in the market. They also have insurance if anything goes wrong.    We left at 3 on a mini bus. On arrival we were welcomed into a beautifully decorated seating area where we were give tea. We then went on a long quad bike ride which was great!!! The leader was fantastic and looked after everyone including his staff who were all very friendly. As he didnt want us to wait for the camels he sent us on a ride in the 4x4 which allowed us to take some lovely pictures. We then experienced a camel ride before going into a beautiful tent to eat a DELICIOUS 3 course meal (beautifully cooked and presented) followed by singing dancing shisha and henna. All for 750DHS.    OVERALL: definitely recommend this place paid £100 pp for 3 days - 100% worth it.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,David wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Quiet hotel away from the hustle and bustle.,This large hotel is is away from the city and the medina used mainly by mainly French tourists. It is very private and feels safe and is also very well managed. It is comprised of separate blocks each designed like a Riad and each with a quadrangle open to the sky with rooms on two floors surrounding the centre which is either a private pool or a private garden.  We had a superior room which was in a riad with a private pool with sun loungers and beds. There was a drinks service at the pool but we found that we would have to upgrade further to have snacks and decided not to. The lady who was on pool service at our Road was an elegant Moroccan lady in traditional clothing and she was very proper respectful and helpful at all times.  The dining hall was the size of a sports hall and we had to time our entry to avoid busy times. There was a huge buffet area which was well stocked and the food was of a good quality overall. The waiters were attentive once you got know them but they were rushed off their feet.  We used our private pool all the time avoiding the huge public pool and the children' areas.  Evening entertainment was ok those involved doing everything they could to be as professional as they could.  There is no point 'going for a walk' outside the hotel. It is just too far out. But there are free shuttle minibuses from the hotel to and from the Medina. (the old city)  We also went on a daytrip to the waterfalls at Ouzoud which was a great way to see some countryside and we enjoyed the day very much but the walk down into and up from the valley is quite demanding.  A good holiday overall but not the best location to just 'walk into the Medina'.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmb126

The staff were incredibly friendly and always made us feel good and welcome despite being the minority in the Berber/Arabic/French speaking nation.  One of the waiters Moncef looked out for us daily and looked after all of our needs always smiling and helpful even inviting us to his home.  We made excursions to the Medina/Souk/Monuments and the High Atlas mountains during our 4 nights stay and a Hamman steam/sauna/massage on the actual day of our Anniversary which was incredible.  During our excursion to the Medina we visited the Argan Oil suppliers and inadvertently purchased bottles with Jasmin that exceeded the 150ml hand baggage allowance and was confiscated at the airport which was a shame. We had bought the smallest size available which bore no actual size information but was airport security assured us too large. Totally our fault but something to consider if you only have hand luggage.  We will be going back again as we thought the entire nation was exciting and beautiful and the people were magnificent and friendly beyond belief.,,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilClarke17

Food was average - luke warm and doesn't change a lot. The snack bar is unclean and the drinks are definitely watered down.  Resort itself caters for French and African/Middle Eastern visitors which is fair enough but if you're a Brit then you may get frustrated with the lack of attention and friendliness - staff pretending not to speak English for example!  Marrakesh is surreal but well worth visiting- we took a private guide Youssef Kharroub for a mornings walking tour of the souk - fascinating and a real eye-opener - very informative and we learnt a massive amount.  Also went on a horse carriage tour of Marrakesh with a rooftop BBQ courtesy of Safari Tours - interesting bit too cold and not worth the money!  Generally a good break made by the weather and the walking tour of Marrakesh but let down by the resort and staff.,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Halifax, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Huwbie50
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Justin J wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Great value,You will not find friendlier staff . I'm not a fan of buffet food but the food in this hotel was very good. The pool area was top draw and very clean. It was rated a 5 start but was more like 4 and thats what we'd payed . The only fault would be the rooms were a bit dated and beds and pillows were hard,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swansea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/785justinj

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Talib K wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Best Holiday experience,We arrived end on Jan 2017 it arrived at the airport come out and were met with our rep. Near the big board with my name on it  He offered our party of 6 bottle of water which I thought was very good of him as we all were thirsty thank you we were ascorted to a big suburban vehicle load our stuff and arrived at the hotel on 15 mins  Filled the arrive forms and had requested room close by we had indeed been give room close by lovely ride on an electric car to our block it's a good idea to tip a little to all providing you some service it makes them happy and you.  It was around 7.00pm when we arrive was around 17c (mid day temp around 21c )  Perfect for walking as we were there 4 nights we went to the club bar every night and then to the show by the animation team very good we went to town first day to the old square and the second day to the new part  It was easy to get in town with the shuttle bus then walked it in the direction in the map provided by Rep copies available from reception  Third day we booked with Rep the spa hammam after noon 3 hour in total great as we all had the works  Fourth day we we did the packing went to lobby at 11:30 checked out and left luggage there and chilled rest of the day till transfer to airport at 4.00 pm  Remember to go to check in desk to get a stamp on your boarding printout card as they will not let you in for departures.  We liked the people of morocco they were hospitable and helpful  We will come again to this hotel in the near future as it's also value for money too,Date of stay: February 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalibK4

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LouC87 wrote a review Feb 2017,20,Very Basic / Cats Everywhere,Advertised as a 5* holiday it was barley a 3*  The food was below average Cats were roaming Everywhere and there were birds flying round inside the restaurant.    As soon as we spoke to the staff in English their attitude became more unpleasant. Most of the other guests were French and they all seemed to be able to communicate and be respected so I wouldn't bother going here unless you are able to able to speak Arabic or French.    There was no plugs near the mirrors so don't bother with hair straighteners. the walls were incredibly thin and every night became restless as the beds were overly comfy and people walking past woke everyone up.    The hotel was basic and not all inclusive - you were expected to tip everyone and pay for gym/spa pool etc. the times of things opening and closing such as the bar/lunch etc were never right so we didn't get breakfast on our last day even though it 'opened at 6.30' and we were there at 6.45am.    The shuttle only runs about 10 times a day It's a 10 minute journey so there's no reason they shouldn't do this on a constant basis as it was full every time we were on it so i assume people were missing out on a trip and an hour is a long time to wait for the next one.    Marrackech itself is awful. Souks were full of thieves and people who think they deserve money for standing in front of you. Absolutely horrible experience.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouC87
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sibinsanks wrote a review Feb 2017,50,Delightful Stay,"My wife and I just returned from this property after 5 night stay. It was amazing! We didn't know what to expect as this was a last minute plan and we just booked it to go somewhere warm. It was beyond our expectation. The hotel is immaculate with outstanding staff members. We wondered how they can keep up the class especially when we didn't pay a lot of money to stay there. Room was cleaned everyday with attention to detail. Restaurants were clean and food enough to keep you going for days. Apart from the restaurants and bars they also have a night club on site. Daily shuttle service to town is useful in Marrakech. We went to the city only once and used a guide there to help us out but that quickly turned into a mistake as the guide was into making money and wanted us to visit the places he liked not the places where we wanted. So my advice is not to take any guide its easy to navigate your way around as you can see the ""Minar"" where you will be dropped off and picked up from from everywhere in Marrakech.    Originally we booked a room on the ground floor but when we asked for a room with balcony they organised this with out a fuss with in minutes. And boy I must tell you the room that we got was exceptional. A room with a view of the Atlas Mountain was a beauty to wake up in the morning to.    I would also highly recommend the desert safari package. I used the guy on site ""Marrakech Desert Safari and Tours"" very nice and polite guy and gave us a good price (always ask for a deal in Marrakech) for the full package. It was a wonderful experience.    Overall a great experience and we will be going back.",Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Portsmouth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sibinsanks
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,John W wrote a review Feb 2017,40,Holiday,he  Have to say the hotel was lovely and clean the staff were friendly and helpful. Yes the main language is French but I don't find that of any particular problem as soon as you say you are English they attempt the language and do very well.  The food could do with a little more variety and could be hotter but there is a microwave oven situated by the crepe\waffle section but there was always something to eat the service received in the pool bar and the main bar was really good and they do try to remember what you are drinking.  One particular member of staff that made our stay really lovely was the waiter Moncef Amazzal he was a very sweet and friendly and attentive chap with a great sense of humour but also a fabulous disposition so a big Thankyou to him.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnwE5351DF
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ash J wrote a review Feb 2017,50,I can't understand any bad reviews. This hotel is lovely!,We have just arrived back from an amazing 7 nights at Kenzi club agdal medina.  The hotel was immaculate. Cleaners always busy. Gardeners busy. And it shows. Everything is very well looked after. Clean and tidy. Nice decor. Nice grounds. There's not a single thing that I thought could be improved really.  Reception.  When you you walk in the first thing that hits you is the smell! It's amazing! Essential oil burners on the go constantly.  We checked in no problem. The room wasn't ready until around 1.30 but were given our wrist bands so that we could go and have lunch in the restaurant. When we came back to get our room we had no problems. So maybe people moan when they have to wait at busy times. Personally I found reception to be very helpful.  Pool.  Really nice to have a large outside heated pool. Too cold to use the larger pool in January but it didn't matter. The sunloungers are really comfortable. Luxurious and great quality. Massive double bed loungers were great. Plenty of cushions for extra comfort. Snack bar open at certain times when restaurant was closed. Freshly cooked doughnuts. Mmmmm.  Pool side bar.  Friendly staff who really work hard and do a great job. Only thing that I could complain about is wasps! Too many feeding from the drinks dispenser. Maybe a wasp trap or fake nest would help keep them away?  Restaurant  Food was great. Sometimes a bit the same but there's always something you will find that's tasty. I was very impressed. Wine was ok. Beer was really good. Mint tea not to be missed. Staff were excellent and made you feel most welcome.  Room.  Our room was really nice but what made it extra special was the cleaner. She did an excellent job. She always left our bed decorated after she had been. Rose petals and origami swans made from sheets etc were a nice touch. We really felt special.  Shuttle bus to Marrakech.  A good service and free. Runs every half hour.  Marrakech  I've read bad reviews. What you have to appreciate is there are many people who are homeless in poverty nothing to eat ect. So for them it's survival. So expect to get harassed for money. If roles were reversed then I'm sure you would do the same. Keep your wits about you.  Don't encourage the monkey men it's actually illegal for them to own one plus it's exploitation. Same for the snake charmers.  Expect stray cats and dogs. Donkeys and horses everywhere. You're entering a third world country. It's not Spain. Be prepared.  Hammam.  I had a good scrub down and massage after with my girlfriend. A great experience. Felt good afterwards. You must try this!  Atlas mountains.  Lovely. But spoilt by all the people living on them! Still well worth a visit though.  In summary Marrakech is an amazing place not for the faint hearted but I'm definitely going back again this year! I loved it. The hotel is really really good. Well done Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. 5 stars!!!,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82ashj
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sugarandspice2 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Luxury at a budget price,"Loved every minute of our 3 weeks all inclusive at the Kenzi Agdal hotel . On arrival at reception we were warmly welcomed by the pleasant staff with tea & once we'd filled in the registration forms we received 2 key cards & our bracelets and the porter took us & our luggage in a buggy through the gardens to our room .    THE ROOMS  The rooms are laid out in "" Riads"" around courtyards . Each has a patio or terrace with shrubs & plenty of greenery . I felt like we were looking over the Kasbah walls from our terrace ( see photo ). The gardens are well maintained & there are orange  banana olive trees  bamboo  cacti  colourful flowers & so many happy birds singing .  Our room had comfortable twin beds pushed together  an armchair  sofa bed  desk ( with writing paper) coffee table  reading lights over the bed  tv with 31 channels  fridge  air conditioning  large wardrobe with a safe ( 3 dirhams per day).  The bathroom had a bidet  shower above the bath  hairdryer  soap  shampoo  shower gel & a box of facial tissues . Plenty of hot water .

The kitchen & restaurant staff are absolutely amazing  professional but also charming & funny . Everyone was wonderful but I must mention Hachacha & Chef Ali who really stood out as highly professional & made our holiday something very special indeed .    SNACK BAR 16h_17h.30    DINNER 19h_22h  Themed buffets on most nights with International  fisherman's table  Asian  Italian Spanish & Moroccan evenings .

The desserts ( photos attached ) were a work of art to look at & so delicious I couldn't resist trying them all . After all this we would go to the bar for a coffee & brandy .

POOL BAR 10h_ 18h  Wonderful bar staff who remembered your favourite drink .We often had such a laugh with the barmen & animators that our stomaches hurt .

EVENING BAR 18h_22h.30  Cocktail hour with a large choice of alcoholic & non alcoholic cocktails  tit bits  olives & nuts whilst live singers entertain & everyone gets up on the dance floor .

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gasmangeoff wrote a review Jan 2017,40,"Nice, nothing fancy and getting tired but nothing bad to say",We have enjoyed five days in Marrakech staying here and taking the shuttle bus into town each day. We are in our early fifties and enjoy leaving our grown boys at home to explore different places. Our choice is to have a base from where to see the sights and Kenzi Club is really ideal. Not being accustomed to all inclusive it took a little adjusting. The food is varied but cooked for a large audience so not outstanding. Really too much so be prepared to be selective and avoid overeating! My wife recommends the almond tart and crispy donuts.    Drinks are available somewhere throughout the day but there are no coffee/tea facilities in the room which is a shame. Not much choice and no branded drinks but hey that's ok. I developed a taste for Moroccan tea here.    We had a simple room which was big enough nicely furnished and clean. Apart from rather intermittent wifi we have no complaints.    All the staff are very friendly and while we have poor French language skills this was not an issue as everyone tried very hard to speak English and anyway Gin Tonic and beer are universal words!    Unfortunately it's not been warm for much of our stay and we've had two days rain which exposes the lack of indoor space to chill away from the room. Again not much of an issue. The complex is large and I wonder how crowded the pool area gets in summer but there are ramps for pushchairs and wheelchairs and we viewed a ground floor room with disabled facilities for a friend who we will recommend Kenzi Club Agdal to. Families seem well catered for and there are quite a few here with young children who seem quite happy.    Overall a nice break in a nice hotel close to the modern town but far enough away to relax!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Vicky C wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Great for some winter sun!,After reading some of the reviews my partner and I were a little apprehensive to stay at the Kenzi club. When we first arrived we were greeted with a quick check in at reception and whisked to our rooms on a buggy through the pretty grounds. Our room was large lovely and clean - which it continued to be as the cleaner cleaned everyday renewing towels and fresh bed linens. The patio door was broken on the first night. We told reception and it was fixed about a hour later longer than I would have liked. I also found that the rooms where not noise proof so you can hear other guests closing there doors and what not at night. It wasn't too bad because I think we travelled when it was less busy but I can understand it being a lot noisier in peak season.    We were worried about the food but there is plenty of choice. Yes breakfast was the most repetitive but you don't have to eat the same thing again right? There is a different theme for dinner each night so there is a selection of different choices don't previously on display. Obviously there are dishes that stay the same each night but there are new dishes to try too. The complaints about oil in the food was a bit ignorant considering you are in morocco a country that as a whole cooks traditionally with a lot of oil. Again if you don't like oil don't have it there are plenty of choice with less oil (even a steam section.)  A lovely touch was when you ordered water and other drinks they brought it to you by the bottle so you could always take it away back to your rooms.  We can't speak for the cocktails or alcohol because neither of us like to drink.    You have to pay for a safe (30dh a day) which I thought was a bit cheeky. The gym was (250dh a week 80dh for a day) which is a shame that you need to pay but my partner an athlete (so fitness is very important to him) who used it thought it was absolutely fine better than expected when some of the reviews made it out to be a hole in the ground.    I didn't feel like there was any preferential treatment to French guest. The complaint that kept cropping up about this again seemed a tad ignorant as morocco was colonised by the French so a Arabic and French are the main languages spoken there. You can get by in the hotel speaking English and they try there best especially at reception and the waiters. But to be annoyed they can't speak English fluently in a country like morocco is like being annoyed that not everyone speaks Chinese in Paris.    I would say when exchanging your money at reception be careful and figure out roughly what you are suppose to be getting. I made the mistake of not speaking up at the time of exchanging my money so was owed more. Which is harder to explain when both parties are not fluent in each other's languages. Of course people make mistakes and the little niggles in the hotel didn't (and we wouldn't let it!) damper our time there for some warm winter sun.,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickyc396

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ShahinAli wrote a review Jan 2017,50,#TeamAnimation #TeamKenzi,First of all I want to say forget all the negative comments you read. We live in a world we're everything is still never enough. I was close to booking Riu Hotel but then come across Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. It was probably the best choice I made there are no words to describe how happy I was with my stay. I stayed from the 5th Jan - 12th Jan.    Big open reception with polite reception team. Very clean and the scent in the reception is so nice forgot to ask what it was. January for me was perfect as I wasn't looking to party. It was cheap hot and quite but yet busy enough to have a great time.    My room was clean and big. Had a separate lounge to the bedroom big bathroom 2 toilets and 2 balconies. Everyday the housekeepers did something nice with the duvet like a design every time they made the bed. It's nothing major but it sticks to your head the small things.    The hotel has 3 pools. 1 big which is not heated but 10meters away is another pool which is heated and has a snack bar and drinks bar next to it which provides great food and drinks.    The main restaurant has a very big buffet and every night for dinner they have a different cuisine food for your tastebuds which gets refilled straight away. They are very generous with drinks. If you order coke you won't get a glass of coke. You will receive a whole bottle. Same goes with wine.    The hotel also has a Bar that is open till 23:30pm which has entertainment every night without miss and straight after near the pool they have a disco club which is open till late. The animation team is a one of a kind. They do shows and acts every night to keep the guest happy. Hasina Spider Salim Youness were brilliant. Always smiling and recognise you straight away. Great customer skills. Kenzi lucky to have them.    Nizar & Majeek.. Stayed in many hotels but have never come across two staff members with so much passion for what they do. Everything they do they have a smile on there face. Always going the extra mile with the guests. There should be some sort of award given to them. Great great great guys. Throughout the day Nizar will get the guest to join in on activities such as shooting archery darts etc. Majeek goes out his way to teach guests Arabic. I just hope the manager or owner reads this cause they deserve a medal. Thank you both for the service you provided. It was an honour.    I will definitely return to this hotel without a doubt. Best hotel I stayed in.    Don't waste time booking another hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Nael C wrote a review Jan 2017,30,Reasonable resort- unreliable service,We visited during a busy time ( July) this place had been suggested by one of our relatives. The room was nice but it was not made up on time (4 hours late!) so I slept slumped in a chair whilst the maid prepared the room. It was obvious that the hotel was restraining its costs to the detriment of service for example - not enough waiters also poor communication skills from the over-stretched staff as a general observation but a few tried really hard.  The popular items in the single main restaurant quickly ran out -without replacement in a timely manner. There was no fly zapper so you had to be careful not to take food (especially salad) that the flies frequently sampled!! and it took a long time to obtain soft drinks though the waiters were generally polite and tried hard. Some chefs were ignorant. I speak Arabic as well as English and the french visitors were favoured. This was sad since all guests should be regarded equally as customers. Tipping was essential to ensure your evening drinks arrived quickly: in my case copious amounts of mint tea.  The evening entertainment: varied and very good.  The pool bar was a weak spot. I guess a couple of the staff had attitude problems their Arabic dialect is very different and I refuse on principle to speak french in an Arabic country they were slow and rude plus the bar near the soft drinks machine was infested with wasps. The manager stepped in and was very polite and efficient. One younger guy stood out as personable the others required a sense of humour transplant!  We issued two written complaints. The assistant manager was sincere and issued us with a free meal to the Moroccan A La Carte restaurant.This is an excellent place to visit. The service manager didn't turn up but I was not at all surprised .  I wouldn't re-visit but overall the holiday was OK.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bashley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888naelc

Our room number is a low number so not the best but we are very happy with everything here. Food and alcohol are good and plentiful. Rooms are clean staff are extremely nice entertainment is good shuttle bus to Marrakech central reliable and safe. We have travelled widely and well so would not put up with poor service or facilities.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Amanda W wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Very Good place to stay,We stayed in the hotel for 5 days in January 2017 and would definitely stay again if we return to Marrakech.    I am not sure what some people expect after reading their negative reviews but all I could say is the must be over fussy.    It may not be up to the standard of some 5* hotels but you are certainly not paying 5* prices.    This is more of a resort than a hotel and everything we experienced was excellent.    Our room (440) was very spacious and comfortable the only negative I could say if really being picky was the bathroom could be spruced up a little....however all was spotless. The room was away from the main amenities but had its own private pool (shared between around 40 rooms) plus a bar though we didn't use it as we prefer the activity around the main pool.    There was several activities (all included) archery air rifle shooting golf tennis keep fit etc. The pool bar served a wide variety of drinks and snacks till 6pm.  There is one main bar that opens at 6pm till 11.30pm....waiters constantly provide drinks. The entertainment consisted of a singer from 7-8pm a mini disco 8.30 - 9.30 then some entertainment from the resident team....might not be to everyones taste but we didn't mind it. The entertainment team certainly work hard and was very friendly without being pushy.    The restaurant was buffet style with a wide choice at all meal times.....Breakfast had all the standard choices....lunch and dinner had a wide variety....as with all buffets some of the food could have been a little hotter but it was not really a problem. Drinks were also served which included full bottles of wine water or soft drinks.    All staff that we encountered was friendly and courteous French is the main language as you would expect but most also spoke some English.    Our opinion is that this is a very god value place to stay with lots going on with a free shuttle bus to the centre meaning you can easily get to the tourist attractions taxi to the same place was approximately £5.    Would highly recommend!,Date of stay: January 2017,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickw495
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jay P wrote a review Jan 2017,40,Consistently Good,As a regular here this was my third stay I cannot fault this resort. The facilities food and stay make for a pleasant stay for an All Inclusive.  Special mention must go to Mr. Lahlou (Guest relations) and his team for making our stay smooth and memorable.I have to mention Lubna at the reception desk whose service with a smile in accomodating our room concerns above and beyond her call of duty was another example of exemplary customer service which I have rarely experienced. Last but not least Chef Hitcham and his team went out of their way to meet our every culinary need.  My family and I look forward to our next visit in anticipation!

Food was very good and assorted. In winter the temperature was 20 degrees C during daytime so it was nice to stay close to the pool. There is a heated pool but I did not tried it. The spa and inner pool are charged but it should not be an issue since the price of my stay was reasonable.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Naomi I wrote a review Dec 2016,30,Decent place-would recommend for a 3* holiday.,I stayed here December 17th-24th with my husband and another couple. Our overall impression was that this is a decent 3* hotel acting as a 5* hotel.    Rooms: The rooms were really lovely extremely spacious with a very comfortable bed and fantastic air con/heating (which we initially used as it was quite chilly). Towels and soap/shampoo are provided however the maids did not always replace towels when we left them on the floor or soap etc.    Pools/spa: I felt that all of the pools were fantastic-the heated pool has a bar next to it from which you can order basic food like chips pizza and beverages. The spa/indoor pool was very lovely and relaxing. The hammam is a fantastic experience with a heated chamber however if you want a massage you can definitely get a better and MUCH cheaper one in the city centre (I recommend Les bains de L'alhambra-we went here and the experience was 2.5 hours and 350 dirham as opposed to a 1 hour massage at the hotel which was 500 dirham.)    Food:  -The main restaurant had a large selection of food with different themes everyday. I personally thought the food was mainly mediocre tasting (apart from the Moroccan food) but each to their own. The desserts were really nice and breakfast is definitely the best meal here with Moroccan pancakes fresh fruit etc.  -The a la carte restaurant menu was absolutely delicious and very filling with large portions and had great service (there is however a 100 dirham charge per person to eat here). I feel that the main restaurant could do with an upgrade-lots of chipped glasses dirty cutlery and undercooked food at times.  -The alcohol was extremely watered down and even the virgin cocktails were awful to taste. However a positive was that they give you fresh bottles to drink at your table if you ask i.e. water coke miranda wine etc.    Service: There is no room service (which you would expect from a 5* hotel) and some of the staff were a bit blunt with us especially when we didn't tip them for every little thing or requested a room change when we realized they'd put us in the wrong area.    Entertainment: Fantastic for children not so great for adults..    Amenities: Wifi is good in the rooms and by reception and the pools. The hotel provides you with an iron if you ask for one. There is a safe in the room but they have a daily charge for this (also something I've never heard of in a 5* resort). There is also a mini fridge in the room but this is empty. The reception area is also really lovely and there is a man who walks around pouring Moroccan tea for everyone.    Positives:  -Very lovely looking resort    -The rooms are comfortable and very clean and the pools are lovely to chill in.    Negatives:  -We felt as though the hotel claimed to be all inclusive and 5 stars however were trying to squeeze money out of us in any way possible-e.g. a 150 dirham charge for pool towels entry to the indoor pool (I have literally never heard of such a thing in a 5 star hotel before) dinner in the a la carte restaurant use of the safe.  -The staff seemed very blase and didn't make much of an effort until Christmas eve when there was a huge influx of new people who came to stay.  -Even the hotel representatives tried to rip us off with expensive activities such as an Atlas Mountain tour which we paid for at the hotel and when on the trip they tried to make us pay more for something we were told was already included (we got 100 dirham refund for this in the end).    In a nutshell Kenzi Club Agdal Medina is ideal if you're looking for a 3* (mostly inclusive) holiday with children but I wouldn't recommend it for couples looking for a true all inclusive 5* resort.,Date of stay: December 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Croydon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nay_ignatius

The facilities were great and the staff really friendly. There is a huge slide for children (in the unheated pool) and the heated pool is huge but 1.50 deep so your child needs to be able to swim or should use swimming aids.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,berlin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldielocksBerlin

Not the same standing however a very decent place rooms are large all with a balcony.  Restaurant is OK it can be busy but you can always choose to sit outside on the terrace. Good service food is regular but OK many options to choose from. You can join sport or other activities families with children will also enjoy. Great outdoor heated swimming pool I used it mid-December !  The Spa is nice it includes the gym. Only issue is you have to pay an extra to use the Hammam and the indoor heated pool.

There isn't much entertainment in low season but there are always activities for the children and some dancing for the adults. The hotel is not in the Medina but offers a free shuttle bus every hour.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,jim s wrote a review Dec 2016,50,Moroccan Hospitality,As you can see i write as i see it and this is my Personal Opinion    Over all the hotel is exultant i had a great stay all staff i came in contact with were Very Friendly but some not so.    i always give Credit when due and NOT when NOT Hassan in Dinning Hall very professional after one sit down meal the next night He remembered what we drank and delivered to our table. great service he kept table clean all time. well done.    and to the young Guy Pool Attendant you seen the danger and acted and save a young lad from droning hope the hotel replaces your Phone Well Done    BUT sadly there is always one person that spolies it the Maitre D smoking next to food prep area outside and on duty in view ( don't get any Brownie points from me) he also seemed to show a lot of favouritism to Arabic origin Guests  he could of helped out at times  to give an example  one guest asked for some water so he went to the waiter serving the guest and said water for this table but the waiter was serving another guest (bearing mind he was standing right next to the water bottles a arms length away) so he stopped the waiter serving the guest he was to get water then instructs another waiter to serve the table the first waiter was serving He could have easily served the water to the original guest in stead of sending everyone on a gosses chase and sadly the cleaner and guy Squashing Oranges Do you relay have to have a full blown argument about him dropping orange peel on the floor in the middle of Breakfast time.    They did get our room wrong but one swift call and we were relocated within Minuets  Thank You      lots of activity's for Parents and Kids    There is a small Farm in the corner of the Hotel and animals are looked after very well and in the other is a small Vegetable garden bit strange for a hotel but was something different.    We stayed in the Adult only section from the first room we had to the upgrade we got theirs not much difference yes it has a Pool but is not heated not worth the extra IMO.    and i do think a bit more care on house keeping for that Block the stairs and landings could do with a good clean.    the room was spacious and bed really big TV for the late night catch up if you understand French or Arabic  Aircon in room the room we had it seed a bit hissy missy but done its job    i couldn't fault the room apart from one thing the walls as mentioned in other reviews are very thin being awoke at 1:30 off a couple in the next room at the height of passion is not good.    just in case your holiday company forget to mention there is local taxes to pay it was something like £30.00 on arrival and if you wanted to use the safe 3 Euros a day which i find a bit harsh and in my opinion not worth the money lets say i could easily have taken the safe out without any effort .    and now the main thing Food    There was a wide verity of food everyday  Breakfast was a the same everyday but Lunch and evening meal were different every night always something for everyone my favorite was the lamb done in the Tagine    i can confirm most of the food under the lamps are cold  BUT there is a Microwave to the left had side of the buffet.i nuked my every time just to be safe.    if you didn't Know already Morocco is predominantly French speaking with Arabic  off the people i met most spoke English and are very polite.  The hotel is on a Large Plot just south of the Airport 10 min drive it seems to be an up and coming area for hotels there is a lot of building work BUT dont let this put you off as its that far away you cant rely hear any it.    if possible Book your Airport Transfers From you Holiday Company a lot easier and Most people tell you to exchange money at airport DON'T take a few Euros to give as tips and exchange at your hotel you get a better rate we did its only Cents (but they Do Add Up). At Airport Exchange they try make you get a MasterCard Debit card DON'T they are very hard to use Not many of the places we visited took it only Shops in the Malls (Shopping Centers) and we had a few Dirhams Left on it and was Hard to part pay with it.and the staff are very pushy if you want 1000 dirham the persist ion you getting 2000 stick to your guns.    Taxis are very Cheap from Hotel to main Square was 50 dirham in day and 70 at night i always paid 50 at night always negotiate (barter the price ) a price first and stick to it there is always one of the taxi drivers will take you never get into taxi without agreeing a price .one thing you have to be very careful off make sure your taxi driver knows were it is as we did get dropped at wrong location twice theirs always taxi out side Hotel.    i would not recommend Hire a Car it will cost more in parking that in Taxi    Be prepared to Tip anyone that helps you    Do Not take anything from anyone as once you have it in your had you have bought it.    things i did  Hired a Guide see my review  Quad Biking see my review  Go crating see my review (just over road from Hotel )    one last thing when you return to airport make sure you complete the exit card and have a pen take time in completing it as if its not complete right you will get sent to the back of the queue at customs. YES you get customs checked when you leave.    and dont take a Trolly off any off the guys at the airport as he will charge you go get your own BUT guess what there is NON as they got them all quite a good scam    i had a great time on my visit Yes i will Go Back,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newcastle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1jims
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sarah N wrote a review Dec 2016,40,First Time,First time at an all inclusive resort so wasn't sure what to expect. Paid a good price for 5 nights and was pleasantly surprised. Still not my preferred type of trip but a good way to see Marrakech.    We had a good sized well kept room in block 5. A short walk from all the amenities.  Beer was good as was the wine and the fizzy pop at dinner. Don't waste your time on the cocktails (banana flavour mojitos).    All staff we encountered were friendly and courteous. As it was out of season not a lot to do in the evening so we had a ball people watching in the bar. Entertainment was geared for the French speaking tourists and not really my type of thing but I expect it is similar to what you would find in other all inclusive resorts.    The shuttle bus was a blessing into the centre. 10min walk from the drop off point to the main square. 150 dirhams to use the safe in the room for 5 nights. I believe you also need to pay a deposit for beach towels. 100 dirhams to eat in the Moroccan restaurant.    Food was good but can get repetitive. They cater for most. Tagines pasta pizza meat and fish each night with a variety of salad stuffs and nice bread.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9314VQsarahn

The final straw was coming back to the hotel in the cold and rain to find the DVD player our only saviour from boredom was not available as PROMISED by reception.  After walking a distance to our room both of our cards were out of order and would not allow us into our room.

We found some absolutely beautiful little boutique hotels for a fraction of the price in Marrakesh.  We would really like to know who regulates or protects holiday makers in these situations general thoughts are once you're there they have your money so you have to pay up and suck it up.

Best to visit in the summer they have more activities on!    Plenty of taxis and not to far from the airport or city centre.    Taxi ride to the square should only cost you 70mad no more! Aways set the price before jumping a taxi. Otherwise you will get hit with a rip of bill.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baker_9876

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kpbastone wrote a review Nov 2016,40,Visit of 7 nights 27th Oct to 3rd Nov with wife other 2 adults plus 2 teenagers,Arrived in the evening due to a flight delay (ie Fog early at Gatwick that morning which backed up our afternoon flight). Checked-in at hotel all good reception was polite and helpful. rooms were good but but some of the walls needed a bit of a paint job. Having said that some of the rooms were being decorated so looked like it was the time for this to be done. I must say there was continuous maintenance activity going on especially around the gardens. The trees and shrubs were all kept well and this made a very pleasant environment around the rooms and walkways.  Housekeeping was very good especially ladies Saloua and Soukaina who done an  excellent job in changing towels and cleaning the rooms to a high standard.  The animation guys and girls were excellent especially 'Spider' I don't know where he gets his energy from. The team that tend to the younger children are also on the go all day and the kids seemed to to be having a good time. The animation team also put on some good shows in the evening especially the 'Halloween Night' they worked hard on that one even the decoration/scenery on the stage etc. Pool area's  were also kept clean guys going round all day picking up litter and empty glasses etc. There were a couple of water slides (not very big) but the kids of all ages seemed to enjoy them the slides and pools were all attended by life guards.  Food well it is all inclusive quality was good plenty of it good selection desserts seem to fly out quick best to get them with main course to avoid mssing out on some popular ones .Waiters in restaurants all very attentive nothing is to much trouble if you ask politely. Only thing although a good choice of food  it can be a bit repetitive I would think over two weeks. I Have always found the Morocco'n people to be friendlyevery member of staff always acknowledge you in passing even it is in french (main language). all in all a relaxing hotel lay by the pool and eat all day if you want. Nearly forgot the weather was also good at that time about 28 deg most days nice cool early morning pleasant in evenings no coats needed.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpbastone

Archery golf tennis plenty to keep occupied with. Aqua aerobics cookery lesson belly dancing.  I was upgraded to the quieter area where there was a smaller pool refreshments etc served round the pool. Very peaceful or take a walk to the area where the other pool was where there was a lot more going on. So you could have the peace and quiet if upgraded or be round the main pool where there is more going on.  Took the shuttle bus to the market lots of winding alleys. Plenty to see and plenty to buy.  Rooms are very nice size and clean comfy beds.  Enjoyed my stay.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Conwy County, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djw0072014
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,rich_break wrote a review Nov 2016,50,Pleasantly surprised,Visited this hotel for 5 days after reading the reviews and decided that the majority were decent.  We arrived from airport (taxis from there are a rip off so book before) a trip to the airport from hotel cost us 150 dirhams/ €15 but the taxi to the hotel from airport when we landed was double that.  When we arrived we were impressed with how modern the hotel was and there is WiFi almost everywhere. We sat down with some mint tea and checked in to our upgraded privileged room which was excellent. We got taken to the room in a golf cart and everything was smooth!  The room was large good facilities and had a private (ish) pool area with service from a nice lady who got drinks and food if you needed it. Only thing that i would improve is the safe you have to pay for even in a privilege room which is odd and also extra money for the a-la carte when you're all inclusive is wrong. At least 1 complimentary visit should be allowed.  The hotel has many activities from shooting air rifles to clay tennis courts these are included if you stay and there is also a pack of trips bookable through the reps there plus a free shuttle bus into the medina (very busy area and the souks are a maze so not for the feint hearted but we never felt at risk go at night too)  Food was pretty good although i may have got a bit fed up if i was there more than a week or so but no problems while i was there lots of local food and also plenty for those not wanting to try anything different.  The grounds of the hotel are covered with olives trees and quirky statues and nothing is too far to walk really.  Cannot fault the staff- the porters in particular were great and the entertainment team were nice enough although the shows were pretty basic (maybe bring in more external acts).  All in all we had a decent trip and I would stay here again the area is deffinitely being developed and the UN summit there currently and the electric F1 event opposite the hotel will help this development.,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rich_break
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,nina063 wrote a review Nov 2016,50,"Perfect Holiday, Can't wait to go back 😀",Well what a beautiful hotel......Food was absolutely amazing so much choice you will not go hungry. The holiday did not start perfectly. We were stuck at Casablanca airport with a 2 hour delay and when we arrived at the hotel they did not have any rooms left. Mohammed the night manager took us to thief sister hotel which was beautiful. We stayed there the first night were taken to the Kenzi Club the following day after having breakfast and lunch and a nice swim.  As an apology we had our room ungraded to a suite. So in our opinion a mistake happened and the hotel and Mohammed solved it perfectly. The Kenzi Club is a lovely family hotel great fun for our 11 year old and perfect for us. Our house keeper Najat kept our room spotless every day and the sculptures she created with the towels were a joy to behold. Tariq the waiter that looked after us each evening was a credit to the hotel being helpful polite and giving us great information about Morroco.  By the way the food each evening was varied freshly cooked and really enjoyable they cater for all tastes and do it with a smile on their face. Magic Spider and the whole entertainment team were terrific. My wife did Morrocan cooking lessons everyday and the teacher/chef was not only entertaining but very good at teaching each dish. Please do these lessons if you go time spent laughing and learning.  So would we recommend this hotel yes were we made to feel welcome and treated with care yes we were. Would we recommend this place and go back again? Yes yes and yes.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,hampshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nina063
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Chris J wrote a review Nov 2016,10,Terrible,I didn't enjoy it at all. You really do feel that you're just there so that the hotel can make money from you.    Something strange is going on at the bar. The drinks regardless of if it's gin or vodka taste the same. It gives you a terrible headache. The local beer is a very weak thing and the service is dreadfully slow probably deliberately to keep costs down.    The food is plentiful but the emphasis is on quantity not quality. It all tastes the same. If you would like a glass of wine with dinner expect to pay London prices for some nasty local plonk.    And whilst all this is happening the hotel management watch over you frantically checking your ID to make sure you're not taking advantage of the all inclusive.    The room was large but well overdue a refit. You will hear the people next door or above or below through the walls. Every baby cry every cough or snore.    On check out day if you approach the door to go out they get very upset that you might be trying to leave without settling up with the cashier.    The overall mood is one of money grabbing penny pinching total lack of trust. The management are a very suspicious crowd. No effort is made to create any type of relaxing atmosphere.    My advice - give this place a miss.    Chris,Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled on business,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisjR8105EP

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,stephs06 wrote a review Nov 2016,30,It was okay,This is not a five star hotel. I'm not saying that it's bad but it's not reflective of its rating. Our bedroom never really felt cool and we had two single beds pushed together however we were given a balcony and the rooms were cleaned well everyday.  The pool was nice and we didn't find the sun loungers too busy and there was music playing all day.  The bars were okay however I stuck to some because their spirit measures were questionable and the cocktails were far too on the sweet side - mainly syrup.  The majority of the staff were lovely and attentive however the female reception staff were incredibly rude. Be aware of extra charges e.g. Towel deposit paying for the nice restaurant gym useage etc.  The food was incredibly repetitive and very carby. A lot of the food had a very weird after taste to it - maybe the oil it was cooked in? And you are only allowed juice tea/coffee or water for breakfast. So if you're feeling hungover and want a glass of fizz - you're out of luck.  The entertainment was alright if not a bit odd. Learn at least basic French before you go as the entertainment is largely French speaking.  Overall ups and downs.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Heather B wrote a review Nov 2016,10,This is a low grade all inclusive young FAMILY hotel,"My husband and I booked a short break here for a complete chill after a very busy summer. This is advertised as a 5* hotel.  We arrived at the hotel in the early evening to be met by Muhammed ""Sweetie"" guest relations. We were told that the air conditioning was not working and we were being upgraded for the night to the Kenzi Menara Palace - this is also advertised as a 5* hotel. We were taken directly to the other hotel and shown to our palatial suite. It was the height of luxury.  Unfortunately I had been quite poorly before we left the UK so wasn't able to do very much at all while we were visiting. The Menara palace was ideal as hubby and I were able to lie on a sunbed by the pool with an umbrella and completely relax. It was peaceful towels were plentiful the pool was huge and cold (according to hubby). The food was plentiful and tasty (again according to hubby). No complaints there.  The following afternoon we were collected from the Menara palace and delivered back to the Club Agdal. I was still feeling quite unwell so went straight to our room. This had 2 single beds pushed together a grotty terrace overgrown with trees which opened onto the footpath through the resort. It was tired and in need of tlc.  My husband went off to explore the resort. When he returned he likened the place to Butlins. Lots of children and loud music round the pool and no sunbeds available. The place had a general feeling of neglect.  The ""restaurant"" - more like a school canteen was loud. However the food plenty and varied. There was a reasonable selection of vegetables salads and fresh fruit but the emphasis was definitely on quantity rather than quality.  An hour after we arrived my hubby went up to reception to request that we return to the Menara palace (we were happy to pay to move). We were told they had no availability - I find this very hard to believe as the place was half empty the day before. We were offered a room upgrade. The second room was much fresher and had a big double bed. It was also closer to the pool and all its shenanigans.  We were given a free bottle of wine offered a complimentary massage and given complimentary towel deposit tokens.  So for this all inclusive holiday you have to pay a deposit for your towel (I assume you get this back) you have to pay to use the gym you don't get a night in the ""proper"" restaurant like you would normally on an all inclusive package. There is 1 bar open throughout the day - the pool bar so nowhere quiet to sit and enjoy a relaxing peaceful drink.  By 6pm on our first night at kenzi club agdal we decided that we would cut our losses and book flights home for the next day. I was still feeling poorly and there was nowhere we could go and quietly relax.  The next day we bumped into Muhammed ""Sweety"" and told him we were going home. He was clearly upset by this and informed us that magically there was now availability at the Menara palace and would arrange for us to move there. Having spent £220 on flights and psychologically prepared ourselves for the disappointment of coming home we decided to leave. Had I been fit and healthy we would definitely have gone back to the Menara Palace.",Date of stay: November 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Betws-y-Coed, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hevslbeale21
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,logorrhoea wrote a review Nov 2016,30,Tired and in need of revamp - not five stars,First the positives...    The location of this hotel is pretty good - only a ten minute cab journey from the airport and the airport's so small it hardly takes any time to get through passport control.    The price is low for an all-inclusive. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's good value for money - that for me implies a bargain whereas you notice the difference between here and say a more upmarket hotel in Dubai.    The staff at the snack bar the pool the 'animation' desk and the evening entertainment are really friendly. I didn't notice any particular preference for French guests. It's only natural that they're going to find it easier to get on when they speak the same language but I didn't see any preferential treatment.    There's enough sun loungers around the pool that you don't really need to put towels down before breakfast. People do but it wasn't at all necessary during our time there.    So areas where there's room for improvement...    The room was adequate but my god the walls are thin. Night 1 we were kept awake by a loud TV. Night 2 we could hear the next room arguing. Night 3 I was kept awake by an air-conditioning hum from outside. There was a squashed insect on the wall near the shower head which wasn't cleaned off during our stay. The towels get swiped very quickly in the morning before the rooms are given a full clean. Tip: put the do not disturb sign on your door when you pop out for breakfast if you intend to go back to the room and have a wash.    Charging a fee to use the safe in the room is cheeky. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in my life and have never been charged to store my valuables safely.    The food in the main restaurant is average at best. There's long queues and not much variety. They tried a couple of theme nights and while I would give them an A for effort it's an F for execution. One example: the Asian night replaced the usual spaghetti bolognese and vegetable tagliatelle with... spaghetti and tagliatelle covered in an ersatz sauce to approximate stir fry. You'll be ok if you don't mind having pretty much the same food every night - and you're well served if you like pizza pasta or chips but if you don't have the palate of a child you're going to get bored of the food very quickly especially as it's similar for lunch and dinner.    The operational side of the restaurant really needs addressing especially at breakfast. The staff work like trojans but are clearly stressed and it shows in the service. I don't blame them at all. The hotel needs to invest in more crockery and cutlery because there's clearly not enough to cope with a full and busy restaurant. That would help staff to concentrate on clearing tables and setting them quickly instead.    All in all when you look you can spot signs of a lack of attention to detail or lack of care. For example loose mosaic tiles in one of the pools signs of mould in the grouting in the bathrooms dirty crockery and glasses in the restaurant parasols that don't stay open sun loungers that have wonky legs.    It's the kind of thing that means this is definitely not a five-star experience but then again you're not paying a five-star price.

Staff were very nice and polite spoke very good English.    We have been sent a bowl of sweets and fruit as a complimentary service which was a lovely touch.    Room 414 was very spacious and clean great area as we had the luxury of private pool as well. they serve drinks there and the lady was lovely.    food was amazing I think if you haven't been to Marrakesh before this is a good starting point to get a taste of local food. Tajine was nice some nights better than others. We stayed over for the haloween and the staff made so much effort with decoarations etc. I was very impressed.    Entertainment was also very good drinks were nice cocktails were average but that is to be expected.    Pool area was very nice great slides and nice atmosphere. As this is a French speaking country it was obvious that many French tourists were there. We didn't think that staff favourite them at all. We were all treated equally.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,761Happy_traveller wrote a review Oct 2016,10,"Not again, a bitter disappointment.",We came here for the fourth time this year but won't be coming back.  From the moment we arrived there was a noticeable difference in service reception staff were unwelcoming we had to wait 45 minutes for room service to arrive with missing items and unfortunately that was the start of a pattern that would spoil our holiday for the rest of the week. Everywhere you go at this hotel you are now forced to wait in line restaurants bars hotel reception and housekeeping due to either poor management or staff shortages.  On our last day checkout was 12:00 but having returned to our room after breakfast our towels had been taken from the room meaning that we could not shower we called to request more towels and were told they would be sent straight away 40 minutes later still no towels.  You would expect that as checkout was at 12:00 they would expect high volumes of people needing assistance sadly though despite the expected increase in people at the checkout desk there was only one person on checkout duty (yet another period of waiting in line).  If you ask to see a manager to complain you're forced to wait in reception for 45 minutes to see the guest relation manager Mohammed Lahlou who then argues he was only called 5 minutes earlier and doesn't seem to understand the frustration of a customer who explains that whether it was his fault or his staffs fault a customer has been disadvantaged. His only recompense for all of the above was to offer us a complimentary late check out and a discount off our next stay (we won't be coming back!).,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Birmingham, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761Happy_traveller

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Peter G wrote a review Oct 2016,40,A piece of paradise convenient to Marrakech and airport.,My wife and daughter had a four night break here in mid October 2016 and enjoyed hotel's ambiance as well as the convenient location and weather.  Booked through British Airways the hotel was only fifteen minutes from the airport (private taxis each way £14) and offered a courtesy bus (free) into the medina. It was set in lovely gardens and offered a number of pools.  All inclusive the buffet restaurant was excellent offering a wonderful range of food including the all important vegetarian choices for my daughter. The themed nights in the restaurant meant that we had no need to try the hotel's a la carte restaurants (charge applies).  Guests were mainly French plus some English and a few Americans. This international clientele added to the ambiance of the experience.  Very helpful and friendly staff at the hotel confirmed our respect for the local culture and population in this second visit to Morocco. You will not be hassled on your trips away from the hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sianyxx wrote a review Oct 2016,30,True and fair review,"I am not one for putting reviews about hotels but after my experience at this hotel I felt the need to make other people aware before booking this hotel. This is 100% not a 5* hotel. My partner and I have stayed in plenty of amazing hotels and this isn't one of them. I will break down the reviews on different parts of the hotel to make it more readable.  Food: There is one main area for food and whilst there is a good selection of food it's quantity rather than quality. The food is cold and very repetitive. Also you can't enjoy your meal because the smell of fried food is vile. Each time we left the dining room our clothes and hair stunk of grease. There is no ambience and it's like being in a school canteen. There is a Moroccan restaurant but you have to pay extra for that. Usually in a 5* hotel you get at least one free go in the a la carte restaurant.  Pool area: There are lots of sunbeds and the atmosphere around the pool is really nice. The animation team were lovely and they were always working.  Drinks: probably the best thing about this hotel. There was proper coke cola in bottles and large bottles of water as well as many more. The wine and lager was good too. There is only one bar area open in the day which got very busy at times and the wasps were quite scary.  Rooms: So when we went to check in our room wasn't ready for 3 more hours. I wasn't a happy bunny as we had to wait around. When it was ready they told us we were ""upgraded"" to the area with a private pool. The room was nice but the bed very hard and uncomfortable. The room was cleaned every day and if you placed the towels on the floor you got given new ones. If I had paid for the "" upgraded"" room I would have been annoyed as it was no different to the others. The area did have a private pool which to be fair was lovely and there was a lady there to serve you drinks all day. She was lovely!  Gym: I was so annoyed by this! You have to pay extra to use the gym. I thought that this was ridiculous! When I did pay for the day pass the gym it was hardly worth it. Two running machines and a few other things.  Staff: They were all really nice and helpful. Some reviews on here say they favour the French. That isn't really true it's just because they speak the same language. Just to make you aware that it is very busy with French people. This didn't bother us!  Child friendly: We had no children with us but if we did then this place would be amazing. The animation team kept them entertained all day long. There's slides by the pool and a mini farm and lots of other activities to keep them entertained.  Overall I was very disappointed with the hotel. Last year we stayed in the Kenzi Menera Palace which was down the road now that was 5*. We had room service a free gym two a la carte restaurants to eat in as well as the main one.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Natianan wrote a review Oct 2016,40,"“Excellent value for the money, not 5 star though”","The negative:  The staff. Most only spoke French and all the poolside activities and entertainment were in French. I know most people are French speaking but there were quite a few British and Americans as well as other Europeans. This was quite annoying.  The room was always short on towels. We were a family of 5 and we never ever had more than 3 towels if any at all.  The food was a bit repetivie but it was fine. If you have a picky child that's a problem as there was only really french fries and sometimes some pasta or plain pizza.  The drinks at the pool were quite bad. Just some cheap alcohol with some juice poured in.  The gym opened at 9am which is a bit annoying if you want to get a workout in before your kids wake up. I missed breakfast almost everyday as I wanted to work out and the buffet closed at 10am.  The hotel and the grounds have all the ""bones"" to be a great resort (soccer field basketball hoops tennis archery etc) but it's all very worn down and just ""tired"". The trees and landscape need some major trimming as everything is overgrown. The paint is faded on everything.    The postitive:  Definitely not 5 star but a decent 4 star hotel.  Large rooms and bathroom.  The main pool was big and the kids really enjoyed the waterslides.  Yes you do have to pay extra for the gym but the equipment was good and it was clean.  Very spacious property.  It was nice to eat dinner outside and listen to the live band playing.  Plenty of pool chairs to grab a spot at even after lunch in the afternoon. (not sure if this is true in high season though)  Location was fine. It was outside of the crazy Medina area but yet close to the airport. We did manage to walk to the small mall about 2km away. I felt safe and there was also a movie theater next to the mall.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Polly9099 wrote a review Oct 2016,30,Not 5 star!,So you get what you pay for and I'll caveat this review with the fact I paid £800 for 3 of us for a 5-night stay all inclusive.    The grounds are well kept and my daughter loved the pool and water slides. Everybody ignores the signs not to reserve sun loungers and puts down towels before breakfast and the hotel don't do anything about it so make sure you throw your towel down too!    The room was OK spacious and clean but very tired looking. The walls are quite thin so we were disturbed on the first night by next door's TV and by a dreadful domestic fight on the second.    The area that really needs some attention and investment though is the restaurant. Food was OK but the staff just cannot keep up and clean tables quickly enough to allow others to sit down and eat. Twice during our stay I had to clean our own table and they don't have enough crockery to go round. We had to drink coffee out of a glass and I saw a little boy eating cereal out of a wine glass.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,carol s wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Great holiday again!!,Just got back from 10 days at kenzi club. This is our second visit this year and it an amazing 10 days. Upgraded to the riad with the private pool. A lot more English people this time than our lady visit which was nice but still a mainly French resort. This is not a negative thing and no way do the staff favour the French it's just the language they speak!  Food was lovely as always could get a bit repetitive after the 10 days but that's expected.  Bar and waiting staff are so helpful and friendly especially siad and moustapha.  Entertainment team make the holiday! Always friendly  hard working and making sure everyone is happy. Big thank you to magic spider and hasna for making us laugh so much we'll be back next year!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jodaily wrote a review Oct 2016,30,Not what I expected :/,"I needed a break and Morroco was recommended beautiful placelovely people and warm weather even in October. So was very excited for this holiday with my boyfriend but unfortunately this hotel made my whole Morroco experience rubbish! Will just get straight to it firstly no where on the site states the check in time we arrived at the hotel at 11am and our room was not ready so we had to wait around for 3 hours around the hotel which was very annoying after the flight and all you want to do is get out of clothes and put more suitable clothing for the Morrocan weather so wasted time just trying to pass time in the hotel lobby. Once our room was ready they had not included our free wine which was part of the booking deal with the hotel! We found ourselves constantly having to chase up on the cleaners to clean our room then also realised when they clean our room they do not change the bed sheets they just keep the same dirty sheets and just neaten up the bed which is disgusting as the night before I had encountered the worst experience a large cockroach I mean it was massive on my bed as I was asleep it pricked my finger waking me out of my sleep felt like a sharp needle! Boyfriend killed it but the residue of the cockroach was on my bedsheets and they put that same dirty sheets back on my bed when they ""cleaned"" my room had to report this which they did change however reporting the cockroach incident to the hotel they did not offer a different room as I had explained I can not sleep there. The shower cord broke and we was showering with a shower that was not bringing enough water out of the shower head so I showers was not pleasant at all.  The pool side bar offer all inclusive drinks which sounds amazing but again the cocktails was rubbish absolutely rubbish didn't taste or even look tantalising at all there was wasps all over the bar made it very difficult to even order a drink. The spa they have in the hotel charged you to use the indoor pool! Even when you have paid for a spa treatment which was ridiculous!!!!  They charged you to provide pool towels?! That should come with paying to stay at the hotel.  So my opinion would be that I would not recommend this place at all only thing I would say the only thing that was ok was the food but didn't even like being at the restaurant for too long to sit and enjoy my time with my boyfriend as you will just leave the place smelling of cooking oil.",Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodaily

The hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport which is great as there was no long transfer. Upon arrival at the hotel you are welcomed with a refreshing drink and wet cloth which is great after being on a plane for a number of hours.    The hotel the rooms the pool the walkways etc are all very clean - there was a plate of local pastries and fruit in the room which was a very nice touch. The room we stayed in was on the ground floor and was a great size with a good size bathroom.    All the pools were very good and there was no problem getting a lounger each day.    The restaurant area was a great size and there was a large selection of food each meal time to satisfy every appetite. However I would say that if you are staying for a longer period of time that it may become a bit monotonous - but for short break it was ideal.    I would definitely return again to this hotel.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Carrickfergus, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VG0209
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Emily L wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Lovely holiday,We stayed at the Kenzi for 7 nights.  The hotel was always very clean and staff were polite and attentive.    Food was varied and on the whole good. Drinks were fine although cocktails and wine were not top quality but for an all inclusive it's pretty much what you would expect.    The only issue we really had was the loud music which is played by the pool. It's pretty 'banging' for most of the day. I think it might accompany exercise classes - but it became quite irritating as we wanted to read our books and relax.    We booked two day trips during our stay with the in house tour operators. The atlas mountain trip was really good so we would recommend this one in particular.    Overall we would recommend this hotel. It's good value for money.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SteMar247 wrote a review Oct 2016,20,Glad we only went for a week,This hotel has very nice bedrooms nice pools and pleasant grounds but we just cannot see how it gets 5 star reviews or ratings. We really struggled with the food and felt the service and warmth of the staff was below par. The salads were good but the quality of the meat dishes was very poor. At the bar all spirits were very weak whuch spoilt the cocktails. The spin classes held on water bikes looked fun and my partner decided to join in because there were only two participating and they had 10-12 bikes; she was shocked when she wasn't allowed because she hadn't booked in advance - that's unfriendly and doesn't make any commercial sense. Our towels were not changed once while we were there (7 nights) and despite the signs saying that reserving sunbeds is prohibited this was not enforced and was rife. Potentially this hotel could be much better but the food and service needs to be improved drastically.,Date of stay: October 2016,,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteMar247
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Aimee D wrote a review Oct 2016,40,Good all inclusive hotel,The hotel was really lovely and I was pleasantly surprised for the amount we paid for one week all inclusive. It was a beautiful complex with an abundance of flowers and plants and lovely areas to walk around. The rooms were very clean however I did have to request clean towels every now and again as they forgot to replace them.    The majority of the staff were very friendly but the comments regarding the French receiving preferential treatment is true. We found that giving tips helps with this issue otherwise you may be waiting longer than expected at the bar. We also had to wait longer than expected to get on the karaoke!    There was plenty of options for food in the restaurant and everything was fresh and tasty. My advice is to get there at 7.00pm in the evening once the restaurant first opens to get the best of each dish when it's nice and hot and there is plenty of it!    The pools and surrounding areas were well maintained and there was no issue with availability of sun beds however we were holidaying out of season so this may be the reason why. The only thing to be aware of is the amount of wasps around the bar and pool. There were literally hundreds of them and they were hard to avoid.    The entertainment team were lovely and there were plenty of activities to keep you busy during the day. The evening entertainment can only be described as 'interesting' and to be honest we couldn't really work out what it was about or what was going on! Of course it was all in French too with lots of French line dancing in between acts. There wasn't much room for free styling and throwing your own shapes on the dance floor. It felt a bit robotic at times with everybody dancing the same!    Our only complaints would be that the alcohol appeared to be watered down. However for the price we paid I can understand that! Just make sure you ask for a double at the bar. My other issue is the payment of the local taxes we were asked to pay this on arrival and then asked to pay this again on check out. I disputed it but because they did not log the payment against our room number nor did they provide a receipt we had no option but to pay this again. My advice is to obtain a receipt if they ask you to pay upfront to avoid additional charges during check out and an uncomfortable stand-off with the reception staff.,Date of stay: October 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aimeeD04

I can imagine that there are people that will like it but we are used to have more luxuary hotels in every meaning of the word. It was okay buth it is all because of the excellent animation team. In the beginning we were afraid to stay in this hotel buth the animation team made our vacation.  From morning till evening they are laughing en making shure everyone has a good day. They are superfriendly they talk to everyone en in the evening they make shure everybody's having a wonderful time. They give several lessons: aquagym aquabike oriëntal Dance ... and there are also lots of other activities .. you just can't be bored. Between different activities there is a really good ambience with lots of good music. Then there are the shows. I have never seen shows in a hotel this professionel... from Fire-breating to acrobatic trucs to several dances... it was all supergood! You can have it all.. breathtaking shows funny shows karaoke-evenings... tumbs up for the amasing choreographer Monkey!! Every member of the team has there own qualitys ... together they stand! Achraf and hassan are superfriendly and make shure everyone is having a good time. Achraf Magic en sania are giving good sessions of sports and they are also excellent dansers in the shows. Zico and Salim are making shure the presentation and arganisation are going well. Then there are hasna and spider.. they are the crazy-ones. If you want to laugh that hard that your belly hurts you have to be in there naberhood. Hasna is also the instructrice of the Dance lessons. She spider and hassan are also Daily members of the Showteam. They dance really good! Some nights there are sketches.. it is spider who will let you laugh superhard! Then there is omar ... together with his college .. who's name I regraetly forgot.. are in charge of the miniclub.. they are supergood with kids... my son really liked it to the moon and back.

Recent returned from a 5d stay with family all inclusive. 15mins taxi from airport and 20mins from the souks/tourist attractions. This is a beautiful. calm oasis. The hotel is arranged in stunning riads. The grounds are beautifully kept. Two large pools and plenty sun loungers. Pool side drinks and snack bar perfect to relax to. The buffets breakfast/lunch/dinner was to a high standard with table service drinks - the red wine is delicious. However the cocktails were poor - this could be improved but a regular theme in all inclusive hotels.    I would ignore some of the comments about being British and not being french. -yes there are French families there but also British. Understandably french is spoken more commonly but that did not affect the service and friendliness of the staff.    The spa provides some lovely treatment we had a massage and hammam. Perfect relaxation!

Days when I got up I spoke to the restaurant manager and he didn't care the next day I went to reception they too didn't care and said that they are not bothered about trip advisor comments so that said it all we were in the middle of no where no cafes or bars near by I was so glad that we were leaving the next day 5 days too long some staff were nice to us but most were rude and aggressive and there was never any where to sit by the pool as all the French rush out early and put there towels on the loungers even though there is a sign they don't care I do have photos we were told not to take any of the dinning room the entertainment was again awful and no one could sing so think before you book not this hotel as you too will be very disappointed,Date of stay: September 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chazd933

Pros;  Staff are very polite and are so good to help you out with anything. warm welcoming on arrival)  Restaurant is really nice I took a great loving with the pizza and fresh ice cream.  Donuts and pancakes were made fresh daily and they were amazing as I came here expecting to not be able to eat anything and there is so much to choose from.  Special thanks to who ever the Pastry chef was the cakes that were made were out of this world!  Like the touch when you get the Big bottles 1l of drinks in the restaurants  I like the fact the all include started at 10 most country's are 12  Abdelfttah(Essag hraomi) always helpful in restaurant I think they all do very well in there but he just made the extra mile for all of us  Freshly squeezed orange juice in morning and the Moroccan tea in the mornings.  The rooms are love big and spacious and are cleaned daily.    There is also a shuttle bus going to the local town daily I think they run every hour book the day before to get your place or get a taxi it was £5 as that's what they're rate started at    Cons;  I think you should consider adding a Swim up bar it would make all the difference as the bar is too far from the main big pool.  Add a la carts restaurants  New mattresses on bed the only thing I would have to fault with the beds is the mattress they were so hard didn't have the best nights sleep here  Never replaced room towels or when they were taken they weren't replaced and always had to call reception  And there is no TGI Fridays in the mall no matter if the sign still shows the told me they closed 2 years ago but still have the sign up that was a guttering evening as we fancied something different    When going to the big square just be careful if you see the monkeys or cobra snakes they will want you to pay £10 for a couple photos and when I said no that's too much they cornered me calling me names so just be weary of you want pictures    We also ate in the big square at no.81 in the food court street food was amazing and so cheap!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Pixieemma wrote a review Oct 2016,20,"Awful food, drink and service - Pool and grounds are the redeeming feature","I just got back from a 4 night stay here with my boyfriend and first time in Marrakech. First impressions were great when looking at the reception area grounds and pool. We checked into our room which seemed very dated with no water/tea facilities and even though a double room was booked it was twin beds which even when pushed together kept moving apart which wasnt romantic or comfortable at all.    We realised there was some small marks on the sheets - I've stayed at many places before and arent someone to complain about things so just assumed we'd get a fresh set of sheets anyway tomorrow. The next day the bed was made but we realised that actually none of the sheets were changed and on further inspection they were a lot dirtier than I thought with blood marks and even an old dirty bloodied plaster which was attached to an extra duvet I got from the cupboard. We called the front desk who sent some guys up to address this and they couldnt speak english or understand what the problem was and then even when we pointed it out they had a real attitude and only took the bottom sheet and duvet away and didnt even change old pillows etc. They went away and during this time the front desk called to ""make sure they were doing their job"" and when they came back 20 minutes later and put what we thought were a fresh set of sheets on we got into bed to realise it still had exactly the same dirt marks in most places and they didnt even smell like they had been through a wash it seemed like they had just had a quick scrub at some of the stains. We did intend to raise this with reception however out of all the times we stopped by when it was convienient for us the desk was inundated with queues of people and we just wanted to get on and enjoy our time.    I could look past the room issues as an isolated incident but the food was just absolutely disgusting and both myself and boyfriend barely ate during the time we were there even though it was all inclusive and he now has a bad stomach bug upon returning. It wasnt that it was just repetitive which it was even comparing breakfast and dinner but the quality of food was inedible dirty trays/serving tools and none of the items would even go together to make a meal. There was never any clean cutlery glasses or plates around and a lot of the service was inconsistant with them offering tea/coffee/ice cream one day and then nothing the next.    Flies were absolutely everywhere which is to be expected in hot countries but this was excessive amounts with no attempt to deal with them. The outside bar food service had no protection so the food was just laid out with flies swarming all over the buffet items for people to take when a simple beaded curtain or shutter would help contain things. At the pool bar the soft drinks machine was covered with them like a hive and even crawling up into the piping the staff werent even bothered enough to try and swat them away when they went to pour you a drink.    Service wise there was a definite preference to locals or the french even though we were extremely polite and made an effort to address them in the french we knew. If you apprpached the bar or towel desk they would have 4/5 of them stood there chatting to each other for as long as they felt before even addressing you. The alcohol offerings were also disgusting so we didnt use any of this and they would display high end branded bottles in the bar which they didnt actually have and what you were served always had the same taste of bleach.    The only redeeming features to this hotel is the big clean pools and slides nice grounds shuttle service to the centre and we also like that there was lots of cats who seemed well looked after.    Overall I feel like I was cheated into paying for an all inclusive experience but not using any of it because it was so dire with no effort to improve as they know you are a captured audience. If I was to go again I would stick with my gut and go back to a RIU hotel for all inclusive or stay in one of the beautiful riads in the centre and eat out.",Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixieemma
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kirsty W wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Fantastic holiday,We arrived late in the evening during a thunderstorm after a long day of travelling from scotland to manchester to catch our flight then getting to Marrakesh we were pretty done in. The airport was fine there was a bit of a wait in the line for visa checks I have since heard you can arrange a fast track service for a fee through your hotel which we definitely would have considered.  We got a taxi right outside the airport and it was minutes until we arrived at the hotel the reception area was beautiful and the staff behind the desk were very welcoming we were informed we could leave our bags and catch the restaurant before it closed so we had some food and then we checked in.  The room we were first placed in seemed to be for disabled use the bathroom had been set up like a wet room and when my husband had a well needed shower he managed to pretty much flood the room cue grumpy tired phone call to reception they sent someone along to clean up and asked us to go and speak to them in the morning.  So we did and they kindly upgraded us to the privilege Riad as an apology I would recommend paying for the upgrade as it was a lovely quiet part at the back of the resort with its own semi private pool no lack of sunbeds the lovely Samia looking after you.. She's the lady who kept us going in soft drinks and coffee by the pool while we baked in the sun bliss!  The room was great good size massive bed and plenty of storage space there was also a bath which was a definite bonus. The rooms have a small fridge to keep water in and I think if you have paid for the upgrade that also has a small mini bar of soft drinks as well.  The rooms were kept very clean I particularly liked that they mopped the floors every day so your feet didn't get dirty walking around barefoot all the time.  The restaurant was large and there were plenty of staff to get your drinks and clear your table between courses I loved that you could have a whole bottle of wine with a meal and it was very nice wine in an ice bucket they also didn't mind you taking the rest to sit outside after dinner. The food was varied and we always found something good to eat I particularly loved the savoury doughnuts at breakfast delicious! We both enjoyed the various tagines my favourite was definitely the beef! My husband ate more deserts during this holiday than I've ever seen before morrocan desserts particularly.  The main pool we didn't spend much time around but there seemed to be plenty going on the animation team were around all day and kept the families entertained. The pool area was huge with plenty of sunbeds and there was a snack bar with pizza and cakes etc during the day between meal times.  One thing we really loved about this hotel was the grounds spectacularly maintained gardens olive trees and flowers everywhere with the odd interesting abstract sculpture which was quite funny.  The hotel offers a regular free shuttle bus to Marrakesh we used this one evening to have a look around the markets. It was pretty crazy and busy but fun and we finished off our evening with a couple of beers and some street food.  This was a much better hotel and holiday than we probably were expecting I would recommend this hotel highly you get loads for your money!  The only slight downside for me was the amount of rude guests pushing in front of you in the bar or restaurant and snapping their fingers at staff my husband and I are generally very polite and have good manners it would seem that in certain other nationalities it is less common. However we didn't let this ruin our holiday and we would return.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyB748

Our room was lovely cleaned every day with fresh towels and bedding.  The food in the restaurant was varied yes there were some of the same things but there was also different things every day fresh fish tagines salads rice couscous koftas and for the less adventurous English food as well. Always plenty of fresh fruit and yogurt. Mountains of oranges for the freshly squeezed orange juice.  The pool area was clean and regularly cleared of glasses and cups etc. The pools themselves well maintained. Plenty of activities for those that were interested but if you weren't you didn't get hassled into joining in.  The staff - what you need to remember is English is not their first language or their second. But with a sense of humour which they do appreciate it is very easy to get on good terms with them. I love my Yorkshire tea so took teabags and a mug with me and by the third day I was going to the poolside bar and they knew exactly how I liked my tea made. As with all these things if you treat people how you would want to be treated language is no longer a barrier.  The pool side snack bar team were amazing worked so hard all day and then some in the evening. The restaurant staff again always friendly and helpful we always sat outside and the waiter always remembered what drinks we had each day. The reception team were polite efficient and friendly just what you want when all you want to do is get back out in the sun again.  The only little niggles and they were little was the loudness of the music by the large pool throughout the day. And the evening entertainment. The entertainment was more Moroccan style but the majority of guests were Moroccan so what can you expect.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,150Debra150 wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Average hotel,Myself and a friend stayed at this hotel for one week in September 2016. Having arrived at the hotel at 11.00am we were advised that our room would not be available until 2.30pm. This wasn't a problem as we were given our all-inclusive wristbands so could still use the facilities. Having returned to reception at 2.30pm we were advised that our room still wasn't ready and we had to wait. The reception staff were rude unfriendly and happy to talk amongst themselves rather than help us. We eventually got into our room at 3.30pm.  When we finally got to our room it was a good size and clean. The minibar only consisted of one bottle of water and this was never replaced during our stay. The sheets weren't fresh every day either.  The pool facilities were good although the pool bar was surrounded by flies and smelt awful. The cocktails from here were hit and miss. Best to have beer or wine although at night-time I would recommend mojitos from the main bar!  The entertainment staff were brilliant even if most of the shows were pretty naff.  Food was average and repetitive. The a-la carte Moroccan restaurant was the best but you have to pay extra for this.    Also if you are a female visitor beware!!. I don't think I've ever been propositioned so much (from male staff at hotel) as on this holiday.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/150Debra150

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,bxley wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Good Stay at a fair price,"A very relaxing place to holiday. Mainly french speaking people around whilst we stayed but they and the staff very welcoming. Staff are very attentive and friendly in the most part. Bar staff in the pool area leave a bit to be desired??? Not very switched on to who has been waiting and are prone to blatantly ignoring people. The staff on the reception desk are all to often trying so hard to help they jump from person to person and get things mixed up rather than asking people to wait their turn and concentrating on the person in hand.    The food is good but for me not enough ""local"" food until the Moroccan night. The staff in the restaurant are very attentive and helpful. The chef even passed on his recipe for Octopus Tagine.    Staff at the evening bar and the entertainment are fantastic and really try to get everyone involved.    We had a suite which was very nice and comfortable but I think coming to the end of the season it was not at its best.    Overall a very good place for the price paid and one both myself and my wife will be returning to.",Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chippenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bxley
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Annabel S wrote a review Sep 2016,20,Awful food and service,"The hotel itself is quite amiable however I have been lucky enough to stay in 4 & 5 star hotels in my life and travel a lot with work and this was neither I would say its a 3* at best.  I have seen certain people mention that that you get what you pay for however I would have to disagree! I think there are a lot of deals nowadays for better value for money so no excuse. The main amenities of a hotel for me is good service and food and this is not what I experienced during my stay and I can see that a lot of people have experienced this so why hasn't it been resolved.  I stayed for a week and got ill a couple of times the meat was not cooked properly and potatoes were raw plus there was a very limited choice of food. The drinks were also very disappointing especially the cocktails I was not expecting anything fancy however I really wouldn't recommend the ""Pina colada"" or whatever blue sugar watered down concoction they made me which I am pretty sure they also used to kill the rodents and insects in the hotel. I had one and decided its safer to stick to wines and beers.  Another factor which might not affect everyone is when booking it states there is WIFI however the only place that has full connection is the lobby. I only found this bothersome as I need to check emails for work so walking each time to the lobby can become tedious.  The staff of the hotel do not speak much English and are not very polite/ helpful which was extremely frustrating at times however my cleaner was very lovely and the staff at the spa were also friendly.    Also you have to pay to use the safe which I didn't mind so much if it actually worked and didn't break all the time so they had to keep sending someone to fix it.    The weather was okay around 30 degrees with some clouds but overall very warm.    I would suggest another hotel this is my forth time in Morocco and never had a problem or this many in any of my stays so unless you are planning on going out seeing the sites and eating out I would say its a NO GO!",Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/171annabels
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,AUSLion wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Marrakech adventure,We stayed at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina for 5 nights for our Marrakech adventure. First impressions were very good - room was spacious good assistance to get us to our room and helpful with considering some tour options.    It was our first All Inclusive experience and we are not sure we would prioritise this approach for future travels. We mainly did breakfast but were never on site for lunch and dinner was ok. The option for drinks was the typical house drinks nothing special.    We found that we enjoyed wandering the streets of Marrakech and watching and experiencing the sights and sounds and tastes was our highlight so the hotel became a place to rest our head. The pool on-site was welcome relief on the typical hot days. And we used the basic water slides as often as we could (just like big kids!).    Our only challenge experienced was with the wi-fi which was very much hit and miss and we lost connection for more than 24 hours at a time and more than once. We did lodge a complaint on a number of occasions and whilst nothing was really fixed for us during the stay they did offer (and we accepted) a free airport transfer for our departure. So that was something at least.    We would recommend if you were looking to laze by the pool every day and eat as much food as you could. But for us next time we will stay in town in a more traditional accomodation and maximise our exploring time.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AUSLion

Restaurant staff fantastic especially Absassamud who looked after our family of four in the outside dining area for breakfast and lunch. Also our cleaner Fatima Zahlo did a great job too - my wife and I were in room 824 (on first floor) which was southern facing and looked onto the adult pool so a good location. Food and drink was fine.We also enjoyed the air rifle shooting archery and golf plus very few English here - mainly French which felt that we really were on holiday.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,119Barbara wrote a review Sep 2016,30,A lovely mini break,I have to agree with many of the comments that it is not 5* as far as the rooms are concerned.  However the reception restaurant pools and garden are immaculate.  There are plenty of sunbeds around the pools and dotted under olive trees. This is unusual in such a big hotel. Pool was spotlessly clean.  We had several issues with our room but all were dealt with reasonable quickly. No problem with wi-fi at all.  We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful especially our maid.  The food in the restaurant was varied but sometimes dishes ran out and not always replaced. Was definitely better the earlier you went. Have to agree with other reviews that it could have been hotter. Biggest bugbear with restaurant has nothing to do with hotel but greed. So much food left uneaten by guests.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Chebcoo wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Fantastic holiday,Outside of the hotel was very simple so I was not expecting much but going inside and after walking around I was very impressed. It looked posh. Lots of greenery; olive trees and lights lined the pathways. All rooms have balcony and very clean. We ride a cart to reach our riad which was at the end of the resort. We paid extra for a room in this riad as it has its own shared private pool and snack bar. It was very quiet and private. Staff speaks Arabic French and English. There are some facilities that we had to pay for like the use of the indoor pool and spa. We had hammam and massage. It was very affordable though. Food was ok lots of variety to choose from. We adked for sparkling water and coke and we were given a litre of each which was great and we brought it to our room. There was a snack bar and disco. Friday is Moroccan theme in the restaurant and evening entertainment. There was a lot of daytime activities to do like tennis golftable tennis archery arabiccooking and dancing classes. There were 5 pools in the resort-private pool by Riad La Roseraie deep pool kids pool big pool with 3 slides and the indoor pool. There was also a minifarm for children. Animation team was great and performs well. Unlike other animation teams who has a lot of audience participation Kenzi Club animation team was more of performers which I preferred. We will definitely be coming back next year.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chebcoo
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Paul&Leah wrote a review Sep 2016,40,5 Days of Fun,We stayed from the 15th-20th Sep (4 couples) and overall it was a good trip.    It's definitely not 5 star but neither is it 5 star prices so for me you get what you pay for which was a reasonable quality of hotel. What we paid for 5 nights all inclusive was less than 1 night room only in many hotels around the world.    It's staff are very good in the service areas especially the main bar and restaurant. The odd small dirham Euro pound or dollar tip goes a long way to improve this which I'm happy to do.    Hotel was always clean so no complaints there.    Food was ok some good some bad but overall no issues.    The drinks were also overall ok wine bearable beer cold and cocktails a bit hit and miss.    Plenty of entertainment mostly in French but some entertainment staff had a laugh and a joke in English.    We found it tough to get the reception desk to fix the safe and repair the sink but after 6 calls to reception it got done. We were also never charged for using the safe probably because of the aggravation in getting it to work. Otherwise it was about £2.50 a day.    £15 a towel deposit returned at the end if you don't lose your towels.    A final nice touch was 4 shower rooms with towels hair dryers and sockets to get ready before leaving if on a late flight this was free and we could still use the all-inclusive until we left in the evening.    A good late summer break with mostly ideal weather low 30's and sun with just one cloudy morning.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global802931

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LOYORK wrote a review Sep 2016,30,What an experience!!!,Arrived late after what seemed the longest wait to get through immigration quick private taxi transfer although name on board no one manning it!!! When we looked further they were sitting on the curb smoking and having a chat!!  On arrival at hotel informed we had been upgraded our room was right at the end of the complex overlooking the tennis courts  got a buggy ride looked very impressive as all the rooms situated here share a private pool.  Room clean but when checked it's a standard room so where the upgrade comes in other than the pool I don't know?  Choice of a couple of pools nice clean and plenty of sun beds. Pool bar so so busy at all times now here's the first of the down sides we experienced as 2 women travelling together and I know other ladies at the hotel on their own did too the staff really don't want to serve ladies on their own they will serve everyone else first before you regardless of the fact you have been waiting ages.  As a vegetarian having visited Tunisia India and Egypt I have always eaten well and my dietary requests more than catered for here  was a different tale the staff assume you know the procedure you sit and you sit until finally they come to ask what you want to drink then the fun starts the restaurant is very large and clean however it's a fight for survival  not at all a pleasant experience the food the same over and over again luke warm and the queues for anything fresh ridiculous I was actually hungry which having paid for 5* I don't find acceptable.  We went on the shuttle bus to the market's  as soon as we got off the bus we were harassed by so called guides one followed us and another couple of ladies for at least 10 minutes once he realised we weren't going to use his service he got very nasty swearing and hurling abuse at us all very unnerving and so unexpected!!!  However this wasn't the only case as when we left a shop one man followed us screaming foul abuse they clearly do not respect ladies on their own we heard other stories too of tourists paying silly money for what can only be described as tat!! Be careful you don't need a guide haggle and be firm  but ladies on your own be extra careful. Not all shop keepers were this rude one guy followed us once he had found what we had been looking at in our size so there are some good ones too.  The hotel caters for French all the announcements are mainly in French occasionally a very hurried English sentence thrown in the animation team provided the most of the entertainment in form of dance the head choreographer absolutely amazing I could have watched him all night long mesmerising. Again don't cater for the English even when more English guests arrive it's mainly French music.  I have to say we were glad to be going 1 week was more than enough the spa I fully recommend lovely experience other than that we didn't look back as we left.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mariaandjeff wrote a review Sep 2016,30,Good break for a week - but wouldn't stay longer. Be aware of the excursion you book,Just returned from a weeks holiday. We enjoyed it but glad we were only there a week. Firstly I have to say the staff are brilliant. Always smiling and helpful we enjoyed some great laughs with them. The food was ok - as others have said it is repetitive but it is hot and you can always pick something. They make a lot of effort with the desserts - great selection but very very sweet. We booked a meal in the on-site Morroccan a la carte - and wished we hadn't as it was the worst food we had all week. Just a tip if you book a trip to the souk with Sunmaster rep it is advertised that the guide that takes you there helps you to haggle - please be aware that he takes you to a friends pharmacy to buy creams oils ans spices (which we did last time we were in Marrakesh) and although he takes you through the souk he stops then for you to shop at his friends large shop - so you don't actually haggle at any unique small shops you pass on the way. My husband and I went with the guide (cost us £20 each for the afternoon) but also went to the souk on our own which we enjoyed more. I felt safe in Marrakesh although we were hassled a bit by shop keepers you just need to be friendly but firm. I paid £40 for a gorgeous pouffee (camel skin) and £15 for a beatiful hand stitched kaftan. Both the shop keepers and I were happy with these prices - and thank you to my husband the brilliant haggler 😘.

The food was ok but repetitive. The grounds are kept very tidy and the staff are very friendly (except on reception they are very lazy and would rather talk than help) and in no way favour any one by nationality. The hotel charges for extras i.e. Safe which is about £16 for the week we just secured are valuables in our case. The entertainment is good and they are brilliant with kids. There is the city tax to pay when you leave the hotel which is around £18 for two people one week.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JBorrett wrote a review Sep 2016,30,"Amazing Hotel, Disappointed with the Food",On arrival to the hotel we were blown away the entrance was impressive and so was the rest of the grounds. Reception staff were very quick in checking us in and very efficient. To soften the deal we had mojitos which made the mandatory form filling easier. Overall the staff were very friendly and welcoming to the resort.    Before you check in you will be asked to pay tax which was around 250 dirham for two of us for a week. We were happy to pay this as you do not buy a visa before entering the country. There is also an option to have a safe however this was around 300 dirham for the week.    Once our room had been assigned we were taken to our hotel room which was lovely and very spacious. It was extremely clean and we couldn't have asked for anymore. Throughout our stay we had an amazing house cleaner called Ayicia who was extremely thorough polite and friendly.    There are two pools which are very clean and the main swimming pool has water slides so is kid friendly. There is also a mini club available to them.    The only downside we found to our trip was unfortunately the food. Me and my boyfriend are not fussy eaters however we did find choosing what to eat for lunch and dinner quiet difficult. By the time we got our food back to our seating area we found it got cold rather quickly and there was not much variety from night to night. We also suffered with unsettled stomachs/vomiting and feeling very unwell the majority of our stay which we feel came from the food also. For the last couple of nights of our stay we went out for dinner and even resulted in ordering KFC one night as we were not impressed greatly by the restaurants in the old town. This was the biggest disappointment for us as it made lunch and dinner very mundane and boring.    One of the first nights we were there once we were seated with our food we found our turkey breast had not been cooked properly and was still uncooked which immediately put us off the food.    In regards to the cocktails we were also disappointed as they did not resemble the cocktails you could get outside of the resort. (The cocktail we had on arrival gave us high hopes however you couldn't get this again once you had checked in) For instance we ordered a Pina Colada at the entertainment bar which was pineapple juice and vodka rather than a traditional one. We resulted to going out for cocktails of an evening as they were very unpleasant (cocktails outside are about 110 dirham which is around £8).    Myself and my boyfriend are English and we found it very difficult to communicate with some of the staff at the resort. Reception staff were very good at conversing with us however we did struggle in the restaurant and at the pool bars. We lost our towels one evening and trying to speak to individuals to get them back was almost impossible (with the help of the reception staff we found them in the end). Make sure you bring your own towel as there is a charge to use the resorts we would have been charged around 200 dirham to use the towels for a week. This also came to light during the night time entertainment where the host would only speak in Arabic and French. We struggled to understand the shows every night as we were unaware of what was going on.    The majority of the guests at the hotel were French and could be very rude at times- this is not a comment directed at the hotel however something for individuals who are English looking to go to watch.    The hotel has massive potential as the hotel itself is beautiful and the grounds are so well looked after. However unfortunately there is still more work needed around the food and cocktails provided to guests.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rayleigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBorrett
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CLCowlin wrote a review Sep 2016,30,All inclusive visit UK guest,I would like to begin saying that on arrival to this hotel it looks amazing the hotel is beautiful.    Me and my partner visited this hotel on an all inclusive basis. We were greeted at the reception with an ice cold drink which was very nice indeed. We then checked in and had to pay tax for our stay which was 16DH a night per person. After this we were taken to our room on a buggy our suitcases were taken by staff and loaded on to the buggy. I was very impressed with this service at this point.    The room was very clean and tidy on arrival .    Me and my partner went for dinner on the first night which I was disappointed with. The food looks very nice and there is a variety of food to choose from (none English) when taking the food back to the table the food felt like warm and didn't feel cooked. I looked inside the turkey breast which I was eating and discovered it to not be cooked properly and was still pink inside. This immediately put me off my food and did not eat any more as all the food was cold by this point.    We then went to the bar for drinks where the entertainment would be held there was a cocktail menu so I decided to have a cocktail (if you like cocktails this is not the place for you ) the cocktails are awful. They are literally all just mixed together already in a jug which then the bar staff would pour into a glass and add a spirit into. I was very disappointed with the drinks.    The entertainment is ok if you are a kid. There is a show for adults which runs for around an hour. If you are English you will not understand a word and will not know what is going on as none of the commentary is translated into English.    The pools are clean and are very nice with waterslides for kids in one also one for the toddlers.    Again the food become very repeatable and within the week I saw the same dish around 4 times. Breakfast was bearable and lunch was ok too. The food is not amazing here and doesn't really cater for English people. My partner was sick from the food and in the end resulted in us eating lots of bread as every day and night the food just didn't feel cooked and was cold. Take note I am not a fussy eater and will eat anything given to me.    The snack bar in the day was again awful. Pancakes pizza and donuts everyday. Ok it's alright for the first couple of days but just becomes boring.    I would also like to add that if you are an English person visiting this hotel 95% of the hotel staff and guests are French or Arabic staff know very little English and is hard to translate anything. I found that some of the staff at the snack bar were very rude although the staff at reception were very helpful (when they could understand) this becomes very hard work trying to speak to anyone.    Overall I would say that the hotel is amazing the grounds are beautiful and would just like to say a big Thankyou to the maid Ayesha who was very kind and helpful when cleaning our room (although she couldn't understand a word we we're saying)    Also I would just like to add that in addition to your stay if you are looking to visit the gym or spa this will be at an extra cost 250dh a week for gym and around 300dh for a massage.    This hotel has huge potential to be fantastic with a few tweaks unfortunately it is let down by its food entertainment and overly French populated staff and guests who don't understand any English and can be very rude at times.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Rayleigh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLCowlin

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sophie M wrote a review Sep 2016,10,Not as expected! Disappointing stay! Hotel STOLE from us!!,"The hotel's reviews portray it in a very different light than we experienced! We found the rooms to be average at best the aircon released a dirty drain smell and the cleaners didn't change the sheets once throughout our stay! Perhaps first and foremost a warning to future guests the Kenzi Club Agdal STOLE FROM US! We were told upon check in we had to pay 150 DH each for a 'towel deposit' after which we received two cards of proof of payment to exchange in for worn old towels. At no point was it explained to us in French nor English that alongside the mountain of documents handed to us a thin slip of paper would guarantee our deposit returned and upon our departure we handed back our cards and were told this wasn't enough! We obviously were not lying so asked them to check their system for proof however they don't use electronic system to log it and ""searched"" their receipts very begrudgingly. Unsurprisingly the one person they didn't tell this to the receipt also goes missing for! We requested to view CCTV footage of the exact time we placed the deposit - we had bought the safe use at the same time and that gave a timestamp. However of course this was not possible either. We are evidently not liars and at no point during the ordeal were any of the staff in anyway apologetic for their lack of organisation and communication skills. One receptionist even smirked from behind a curtain and the customer service was frankly APPALLING! We also booked a trip through Rashid - who works behind a desk in the hotel lobby and who declared that trips through anyone else are not the responsibility of the hotel - but his was. With this in mind we booked a trip to Ouzoud Falls but the 'short' 2 hour journey was incorrect it was over 3.5 hours each way to the waterfall so around 7 hours of our day sat doing nothing! Had we been informed correctly we would still have gone on the trip but brought books etc to bide the time. The road itself was incredibly windy one woman having to get off to be sick which I understand the guide cannot help however no mention was given to those with car sickness. Then we embarked on an hour and a bit trek through very steep clearings down the mountain which I enjoyed but no mention of correct footwear or our physical fitness was taken and could have been very dangerous for some. The Falls were nice we weren't given much information about them other than 'they are the highest in the world' - not even the highest in North Africa! Considering our trip was made up of 10 people 7 of which were British the guide spoke in very little English and chose to speak in German to the 3 German tourists not even from our hotel! We explained our problems to reception but they didn't seem bothered at all claiming no responsibility (despite written confirmation from Rashid they are endorsing him!) And not a single sorry was said. The food was okay a lovely Moroccan themed night on one dinner time cocktails a little bland - the pool bar offers much more choice. Also the hotel do not provide bottled water at breakfast in 40 degree heat which considering we paid for an all inclusive package this is a bit of a joke! The pools shut even for adults and despite not being supervised during the day anyway at 6pm. We were slightly disappointed with the lack of Moroccan culture displayed within the hotel very little traditional Moroccan cuisine was on offer and no traditional Moroccan dance or language on display unless you paid for the restaurant. The small tasters of Moroccan food included a chicken kebab one day that was bright pink and evidently raw so we had to refuse it! Overall I would not return even if you paid me every day was horrible experience mostly ending in tears and disappointment. Preferential treatment was constantly given to the French and this was quite insulting as all money equals the same! The hotel ruined our Moroccan experience so really consider before booking to stay here! -10/10!!!",Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Carmarthenshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H4117YVsophiem
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,owen1408 wrote a review Sep 2016,50,"Fantastic service & food, all the facilities we wanted and more",We stayed here the first week in April and are 2 more very happy customers.    5 star? - I'd say 4 star plus by UK/Spanish standards having worked as a reception manager and a rep in my youth in both countries. Silly little things like getting a cup of coffee at breakfast – the cup is on the table the spoon is at the far side of the restaurant the milk is in the middle of the restaurant and the coffee itself you have to ask a waiter for. We were two but they were only leaving us 1 towel each day though when we asked they came straight away with more. The housekeeper threw away a couple of receipts I left by my bed that I needed. Problems leaving the hotel after paying my bill as the cashier forgot to give me a ticket so security wouldn't let me out with my case. Normally I wouldn't mention anything but I see comments saying the hotel is a 3.5 star and it's not. A little bit more attention to detail and it's very much a five star. It felt like the hotel was at around 50-75% occupancy when we were there. If it was any more than that then well done Kenzi. So many staff and all very efficient and polite. Sanna isn't all smiles and cuddles as I read but she sorted out a mistake with our booking very quickly and gets everyone checked in promptly better than chatting with everyone I think so she does a good job! I'd also have a little moan about the towel deposit system especially if you are sent from one pool to the other then to reception then back to the pool again with a stop off at your room for some cash on the way all in 50C.    The Pools – There is one HUGE pool with kids and slides at one end but generally more adults only at the other. There's pool-zumba and all sorts going on along with music and a nice big pool bar there too. The other smaller pool by the Spa is their Zen pool. Kids must be supervised at all times there not left to run around on their own. Whilst we were there we didn't see any kids at all there lovely and peaceful. No music and another pool bar. Both pool bars served alcohol so that seems to have changed. What more do you want? I think that covers everything for everyone? Plenty of free sunbeds as the hotel wasn't full but they also remove towels after an hour or so if nobody is there. None of the sun-loungers needed repairing or painting as I read elsewhere (they looked new). There's also a “Riad Privilege” option I believe (not tried or visited) with different rooms in a different area adults only and a quiet separate pool. If you have to be away from kids and entertainment a) pick the privilege option or b) don't go in school holidays.    Security – Very impressed to see the complex surrounded by a very high wall and a security guard and metal detector to pass at the entrance. That's all though. The metal detector beeped at everyone going in but nobody was ever stopped nor bags scanned so anyone could have taken anything in. Also I left my key in the room during my stay and went to reception with ID plus my room card but nothing was checked. The guy on reception (around 10pm on 7 September – sorry mate but they should know) asked me what room number then gave me the key without asking anything else from me. If you're going to charge for a safe (odd when you pay for all-inclusive) then beef up the security a little.    Restaurant – I didn't find the food repetitive at all. I'm a fussy eater and everything I tried was delicious. First night was lamb couscous my favorite though it was replaced the next night with beef then fish…… there must have been around 10 hot dishes and 20 cold dishes plus salads and deserts so even if it was the same (it wasn't it varied a lot) that should keep you happy for two weeks. Service was impeccable and everything looked lovely and clean. They have a good vegetarian section and even a steamed food section (what's that about?). The house wine left a lot to be desired but we weren't paying extra for it (all inclusive) so I shouldn't say anything. Loved the guy squeezing fruit all morning so you could see it was all fresh. Us Brits love our deserts yes they were the same every day.I read a comment that you struggle to find a bite of food – ridiculous ignore that review something must have happened to p**s him off.    The Room – Very spacious well-maintained modern with a sofa at the far end and patio doors onto a balcony. We had views of the garden. I like that either side of the balcony is a drop and bushes/trees so you can't climb from one to the next. Big athroom has a full size bath and a powerful shower. There's a half- fridge which was welcomed. Though it wasn't stocked we took bottled water from the restaurant back to the room. The beds were so comfy huge thick mattresses and a choice of sheet or duvet. 4 pillows plus spare. Air conditioning we had on the lowest setting which was enough for us even during the day when it was 50C in the sun. Not a great choice of UK or Spanish channels (BBC World News or TVE1) but when they play movies it's often in version original with subtitles. The maids did a fantastic job fresh towels daily beds made ….    Location / Shuttle Bus – There's a shopping mall about a 20 minute walk from the hotel otherwise walking nothing much other than wasteland. It's only a 10 minute drive into the center of Marrakesh and there's a free air-conditioned shuttle bus every hour during the day. Be sure to book it going as it fills. We booked coming back too though it was never more than half full so if you miss your bus coming back go and wait for the next one.    The Spa – Very quiet indoor pool lovely on the 50C heat days. I had a relaxing massage for 250 dirham which was lovely.    The French – if it were true in the past that the French got preferential treatment then it wasn't when we were there. Everyone is served in order and nobody had any special treatment. Maybe when we were there the percentage of French had dropped maybe we were the only brits or Spanish who knows not me.    WiFi – People like Booking.com and Tripadvisor score you (Kenzi) on half a dozen aspects and one of them is WiFi. That's bringing your overall score down. I net that 8 out of 10 would be a 9 kor more if your WiFi was faster with more access points. The service is dreadful. It's there but it's so slow and stops and starts that it's not worth bothering with. We went to reception to check emails and update social media as the signal and speed was OK there but elsewhere no.    The Medina – Is a must! Even if you don't like shopping get out of the hotel and go see the Medina. A never-ending maize of streets packed with stalls. Start haggling at a third of what they ask and aim to finish at around 50% of their initial asking price. I managed to get two big (Ryain air cabin size) leather bags for 300 dirham each and they hand made me (from scratch) two very thich studded dog collars for my two doberman for 150 euros. Took around 40 minutes but we had plenty of tea and chat whilst we waited quite a nice experience. Haggle at two or three places before you go in for a serious shop so you know what price to expect and you'll find as you're walking away from one the price drops to whatever your last offer was.    Kids – I can't comment much other than they were entertained have their own section of the pool with slides and didn't bother me once whilst I was there.    My only other comment is there's nothing quiet and relaxing to do of an evening so you have to go to the main bar and watch everyone dancing to Agadoo full blast. A lounge-bar at the other end of the complex would be a blessing.    If you want a true five star experience as compared to the UK or Spain (I'm from both) then look for a hotel that charges double or more than this one. If you want a five-star Moroccon hotel than yes this ticks all the important boxes. Fantastic food fantastic service lovely air-conditioned rooms and great facilities that should suite everyone.    I'll be back in Marrakech at the end of the year and will be staying here again.,Date of stay: September 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Gran Canaria,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/owen1408
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mrs J wrote a review Sep 2016,50,Great holiday,We arrived at the hotel on 30th August for a week. From beginning to end it was a fabulous break. The staff are all friendly and any requests we had were seen to within minutes. Our room was immaculate and close to the restaurant and pool. Food and service in the restaurant was very good with a wide variety of choice and everything was fresh and well cooked. Bar staff even during busy times served us quickly. the entertainment was typical all inclusive but ok. Omar and Amal at the mini club were excellent and went out of their way to entertain my 7 year old daughter she actually didn't want to leave their company which was great as it gave me time out by the pool! I would highly recommend room 811 perfect location close to everything and I will look to returning there again.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JuggalettePL wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Good week in Marrakesh,We stayed in the hotel at late April (5nights).  Reception team was helpful and friendly. Our luggage was taken from us on the entrance of the hotel and stored in a separate room which was open for anyone to go into (you could with no problem take someone else’s bag to be fair). We enjoyed the stay room was big clean and had a working air con pools were clean and there was more than enough sunbeds around for everyone. Except one bartender everyone spoke English even that 99% of guests were French. Food was ok but a bit repetitive after few days you just wanted to have something else. As we were departing early in the morning (just after breakfast started) we're hoping for at least some sandwiches or an egg for breakfast but unfortunately only things that were available early in the morning was coffee and pastries.  Shuttle bus is available from the hotel to central Marrakesh for free but you have to book it both ways at reception and it is 15 min ride.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,bumpy74 wrote a review Aug 2016,40,Good week in Marrakech 🏊🏻🍹🍻👙🌞🌞,We booked this hotel as a relatively inexpensive sunshine break for 4 of us -2 adults 2 children and overall we had a good week.    - Rooms - the rooms were huge  well maintained and cleaned daily  we were on the ground floor and yes we did have a few ants but we were surrounded by greenery . The grounds were really well maintained  - Shuttle Bus  we used this to go into Marrakesh and paid for a local guide which was organised by one of the tours desks - this worked perfectly - shuttle bus took 10 minutes and was really reliable. I loved the souk and medina what an experience .  Pools - 2 big pools lots of sun beds available at anytime plenty of tables and large beds to choose from  - Entertainment - they never stopped and was lots of activities if you wanted to join in  they were happier speaking French than English but wasn't a problem.  Food - there was a lot of choice but I'm glad I came for a week and not 2 as would have been very repetitive but was replenished quickly  waiters were generally really good here  wine by the bottle or glass beer and soft drinks were all available ( Miguet was always happy and smiling )  Pool Bar - I didn't see any preference of French apart from 1 guy who said he didn't understand English when I asked for a Coke please - Hicham did a good job in making sure everyone got served in the right order . They weren't a particularly smiley bunch but I'm not sure I'd be with hundreds of wasps swarming round the drinks machine but there was plenty of choice and never had to wait long.  Also the guys who collected the empty glasses were always so polite  Spa - husband had a massage and used the gym and was pleased with both  Yes there are a few extras such as the safe but these are inexpensive and I've never stayed anywhere that wants a deposit for a beach towel but it made no difference and you got fresh towels daily.  Reception - Sanaa was nice and I'd emailed before I went and got a quick response - they were generally helpful until we checked out.......  We had gone to reception the day before we checked out as I wanted to have a rough idea of what was expected on our bill the lady printed out with the city tax and added on the final day in biro  when I went to check out the guy showed me a calculator which was a couple of hundred dirham more expensive  I asked to see the bill as it differed and he pointed to my son and said you need to pay more for him  I was confused but didn't really know if I needed to pay or not and couldn't understand why it hadn't been added originally he said he is 15 you need to pay more ( he isn't 15 and can only assume he took a guess? ) and you booked 3 adults and 1 child  he had a copy of the booking form which I had which showed 2 adult and 2 children so I asked to see where it said 3 adults and 1 child  he refused and said dont worry my friend will pay the extra and put the original amount on my previous bill through the card machine. This all made me feel a bit uneasy and not entirely comfortable and put a slight damper on an otherwise good week.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Didcot, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bumpy74

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ben g wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Loved it,Stayed with the girlfriend in June and we loved it. Food is very good for buffet style and always something that you would eat. Sure the cocktails are watered down but sure just order two! The beer on tap is flag special which is one of three Moroccan beers brewed in the country and probably the best. People blatantly ignore the rules about no reserving the sun beds so just to it your self. With the heat it's quite difficult to lie in so you will be up early anyway! Rooms are large and cleaned to a high standard. They will try and get away not changing the sheets if they can. Book early to get the shuttle bus into the city. Ignore the guides the hotel has waiting for you. Ask the hotel to organise a taxi for you to the airport. Tip the animation team and bar staff early in your stay. They will make an effort going out of there way to help you in the future.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dundalk, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/731beng

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SGB90 wrote a review Aug 2016,40,Great hotel for families and great location!,As someone who usually travels alone or more recently with my partner I was looking for a family friendly place (as we were a large group of 12 with young children) that would meet all of our needs. I had been in touch with Souhaib prior to flying out and he was excellent in responding to my questions promptly and was very clear about all the charges (I detest surprise charges upon checkout). He was also really helpful in arranging for a shuttle to take us to the hotel.    Upon arrival we were checked in smoothly by Loubna and Mourad both of whom were helpful. We had to pay in Euros but be aware- the hotel does not accept payment in Euro coins only notes! I had a number of coins left over from some trips in Europe and was hoping to utilise these but used dirhams to fund the shortfall in Euros.    The pros:    The hotel is huge! Really nice and stunning grounds which made our walks back to our rooms at night really pleasant. We also enjoyed the tennis grounds which was a short walk from our room.    The staff. Before coming here I came across mixed reviews on the staff but I found that they were very friendly and approachable despite my poor GCSE level French. In particular Muhammed Mourad Salma and Loubna were really friendly and made us feel welcome. The staff in the restaurant were always very pleasant and welcoming despite the hoards of guests. The staff in the Spa particularly Afifa were always really kind and welcoming too and we really enjoyed the massages- I would recommend the energy massage which made my flight home a lot more comfortable!    The cons:    There are a number of reviews which talk about the hotel guests and unfortunately these are somewhat true! It is true that the majority of the guests are French and unfortunately a large number of these guests were very obnoxious! For instance they were largely pushy in the restaurant often pushed in were glum and refused to thank you or smile if you for instance opened a door for them. A lot of them also had unruly children pushing into the queues or (disgustingly) licking the serving spoons for the buffet foods and the parents would do nothing! There are always of course exceptions and there were some French people who would say thank you and our neighbours in the Riad would always say bonjour in the mornings.    The hotel and its all inclusive package is great for large families but if I were to come back with my partner I would definitely stay in a smaller Riad as the large groups of certain guest types are a little too obnoxious to handle.    We also found that our room was not cleaned and we had to call reception to request for cleaning which was eventually done. I suppose that it was the most busiest time of the year and the hotel seems pretty understaffed in respect of housekeeping given the large size.    We also found that we had to pay 30DH a day to use the safe which I found very strange- I have stayed in other hotels and have never seen this in my life and really not a good image for a hotel which is claiming to be 5*.    The only other drawback as others have mentioned here would be the wifi which worked best in the hotel lobby. This wasn't a huge deal for me as i didn't necessarily want to spend my entire holiday glued to my smartphone and the lobby wifi was always a nice (air conditioned) break to catch up on emails and such.    Overall tips/comments:    The hotel experience was really strengthened by the staff who most certainly made up for the guests. The staff were always very polite and saying hello/salaam went a long way. We were always made to feel welcome in the restaurant despite the large number of guests.    Other reviewers mentioned a Riad with a private pool. I didn't stay in this personally but if I was travelling in a smaller group I think I would use this as the main pool was full of kids and I personally prefer some peace and quiet.    I would try to get there early for breakfast/lunch/dinner if you are travelling in a large group. We found it difficult to get a large table as we found large tables were quickly taken by small groups! For instance a large table for 8 would often be taken by 4 people and their handbags! Also after seeing an unruly French child lick the serving spoons I was inclined to be one of the first to get there for the food before another child contaminated.    Getting to the food early also means avoiding large crowds and children who would push in for their 5th serving of pizza. This was really surprising as my group also consisted of small children but these were constantly supervised and controlled by their parents and were taught basic manners like queueing or saying thank you. The food was quite repetitive but the breakfast choices were always plentiful and included fresh juice. I would in particular recommend the Moroccan pastry (located next to the fried eggs). The desserts are usually the same (variants of sponge cake) but we enjoyed the chocolate tart coffee ice cream and the lemon tarts. The main meals were usually the same: pizza pasta tagine based foods and a selection of salads. There were a few days where beef koftas were served and these were pretty tasty.    The hotel also has a great shuttle bus service which goes to the main medina- book this a day in advance.    Overall it was a great stay and a beautiful hotel which is great for families. Thank you to the whole team!,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SGB90
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ShivC83 wrote a review Aug 2016,40,Wedding Entourage,As part of a 80+ wedding group of mixed ages and health the staff were very accommodating. A few issues with language barriers but that is as expected in a foreign country. With some broken French we were able to get what we needed. The staff at reception never answered the phone when I called them but when there in person during the daytime they were extremely helpful. Reception Staff: Mourad was extremely helpful and always friendly! Maria... was awesome too though took some time to get a smile out of her but was very pleasant and helpful always! My wife is Gluten and Dairy Free - before our travels I tried to contact the hotel via email but had no response (this was 6 months before we travelled!! and still no response!!) I then gave up and called them twice and was basically told that she would have to eat what is the kitchen and they didn't know if it would be DaGFree. This worried us a lot! We took our own Soya milk from the UK and I planned to go to the local supermarket to pick up items once I got there. Luckily the Food and Beverages team are awesome! ON arriving I met Veronica and Mohammed - both were awesome in showing us what the wife could eat and let the staff know to assist us throughout the week. They were also awesome in arranging tables for our travelling entourage to sit together at Dinner time and also made a cake for one of our guests 11 year wedding Anniversary. Nothing was too much trouble for them!! They made the stay at the hotel extremely pleasant! Bar staff: Said/Aicha and Icham were always friendly and could have good banter with!    Overall the stay was good.. I would have liked it if the fridges in the room were fully stocked of soft drinks..or re-stocked with water daily at least. The temperature was 46 degrees while we were there so couldn't go anywhere without water! Some of the rooms were not the best - our bathroom had mould in the corners of the bath tub. Not what you would expect in any room.  It would have also been nice to have their main bar open during the day or at least another bar available outside so people relaxing near the kids pool or main pool can get a drink without having to walk all the way to the snack bar near the adult pool.  Animation team were enthusiastic and out there as you would expect - we did find some of their routines on their 80's night not necessarily fit for children to view.  Spa - was ok. Not the best Hammam I have had in Marrakech. You have to pay to use the indoor pool and the gym which is ridiculous for an all inclusive hotel.    All in all was a good visit. Wouldn't necessarily go back and be itching to stay at this hotel as plenty of hotels that would check all the boxes but wasn't a bad experience. They could make a few changes that would make this hotel great.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Stanmore, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShivC83
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Dessiebabiie wrote a review Aug 2016,40,HELLOOO MARRAKECH!!!,Spent a week in this BEAUTIFUL hotel in Marrakech Morocco in early July for my boyfriends birthday & we absolutely had a ball. Let me take you through it. Firstly when you get to Marrakech airport it is a little annoying as you have to fill out forms at passport control and the que is long before finally getting through but you've made it this far. You can exchange currency at the airport & the rates are pretty good we exchanged a little bit of our euro as we heard the hotel exchanges money too it's best to bring euros as it is also accepted locally. Arriving at the hotel around 8ish and was blown away by how beautiful the hotel reception was our bags were taken and set aside as we checked in and moments later were brought two delicious mojitos and I think there was no alcohol in them but they were honestly the best mojitos I've ever had I miss them. Check in was smooth and front desk were friendly. We were taking to our rooms by golf carts and thank God cause it's a bit of a walk as hotel grounds are huge. We stayed in the Privilege Raid which is at the very end and has its own swimming pool and lunch service  I'm not sure how much an upgarde to this raid was but its worth it if you want a bit of privacy and quietness. Rooms are nicely sized with nice bright bathrooms and ether a garden view or balcony view in each room. I love how dinner is late so when we were settled we headed straight for food amazing big restaurant where breakfast lunch and dinner is served buffet style. Plenty of choice for everyone with food constantly being made and brought out or some dishes made live like pancakes pastas pizza fish & meat etc. We enjoyed the meals each night but a little repetitive I must say I expected there to be more of a variety each night but one night they had a Chinese theme which was cool. Plenty of choice in drinks too as fizzy drinks were brought out in big bottles I never finished a bottle and lots of wine on stand by too. Oh we went all inclusive might I add desserts were plentiful also & delicious. After dinner there's a show which is fun to watch as the animation team gets everyone involved with singing and dancing  beside the stage was an indoor bar which served drinks till late. Lots of French people at the hotel as it is a French speaking country but hotel staff speak good English. I have read a few reviews of staff favouring the French and I don't wanna say it's true but there was one time I was waiting to be served at reception & a French man behind me got served first by a male receptionist I was like ..... But anyways majority of staff are lovely and accommodating. Had ants in our room on the table after the first few nights and this is when we figured out calling reception to send out someone was uselesssss. To get anything from reception you'd have to call them about 10 times and if they do decide to come out you'll be waiting a few hours same for when I asked for an iron they really need to improve this service it's the one thing that annoyed us so much. Wifi works great at reception and not so great in the rooms but strangely we got wifi near our door. We ended up buying a sim anyways. Hotel has a big family pool area with slides on one side and lots of sun beds and cabanas around for everyone . On the other side there's another pool for serious swimmers with lots of beds too and a pool bar in the middle. There's also a place to get snacks by the pool how fab right? On the hotel grounds walking to your rooms there's stalls where you can book activities and excursions I'd recommend to do so as the guys there are lovely. We booked a day trip to the waterfalls and also booked quad biking and camel riding so much fun and reasonable prices. Be sure to visit the big square also were the big markets are and if your brave go at night as its crazy live and lots to see!! Be carful of people trying to get you to buy everything just say NO firmly and walk away and if you do wanna buy something always bargain. Also agree on a price before getting into a taxi anywhere or you'll be shocked by the price given to you at the end they try take the piss. The hotel has a free shuttle bus service going in and out of the square everyday which is pretty cool. There's also a gym (heard it wasn't great & you have to pay for it) kids club souvenir shop mini golf tennis court and lots of daily activities on during the day around the hotel. All in all had an amazing time in Marrakech & a Beautiful stay at Kenzi Club Agdal hope to be back in the future.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dessiebabiie
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,shree100 wrote a review Aug 2016,20,Summer Visit,"Stayed here btw 1-5th aug 2016. Big resort with 2 public pools and private pool if paid upgraded prices. Unfortunately not a 5* by ANY stretch. I found the staff were quite unhelpful and the communications barrier did not help the situation at all. If you speak french/arabic communication would be great. Hotel facilities were basic and if u need a coffee in the morning - YOU DO NOT HAVE A KETTLE in your room.    THERE IS NO ROOM SERVICE at any time. There is an additional cost for everything such as: pool towels safe etc. also you have to pay 33dh per night per room (did not know this - only found out at check out).    food was ok - lots of cougettes    LOTS of flies and insects and wasps around the snack hut by the public pool    buggies 1st priorities for people arriving and not much concern if you need help (mobility problems) with travelling around the resort (staff VERY unhelpful regarding this!!!! - VERY disappointed)    When i enquired about the Star rating and their LACK of facility the resort manager (public relation manager) told me that ""they are NOT a 5* hotel and they have no interest in Trip advisor rating as it had nothing to do with them. He called this a family resort and definately NOT a 5* rating"".    I have NEVER felt the need to write a review for any of the other resorts/hotels i have stayed in. But in this case I felt so strongly and disappointed about it that i HAD to write a review.    Hope it helps    I WILL NEVER STAY AT THIS RESORT AGAIN!!!!!!!!",Date of stay: August 2016,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shree100
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,october3 wrote a review Aug 2016,30,nice hotel shame about the food!,I was apart of a big wedding group and I guess this hotel suited parents in our group with young children and affordable for most of us. And since we were attending the wedding festivities at different venues (BTW we had an amazing Moroccan experience here)this was just a place to sleep and get some food. We stayed here for 5 nights.    This was my first time in Marrakech so I decided to request for an airport transfer through the hotel. I was charged 25 euros for a 10 min drive. The best thing to do is to get a taxi and negotiate a rate with the driver outside the airport. This should be no more than 120 dh.    When we arrived we were given wrist bands to have lunch at the buffet restaurant. I was overwhelmed with the people traffic the messy tables the flies and the smell of fish. I was totally put off with the chef using the same utensils to cook meat with and then using it to stir some vegetables. In addition I avoided food which looked like it had already been eaten by the many flies which rotated around the food constantly. I stuck with eating chips and some pasta. Having said this the chocolate tart which was served most evenings was very tasty. The breakfast was nice. Good variety. Must try the fried Moroccan bread pastry which can be found near the fried eggs    The staff seemed to be quite friendly and hospitable apart from an inattentive and unfriendly bar tender who refused to serve drinks 10 mins before the bar was supposed be open.    On the first day we booked an excursion to the atlas mountains. This was done through the hotel. It cost 200 dh each and we were told we would meet the local berber people and go around by minibus to the mountains. If you have children do remind them to charge the child prices. This excursion was lovely. However we were charged another 30 dh each for a tour guide to take us to the mountains. If you are unfit or have very young children I do not recommend this trip. Also do not wear flip flops. A boy in our group lost his during the climb. The climbing in my view is quiet difficult and dangerous and my daughter had to be carried all the way by the guide. The entire experience reminded me of the raiders of the lost ark movie. A local Moroccan man fell and hurt his back. Thank god he wasn't injured too badly. We had lunch at the riverside. I ordered a chicken tagine which was the best I had during our trip. This was a set menu and although my husband and I shared this we were charged twice. The food was delicious so I couldn't be bothered to moan about it.    The family entertainment in the evening was very good. Very entertaining. They encourage participation whether you speak French or not and this was fun for all    The wifi only works in reception.    Hotel room - nice. Each room has a small patio area which was nice. House keeping was ok. On one occasion we had to request for the room to be cleaned after 5 pm.  The hotel grounds are nice. There is a basket ball court tennis courts a spa and a tiny farm. The swimming pools are good. Watch your towels and shirts! The hotel needs another area for larger groups to congregate indoors. The bar area was not good. The bar near the pool has marble floor and one of the guests fell.  The drinks are watered down and sugary. The white and rose wines were nice. Worth trying. The red wine looked off and tasted horrible.    This was my first time staying at an all inclusive hotel. Not to my taste partly due to the food. The hotel can do much better by concentrating on making this better and offering better quality drinks and snacks. Also it would have been lovely if there was someone at the reception area giving out recommendations on things to do around the town rather than being told to go to the tour operator.    This was my first trip to Morocco- it was lovely because we were part of a big group and went out to some amazing venues to celebrate a wedding. However I would not return to this hotel because of the food hygiene aspect. There has to be ways of controlling those wretched flies from falling into the food - and also hire some good chefs who have been trained on basic food hygiene..,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/october3
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sam4162 wrote a review Aug 2016,50,"amazing hotel, staff brilliant so much to do",To beat the queues on the airport you can email the hotel prior to your visit adna sk them to arrange fast track through passport control.  amazing from the moment you walk through the hotel door. Staff couldn't do enough and were so so friendly. Reception is lovely and cool with some stunning art work to look at. We were upgraded to the riad for free which was stunning. We were taken by reception in a buggy to our room and our suitcases taken to the room. Our bed was bigger then anything I have ever seen and the room was fantastically clean. They came in every day to clean and change the linen. There is a market in the hotel grounds by the shop which was a bit of a rip off compared to the shop prices. I paid 300 durum in the hotel market and the shop were selling them for 45 durum which is a huge difference.  We booked the excursions through the company at the hotel and it was again out of this world. It cost appx £75 per person 900 durum but they advertise it at a 1000 durum but you can get it for 800 durum. The package we got was at sunset in Marrakesh desert. we were picked up at the hotel at 5pm and taken to the desert. there we had our own quad bikes which are automatic and helmets with visors and you get about 30/40 minutes quad biking on the desert terrain stopping for pictures. we then had a jeep safari around the desert and again was stunning. then we each had our own camel and went for a 30 minute camel ride.  at about 8pm your taken into the desert village which is very well organized with electric toilets shade. all soft drinks were included and there is no alcohol for sale regardless what they tell you. we were seated and you had a man playing his guitar in his fez around a fire then your served a Moroccan cuisine of bread soup tagine cous cous followed by fruit salad. then a lady came out and belly danced and got everyone involved it was once in a lifetime. to round things up they then did henna tattoo and shish pipe before dropping us off back to the hotel at around 11pm.  cant wait to come back .  Book a taxi through the hotel a lot cheaper,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,perthshire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sam4162
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,5manor wrote a review Aug 2016,40,Enjoyable week,I have just returned after a week in Kenzi club. Check in was quick and easy. We were really lucky to be upgraded to the privilege riad upon arrival which gave us access to a private pool for our riad. We did use the main pool on one occasion but it wasn't easy to find 2sunbeds together and this was before 10am there is a lot of reserving of beds being done.  Food was good although I did find it a little repetitive as the week went on. The queues at the fresh cooking stations could be crazy and they could really have done with extra staff at these stations. Drinks weren't bad wine was good but cocktails all tasted the same and seemed quite watered down.  Our room was perfect and really clean. Air con worked well. I would say the rooms could do with having information packs giving general information on the resort. On one occasion we needed to call reception but couldn't find anywhere in the room how to do this.  Majority of staff we dealt with were really friendly despite our poor French abilities.  Although this resort may not be quite 5star the value for money can't be questioned and we really enjoyed our stay.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Dublin,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5manor
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,finnlagun wrote a review Aug 2016,30,Let's be honest: 3* hotel at best,I'll keep it simple:    Pros:  - Staff were generally pleasant and warm particularly in the restaurant  - Whilst it's true that the staff speak better French than English (this is Morocco after all) they showed no preference for the French as others have reported and communication was rarely an issue    Cons:  - This is categorically not a five star hotel as others have reviewed; not sure why it is categorised so  - Parts of the hotel are in need of major rejuvenation. Take the sun loungers of which the majority require repainting and/or repairs  - Food was hit-and-miss: breakfast pastries were more like bread: baked with too little butter. Scrambled egg was never warm. More disappointment than glee in this area - never good where food is involved  - One member of the reception staff Sanaa comes across very poorly indeed: as patronising impatient and contemptuous of guests' intelligence. She could learn a thing or two from her colleagues at the adjacent payment desk: the male staff there were comparatively cheerful and friendly  - Wifi is patchy and unreliable. If you need to access the Internet frequently this will prove frustrating  - I wouldn't call this a relaxing destination during the summer holidays: children run wild and cheesy music plays without respite (though we found this quite entertaining after a few gin & tonics...)  - The towel deposit scheme is quite bizarre and totally unexpected in a hotel with five star pretensions    All things considered I most likely wouldn't return. If you're looking for a genuine five star experience you'd be better off looking elsewhere.,Date of stay: August 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/finnlagun

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tim H wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Two weeks in Marrakech,1. I'll start with the fact that we are here for two weeks and are half way through so thought it a good time to review.  2. The review must be majored with an eye on the price. We paid £1140 (taking off cheap Ryan Air flights) for two people two weeks.    Many thanks go to the excellent staff and their service especially:  SOUMIA (Riad 4). Fantastic service all the time. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you. 5* Quality. Would like to take you home. :)  MUSTAFAA (Restaurant). Always helpful and friendly. Very much appreciated  AHMED (Shuttle Bus). Excellent service always on time and happy to meet and greet.    Very welcoming reception and impressed with the gardens and maintenance throughout. Two large pools water slides and baby pool - thanks to the previous TripAdvisor reviews we were expecting this area to be busy with lots of children PA music and families - it was! We requested an upgraded room in Riad 4 (La Roseraie) which is the only Riad with its own internal private pool (requesting silence). Personalised drinks service which was great. Excellent place if you want piece and quiet away from children hub bub.    The restaurant is busy given the number of guests on site and a bit like a noisy school/works cafe at times. Pick your time well - early on is best time for dinner. The food is good with healthy options although a bit repetitive! Lamb tagine very good if you take off the bones and a great pear meringue and popcorn (once). The staff are very good and work hard given the numbers - speak French to them and they are funny and helpful. Our wine and water was always ready to greet us on our 'usual' dinner table each night. Don't expect Michelin star cordon bleu - you've not paid for it! (Value for money I'd say)    The star rating in this area of the world is somewhat spurious. You get what you pay for. 5* rating with a 5* price you should get it. The Kenzi is not 5* price so you'll get the quality to match.    The shuttle bus into Marrakech centre is excellent and very reliable. We used it every other day (book the night before at reception). Had a great explore of the area. The souk is socially heavy to take in so don't just assume Marrakech is the souk. Get about and explore the other areas including the modern shopping malls parks palaces museums etc. Lots to do and see as well as plenty of time for pool relaxation. Note that many are after the tourist dirham so resist their offers of 'help' and 'guidance' and don't fall for their patter.    If you walk out the hotel and turn left you can be in a shopping mall and cinema complex in 20mins. Good to see 'normal' Moroccans and visit Carrefour to pick up any extra provisions. Moroccans usual Friday night social venue.    We have no complaints really. Very impressed with the staff service and facilities. We will come back and enjoy again.

As per usual the staff went out of their way to make my birthday special. I missed my flight and did not arrive until 9 hours later however the birthday cake and the beautiful swans made on my bed made up for my initial disappointment.    I was given a beautiful room which had its own pool immediately outside.    Food again was more than plentiful and the lamb tagine tasted superb.    I cannot get enough of this hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Peter C wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Kids fun,We stayed here for one week.  This is an all in-hotel with food and drinks the whole day.  Food is decent : huge variety acceptable quality for an all in.  Service is quite friendly for such a huge place.    There is a kids club and plenty of activities for the adults as well. Although officially bilingual (French/English) in reality you ended up in an almost exclusive French speaking environment. For this reason our kids never attended any of the kids club activities which was really a pity.  They did enjoy though the two swimming pools and 3 fantastic water slides very much.    We had a family room which was spacious (2 separated bed room areas big bathroom with shower and bath tub).    The hotel is outside the city and if it was not for the Moroccan style in which the hotel is built you would not even know you were in Morocco. Fortunately the hotel provides a regular shuttle bus to the city (free but need to book the day before) giving you the opportunity to find your ideal personal mix of swimming pool relaxing shopping and culture.    Wifi was not available in the rooms. Half of our stay it was available at swimming pool restaurant and reception area; the other half only the wifi at reception was working. Quality of wifi was bad and slow (by far the worst we got in different hotels we stayed in Morocco even when all the other places we stayed were just small riads or guesthouses).,Date of stay: July 2016,,"Bangkok, Thailand",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/744PeterC744

The staff very friendly and the complex beautiful.  If you are travelling as s couple ask for riad 4 with its private pool for some peaceful sunbathing. I did not enjoy the constant music around the big pool and retreated back to riad 4 for some quiet time.  The rooms were spacious and clean. The spa good and we enjoyed the hammam.    The hotel caters mainly for the French however still a good place to stay    My only criticism. There should be a quiet bar to go to in the evenings as not everyone wants to have the noise of the shows and the animators every night and to retreat to a quiet adult only bar would have been nice.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CoupleFromSweden wrote a review Jul 2016,20,AirCondition and WIFI did not work at all,Very bad stay at this hotel. WIFI and Aircondition were the most important for us and we would not choose this hotel if we knew this issue earlier. We payed full price and did not get what we payed for. We complained the issues 3 times and they said that they should fix the problem. We had the room far away from the reception and WIFI was to important for us for our business.  We stayed at Riad some days were in tangier and madrid before this hotel and we had not any problem at all at other hotels but this was really ridicolous.    Btw the pools were fantastic and we enjoyed a lot. Good for families. Pretty far away from the city. The taxis outside the hotel takes to much. If they dont go for 30-50 dh go just 100 meter and you will find other taxis. Even the staff at the hotel says it cost 100 dh but its a big lie. From the city you will find for 30 dh easily but have to go to ask 2-4 taxis.  There are a shuttle bus free from the hotel but you have to reserv the time day before and it does not go after 19:30 which means that you'll miss the dinner at the all inclusive hotel. Its to hot at day time in july n its perfect to go out after the dinner time but then you have to take taxi.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockholm, Sweden",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asim_164
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,GemmaCurt6463 wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Great for families and friends...,We visited this hotel in June to celebrate our anniversary. It is a great place for families with young children young couples and friends on hen/stag parties etc. Lots of entertainment throughout the day for children and adults alike......water Zumba especially entertaining to watch. There are sufficient sun beds and note a refundable deposit for pool towels is required.    Overall the service was good but unfortunately we can't rate it as very good or excellent because of the pool bar service restaurant experience and overall hygiene. Each time my husband went to the pool bar he was overlooked there does seem to be preferential treatment for French speakers. I have some basic French and I'm not sure if it was my attempt to speak the language or being female that resulted in prompt service. There was also not a lot of choice for non-alcoholics....fruit punch or coolers.....made from cordials.....not fruit. Oh yes and water😉    We chose an all inclusive option for dining which include drinks. The meals were good but predictable although there was a fair variety of choice. However timing is of essence as there is only one restaurant and finding space at peak times for breakfast lunch and dinner can be a bit of a nightmare. We often resorted to finding s table first and then taking it in turns to get our meals as if you both move the table is gone! However the staff in the restaurant were great and would reset a table for you as and when needed.    The hotel is well located with beautiful grounds but the rooms are a little dated. On our first night we noted a lot of mosquitos in the room and ants on the floor around the door. We reported this to reception and the room was sprayed and a mosquito repellent plug-in provided. Hygiene around the building wasn't too bad but I did spot a dead cockroach in the restaurant toilet.....didn't use that facility again!!    There is a free shuttle bus to town which operates a really convenient times but be mindful when you exit the bus as you will be approached in a mildly aggressive way by 'guides' who want to provide you with a tour of the area. No tour guide needed it is easy to walk through the square and around the Souk just take note of various landmarks. Prices are good and I don't usually haggle but tried it on this holidays no did I get some bargains or what.....one particular item for a fifth of the original price😜    Would we come again? Yes to Marrakech but would probably try a different hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Loopyludesigns wrote a review Jul 2016,50,So good we came back again!,We first visited this hotel in 2013 for a week having wanted to tick Marrakech off my travel bucket list for a while so when we saw the fantastic price we could get this year for 10 nights we were sold! The food is a very good standard considering there's just one all inclusive restaurant to serve the entire hotel. The Moroccan rose wine is very good and I like the fact I can get a bottle with my dinner and not just by the glass as well as large bottles of water each day with lunch and Coke Zero if we fancied. All staff are very friendly and helpful although sometimes the staff at the pool bar could learn to smile a bit more! The entertainment team are great - friendly and amusing but not pushy. Aqua gym is fun! The majority of cocktails are what you'd expect from an all inclusive (not great!) but the strawberry mojitos deserve special mention as they were amazing - not too sweet! Good G&T too. There were more English on this visit - otherwise mainly French as its a French speaking country. We were told by our travel agent that they would communicate to the hotel that we were returning customers as they said they appreciate to know but when we arrived the reception wasn't aware we'd visited before but this was probably our travel agents fault despite them confirming they'd done so! Never mind. The rooms are just right - simple design but with a Moroccan twist. Our light switch was hanging off the wall when we arrived but this was fixed within five minutes when we flagged down a handy man that walked past our room. Our bed wasn't laid but a maid turned up within 10 minutes to make it when we called reception to complain. Only two grumbles: 1) We usually tip at the end of the holiday but we were a little annoyed when after the 10 days our bed sheets hadn't been changed - as you can imagine with suncream/aftersun use they'd begun to get grubby as they were white 2) when Ramadan finished the Moroccans descended on the hotel for the weekend and we felt the buffet restaurant struggled to cope with the amount of people utilising it and the standards dropped for a few days - it was manic to say the least! In future we will stick to visiting during Ramadan and quieter periods. We really do love this hotel - the grounds are stunning and the pools very clean - and will definitely be back again.

Let me start by saying my husband & I are not picky hard to please people...poilitenessgood manners & just a little bit of respect is not a lot to ask for as a 1st impression (on either side i might add).  From airport taxi driver wanted to. charge  250dh to go 15mins bt we gt him to reduce price (do b4 getting in taxi) Got to resort hotel only to find that we were being taken to a sister hotel for 1 night with no proper explanation except problem with room...a hotel that we had avoided booking due to bad tripadviser reviews so not a good start. Food at dinner was bland service poor.. staff have either attitude or just completely blank u.  Customer service Manager(duty manager) frm 1st hotel was suppose to pick us up at 1pm so not much time after breakfast to relax & enjoy sunshine. Waited paitently in lobby bt then had to gt reception to ring hotel to find out what was going on. He eventually turned up at 130pm with no word of apology & we found that 3 other lots of guests were also being shunted btw the 2 hotels. Shuttle bus nt big enough for all of us plus all luggage so without telling us they offloaded  our luggage including our camera bag without giving us the option of putting on our lap so then had to wait at original hotel for luggage (×tra 15mins bt not the point as to how much time just annoying & inconsiderate). Our room still wasnt ready & still being cleaned when we gt our key !!!!  Still no apology & by this point manager had dissappeared.    The room we were eventually given was good & close to all amenities. But that was the only good point other sister hotel has at least 3 restaurants & free room service btw midnight & 6am. A fridge in room with cold drinks all included in your AI rates    The dining room more ressembles a 1960s butlins camp (nt quite sure how they have the nerve to call it a restaurant coz it resembles a canteen more)& yet again food is quite bland. Practically the same food dished up every night...there is a MICROWAVE in corner if you actually prefer your food hot in preference to luke warm or cold !!!! The overall attitude of the staff is also not good...when wev paid hard earned money for a relaxing holiday the last thing u want is staff acting like they r doing u a favour when they serve u. (Yes i know we are the foreignersbt goes back to poiliteness) Yet they still expect tips  for rude service     AI will give  you opportunity to sample a la carte restuarants at least once bt not here you actually have to pay extra which is a complete scam.    We came to Marrakech because we enjoyed visiting Agadir so thought we wld try elsewhere in Morocco... All we can say is we wish we hadnt bothered.    Good points  staff on animation team namely Magic & Spider for their interaction with the holidaymakers.  Barstaff brilliant service & remembering order everynight.    Free wifi an absolute joke as never connects unless you are in reception even though resort states that it provides free wifi through out main buildings    Cats should not be allowed in restaurant for all sorts of health reasons.  Childrens entertainment in main bar area went on til 9pm on the thursday night.  All important question as to whether or not we would return...Absolutely never,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EleanorB835
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mr_MrsMogz06 wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Great Hotel with Friendly Staff,We went on a family holiday of 4 being myself and my Partner and his 2 daughters (22 & 16). There is plenty to do for all ages but I would say if you have younger children the kids club is amazing they will have them all day and they even take them to eat/drink etc.  Hotel rooms are very modern and tidy we had a super king size bed apart from the pillows being like a brick everything else was great and the bathrooms are lovely with fresh towels daily.  Food in the hotel is ok there was a few nights where we struggled but there is always fresh salad and pasta so even if you can’t find hot food you fancy there is always an alternative only other thing I would say is food isn’t covered up and there are a lot of flies in Morocco so didn't like the act they could land on the food and with it not being covered was sometimes very cold even though under a hot plate.  The pools are lovely we spent our time round the quiet pool and then there is the animation pool so louder music and the animation team doing their daily program so you have a choice of where to sunbath and there are always plenty of beds free even at 9/10 am in the morning and there is always plenty of shade available.  Animation Team are great and work very hard all day and then go on all night for the entertainment.  Overall this hotel is very good for the price you pay and I would certainly go back and stay there again and we have already re-booked to go back in September.  We used the shuttle bus to go into Marrakech to see the main square and the souks which was an experience but second time around when I knew where I was going I felt more comfortable and we sat in one of the café’s and watched the world go by and the beautiful sunset.,Date of stay: July 2016,,"Swadlincote, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_MrsMogz06
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,NatalieCHFrance wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Not 5 Star - but Saad at the pool bar/cafe highly recommended for a fab pizza!,This is marketed as a 5 star so my review is based on that. Stayed 5 nights left 12 July.    You pay for a safe you pay deposit for a torn worn pool towel which when it is taken by another pool user you forfeit your deposit. Not good enough not 5 star.    Food plentiful and well cooked however repetitive to the point of missing meals. Always salad cereals omlettes fresh bread eggs omlettes and pastries and ffruit for breakfast. Always a meat/fish/pizza choice for lunch and evening plus usual salads potatoes chip tagine and cous cous.    Wine and beer fine - feel free to let your kids have the alcoholic or alcohol free cocktails as the 'spirits' are watered down to the point of tasteless.    Short drive from the souks - recommend booking the guided tour at £17 a head.    Clean rooms and facilities. Grounds nice. Expect to tip for everything.    Fine hotel if you want a few days relaxing in the sun and not have to drag out for meals and aren't after a 'quality stay'.    If you are going for a romantic couples break this is probably not the hotel for you. Over loud entertainment teams in the day led to a far from relaxing poolside experience. Only one bar in evening and entertainment questionable.    If you are looking for a more accurate 5 star Moroccan hotel with exceptional service far better food and more opulent surroundings go instead to the Mazagan Hotel in Casablanca. Far superior in every way.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,France,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieCHFrance

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Anna wrote a review Jul 2016,30,4 Nights in Kenzi,We travelled as a family of 4 2 adults and 2 children (aged 14 and 12 years old). We wanted a short break with culture in sunnier climes and Marrakech delivered! We specifically chose to stay in a collar X with pools to occupy the children and chose not to stay in one of the beautiful historic riads in Marrakech.    Check in is at 2:30pm. We arrived at 4:30pm and was told our room wasn't ready and to give them an hour to get our room ready. We return an hour later and were asked to wait another 30 minutes. 6:30pm we are shown to our room which was not ready at yet either to be occupied. Housekeeping was still cleaning it. The reception team could please try to smile even if through gritted teeth.    Food and Drinks. It's one of the worst All Inclusive places I have visited. There isn't much choice. Their attempts to vary the food with a theme night still didn't vary the food choices enough. There wasn't enough meat choices. Great salad bar though with variety. I do note some of the guests were overly greedy with the food. They filled up their plates to the brim as if they haven't eaten. It's horrible seeing food go to waste.    Hygiene. Breakfast lunch and dinner is a busy time. Pressure to serve a huge crowd of diners. However we noted that one of the chefs handled raw meat with burger buns and vegetables. We are convinced as a result one of the children had an upset stomach (diarrhoea to name one of the symptoms). My children usually have a high tolerance with their immune system so I am disappointed when my holiday is spent trying to go and find medicine to cure the problems. This hygiene practice is totally unacceptable.    Animation team. A lively group who work very hard and long hours. The only bunch I've noticed who have made an effort to actually interact with the guests. They do have activities scheduled on offer. Water polo water aerobics belly dancing and evening entertainment.    Just disappointed that when my 14 year old summoned up the courage to join in one of the activities (air shooting) only to be told he had to wait until the 14-17 year old age group. The activity never happened for the age group.    Housekeeping. Can't fault that the beds were made and towels refreshed daily.    Pool. There are indeed 3 pools but 2 outdoors and 1 indoor in the spa and chargeable. There's a polite notice about reserving sun beds and how they strictly enforce. During our stay I noticed that this was not enforced and most of the sun beds remained empty for long periods of time.    Pool Bar. Gets very hectic and hard to get service. I'm sure there's favouritism in the order they serve the customers as whether they have tipped them or not. Totally irritating because you don't want to constantly tip them. Yes it goes without saying - money gets you far. A small tip does help.    Language barriers. I understand the staff will speak French. But I expected some effort to at least answer our questions perhaps in broken English and French.    Wifi. The wifi signal was only usable in the reception and the pool bar areas. Wifi was not available in our room.    Overall this place is acceptable. There are still a lot of improvements that can be made to make it near a 4 star resort. We stayed 4 nights/5 days and any longer I think we might have gone stir crazy as there wasn't much to do. The resort is clean and well maintained but not standard 5 star.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Surrey, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stummy

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ellie wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Good but...,I'll start with the bad and end with the good.    A number of reviews seem to debate whether this is aimed at the french or not. It is most definitely. I speak a little bit of french but I understand much more. The staff were most certainly more friendly and chattier with the French. Even when the entertainment staff translated in English it wasn't the same friendly pitter-patter that had just been said in french. I went to watch a cooking class one day the awaiting audience (all French) were having a whale of a time with the chef they were all laughing and joking. He acknowledged I was English and then just carried on in French. I didn't feel very welcome. I certainly do not expect them to speak solely in English for me but some effort to include and translate parts would have been great - I ended up walking away. The spin class that went on in front of us each day - in french. The entertainment- french music. Service at the pool bar- I felt invisible - only when I spoke in French or the tiny bit of Arabic I know did I get served quickly. It felt like I was making all the effort to be friendly and communicate it wore really thin by the end of the week and it then just started becoming plain rude - but hey it certainly has a prominence of French and French speaking Moroccans so maybe that's just the way it is.    The wifi is basically non-existent you could only connect at the reception - very very poor for a hotel of this standard.    You have to pay to activate the safe in the room. It's there sitting there doing nothing but you have to pay 50 dirhams a day to use it. This should be included.    The staff in the spa were not helpful at all. I'd broken three nails whilst there and just wanted to get them cut down and filed no fancy manicure no polish just a quick 5 min tidy up. All they could offer was the full 'hands beauty' package for £30...    This is 100% a family resort - we were a couple looking for a relaxing time. A few too many kids for us however it seems like the PERFECT place to take kids. They all seemed to having an excellent time and the entertainment staff really interacted with them well. -just make sure they learn some french first ;-)    It's certainly not 5 star a mid 4 is probably more accurate.    The good...    (apart from the safe) The rooms were great clean nicely laid out and had everything we needed. Really lovely decor. Beds were SOLID though!    The food was good also. Loads of choice and really varied. We stayed 6 nights and never had the same thing twice. We went all inclusive so even when the restaurant was closed the snack bars had plenty to choose from - you can't go hungry.    Plenty of sunbeds and they discourage reserving them (even though lots did) so could always find two.    The grounds were really lovely and we were there over Eid so they had some great local musicans around on a few days.    Lots of activities and things to do.    So all in all a few things ruined it slightly for us and we didn't have quite as great a time as we'd hoped but all we really went for was a hot get away and it was certainly that! But if you're a french speaking family you'll probably have a really great time!    Tips for places to go: Try Comptoir Darna or NOMAD if you want a fancy meal out. Quite expensive but worth it. Watch the sunset at NOMAD but go after 8pm for Comptoir.,Date of stay: July 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swindon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellierj
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Elaine L wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Def not a 5*,"Visited this hotel in June hotel looks lovely the pool was great  rooms were nice beds quite comfy but it's all smoke and mirrors!! Our first evening there was no bed for my grandson to sleep in  just 2 beds for 3 people! The snack bar and drinks bar by the pool is a real Trek if you are near the water slides everyone reserves beds with towels and staff didn't care  people would go off all day n leave towels so you could never get a decent sun bed the restaurant was a nightmare trying to get a drink was a joke no self serving machines you have to constantly ask for soft drinks or wine they were very slow to serve there is 1 beer tap which was always empty! The food was OK specially if you like salad the ""Moroccan"" food was very bland was dissapointed with this. There was no kids club or disco no kids entertainment when we was there never experienced this before. Our room was half cleaned they made the beds that was it! The bathroom was never cleaned properly. There is NOTHING outside the hotel within walking distance you have to get a cab every where and they try their best to rip you off at every opportunity I found people rude and trying to con you all the time no matter what even asking direction's they take you completely the wrong way to get you to there cousins aunties uncles shop!! Leaving the hotel was very stressful. On leaving you have to pay a tax for the room the manager tried to con me on that also I paid in English it worked out to about £17 he tried taking £25 till I pulled him up on it!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hellosalma wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Lovely hotel!,I was sceptical when I read the reviews but really glad I booked this hotel. Amazing entertainment team beautiful hotel good facilities lots of activities and so much choice in terms of food for an all-inclusive! My family got back and immediately wanted to re-book this hotel for our next trip. If you have kids they will love the water slides and little zoo they also have fans around the pool which spray cool water on those super hot days.    The only drawbacks would be the 2pm check-in if you arrive early the extra taxes which some booking sites don't mention and the cockroaches (but its not the hotels fault the rooms are on the ground floor and it is Africa after all!)

We were put in the wrong room the first night then woken quite late at night in an attempt to move us however we were both completely zonked from a day of traveling! We were then moved the next morning. Our room was fine however we stayed for 7 night and our bed was not changed once which I wasn't happy about at all. It's a rushed clean and not tidying was done we were also left for most of the day with no towels in our room. We were also not able to use the pool lunch service until we were offered it on almost of last night! So we could have eaten by our upgraded pool every lunch but we weren't made aware.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Maria G wrote a review Jul 2016,40,lovely clean & peaceful,Firstly after reading the reviews prior to going which i know do for all my holidays the one thing that stood out to me most was that they favoured the french this is not the case at all the simply speak french so they can communicate with them far better than what they can in English!!!  I never had any problems in asking for what i wanted or needed to know!!!  Room was lovely clean and a comfortable Queen if not bigger bed so sleeping is fantastic T.V on wall with some English speaking channels especially after 6pm you would get a English movie on one of the channels.  Bathroom was nice to A full size bath with shower over this wasn't fantastic (i love a shower over a bath) but i could still get washed and be clean it could do to have more power in it. Fresh clean towels everyday.  Pool area there was 2 pools available to us one was a nice size rectangle pool the other pool was the one that had the water slides that went into it I think the other pool people talk about is behind the wall in the middle of the complex as we never found it!!! and wasn't offered the upgrade! they also play English music but calming not banging all day like other hotels  Food i thought there was plenty of choice for everyone theme nights happen most evenings and i really enjoyed the Tagine selection of food its a must breakfast included a omelette station freshly made to order and taste amazingthere also fresh bread and a toasting machine with all different jams in big bowls Pancakes and Moroccan patties been constantly made along with fried eggs loads of different fruit and yogurts available along with cereals but my favourite morning thing was watching the man with hundreds of fresh oranges juicing them all morning you cant get fresher than that!  Lunch was different selections of cold meats and salad cheese to cooked food and fresh veg and chips ( no burger & hot dogs here)  Evening dinner was anything and everything that i doubt there is nothing someone could find to eat  Kids area was usually steamed veg and meat the usually chips and french bread is available all of eating times.    Grounds were lovely and kept well too i enjoyed our walks to and from the pool.    Evening entertainment starts at 9.30pm in the air conditioned theatre room shows were good and funny i enjoyed them.    Overall we had a fantastic chilled out time and would love to return!!!!!!    On a last note you get zero pressure around the pool and the spa onsite does not do any selling this i found to be a very big plus.    I would like to see them speak more English but then i expect they prob want us to speak french    Shop on sites sells take home gifts i did ask for a shop to buy somethings we couldn't bring with us but was told the nearest other shop was on the bus 20mins away they do offer a free bus services into town we didn't use it.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariagV7609HM
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Missysiley wrote a review Jul 2016,50,Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Absolutely fantastic hotel staff location food and rooms. We stayed here for 5 days and have had an amzing time. From day one right through to day 5 Kenzi Club was on point and catered to our every need. Good for couples (us) and the time we travelled there were not too many children although those that were there were well catered for equally. Great value for money. the venue itself is very well maintained and managed and staff execute their services to a high standard friendly efficient and work well as a team. It is very clean and the attention to detail is at the evident. There are a range of activities you can book that take place in the hotel or off site including quad biking camel riding in the desert homan (suana n massage). There was so much good quality food to choose from and the standards never faltered. Wine is available for all meals and the quality was very good red white or roseau. Cocktails were plentiful as were pancakes pizza donughts slushes freshly made all day round. A lot of healthy treats available too. The entertainment crew were outstanding they also hosted aqua aerobics belly dancing water polo tennis courts to name but a few of the activities availeble the list is endless...if you are looking for somewhere just to chill and let the sun find you Kenzi Club is where it is at. If you are looking for a location where you can reap the rewards of all your hard graft as an employee spouse parent student or boss Kenzi Club is for you...The shuttle service into town is efficient and reliable and you are a few minutes away from a host of other good restaurants and places of interest. There is a departure tax you have to pay when you leave be aware. Beach towels are available (100 dirhams pp) refundable deposit on return of borrowed towels. We stayed in room 809 and it was great as led straight out onto the pools and was a great central location.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Topol_dog wrote a review Jul 2016,30,Well maintained but disappointing,"We found the checking in process fairly painless but did watch the receptionist checking our information form against the wrong passports. Also when we arrived because our room wasn't yet ready we went for a drink but took our luggage with us as we weren't informed that we could leave it somewhere.  We were taken to our room in the little golf buggy which was great and once we had been given our room we had a sit down in our little garden bit at the back of our room which was unfortunately backing onto the service road that the staff use CONTINUALLY both on foot and with those buggies. We were so disappointed but to top it off while we were sitting there a member of staff took away our garden wicker chairs that were mildy comfortable at least had arms and a back that you could recline against and replaced them with armless straightbacked dining chairs. We went to reception and asked for them to be swapped back and they made a call and said it would be done now. It wasn't and we had those horrendous chairs for the entire stay which is rubbish when the entertainment isn't really to your liking and you just want to go and chill out on your ""service road balcony with a view of the wall"".  Food was nice can't complain and the all inclusive drinks are good. The coffee at breakfast is always mildly warm and very bitter but maybe that's a local thing. Stick with the chap making mint tea.  The pools are good and flumes are always a laugh. The loungers are good glad the hotel has a no reservation policy but sometimes tricky finding two loungers together with a spare sunshade.  Entertainment in the evening around the stage bit was pretty much the same every evening but the animation team did very energetic performances that were a bit cringy but they worked hard.  Another thing that we thought was rubbish was that to use the gym you had to pay extra about £6 for a day pass which we thought was a bit steep when you only want to have a run and do a few exercises.

On arrival yes room not ready but we knew that as on an early flight but heh instant upgrade to Roseraie riad wrist band given so we can now eat drink anywhere on the resort staff super friendly and welcoming cases taken got changed went to pool nice.    Room ready by twelve as promised super clean bottle of water fridge and great aircon it was 42 degrees when we arrived. Housekeeping were stars wine fruit bowl and towel art on return from pool. A small tip goes a long way but you never feel you had to tip anyone.    Thanks to upgrade poolside waiter service can't fault it all staff do best to understand all languages and can't be praised enough especially as it was Ramadan and seriously hot. Again small tip and a smile go a long way.    The whole resort spotlessour room was only a five minute walk and we were at the end of the complex yes golf buggies will come and get you but seriously only 200 metres at most to anywhere.    Restaurant was stunning no nationality favouritism always somewhere to sit with a table made up for the Brits who seem to moan no English food..... Chips pizza and meat every day. Why not try the tagines they are great yep chips good too Chinese night so good you might have to wait a couple of minutes for your wine or water to be delivered it's free be polite.    Wifi works ok FaceTime didn't work but blimey I could get emails and check everything I needed too by pool bar and reception. Cash point on site 300 works out about £23. Good shop pack of 20 less than £2 I don't smoke but for those who do.    On site doctor brilliant if you get upset stomach ready supply of free medication well we were not charged.    Oh there is a night club too behind pool bar not free drinks but for those who don't want to go to bed it's called the Studio.    To finish a great week great weather super helpful staff be polite and small tip those you feel you want too no one expects but my god it is only a few pounds and you will notice the bigger smile.    Word of advice get the smallest notes possible when you exchange 20 or 50 dirham notes are the best.

Had a bit of a hiccup with our rooms (given twin rooms instead of double) but that was soon resolved by the manager who upgraded us the a rather nice large suite.  Pool was really nice lots of beds to choose from could do with a few more umbrellas.  Food in the first few days was quite nice but as most all inclusive can become repetitive also drinks menus was a little bit same old same old. Night markets are a must DO.. to experience the smells an hustle and bustle of Morocco but really be careful if you get approach by women doing the henna tattoos  they can be quite aggressive and pushy under no circumstances let then put the henna on you unless you are willing to pay at least 200 dirhams (£40)..shocking. even taking photos on the monkey in the square can be costly. The best thing this hotel has to offer is the entertainment its top draw. The pool guys are so much fun getting everyone involved in crazy activities. But our favourite Rep was Mouss he was a real great guy and a true gentleman very good at his job. thanks to him I now know how to hold a golf club.He also arranged a poker game every afternoon  this was a real treat for me and my partner as we are keen players of the game.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jane S wrote a review Jun 2016,50,We are still here - review in situ!,We are 12 days into a 14 night holiday here and feel that a review whilst we are here is appropriate. We always read Trip Advisor before we go anywhere but nobody posts when they are still there. We have a clean spacious comfortable room in Riad 4 which is the only riad with its only private pool and the staff are very keen to turn away people who are not staying in this particular riad. It has a no noise music or children policy which makes it a perfect place to relax and unwind from our busy lives. The balcony that we have does not overlook the pool but faces outward and does not have the best outlook but in the evening it is extremely sunny and private. The walk up to mealtimes is quite a long one but all even pathways and is very pleasant and pretty to walk along and well lit at night. It builds up the appetite nicely! This area therefore is away from the main larger pools and animation area with the daily activities and music that is usual in holiday destinations but that suits us just fine. The food is good quality and varied and has plenty of choice as well as theme nights - thoroughly recommend the Chinese night. There are a lot of French here but us Brits are well represented too! If you can speak French to even a basic standard it is much appreciated by the staff. Don't forget to save some dirhams for the local holiday taxes that have to be paid on checkout in local cash. Top tip - spray insect repellant under door and the giant ants on the second floor do not bother you. The only annoying thing is the lack of mirror in the main bedroom area so nowhere to look when drying hair etc. However use your IPad in camera mode and problem solved! We had to have the services of a doctor here and we asked at reception and he came to the room did a full MoT and prescribed medication that he went and got and we picked up from reception about an hour later. Excellent service. So all in all enjoying our holiday immensely and thanks Kenzi Club Agdal Medina.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Woking, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janel33
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Selena B wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Very accommodating and entertaining!,This hotel was great! Me and my wife came to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary and had an amazing time.    The architecture of the hotel is very plush with lovely garden settings. The staff are very accommodating. Upon entry we were welcomed with two lemon and lime mocktails which tasted delicious.    The rooms are spacious with very comfy beds.    The hotel had free WiFi which only worked well in some areas such as the lobby the pool bar and some parts of the hotel. It worked in our rooms but only in certain spaces.    There were 2 large swimming pools which had lots of entertainment during the day including Aqua Aerobics Aquabike and Water Polo.    The food was lovely and a variety was always provided to cater to all tastes from grilled meats to rice potatoes and lots of fresh salads and desserts. All the restaurant staff were always very friendly attentive and polite especially our friend Brahim who always got me my bottle of rose wine every evening with a smile and chuckle. He also made me laugh when he mentioned I resembled the famous Music Artist Akon. He is a true asset to the Kenzi staff team as he always made us feel welcomed.    The hotel also organised our very first camel trip in the dessert which was a lovely experience.    Overall a great hotel and we would definitely visit again and would recommend to others.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selenab576
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SusieSum wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Amazing value for money,We booked this hotel through Voyages Prive at a very good price and we personally feel the the negative reviews are completely unfounded. We found all of the staff very friendly efficient and helpful. We had a problem with our safe 3 times during a 7 night stay but it was always dealt with promptly by reception and wasn't a big issue.    The grounds are stunning. Our room was ground floor with a huge bed a little terrace and a mini fridge and was better than we expected. Our air con was fine but towards the end of the week when the temperature went over 40 degrees we needed it on for longer.    We did see a little preferential treatment by two of the younger waiting staff - however not because the guests were French - they were English blonde and very attractive!    We thought the food was incredible in its variety and quality. We always started our lunch and dinner with a salad and there was so much choice of really fresh dishes with different combinations of vegetables and sometimes included classics like Waldorf salad. The fruits especially the watermelon was lovely and so fresh. The pasta was nice - made to order with your choice of ingredients. Each mealtime there was always a different tagine with cous-cous and these were lovely. There was always a meat dish or two and a fish dish plus chips potatoes or rice with different vegetable dishes each day. I am really surprised to see reviews saying the food was restricted. You couldn't get a quarter pounder or roast beef and Yorkshire pudding but this is Marrakech not Manchester or Malden. Puds and desserts are not our thing so we didn't try anything other than an ice cream once.    Lots of the dishes are not that hot but this didn't bother us. We only had the chips once and we waited until the chef had put a fresh batch out and they were good and hot. There is a microwave if someone likes their food to be really piping hot.    We did try the Moroccan restaurant on site which costs 100 D (about £7.50) extra. You can have the house wine free or pay for an A La Carte bottle of something different. This is the real traditional food so every course is quite sweet. We enjoyed it for the experience - lovely decor service and live music - it made a nice change from the main restaurant.    We didn't enjoy the cocktails as they were too sweet for us so we stuck to the very pleasant red wine with lunch and dinner and a brandy (or three) after dinner. The waiters brought a bottle of wine and would offer another when it was finished. I just make a special mention of one waiter - RDouane (auspiciously pronounced red wine) - who looked after us so well and was so charming. All of the waiting staff worked hard but he was exceptional.    Because we did a number of excursions we didn't join in with any activities so can't comment on them.    We did a 4WD Berber Trails with Sahara Tours who were the local agents for Voyage Prive and it was just the best day. We were lucky enough to have the other couple due to be with us change their minds so we had the guide to ourselves for the whole day which cost 550 Dirhams each including mint tea in a Berber House and a 3 course lunch. I will never forget some of the sights we saw in the weekly market in the high mountains where people travel for miles by donkey horse or overloaded ancient trucks to do their shopping. We were lucky to have chosen a Saturday for this trip and to get to mingle with the locals. The Majorelle Gardens are wonderful - real must see - and I would recommend a guide for the medina as you get to see everything without being hassled.    One word of warning. The horse and carriage trips around the city are really good and an experience but the traffic fumes are terrible even at night. The horses (and the drivers) are a bit smelly too so it's not a very romantic thing to do.    All in all I loved Marrakech and think that this hotel is a good place to stay with many positives. It isn't 5 star by UK standards but that is to be expected. I would suggest you budget to give tips and do this earlier rather than later - you will have a better experience throughout the holiday.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Weston super Mare, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieSum
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jan S wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Cheap as Chips - Luvvly Jubbly,This was my first trip to Morocco and wanted to go for ages. Luckily I persuaded a friend to come along on a last minute deal which was an exceptional price.  From the moment we entered the lobby we knew we were getting a good deal. Clean attention to detail and smiling faces.  We did have a few issues with rooms. 1) cockroaches but staff very apologetic and moved us immediately. 2) Described as wheelchair friendly but wheelchair would not go through the bathroom door.3) After waiting 24 hours we were moved to a disabled room but the wet room floor kept flooding due to drain blockage and also an army of ants. We reported the issues but were never addressed. Luckily we are both DIY savvy so managed to sort the bathroom issue and deter the ants.  From there on in our holiday was perfect. Fantastic weather with plenty of sunbeds friendly staff and attention to detail I was not expecting for the price.  Yes the food can be a little tepid but with the volume of people not sure how they could address this.  Every morning staff are pressing freshly squeezed orange juice catering for a range of tastes and preferences.I cannot help but admire their diligence and eagerness to please and provide anything you could ask for.  It was great having authentic Moroccan tagine dishes freshly cooked pasta and desserts sit on your hips.  Animation team are fantastic and encourage people to join in without being over zealous. Particular mention to Magic and Spider.xx  I would return to Kenzi Club without a doubt .,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jansL2743KV
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,alicetildsley wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Very enjoyable,Me and my boyfriend have just come back from a trip- 5 days and 4 nights in Marrakesh.    Hotel:  The hotel is stunning- lovely gardens and grounds large pools plenty of sunbeds and big beds with cushions which were comfy. The bar was great with lots of cocktails and they were very generous with alcohol measures! The pool was very relaxing one had music and the other was a bit quieter. Also liked the more private one we had with out riad.    Room:  We had a double deluxe room which was great- huge bed mini fridge TV with french and english news channels a little sofa thing balcony with chairs bath/shower with complimentary shampoo shower gel and soap. The cleaning service was very good and they put real rose petals on our bed which was a nice touch. You had to pay for the safe but not sure how much it was.    Wifi:  For wifi there were three different types we found some not great. One for each riad to use in the rooms (which wasn't very reliable) a really good one in the reception and one by the pool which you could use if you liked the hotel's Facebook page.    Extra services:  I was very sick for one day and we visited the infirmary. The doctor was very helpful (although didn't speak much English but she understood) and gave me some medicine to take which worked very well. Found this extra service really helpful.    Reception:  Found the reception people really helpful too. We had a few issues with our transfer to the airport and they were more than willing to help and ring local numbers. The free shuttle bus was an extra bonus- watch out for the men when you get off the bus. There was a guy who claimed he worked for the hotel but just be polite and insistent that you don't want any help. In the souks would recommend walking around (not through) the square if you don't like snakes or monkeys. We had men put them in our faces so not recommended for anyone who has a fear of them! Also would recommend seeing a few shops before buying. If an item isn't signposted with a price they can tend to be more demanding with a higher price than other places. (In a bowl shop a man wouldn't back down on 60 dhs for 3 but other shops were selling them for 10 dhs each)    Food:  The food was really nice we liked that they changed the theme every so often. Loved the deserts too. A real highlight: staff waiting on us were really lovely always very smiley and kind couldn't thank them enough. We're not very fussy with food but would have preferred a little bit more variety. More signs on some of the foods would have been helpful for the Moroccan dishes. Drinks with the meal were nice- as much wine coke lemon mirinda beer and water you like.    Excursions:  Before coming I looked at a lot of reviews but not a lot described how they organised excursions. We organised a transfer to and from the airport with EasyJet holidays prior to the trip and after the transfer the driver gave us information on excursions and said a rep would go to the hotel later that day if we were interested in organising some. A really nice man called Mehdi came (the company is called Destination Services- part of the HotelBeds Group) and we organised two excursions. The camel ride was really fun and included some Moroccan mint tea and we also organised a Marrakesh discovery day which included half a day round the historical sites and half round the souks and included a Moroccan lunch (unfortunately we had to leave early because I was ill). There was also a couple of stalls in the hotel which were selling camel rides and quad biking in the desert but not sure what else.  We also struggled on how much money to bring so here's an idea on prices (dhs) of some of the excursions the company offered (per person and all include transfer to and from hotel):  Marrakech discovery day (inc lunch) 380  Souks and Medina half day 180  Atlas mountains 4x4 1 day (inc lunch) 800  Ourika Valley half day 270  Atlas trekking 1 day (inc lunch) 530  Camel ride (inc snack) 290  Fantasia show 460  Quad bikes 590 driver 380 passenger    Lovely stay at this hotel and would recommend.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicetildsley
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,honestreview181 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Would visit again!,Overall this hotel is excellent. It has beautiful grounds clean rooms comfortable beds good facilities nice pools.    There is a very good selection of food and I think the hotel makes a special effort with it's themed nights. I don't agree with some of the other reviews that the food is cold...I didn't experience this at all. There were some flies on the food but I'm not sure how this could have been avoided in a hot climate like this. Perhaps some of the food could be covered in the future? Overall you get what you pay for and I think it would be unfair to expect gourmet food at an all inclusive hotel!    There are a few small areas the hotel could improve on:  1) Wifi is intermittent (although I admit it was a nice break for me being away from the internet when I did need to use the internet and could not connect it was very frustrating)  2) Generally the staff were OK but some of them were miserable and not helpful. Considering the size of the hotel and the number of staff they have employed I feel this is to be expected. Simple tasks like unlocking a safe would take up to 45mins to fix which caused delays.    However despite these small problems I would definitely stay here again. When I booked this hotel I didn't have high expectations considering what we paid. Kenzi Club Agdal Medina hotel definitely exceeded my expectations!,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honestreview181
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Rosie M wrote a review Jun 2016,30,Good but not very relaxing,The grounds and rooms were fab but it had a sort of 'Butlins' feel to it (not that I've ever been). There was always music and entertainment around the main pool and each night they put on 'shows'. If that's your sort of thing then you'll enjoy it but it's not what I look for in a holiday. There were golf and shooting exercises but these were at set times each day so you couldn't do it whenever you'd like. Tennis was good and the gym was great.  Meal times were a bit stressful as there's one big dining room and a buffet style kitchen so you have to find a seat and reserve it somehow whilst you get your food. More than once we came back to find another couple sat at our table when we hadn't finished! Food was okay lots to choose from but none of it really healthy (veg doesn't appear much) and meat a bit tough. Wine and cocktails weren't great but they were all free so can't complain too much.  We stayed in the adult's only riad at the back which was so much better than being on the main strip by the pool (in my opinion). There was no music and a small poolside bar that bought you drinks or you could order lunch there rather than going to the main dining room and the lunch was much better as it was made to order. Saying that the waitress definitely favoured the French so her service to them was much better!  Overall the hotel wasn't bad air con wasn't great but it was modern and clean and easy to arrange day trips from. One thing ti note though is that we heard from another couple that money was stolen from her purse that was left in their room and the hotel were very reluctant in letting her call the police to report it. We used the safe and locked all valuables away (either in safe or suitcases) and had no problems.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosiem325

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,miche752016 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Fantastic Week!,Just got back from a week all inclusive at the Agdal Medina. Had a wonderful time. The staff were friendly warm and helpful the room was clean and comfortable the food was great and it did exceed my expectations especially as there were some unfavourable reviews on here. We were greeted on arrival at reception with a juice cocktail and were driven to our room in a buggy. The hotel grounds themselves are quite large and the avenues do look similar so I found a got lost a few times (but that may just be my poor sense of direction!) The gardens are beautifully manicured and a joy to look at. The hotel was fairly quiet and we always found a clean made up table to eat at either inside or outside under the olive tree's. Also didn't have to queue for food and there was plenty of variety.    We left the maid a tip on the first day and our room was serviced to a high standard. The air conditioning was very good but the wi-fi was a bit flaky outside the room. There were always spaces by the pool and we spent our time at the smaller one and left the larger one for those with children! The poolside bar was excellent and the staff worked so hard all day in searing temperatures - Said was brilliant in particular! Lovely guy. We generally found that by being friendly ourselves the warmth we received in return was very genuine and kind and many of the staff remembered our names from day one which was nice.    The shuttle bus into town was great and we also used the spa for a hammam and massage - I would highly recommend this the girls are lovely and it is soooo relaxing.    I also went on the desert safari - camel ride and evening meal - which I booked through Kushim (great guy!) I would recommend this night out as it was great fun and very atmospheric.    My only qualm about the hotel would be that there aren't any welcome details in the room. We didn't realise we had to pay for the safe for example. And it would have been useful to have general information to hand.    Other than that we had a great stay and I hope to return later this year. Marrakesh itself is hectic - we hired a guide who pretty much took us only to his mate's places - but you live and learn. A visit to the Marjorelle gardens is a must as it is so beautiful.

Check in staff were mixed one lady very miserable and the other the complete opposite.  Food was ok bit on par with Egypt breads etc lovely as very french influenced. Never had warm coffee once it was always freezing.  Drinks in the evening were fine nice cocktails to try and local spirts were fine. The waiter staff were great very friendly.  Entertainment was again fine we didnt take part however liked watching the dancing and the staff still spoke to us around pool and at night even though we didn't join in.  Pool areas were lovely loads of sun loungers and nice cushions. Adult pool was nice and spacious and a large pool to swim.  I felt rooms were good a bit dark however only think i really wanted was a mirror on in the room near the dressing table!  The aircon in the room was really poor it could be doing with an upgrade  The resort itself i feel could cut back on the amount of trees around the place maybe tidy them up as the balconies were a little overgrown.  All in all it was a nice hotel with only a few week tweaks needed i would go back as a short break.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Falkirk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnie19

This hotel we choose as all inc. we were upgraded to privilege rooms which I would say they were not with the extra money the pool was quiet and shady.  The food was nice and fresh the hotel was clean and very tidy. A huge choice if sun beds and the animation did well however I personally found the evening entertainment a bit boring .. But they did try.  The spirits were not great so take a bottle of vodka or whatever you drink.  We had no problems with the maids. There is a small shop on site and a cashpoint.  I met a taxi driver on my previous visit who I used daily and he collected us from the airport and also did a trip to the atlas and the medina and he is very punctual and fab prices . His name is abdulla and you can what's app him if you do say jenny gave you his number he is such a lovely guy.  ‪+212 661‑478138‬. You can pre book him to collect you from the airport as he is half the price and no hassle. The hotels wifi is not great but does the job.  I do think they favour the French.

Rooms weren't too bad pool was decent and the food was not as bad as other all inclusive resorts I've been to.    Problem with this place is it's not 5 star. The Wi-Fi is terrible. The staff are inconsistent. We had to ask for towels after they cleaned our room nearly everyday! Unless you speak French it can be hard work with some of the staff. To be fair some of the restaurant staff are helpful but it's only a handful of them.    Then outside sit the taxis waiting for mugs to come out the hotel and they will charge you double to wherever you want to go. Avoid at all costs.    Some of the women on the reception desk give you a look like you are dirt. Serious attitude problems. Again not all but some.    It's sad as the venue has potential it's the management that don't seem to make the changes that would make this place slot better.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kamini wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Lovely hotel and friendly staff,This was my 2nd visit to the hotel. Was there last year in September loved it that much that I had to come back with my family.  Marrakech is a great place and the people are very friendly.  I have only 2 complaints about the holiday and that is the taxis and the Souk market is very expensive especially. Also the restaurants in the square are over priced. Make sure you ask for prices before you order food we didn't. They persuade you to eat a bit of everything and then they sting you with the bill. BE VERY CAREFUL. We were very shocked when we were given the bill. For 6 of us to eat street food it cost us £109.    My daughter did a price check on everything we were interested in buying but after seeing the conversion we choose not to buy. So I would advise you to do your homework before buying stuff. Also you definitely need to brush up on your haggling skills with the taxi drivers and shopping.  Apart from that it's a great place to visit.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eshaan2011
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ellabellae wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Great holiday but tired in places,This is our second stay at the Kenzi Club out first being in 2012. The hotel hasn't changed in that time including the decor and restaurant furniture and that clearly shows.  The buffet restaurant is tired it needs a good deep clean including removing dead flys from the lampshades and changing the old rickety chairs that wobble.  Our room was a family suite again dirty hand prints on mirrors and again tired decor with a rip in the throw on the bed and stained towels.  The food was repetitive lunch and dinner was the same food served daily.  Hotel reception staff were unhelpful no information given at check in and we had to wait beyond 2.30 for our room to be ready. Had we of been French it may of been different.  The pros- the grounds beautiful flowers pools and outdoor spaces are fantastic.. Pool staff work hard cleaning it and around it the snack bar cook the bar staff even the animation team were working hard to keep everyone entertained we couldn't fault them..  Would we go back? Yes but for no more than 4 nights because of the food issue.  Don't expect 4 or 5 stars because it isn't sadly.. Externally yes internally no.  Location is good. Expect to pay 250 MAD from airport to the hotel in a taxi and hold on tight..  Take a private guide from the hotel into the city 15 euros for 3hours ours was amazing took us round the souks.. He will take you to herb sellers and shops where they make you buy but don't be afraid to say no.  If someone offers you something for free it isn't say no!  All round we had a great holiday but the repetitive food left us feeling a little annoyed there's only so many days you can eat the same pizza or pasta lunch and dinner time !,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellabellae

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,BecciS3 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Great holiday for a great price,My friends and I visited the hotel at the end of February 2015. We wanted to find somewhere all inclusive but most importantly it had to be hot. Morocco seemed to be the best destination and we chose Marrakech as there seemed to be a lot to see their. We came across this hotel which had good reviews and the price was brilliant. We booked the hotel flights and transfers separately. We weren't expecting much at the price we paid but we were so surprised on arrival. The reception was so grand with doormen greeting you and Moroccan tea on arrival. We got checked in and our suitcases were taken away to be put on a golf caddy. We didn't realise our Riad was a little walk but not miles. We also didn't realise that the driver wanted a tip when he brought up our suitcases to the room we thought this was part of the service. This was our first experience of people asking for tips for everything they do! The room was lovely and modern. The main room had a massive superking bed and the lounge room which we later realised was the other bedroom had two sofas for beds. The beds weren't made up so we called up reception to come make them which they did. The bathroom was massive with two showers which was convenient for the four of us plus a separate toilet by the front door. We paid extra for a safe which was essential. The balcony's were nice and the lounge had a tv which was great for the music channels before a night out! Wifi was restricted most of the time we couldn't pick it up in our room apart from a corner right by the front door.    We explored the hotel and found various facilities. The pools were lovely having a heated and unheated pool. The bar was big and never really a queue. The activities consisted of volleyball punch bags ping pong tennis etc. and the hotel had its own mini zoo! (although the poor animals looked a bit messy and smelled horrible the staff seemed to look after them?!). There were a few slides into the pool which was funny for 10 mins and enough lounges and bed lounges around the pool. Activities were put on in the day which we enjoyed belly dancing and the water aerobics. The hotel also had a few shops an extra restaurant (which you paid extra for) and evening entertainment in the main hall room which was mainly the dance group. The dance group are wouldn't say were very good it was a little cringy at times but at least the hotel supplied something to see of an evening.    The food was good it varied quite a lot and had themed nights. The drinks are good as they were bottled brands. You could have had food cooked for you in certain sections and it was a big selection. My friends and I became unwell throughout the holiday but this may have been because of how the food is washed possibly the water? our bodies are not use to their water/food I would hate to say it was down to the produce as it looked like they had tried hard to supply a good spread for their customers. There was another bar opposite which also hosted evening entertainment it had more of an atmosphere.    The hotel also supplied a taxi service into the town so we could see the souks (which was an experience) You had to book a space as it was quite busy but was a reasonable price. There were set times and sometimes it wasn't convenient for us to catch the hotel taxi back so we would get our own taxi which would work out almost the same price.    The reception were very helpful with requests and the staff were very friendly. They encouraged you to join in and on the last day we had a pool party with cocktails. It was a fun holiday and for the price it was a great deal. We were technically outside of Marrakech town centre so it was quiet and you were able to enjoy yourself unlike being in town where the four of us (girls) were harrassed by owners of shops and other women on the street trying to make us buy things. It was a nice hotel and would recommend to anyone who wants to experience morocco in a calmer environment.,Date of stay: June 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecciS3
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,UmmRayyan wrote a review Jun 2016,40,4 night half term break,We booked a family room at the Kenzi Club for 4 nights during half term for myself my husband & my 4yr old & 15mth old. The layout of the hotel is abit different to other hotels I've stayed at. It's all scattered - reception in one building restaurant in another rooms are divided into Riad blocks which are a short walk or buggy ride away. I requested to be in a Riad as close to reception/dining hall as possible as my son is autistic and it can get quite difficult to make him walk. We stayed in room 127 in Riad Yasmine. The room was VERY spacious and clean too. The wifi in the reception was good. The room wifi was abit temperamental and only worked in the sofa area of the room. The food is nice. There's always a variety to choose from & they do themed buffets most evenings. There is a free shuttle bus to the Medina. The outdoor pools are not heated but the weather was averaging 35'c so the cold pool was a nice refresher. Pool bar is abit of a walk away but they had a good choice of snacks and drinks. There is a mini fridge in the room but it doesn't get stocked up. They just provide a big bottle of water in the living area. There is a charge for using the safe in the room. Staff were pleasant. A special mention about housekeeping maids - they are wonderful & work extremely hard. Overall it was a pleasant stay.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UmmRayyan
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SK09 wrote a review Jun 2016,50,2nd time round.,My husband and I stayed here back in 2013 and decided to revisit with our 2 daughters at the end of May. Reception staff are friendly and efficient and will answer the phone quickly and are happy to help with your request. The family room is very spacious.The hotel is very clean and the cleaning maids are really helpful too beds are made everyday and fresh towels are given too everyday. I cannot fault the restaurant staff or the food. There is a variety of different types of food and and more than enough choice for children. Snacks also at the pool bar at 4pm which is always great especially for the children. Mustafa and Brahim who work in the restaurant are so friendly and the hotel should be proud to have them working there. As for the Bar Staff in the main bar in the evening well they need to learn how to smile and how to be polite this is definitely one area the Hotel needs to improve on. Entertainment Staff are lovely and there is lots of different activities to do throughout the day and the entertainment in the evening is also varied. Hotel offers free return shuttles to the souks. Wifi is available. We would love to revisit again in the future.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SK2399

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jaser S wrote a review May 2016,50,A Club Hotel to Enjoy and Relax,Stayed here with my wife and our Son 6 years old for 2 Weeks and we enjoyed every single Day. There is a lot to do so you'll not feel boring 3 Pools one with Water Slides a small pool for infants 2 Tennis Courts Basketball Football Volleyball Badminton Tabletennis Bocce and a lot activities with the Animation Team just to mention Golf and Poker with Mouss that was great and Informative Bow and Airgun shooting with Mr. Spider (Amin) a full time Entertainer and Animator Water Gym and Water cycling with Mr. Magic ( Majid) a thrill Coach who makes u sweat even under Water and a lot more like stretching step aerobics and so on with Salim Ziko Ashraf Mario Hasnah and ...... . There is also time to Relax beside the pools under the shades or in the huge beautiful Garden which is well maintained by the Gardeners.  The Food was delicious from Breakfast to Dinner with a lot of varieties ( open Buffet) from local to international  and every evening for Dinner a different Theme. Beside that there is now beside the Poolbar from 11 a.m- 06 p.m a Snackbar and icecream.  Every Night there is a different Show with Dancing sketches and acrobatic entertainment which can be enjoyed with a Drink from the Bar.  I also have 2 small critics that the Management might solve easily first that the gym in the spa has to be paid i stayed in many hotels and i never had to pay like 25 euros per week just to use the gym it should be free of charge and the Timings should be longer like from 7 a.m to 9 p.m!  The second thing is to provide some more activities for children between 6 and 12 cause there are too big for the mini club but also too small to participate in the activities done for the adults so if one of the Animators will be specialized just to take care of the bigger children and provide some activities special for them.  But as i said from the beginning we enjoyed our stay and would come back any time and we will recommend it to our Friends.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Munich, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasers2014

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Styles C wrote a review May 2016,50,Great place,As I forgot to leave a review after returning from the Kenzi club it's really a must I do one now as the hotel deserves all the praise it gets it is a fantastic please to visit. Having been to agadir last December we thought we would give marrakesh a try. We were not to sure about being away from the coast at time of booking but that didn't last too long. The hotel is fantastic in every way. We had standard room couldn't fault. Very tidy cleaned throughly every day. Food was very nice sometimes a little cold but realised if you wander round decide what you want then go get in a dash it's plenty hot enough the presentation to detail was nice. The waiting staff were really nice too. Forget the french are treated better we were all treated the same. Bar staff worked tirelessly too. sorry I forgot the names as they deserved a special thank you. We went on the trip to the waterfalls it was a long drive to get there but wow it's a must visit especially with a guide not sure about high season maybe it's too hot. Entertainment team were very good too we enjoyed all the shows we see. We knew little donnay from agadir visit. All in all a fantastic place to go.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sandsn wrote a review May 2016,40,great to be back,Took advantage of the cheap easyjet flights to get a few days to chill on the sun. Arrived quite late and reception took our cases so we could go straight to the restaurant to get dinner. When we returned to check in we were told we had been upgraded to the Riad Its the one with the private 'quiet' pool and drinks service. A wonderful start to the holiday.    Rooms are spacious very clean and well appointed. air con works well beds are huge and bedding of a good quality. Always hot water available. Rooms cleaned daily.  We were concerned that as it was Jan 2015 we last visited when it was relatively quiet the complex may not be able to cope with large numbers. Happy to report the service attention to detail and quality was just as good. The restaurant is spacious and does not have that school canteen feel of many other all inclusive resorts. Wine and drinks are served at the tables. There is always a good choice of food at mealtimes and it is constantly being prepared by numerous chiefs . There is also an omelette and pasta chief on hand daily. The vegetarian options are vast and really tasty.    The entertainment team has expanded since last year but we were glad to see Magic and Spider were still there. The team works very hard to put on shows help with sports and to ensure everyone is having a good time and not left out of things.    Lots of spaced out sun beds around all the pools all with comfy mattresses. Water dispensers around too and bottles of water available from bars ands restaurant.    We did not leave the resort. We had used the hotel shuttle bus previously to visit the souks. We had such a short visit we really did chill poolside the whole time. The beauty with this resort is that although check out is 12noon you can use the facilities until your departure tome and as it is only about 15min away from the airport this means max time in the hotel another plus.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandsn
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Loulew_11 wrote a review May 2016,30,Hitty missy hotel,I would rate this hotel 4 star at best. Nice reception area and gardens. Rooms tired and could do with updating. Sheets soft but well used and now off white towels thin and past their best.  Food very good breakfast choice hot and cold fresh fruit omelettes etc but coffee cold. Lunch similar each day but plenty of choice. Themed evening meals e.g. Asian Italian Moroccan. Snack bar tends to be left overs from lunch and breakfast!  Limited choice of drinks at the bars and all local brands. Avoid the 'cocktails'. Good bar service from Said at the pool bar.  Animation team mainly poor and self absorbed but there is a full day of activities available.  Two large pools one with a couple of short water slides.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Bazbomb wrote a review May 2016,40,Nice Hotel,We stayed her for three nights.You need to be good at walking as some rooms are a buggy ride away. there is no water in the room or tea or coffee facilities so this is frustrating if you like a drink of any kind through the night or in the morning Our safe didn't work well and we had to wait in our room for an hour for the engineer 7pm-8pm they did fix it but it went wrong again we were not prepared to wait in again so asked for our money back. they did oblige. we were three ladies in a triple room the third bed is a sofa it doesn't pull out so don't expect the normal sofa beds. the last night we were only left one bath towel we called the reception to request another two they never turned up the reception staff answer your calls but are not very good at following up what they say we felt you needed to keep ringing or reminding them if you were sitting in the reception area. We asked them to check our pick up they said sit down the company will ring back in 5 minutes after 10-15 mins we reminded them we were waiting and they recalled pick up for 9 they told us. next day we were ready at 9am. told no its 9.30 we don't pick up before that. communication is a bit hit and miss.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Charlotte H wrote a review May 2016,40,good,Check in isn't until 2.30pm so if you have a morning flight it can be a little annoying but you are able to leave suitcase in safe place.    We had a double deluxe room which was on the ground floor rooms are clean with a flat screen tv and nice bathroom. The beds are single beds pushed together which is very annoying. Not sure what the deluxe part to the room is as we had a spare single bed. Rooms are cleaned everyday. The walls are very thin so can be quite loud.    The food is good so much choice to cater for everybody. Different themes every day from Asian to fish themed. Lots of salad bits. The pasta area is especially good the man will ask you what type of pasta you would like and then what you would like in it.    Sunbeds and the pools are lovely. The slides are fun for all ages. Fun activities to do during the day such as cooking classes water aerobics darts football and more. Behind the animation hut you have basketball table tennis football and volleyball.    The hotel seems to favour French guests rather than British. They speak to you in French and seem to like you better if you are French. Animation team aren't that great. Don't make any effort to speak to you again seem to go to the French more.    The spa is good the ladies on the front desk were quite rude and it seemed a problem for them to help us with our questions. The steam room is very relaxing the only thing which bothered us was we wasn't able to have a treatment done together we had to go one after the other.    The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to the markets which takes around 10 minutes. If you haven't visited the markets before please be aware of men claiming they are from the hotel when you get off the bus and they guide you to the market but then just ask for money. We didn't enjoy the markets at all felt very uncomfortable the whole time certainly not a place for children.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottehx

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,asha b wrote a review May 2016,20,Okay visit,I booked this hotel based on the reviews I had read but compared to other all inclusive hotels in similar price ranges I was disappointed.    The staff at reception were not helpful and asking them anything seemed like an inconvenience for them. I had read other travellers saying this hotel favoured French tourists I can say I experienced this myself. I was waiting in line to ask reception a question about our luggage. A French tourist was behind me. The guy at reception ignored me and tried to serve the person behind me. Thankfully the other person said I was there first. I was shocked by this behaviour and it was totally unnecessary. I understand the hotel caters more for French tourists but favouring certain people is rude and uncalled for.    The food was varied and there was plenty of it but always cold no matter what time we went to eat.    The rooms were spacious and clean. Rooms were cleaned every day and towels replaced.    The spa I didn't use as when I approached the ladies they were rude and unhelpful. Again it seemed as though my questions were unwanted. I used another spa in town which was a much better experience.    The timings for the food/snacks is set and if you miss these times there's no other options. It would be good for a snack bar to be open all day.    Not a hotel I would recommend or return to.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashab2013
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sunseeker560 wrote a review May 2016,30,Not Bad - 3 Stars,We decided to go to Morocco this time as the weather seems to be better than England 32 Deg. Be prepared to wait 30-45 mins at the airport for Immigration at arrivals & departure no visa needed. Anyway the resort is not bad staff are very helpful most speak English so you can get by rooms & room service is ok after two days we were getting this foul smell when turning AC on & it seemed to be an issue with AC which got rectified after making a complain we were in Riad 4 (Block) right at the end of the resort opposite tennis court with its own pool area and serving mini snack bar; The resort was full of French & local French Moroccans no issues there unlike Russians in Egypt. There are two huge pools it was 30-32 deg. at 1 pm but the pool water was freezing cold. could only do ten minutes at a time. The animation team are not bad they seem to provide good activities & entertainment in the resort. The food in the main restaurant I must say was not to our taste at all lots of variety's though salads deserts breads local dishes pasta & egg stations but the main meal dishes I found to be very bland & tasteless including tagines but we got by; One thing I will mention is during breki lunch & dinner if you are early you get a good table otherwise its a struggle to find a clean one; Drinks are usual local type water down spirits cocktails are sweet stick to beer its nice. Buy your local currency at the Airport or Hotel its not much difference but any left over have to be sold back at the Airport before you depart Hotel will not take it back. We took a free shuttle to Medina ( bookable otherwise you get removed) its the usual hustle & bustle of the locals going about their business you get to see the local life surroundings lots of shops no hastle beware in the medina & watch out for cyclists motor bikes & donkey carts; Lots of horse cart rides in the square you can buy shopping in local money or Euros. Apart form that we stayed in resort did not go anywhere else. Resort has free wifi available at reception & in the room only. If you are at ground level check you sliding door as our was not locking properly. On checkout at hotel be prepared to pay your local tax late checkout is available approx. £ 30 to 50 per room. You decide. At the airport in departure prices are in euros its impossible to find a place to sit as the airport is very busy there are no jetty's & its a short walk from aircraft to terminal & vice versa.    Overall:- Not bad but I will not be going to Morocco again not for my taste anyway but you might like it.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hounslow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunseeker560

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,uklarka wrote a review May 2016,40,Good - 3.5 stars,Stayed here all inclusive for 5 nights with friends. If I could I would give this this 3.5 stars but rated it 4 based on the friendly staff. It's not really a 5 star resort; more 3-4 star.    Rooms: we were upgraded to the privilege rooms which are arranged around their own pool with sun loungers. The advantage with privilege rooms is we got free wifi in the rooms & waited drinks by the pool during daytime hours. The rooms were good sized & cleaned daily. They all have a small patio area.    Resort: the guests were mainly French or French Moroccan but we did see a fair few Brits there also. They have 2 pools; one with some small slides. Neither pool is heated. The bar besides the pool serves drinks ~9-5pm. The resort was well manicured and we could see cleaners and gardeners most days. The resort is clearly aimed at families.    Facilities: they offer daily shuttle transfers to Jama el Fina which we used once. Taxi costs ~ 100 MAD to Jama el Fina & to airport as well. Remember to haggle & fix price before getting in! The animation team were friendly especially Mario! The animation programme was relatively limited. They have basketball football beach volley ball & French bowl areas. We did book aqua bikes once but didn't actually go. They only have 5 working bikes! The offer pool tools with a refundable deposit.    Staff: most were very friendly and a few of them spoke English.    Food & drinks: the main restaurant is big and they gave themed evening meals. There is a decent variety and they always have pasta pizza and Tagines. I enjoyed the mini steaks. Desserts are always the same - cakes & tarts mainly. They have coked zero bottles & other soft drinks on tap. Water usually comes in 2L bottles. The snack bar adjacent to the restaurant is open from 4.30 to 6pm; pancakes & pastries. Coffee in the morning (filter) was good but at other times hot drinks are from a machine & tasteless.    We were disappointed they don't serve any decaff.    Spa & gym: very disappointed that access to the gym and spa was not included! It was 80 MAD per gym visit. Massages were quite expensive; 300 MAD for 30 min relaxing massage. The massage was ok. They really ought to have provided gym access for free like all 5 star resorts.    Prayer room / mosque: surprisingly they don't have one on site & there is no mosque nearby. This is something that could be easily sorted.    Nearby: there is a go karting place across the road & 10 mins up the road the fab Bo & Zin restaurant which is defo worth a visit.    Would I stay again? Probably not unless I got a really good price. I'd prefer to pay a bit more for the extra amenities & better standard.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uklarka
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Joan_M_Utset wrote a review May 2016,10,All Included.. Only when available.,A horrible experience at a hotel that pretends to be what is not.    We arrived mid afternoon with the intention to end our trip in an environment that according to the web they offer everything. Premises are there.. but the service is not.    After arriving mid afternoon we wanted to eat something as we came from a long journey. Impossible task all the restaurants were closed and not only that nowhere at the hotel served or sold food of any kind. After sending us the poolside bar where they didn't had not even a miserable bag of chips or snacks not to mention a simple club sandwich we were sent to one of the restaurants where they got us a tray with a pile of breakfast pastries with traces of jam and butter possibly from other clients. When we ordered the drinks to our surprise we got warm Coke and Fanta in 2 liter bottles together with some clearly reused plastic glasses (completely scratched). Worse than a crummy hostel.    We complain to the reception and all explanation was that no food was available until seven and we should wait and told us that in France (!! ??) they also serve the drinks out of two-liter bottles in the hotels all inclusive ...    Funny enough they seem to be more offended about us complaining rather than the reasons behind the complaint.    We decided to go to the city to enjoy a great dinner with the friends and forget about the hotel and their more than poor service and attitude.,Date of stay: May 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lloret de Mar, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joan_M_Utset

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Neal A wrote a review May 2016,10,Terrible Management,I don't normally write reviews but I was so unimpressed by my treatment here that I feel the need to share my experience. I stayed from the 26th to 30th April in room 210. This is supposedly a 5* hotel it isn't at best 4*. We arrived at 11pm to be told the restaurant was shut fair enough but I expected as we were all inclusive that there should be sandwiches there were not! A decent hotel would have anticipated this.  We chose this hotel because it stated that it had Wi-Fi. Now this might sound sad but we run a couple of businesses that mean we need access to the internet. Having discovered that the Wi-Fi didn't work I went to see management who supplied me with a dongle for the day which was great. That evening they took the dongle back and informed me that the Wi-Fi was working properly which was true if you were prepared to sit on the loo all day as that was the only place in our room that it worked. Went the next day to reception to speak to management and was told to come back in an hour. I did this and waited for 15 minutes but nobody came out. Informed reception where I could be found by the pool but nobody ever turned up. In my book that is a terrible way to treat a paying guest.  A couple of other minor points. The food is not international enough. The staff are poorly trained an example is they do not allow you to go through a door first instead they barge ahead of you. Positive points is that there are loads of sunbeds and the rooms are quiet. Frankly avoid this hotel if you are expecting 4* treatment.,Date of stay: April 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leeds, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neal382

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,stephen632016 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A relaxing stay in a superb hotel with lovely friendly staff,My wife and I travelled to Marrakech in December 2015 from Gatwick via EasyJet. We found the flight of about 3 and half hours comfortable and the the crew pleasing. On arriving at Marrakech airport we found our pick-up from the airport easily with our name written on a board and our driver waiting to take us to the Hotel. During our stay we had free transfers via minibus to and from the Medina which was very welcoming and the driver was always punctual. Local taxis were good but always barter and agree a fare before travelling.  My wife and I found the location of the hotel good. The service we received whilst at the Hotel was outstanding nothing was too much trouble and the staff were always happy and pleased to help. Whilst we were there we made friends with a number of the staff. The girls behind the reception (Samaa and Poubna) were always happy and smiling and the girl who looked after our room was lovely always making our bed with swans or hearts made out of towels and sprinkling over with petals. The lovely manager we met Mr. Lahzou Mohammed was very helpful and when he found out we were on our honeymoon he upgraded us to one of the suites in the private area which had its own entrance hall large living room bedroom and on-suite bathroom as well as a large veranda beautiful. The facilities were fantastic two large outdoor pools and cocktail bar games including table tennis tennis shooting and vollyball. All meals delicious with lots of choice and overall value for money fantastic.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephen632016

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Davvy3 wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Relaxing stay,My boyfriend and I stayed here in March 2016 for a week. The hotel grounds are huge and so beautiful lovely bright flowers climb the walls which give it a really picturesque look. At night there are beautiful Moroccan lanterns lit along each walk way a beautiful hotel and very well kept.    There is one rectangular pool which is heated and one more shapely pool the shapely pool was a bit too cold in March but I am sure in the summer is perfectly warm. The pool area is very clean and relaxing with huge bed type sun loungers it made the perfect place to sun bathe. They have a variety of games and sports to play archery boules basket ball pony riding table tennis etc.    The restaurant is lovely a lot of choice of foods most nights there is a theme evening like Chinese or Italian etc whilst they still provided the tradition Moroccan tagine dishes each night (which were so flavour-some) the food was tasty and great quality all cooked fresh. The waiter staff were very friendly and accommodating one waiter we saw many times called Achraf was so helpful and very friendly he always greeted us with a smile and even gave us a recipe for one of the tagine dishes we loved from the restaurant.    There is a bar by the pool which gives you wine beer and cocktails (including non alcoholic cocktails) all day long. The staff were very friendly and the cocktails delicious. The beer and wine was also great.    There is a free shuttle bus that runs about every half an hour into the main Medina/square. they always ran on time and were so handy to get into the main centre. The only down side I would say about the hotel is the reception staff weren't very helpful or that friendly if you had an enquiry they tended to pass you on to someone else but it wasn't a problem. We really enjoyed our stay. We will be back. I definitely recommend it.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davvy3
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SomersetStephen wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A superb hotel outside the city centre,The Kenzi Club Agdal Medina is all inclusive and is situated about 7km from the centre of Marrakech. It is an oasis to retreat to from the city. There is an hourly hotel shuttle into the city centre (best to book with reception to be sure a seat) which takes about 10 minutes. The reception staff and most of the other staff speak excellent english and are very keen to help you enjoy your stay. A taxi from the airport cost about 15 euros but agree the price with the driver before you get into the taxi (there are some rouge drivers). There is free WIFI in the main hotel areas but not in the rooms.  The rooms are set out in the gardens in small squares around inner gardened cloisters and have baths with showers hairdryers and fridges. They are a decent size and have patio doors to either a patio or balcony (both have chairs and a table). The rooms were well appointed and clean. You can choose either a double bed or twin beds and all of the rooms are non-smoking.  The hotel has a very large pool with water slides and also has another very large pool for more serious swimming plus a children's pool. There are more that enough sun loungers and therefore guests didn't seem to reserve them with towels etc. (which was nice). There are various other sports facilities including tennis courts basketball courts football pitches volleyball courts beach volleyball courts archery shooting darts and boules pistes. Various tournaments are organised but outside these times the facilities are available for general usage. Swimming pool based activities are also organised. There is also a gym and a spa. Other activities are also organised such as daily cooking demonstrations and belly dancing tuition etc. The evenings generally start with a light hearted quiz followed by kids entertainment and then a show. A kids club runs during the day. You can take or leave all of this and just chill out if you wish to. The hotel and grounds are generally fairly quiet and the activities do not generally disturb this.  Food is available pretty well all day. All meals in the main restaurant are buffet style. Soft and alcoholic drinks are freely available. The white wine was quite drinkable for all inclusive. Breakfast is what you would expect. It is plentiful and varied. Lunch is a good selection of hot food cold food fruit and deserts. Dinner is similar. The fish is fresh and tasty but some types of fish were quite bony. Moroccan dishes (Tangines Pastiles etc.) are always available as is Moroccan tea (try to get tea not laced in sugar as most of it seems to be). There is also a Moroccan restaurant (for 100dh surcharge) but I cannot recommend it. It seemed very touristy to me and not very interesting.  The key sights in Marrakech can be found in any travel guide but the Souks are well worth a visit at night when they really come to life and take on another vibrant character.  If you want to move around the sights quickly without wasting time I would recommend that you use an official guide as the back streets meander and are confusing. You will be hassled by every tom dick and harry (not sure that they are Moroccan names) but just take it in your stride and ignore them. I didn't find them as bad as when in Egypt but they can annoy you after a while if you don't let it all go over your head (keep calm and carry on). Many restaurants allow smoking. The food cooked on the stalls in the Souks is not hygienic and plates and utensils are often not properly washed. It is probably not a healthy option and to be avoided.  Overall I found this hotel very good for food accommodation location service and value.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Al Z wrote a review Apr 2016,40,A very pleasant surprise! Although avoid the Spa,"I have been surprised to the upside by this resort. This is the very first time I tried an all inclusive hotel. It is definitely an hotel I will go back to and would highly recommend trying. Grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The food is delicious and very good quality. You may get a little bored after a few days but I stayed only 3 nights so it was perfect. There is a different theme for the dinner buffet every night: Morrocan Italian International whilst I was there. I did not try the separate restaurant don't think it is worth paying the supplement. The personnel is very polite and helpful. I really had a good time. My only negative is the spa i booked a 30 minutes massage which is effectively a 10minutes massage. I booked at 5pm did not get into the massage room before 5:15pm and was out of the building at 5:36pm. Knowing that the massage included a 5 minutes ""relaxation"" ie you just lay on the table in the dark ...

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Miles7000 wrote a review Apr 2016,30,Dissapointing,"Website didn't really prepare us for the actual experience. We expected an all inclusive four star hotel but what we got was an upmarket holiday camp. Very Popular with French families since ""club"" means children's holiday camp in French.    Rooms were very dark but had a comfortable bed. Housekeeping was poor. We could see our room door from the pool and timed the housekeeper on a couple of occasions. Three minutes was the total time spent. In four days we didn't have a change of linens or towels.    All food is served at the enormous buffet but what we didn't expect was the characterless 500 seater restaurant. The staff responsible for table clearing etc were poorly trained and even more poorly managed. Tables were left uncleared so if you didn't arrive at the start of a meal service you could spend some time looking for a table. On one occasion we cleared and set our own table only to find that on returning from the buffet that another couple had taken it.    The drinks part of the all inclusive package brought mixed experiences. Beer OK wine just drinkable but spirits were awful. A gin and tonic was actually non specific white alcohol with a sweet mixer . . . Disgusting. There was only one bar which was a characterless barn pumping out full volume country music for the lovers of line dancing.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Peter C wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Massage in Marrakesh,My SJ treated me to this 'different' experience. The Hotel was okay probably not totally to our taste but a good comfortable bed and a place to rest and relax. The food was very good despite the number of people they had to cater for with plenty of variety and themed on different nights. Fresh produce a lot cooked directly in front of you as you waited in line. We ate well drank well slept well and dodged the rain. Yes it rains in Morocco!! The best bit and one of the reasons we went was the Spa. SJ had a full massage first and thought that they were bit gentle but I got a strong girl prepared to find those knots. Three days and three 30mins and I was floating sore but she was good and got deeper each day. SJ had her the last day as well and felt the same.

Quality of food was number 1 let down in this hotel - I've visited many all inclusives and this this hotel ranks lowly for food quality (quantity good quality not so good)  Poor customer service from receptionists - unfriendly stop serving you to serve other guests etc.  Asked twice for fault with tv remote in room to be fixed - never dealt with  Spa reception very unfriendly and almost rude in answering our questions (we were wanting to spend money!)

Unfortunately we did not experience the friendliest of stays as felt staff were biased in favour of french speakers. The staff in the bar were very dismissive and even the waiting staff in the evening were very changeable in their attitude. That said in the morning for breakfast and at lunch time the wonderful maitre de Moustafa made sure that we were treated with the utmost care and courtesy always smiling and very helpful. He is definately one of the best things about this hotel! Generally clean although we did have a problem with cockroach in our room left two for the cleaners reported one at the desk which was dealt with and despatched the fourth one ourselves after which they got the message and didn't come back! Pool area was beautiful and kept very clean although when the hotel is at full capacity wonder whether there would be enough sunbeds. Food was good if a bit repetative but there was something for everyone at all servings. I guess would be classed as a good family friendly hotel but if you don't have children avoid any school holiday time since parents seem to switch off!

This time I took my kids and we were treated really well. The hotel is so clean! So much time goes on the keeping everything in good order. The staff as always are super friendly! My sons aged 10 and 12 were always busy having fun in the pool or joining in the many activities available. The evening entertainment is good we enjoyed this. The main bulk of guests are French most of the activities are spoken in French but all the staff can speak some or good English.    What would I advise to improve.....    The main pool is so cold if it was heated more people would use it it is often empty (last time we used in the height of the summer and it was still cold)    The petting zoo is locked and you cant really touch the animals last time the gate was not locked.    The toiletries in the room have changed it used to be the famous orange smells like the hotel reception I was sad not get these again.    The spa/ sauna is mixed for a Muslim this is not good and I could not use it.    Some of the bar staff were not great in the evening long waits for drinks and poor customer service they would all stand around talking and make you wait for drinks to be served this really annoyed me as it was every night and a few men had really bad attitudes.    The day bar staff up at the pool are lovely friendly people. But more hands are needed for better service and to help them.    The kids beds are made from the sofas these are really hard and uncomfortable there needs to be a mattress laid on them my boys had bad sleeping :(    I will come back again and hopefully see some improvements.

The Room was a very good size will a lovely en suite bathroom and balcony. The only struggle was working out the time of the cleaning rota which seemed to change so we couldnt work out when it was good to stay in.    The food was excellent cooked freshly with such a huge variety. One night there were two whole tunas  and a chef would cut off fillets for you and grill them. The tagines were delicious everyday. The meal times were also more flexible than expected (lunch until 3!) which was handy when you had a late breakfast.  The staff were wonderful engaging and attentive without being invasive. And although we didnt travel with children. the kids club seemed fantastic the children seemed to have lots of fun and would run up to their favourite staff members and hug them.  All-inclusive was great and the pool bar served really good variety of drinks (or made whatever you wanted up for you). There are tennis courts aquabikes belly dancing classes basket ball badminton and table tennis tables not to mention the gym. You never ran out of things to do in the hotel let alone in the city centre (very handy free shuttle bus from hotel)    Just be warned they have the Moroccan tax which is something like 30dh a night.

We went to the front desk and was told it was being re-set and to go back to the room and try again. Went back to the room still not working. Called front desk from room and was told they were trying to re-set again. Still didn't work. Contacted two more times...still not working. Went to front desk on 3/23 at 7am...and was told that technician was going to come out this morning and would be re-set (again). And...if for some reason it could not be re-set...we would be switched to a room with WIFI upon our return from our excursion that evening. We returned from our touring at 730pm and went to room and still not working. Went back up to front desk (mind you our room was in the back of the resort...and it is about a 5-10 minute walk in the cold rain to the front desk) and was informed that it would be re-set (yet again). Front desk supervisor sent us back to the room with a baggage/cocerige representative to see if working....still not working. Baggage rep called up to front desk to confirm not working and handed us the phone. We requested a new room since we were promised one ealier in the day if WIFI was still not working. We were then told by the front desk supervisor that we would need to wait until the next day for a new room. Continued to press and front desk manager provided baggage rep two keys to two rooms for us to try--- neither of those rooms connected to WIFI either. Was told that we would need to speak with Guest Relations Manager at 10am the following day. At 10am went to front desk and asked to speak with Manager (Mohommad). Instead we were told to take a seat. Technician/engineer woman showed up and came back to room with us. Still not working. She stated she would ""be right back""---- 90 minutes later she came back and said it was an external problem. She said she would return with a WIFI box at 3pm. We returned early from our excursion at 3pm and she was a no-show. We called the front desk and they said they would call her. At 415pm we received call saying ""where were you?""--- we replied.. ""we have been back in our room since 253pm...nice try""--- she replied OK I will come now."" Tech showed up again at 445pm (1 hour and 45 min after her initial promise) with a WIFI box. We finally had WIFI. At 630pm the WIFI boxes stopped working. Called front desk and was told they would contact the technician again and would call us back in 10 minutes. No call back. Went to front desk 30 minutes later. This was the 3rd night without WIFI. Now 7pm and we asked to speak with Guest Relations Manager. Manager Mohommad said that we used too much WIFI in the two hours and there was no more WIFI on the box (???). We explained that technician set no expectation of ""how much"" wifi to use and that all we wanted was WIFI so we could communicate with family back home. He tried to give another WIFI box--- went back to room again--- it did not work. Were told to sit in lobby and wait. Almost an hour later--- still sitting in the lobby. No expectations. No idea where Mohommad went off to. Went up again to front desk and asked what was happending. We were given new room key and told to go try that room. Went to that room and WIFI finally worked (sporadic but something is better than nothing). Mohommad showed up and wanted praise that he had spent time finding us a room with WIFI for us. Appallled at the audacity that he expected praise for the new room...I asked for his manager's name and contact information. He refused to provide. I asked if he was refusing to provide me with his supervisor's info and he concurred. I was in shock that he would not provide his supervisors contact information. So all in all...we spent over 15 hours of our 4 night trip trying to get WIFI. We ended excusrions early and missed meals. It would not have been such a big deal had the primary reason for choosing this resort was its advertisement of WIFI and our need to be connected back hom.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,EssexBetty64 wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Wonderful place to stay on our first visit to Morocco,First wasn't shocked to be charged 3 euros per night for the safe or the city tax because I had read it so many times on here. Towels are a deposit of 15 euros each refunded at the end of the holiday. You can pay for pretty much everything in euros.    Now to the review - we travelled as a family of six adults and were very lucky to be upgraded to the rooms around the private pool. This came with poolside service for drinks. It was lovely by this quiet pool but I'm not sure I would have paid extra for the privilege. Rooms were very very clean as was the whole resort.    Food - I was very impressed with the choice on offer. The choice of salads was amazing and the bread which you cut yourself was lovely. For the fussy eaters there was at least 3 choices of pizzas several choices of pastas with different sauces and chips. There was a good choice of Moroccan foods to try and you wouldn't starve if you are a vegetarian. Some nights were themed. The choice at breakfast was vast. Like all buffets its not always what you fancy at the time but I could not fault it. Fresh strawberries and pineapple were on offer some nights. The choice of salad dressings was great. The red and rose wine in the restaurant was very drinkable and was delivered by the bottle not the glass along with beer and soft drinks.    Staff - we did not once come across a rude member of staff. I can not understand the comments about staff ignoring the english speaking customers. This never once happened everyone was very helpful. Even if you cannot speak any French I always feel a Bonjour or Merci goes along way.    Evenings - entertainment is not for us (wherever we are in the world) but other people certainly looked like they were enjoying it. We just enjoyed having a quiet drink in the evening. The entertainment staff did an incredible job were friendly but not pushy if you did not want to participate.    Wifi - if you feel the need for this we found that between the six of us one of us a phone or a laptop that worked at sometime in different parts of the hotel.    We had an amazing time and I would fully recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Essex, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EssexBetty64
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,g4pfk wrote a review Apr 2016,40,A wonderful week,This hotel is a gem - the staff from reception to restaurant bar housekeeping & gardeners were all very polite & helpful. The food overall was very good a wide variety  of dishes always available plenty of beef usually medium rare fish & vegetarian tagines bread soup & desserts. Main complaint would be that the food could be hotter when served. The waiting staff were very good serving drinks from soft drinks to wine with the option of by the glass or full bottle. The pool bar / snack bar service was okay busy times would take 3-4 mins at most. Sunbeds need a rethink after rain as they absorb water & do not dry quickly - they need removing from beds when it rains & overnight - stored dry. The shuttle bus into the city is very efficient just book it.  Excursursions to the mountains & valleys are worth considering & air balloon Marrakech by Air with Captain Hamid was our highlight.  Go to the souqs enjoy the square have a drink in one of bars above & observe the scene - don't be afraid to say no & walk away from hastle its a living city not a theme park.  It is a place to discover & enjoy a different experience.    graham,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g4pfk
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Elmocaroline wrote a review Apr 2016,50,A wonderful hotel,Firstly i really don't understand the bad reviews I have read on here. We found all the staff friendly and very helpful. Yes there were more french people than English but all were friendly and none were rude. Food was lovely nice variety and for a buffet style on the whole hot occasionally you may get a few veg that were lukewarm but its a buffet that happens. Desserts were the best I've had in a buffet holiday restaurant not different colour blobs all tasting the same. We had beautiful strawberries and fruit tarts chocolate tarts cookies. We booked a deluxe room and got upgraded to a riad and it was lovely. Rooms were clean and the riad was so peaceful around the pool with butler service. Shuttle into marrakesh was a good service too. We had a wonderful time and plan on returning next year.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Katie L wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Watch out for hidden charges!,The staff at the hotel were generally very good. We found the food to be good also. There are only two restaurants and the Orangerie is not included in all inclusive but the food was great and the wine flowing! There were lots of different tagines to try including chicken fish beef lamb turnip potato and various other vegetables plus lots of other things from roasts various fish lots of tasty soups chicken pasta veg potatoes pizza. A wide array of deserts and at Easter it was particularly lovely with chocolate eggs cakes and deserts. It looked really great.    The day entertainment was great too. With water aerobics aqua bikes archery belly dancing and a lot more. Music and the evening entertainment was not too good.    There was issues with the room but on speaking to the manager he helped us.    There are lots of charges to watch out for including a city tax deposits on towels. There is a safe in the room but you will be charged for using it and it gets stuck up. We had to call someone in to open it and again when we wanted to leave it had timed out and was locked and we had to call someone in again. Note if you do call staff out it takes a long time. There are four pools. One is a child's paddling bool and two adult pools and also an indoor pool. Charges are 100 dirhams per person per trip to the indoor pool so watch out!    There is only one bar serving the whole hotel and four swimming pools during the day. Be prepared to queue for half an hour to get a drink. There is no pool service or room service. A hotel of this size should either have 2 or 3 bars or 6 people serving in the one bar not one or two.    There is a free bus to the square. This is great. Book it at reception and take a trip to the square and local souks (markets). The rooms are situated on two floors and there are no elevators so quite a few steps to climb if you are on the upper floor.    The wi fi is really poor and slow and the only place that it seemed to work was at the reception desk. There are lots of children here and it is noisy day and night.    All in all this is a great place to stay for a few days.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieL536

I emailed the hotel before departure to ask about upgrades etc as it was my partners birthday when we were at the hotel - they were prompt in reply and upgraded us to the Private Riad - which was absolutely wonderful - an oasis of calm and tranquility.    Upon arrival the golf cart took us to our room which was lovely and spacious with a view of the private pool and the tennis courts.    Restaurant is absolutely great - frankly I can't understand how anyone has complaints about the food ? They have various theme nights - Chinese / Italian / Moroccan / international etc food ranging from freshly prepared sushi to tagines and cous cous.    Staff were wonderful and friendly and nothing was to much of a trouble  drinks were served In bottles (wine / cola etc) which was a welcome change.    I would love to return to the Kenzi Club and if easy jet keep there flights from Glasgow we aim to go again this year.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Graham B wrote a review Mar 2016,20,"Nice rooms and beautiful grounds, but mediocre food, rude food service staff and crappy wi-fi",We only spent 1 night at the Kenzi Club Agdal and are glad we didn't stay longer.    We arrived at 8pm after a 10 hour drive from Merzouga. Check in took 20 minutes and the front desk staff could not locate our expedia reservation (the did handle it very well however and apologized profusely). It took another 15 minutes to get a golf cart to come and drive us to our room which was a long way from the reception area. The room was huge and very nice but was not perfectly clean. The Moroccan dinner buffet was terrible especially after spending 5 days eating some incredible Moroccan delicacies. The Breakfast buffet was much better but overall the food was very mediocre and more about quantity than quality and the plates and restaurant was busy noisy and dirty.    The front desk staff and porters were very friendly and helpful but the food service staff were both surly indifferent and rude. Our 8 year old son woke up with travel sickness so I asked to bring some breakfast and coffee back to our room for my wife which was met with sheer obstinance.    Also the wi-fi only worked in the bathroom in our hotel room and was impossible to get on in the restaurant area.    The only highlight was the pool and waterslide which our 8 year old son loved.    If you are looking to gorge yourself on unlimited food and drink and lay by the pool while your kids swim this is your place. If you are looking for an authentic moroccan experience stay away.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Vancouver, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grahammblank
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Fearless341111 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Stunning hotel. Brilliant staff. Perfect holiday.,I was dubious after reading some of the bad reviews regarding stomach bugs rude staff cold food and the constant mention of French people (even though people seem to forget this hotel is in north west Africa)..But having just arrived back today after spending 5 days at this hotel I can HONESTLY say this hotel is underrated.    Firstly this hotel is dominantly French. And the majority of people staying here are French. But not one staff member ever made me feel unwelcome or ignored me. Even the few who can't speak English offered to get someone else to help. A massive thank you to Said mustapha magic and youssef. You were all brilliant.    Secondly the food...For all inclusive I was very impressed.I thought the choices were great salads were fresh tagines were delicious and the fresh pasta and pizza went down a treat. Drinks at dinner just keeps coming. You get 1L bottles of fizzy drinks and full bottles of wine and water. None of the staff have any problem with you taking this to the room either. Just ask them and they will happily help.    The snack bars are great too! Fresh pastries pancakes and donuts.    Thirdly - the spa! Go in! It's amazing use it for a day or a few hours it really is a special treat.    Overall. I have nothing to complain about people really look for the bad. The drinks were fine staff were wonderful and the hotel itself is stunning. Make sure you stick around for the entertainment as well. It was always a good laugh.

When a female member of our group made a complaint their response was ""he's apologised that's good enough for us. ""  The next morning the member of our group who the threats were made to asked the French/Moroccan ""what the night before was all about?"" He's then gone and made a complaint about the member of our group which ended up with the police being called trying to take 2 passports off the group.  We resulted to phoning the British embassy and the consulate speaking to the police to resolve the issue.  The whole group (18 of us) was then told we had to leave immediately although most of us were on separate booking and a lot of us weren't involved with either of the disputes.  We were then told by expedia's local rep their was a minibus outside waiting to pick us up and that they would cover the cost of our last 2 nights at a hotel of our choice. This was not the case at all there was no hotel I don't know what would of happened to us if we would of got in that minibus.  We managed to book another hotel for the group but of course had to pay for it.  This whole experience ruined the holiday.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,BristolJeanine wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"Lovely, relaxing, amazing oasis",I'm not going to repeat what everyone else has said - but yes great hotel from the moment we arrived we were greeted with smiles Moroccan tea and wipes and a golf buggy took us to our room.  Staff in the restaurant whether they were serving or preparing food were very attentive polite and professional staff in the pool side bar was less happy but guess they are run ragged and can't smile all the time!  I never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour and the review where it states it's unsafe is untrue.  There was a group of rowdy English chavs that just wanted to drink and behave in a manner which which was not the hotels kind of clientele and they were asked to leave. This shows the hotel has high standards and will not accept rowdy drunken behaviour.  Food was always fresh appetising and lots of variety wine was nice and plentiful  although the cocktails weren't very nice.    We took a guide to the Medina as they are outside the hotel and will meet you off the shuttle bus and take you around for around £15. It's worth it as you could get lost and you also don't get hassled.    Taxi to and from the airport is 200 d which again is £15 each way.    Room large and comfortable and cleaned everyday with fresh towels we took water and wine back to our room from the restaurant so if you wanted to sit in the sitting room part of your room instead of sitting in the bar was another bonus.    I am quite fussy and there is nothing negative about this hotel and I would come again for a short break as its value for money and staff are excellent and cater for all nationalities impeccably.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BristolJeanine
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sirimewan wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Lovely resort to have a restful holiday and explore Marrakech,This was our first trip to Marrakesh and were not quite certain if we would like to stay in a Riad so booked an all inclusive deal at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. On arrival we were greeted by the very attentive staff at the front desk. Mourad with his excellent command of English was specially helpful.  We were pleasantly surprised by the room we had 527 which is a suit that could accommodate parents and two children as it had two rooms one luxurious double the other laid out as a sitting area with two sofas that could convert to single beds when needed and two toilets plenty of wardrobe space for a small family and balconies overlooking a well planted courtyard.  Bed was very comfortable and the bowl of sweet oranges provided was welcoming. This was so comfortable I wished we could stay for two weeks at least but we only had a short break.  There are several open wifi networks around the campus reception is a bit temperamental but functional. Front lobby area is the most reliable for WiFi access although my phone could not connect in our room my tablet managed well with the signal strength in the room.  Dining room is spacious and the staff attentive and well trained food varied always with some Moroccan food if one wanted a taste of the country but also international dishes if one got bored. Wine was reasonable no different from what we expected. There was a beer pump that did not seem to work very well and the beer was not very nice so ignored by most people.  As we were there for a short time we did not have the time to explore all the facilities but the pool is large and looked well maintained pool bar open during the day offering a choice of snacks and beverages. There seem to be enough facilities to keep a young family entertained around the pool area such as water slides and children's play areas.  Main entertainment space in the evenings was the Bar area with a large dance floor and seating around very comfortable and had a variety of activities in the evenings to keep the guests entertained. Liquor offered like in most all inclusive hotels is generic but quite reasonable quality and the staff again are polite attentive and helpful.  Hotel is located a fair distance away from the historic town but this did not pose a problem as the hotel provides an hourly shuttle bus to the centre and back. In fact we were happy to return to a comfortable restful place away from the hustle and bustle after all the walking and exploring.  We also took two excursions both good value for money and quite exciting arranged by Hisham who has a stall in the hotel. First a desert safari combining a tour of the desert in a 4x4 a camel ride quad bike rides through the desert followed by a meal and belly dancing in a desert homestead. This was very enjoyable as it was authentic and real not at all like a Disney adventure. Camels are real and one could smell them and touch them as well as experience what the life in the desert would be like.  Second a trip to the Atlas mountains again very real and enjoyable. I certainly would recommend this hotel and the excursions to anybody singles couples or a young family.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Yarmouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sirimewan

Before going I was a little worried about some of the reviews I'd seen on here but to be honest can't see what the fuss was about. The hotel grounds are beautiful lots of sculptures and art work around reception and in the grounds which were unique. Couldn't fault the room - maybe not 5 star luxury but it was always clean and tidy and the maid visited every day. The pools were great we stuck to using the smaller heated pool as the large pool was a bit too cold (I imagine it'd be warmer in the height of summer) but we did go down the water slides on our final day and they were great fun and enjoyed by adults and children alike.    For an all inclusive hotel I was really impressed with the food and drink it definitely exceeded expectations. The pool-bar cocktails might've had a bit of the watered down all inclusive taste but they were still yummy and did the job. The main bar which we sat at every evening after dinner was great we liked the mojitos and coco loco the best. Food was brilliant. I've been on all inclusive holidays before where it's always the same options every day and a bit naff but there was something different every day. The themed nights were great they went all out with different decorations for different themes. There were always different lovely fresh salads on offer and the beef tagine in particular was gorgeous! The best all inclusive buffet I've been at and I overheard some other guests saying the same.    I'd seen lots of reviews implying that if you're a Brit you'd be ignored by staff. This really wasn't the case all the staff were helpful and friendly. I noticed lots of larger British groups who befriended the animation team and the team always made a big fuss of them when they saw them. Many members of staff asked ""English or French"" when we approached them so they knew straight away what language to speak to us.    The shuttle bus was great we used this to go into town which was a quick and easy journey then got a taxi back as we'd booked onto the 4pm bus and wanted to head back earlier at 3. When you get dropped off in town there were lots of local men waiting to guide you around the markets - I initially wanted to avoid this but we ended up with a man named Mohammed who wouldn't take no for an answer and I must say although he did march us around the souks he was friendly helpful and we didn't get any bother from people working in the markets whilst we were with him.    This has turned into a bit of an epic essay because I want to rave about what a fab time we had but overall we had a fantastic holiday were thoroughly impressed with the hotel and would recommend it especially for the great price we got it for!",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilybG6910YC

We spent the entire 7 days at the hotel spending only a couple of hours in Marrakesh using the 12:00 to 14:00 shuttle Careful as there is no 15:00 return shuttle only every hour after till 20:30. The buffet covers all tastes with each night having a different theme. Adjacent to the buffet area was a evening event area and a next this was a Moroccan restaurant for 100D each. Very nice but we felt completely stuffed after eating here. The gym was well equipped and quiet worth the weekly fee c250D. The spa too was very nice and we spent a relaxing 30 mins which was plenty enough time for a message around 350D each. All our food and drink was free and on some days we ate by the pool . Staff continually brought drinks to us and we felt very special. Away from our ""private pool "" two other pools with slides and bars looked very busy. We thought the value was excellent and enjoyed the walk each evening to pick up the wifi from around the reception.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,frolloway wrote a review Mar 2016,10,DO NOT STAY HERE! Awful is an understatement,Well to start you know a hotel is horrendous when you are writing a review whilst only halfway through your holiday. I CANT WAIT TO LEAVE.    Despite the hotel being attractive and clean the staff absolutely ruin the entire experience. Not only are they rude but they are racist. I've never experienced something quite like it. If you aren't French then don't bother; and I don't mean if you don't speak French but aren't French or Moroccan. They clearly resent the English; ignorant rude aggressive and dismissive.    Our main (but not only) incident involved being verbally attacked and threatened by a moroccan couple who were also hotel guests. This was as a result of declining a chair from them which they took offence to. Despite having there young children with them the reason being we did not react in equal measure they pursued to shout in our faces and threaten us (this includes trying to get one of the guys to fight) as we remained sat down.    The hotels response was horrendous. Not only did they not deal with the issue in the manner they would have should it been the other way round but they shook it off saying it was not a hotel issue.    Furthermore they laughed in our faces and one particular male reception staff member became aggressive towards myself and another female; shouting in our faces with intimidating body language. The so called guest relations manager refused to give us details of the hotel manager and snatched the business card from us. It was obvious that they had sided with the Moroccan couple as we observed then shaking hands and laughing with them. Atrocious!    Amongst the obvious racist behaviour the male staff are unprofessional and make females feel particularly uncomfortable. It's unsafe for single women to walk through the hotel grounds unless you wish to be hit on and groped by the staff (yes that actually happened to another guest).    And just as an added extra they will not give you any bottles of water nor do they provide it in the room. When I eventually got a bottle I witnessed the staff just fill up an empty from the tap! The alcohol is incredibly watered down and they will charge you £10 for a single spirit and mixer after 11pm!!

We arrived at 11am where check in is not till early afternoon we were immediately warmly welcomed our luggage taken safely behind reception served tea and given our all inclusive bands. We were able to enjoy all the facilities before getting our room keys around 1pm. We were taken to our room in block 2 by a golf buggy. It was less than a five minute walk away. This block is not the best views but we weren't bothered at all.  2 main pools on the complex 1 with slides with isn't heated then one nearer the pool bar which is. Both have plenty of sunbeds and shade if needed.  The restaurant was the usual buffet style all inclusive but is of a much higher standard. Plenty of variety and always fresh.  Main bar served lovely cocktails all included within the all inclusive along with a gorgeous rose wine.  ALL staff were courteous helpful and genuinely cared that we were having a good holiday!!  Special mention to Loubna from housekeeping who looked after our room beautifully Yassir and Magic from the animation team who made our holiday such fun and all the bar staff who all work so hard.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Laura wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Nice hotel with a great pool,Hotel was very nice. Buildings were not more than 2 stories high which was a nice alternative to the usual high-rise hotels these days.    3 pools. 1 kids pool 1 large pool and 1 heated pool.  Slides for both the kids pool and the large pool.  Plenty of sunbeds around the pool area which was great.    Food from buffet was rather average. Unfortunately the food was usually barely luke warm. The Pasta bar was amazing however. You can pick your sauce and vegetables and type of pasta and they make it for you on the spot. Delicious.    We ordered all sorts of cocktails and mocktails and they all tasted and looked the same. From Strawberry Daiquiri to Cosmopolitan. Don't expect much from the drinks.    Wi-fi was good however you have to switch log in depending on where you are in the resort.    Shuttle bus to town is handy. However doesn't always collect on time. We arrived at 250pm for a 3pm bus and turns out it had already left so we had to wait around until 4pm.    Also you have to pay (in cash) a deposit to the reception to use the pool towels. This is a little annoying as they don't mention this until you are by the pool wanting a towel and also you end up with Moroccan cash at the very end of your stay.    Note: the beds are VERY hard.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ShaunTefal wrote a review Mar 2016,50,Suprised,"I'm currently sitting round the pool writing this. We've got a couple of days left.    Was very skeptical picking to come here. We had been away to other north Africa countries and they wasn't for us. Plus some of the negative reviews surrounding this hotel specifically got us worried.    Honestly I think they must have been writing a review on the wrong hotel. I've come to conclusion that some people are never happy when it comes to holidays.    But not us    Firstly this hotel is stunning. The art and the gardens are beautiful and so well maintained. You will always see somebody gardening or cleaning. Always.    Which leads me to my next thing I saw complaints about before we left. The staff. When we walked in. We was so warmly welcomed. With mint tea a live band.    I saw lots of people saying that ""if your not french forget it.""    But that is simply untrue. I understand that this is a french speaking nation and they are more than likely to chat more to the French guests. That just makes sense. But that's not to say they wasn't friendly. Everyone said hello the staff in the restaurant always smiling. Can't do enough for you.    Which brings me to the food. By far the best all inclusive food we've had. So much variety and it was of a high standard. Different themed nights. My only criticism if you put a gun to my head and made me critisize it. Sometimes the tables were missing glasses or salt and pepper. But then again they're busy making sure everyone is happy. So can you blame them?    This hotel is also ideally located. A daily shuttle that runs into marrakech. Takes about ten minutes. We went to a market in the more traditional side. Was worried we would be pestered as this is likely in this part of the world. We were right. We were pestered but not to the extent of somewhere like Egypt or Tunisia. 90% of the people that approached us left us alone after a clear ""no thank you"". I recommend the market. It's a great opportunity to see the culture of this country.    We did one excursion. The day trip to the Atlas Mountains. Which was beautiful. They had monkeys and restaurants next to these 130m waterfalls and a boat trip at the bottom which was great. It is truly a stunning country.    All I would say is. Don't let the negative people put you off coming here. Hotel amazing food amazing great staff and all for a reasonable price.",Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dartford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaunTefal
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jazreb wrote a review Mar 2016,50,A warm place in every sense.,Stayed at Kenzi Club in March 2016 on a deal we got through Voyage Prive.  There has been some criticism of the place from predominantly British visitors who feel left out and after visiting the place.  I couldn't disagree with that more.  Yes there are many French tourists. Is that a problem? No. Do they get better treatment? No.  I found the staff (let's talk about the restaurant staff as that's where I'm assuming most people's problems lie) were professional and courteous at all times. They made every effort to engage with those visitors who were not fluent in either French or Arabic. We even saw one waiter on his day off at the Jamaa Elfna and he looked delighted to see us.    Moving on. The resort itself was amazing. The pool was what you come to expect from a five star resort and it never felt crowded or full. The activities and the entertainment never felt tacky and you didn't get the idea that you HAD to take part in everything. You could just as easily find a table for your group in the lounge or outside for a quiet drink.  Room was good. Strong wifi which if you're a traveller is something you need to brush up on the city.  The food wasn't repetitive though sometimes the bbq meat could spend a little more time on the grill. Also it would have been nice if they offered more local dishes.  The shuttle bus to the Medina was an added bonus not only for its convenience but the acquaintances you make on this journey.  We would go back and probably will.  Also credit to Voyage Prive to the deal. Private transfer complementary bottle on good wine and a tour guide (if you need one at anytime).    All in all its a good high quality all inclusive that I would recommend to everyone I know.,Date of stay: March 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazreb

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ALAN B wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Disappointed!,"We booked this hotel for my wifes birthday treatit started out very positivebut after checking in it went downhill! We were supposed to be in a suitebut it was like a Premier Inn room! but no teacoffeebiscuits. The view from the balcony was of a building sitethe balcony was all of 7 foot wide x 3 feet deep.  We had breakfast in the dining room and it became quite clear that if you were English you were the minority and treated in such a way I can only describe as a racist thing. All the French people who came to be seatedwere served immediatelyyet we were left wanting.in the end we had to go to the service station and literally ask to have our tables supplied with table clothknives and forks and cups and saucers and coffee.The staff were ignorantunhelpful and resentful about us being there! The French openly bribed the staff so they would be served first and well looked afterthis was a daily thing at breakfastdinner and evening meal.  At the pool bar the staff were downright rude and unhelpful3 staff actually walked away from 3 sets of English couples and went to the other side of the bar to make small talk.I actually went around the bar to remonstrate with themand demand that we be servedmuch to the amusement of the staff! We were continually looked down on and felt like second classcitizens and were treated accordingly.Even the entertainment was in French! The animation team would not play any requests from the Englishjust hammered out French or African music.  The food was bland with very little tasteonly when salt and spices were added did they become anything like being tasty.  Please do NOT book the traditional Moroccan restaraunt! It was dire! the only good thing was the white wine.  Very little information is given out at reception regards nearby shopping centres or quality shopsthey prefer to direct you to the Medina and the Souks. Go to the NEW cityshopseateries and a good day out.Dont be conned by taxi drivers50 Dirhams each way to Medinaalways haggle!  Finallywe asked for a late book out of our ""suite"" we agreed at 1.00pm what they didnt tell you is that the electronic card for door entry to the room is cancelled and denies you access! Thank goodness for the maid on duty. Then the safe had been de activated so we could not get moneypassports etc out of the safewe had to wait till 2.20 pm until the technician turned up30 seconds it took him to open the safe!Then we had to check out and pay our bill.2.45 pmjust enough time to get something to eat before the restaraunt closed at 3.00 pm not a chance they had started to clear all the food away! I actually remonstrated with a cook who was emptying all the salad into a bin at 2.55 pm WHY? he just laughed and carried on! I was disgustedannoyed and very frustrated.Would I recommend this hotel? definately NOwould I return to this hotel?definately NO.  Poor leadership at management levelpoor staff training in customer servicesinability of staff to carry out duties unless there is a monitary benefit for themselves!

Food was lovely breakfast and pancakes freshly prepared and keep coming as its finished lots of food being prepared on sight!

They are all so adorable and I would love to visit again to see there lovely faces. We stayed in room 802 from 19th of Feb to 26th of Feb and we had incredible experience. The entertainment group is very lovely and nice. We found the manager of the spa very friendly and nice. We had an issue about the price on the recipt from spa facilities but reception and manager of spa delt with it swiftly and were great. If anyone is wanting to use the facilities at the spa just make sure they fill the top of the recipt before you sign it so that there is no confusion about the pricing.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,George L wrote a review Mar 2016,30,A Curate's Egg,"This hotel is located on the edge of Marrakech about an hour's brisk walk from the centre (when cool!). It caters for a multinational clientele with Scottish English French Italian German and Moroccan prominent during our stay.    We obtained a good-value all-inclusive booking for a short break with direct flights from Glasgow and transfers from the airport all arranged. The travel and transfers worked very smoothly.    First - the Rooms. Our room was on the first floor of one of several two-storey blocks. It was clean and functional with the odd minor defect. When we checked in we paid extra to use the in-room safe for which we were provided with a code. The code did not work but we could open and lock the safe which we did; however when we returned to our room the following day we found the safe unlocked. I believe that Reception had eventually got around to resetting the code from the previous occupant but the fact that this resulted in the safe being left open was worrying. The plumbing was generally OK except that on two mornings the temperature of the water fluctuated wildly fortunately not resulting in a scald but most uncomfortable nevertheless.    Second - the Staff. In general the staff were very helpful and friendly particularly those in the restaurant the bar and the spa. However on arrival having just changed money - with the inevitable result that we only had large-denomination notes the porter who showed us to our room made such a blunt attempt to solicit a tip that it was at once both comical and embarrassing. It was several minutes before he left. Additionally the staff on Reception were inflexible and skilled at providing every assistance short of actual help. There was little co-ordination between Reception and the rest of the hotel; in particular they didn't know how to handle a complaint saying ""sorry"" unconvincingly and making no effort either to do anything or to relay our complaint to the management.    Third - the Facilities. The bar was manned by pleasant staff although they were not always sure of what they had available. The ""dance floor"" was also the venue for nightly exhibitions of ""Dad dancing"" sometimes assisted by the staff. The spa was very pleasant and we enjoyed using the steam room and receiving a very good massage.    Fourth - Dining. Most diners used the buffet but for a small charge there was an ""à la carte"" option. The service there was poor the food was upstaged by that available free on the buffet and the ""entertainment"" got rather too noisy for a small room. Most importantly much of the food was returned uneaten to the kitchen as it was poor. This is a big opportunity for the hotel to both showcase local cuisine and provide a desirable dining experience. It did neither and my strong advice is ""avoid the à la carte""! As regards the buffet it was a large and generally noisy room with a selection of food and drink. This was generally of good quality although it was not a peaceful experience!    In summary: this deal was good value in that it included decent accommodation in a reasonable location and the all-inclusive food and drink were of an acceptable standard - with the exception of the à la carte option. The buffet was noisy and the Reception staff ineffectual. If you are looking for a base on the edge of Marrakech then this may fit the bill but please read this and don't be disappointed.",Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeL413
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,saintnick76 wrote a review Mar 2016,50,"Warm, friendly & relaxing stay",We were not sure what to expect but were really pleased with what the hotel had to offer. The room we had was lovely with a pleasant garden view and decent size balcony. It was always kept immaculate by the housekeeper as were the surrounding grounds by very friendly staff.  The bar staff at both the pool and main bars were so good to the point where you didn't even need to order drinks as they were brought to our table.  The food again was very good and varied with fantastic choice the only criticism we would have was the seating area in the restaurant was slightly canteen style due to the size and layout however as per the rest of the hotel this was always kept immaculately clean and empty plates etc were quickly cleared from tables.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ptygirl027 wrote a review Mar 2016,40,A great time was had!,We have just returned from this Hotel in Marrakech. We had been to Marrakech before so we were really just looking for a week in the sun away from a Scottish Winter.  The private transfers at the airport and the easy check in ensured a great start to the week. The room was spacious and clean and we had our own wee patio area with table and chairs. The gardens and artwork throughout the grounds were lush and the idea of each block designed like a Medina Riad was typically Moroccan. The food was always fresh and we were all inclusive  so no complaints there!  I have just read some of the negative reviews and cannot quite believe it! Yesthe hotel was filled with French people. On speaking to a French woman in the Spa I found out it was some French school holiday. However no-one- but no-one paid the French holidaymakers more attention than any other holidaymaker. I really cannot stress this enough. All the staff were friendly helpful and organised. I find it is really up to yourself how you get on with staff and other hotel clients and we love to go to a place with mix of people from all parts of the world.  I could see why so many families would go to this hotel it was geared up with all sorts of activities for all ages. The Animations team were fantastic with all the children and they seemed to be having a great time.  The free shuttle bus was a bonus and the hotel is really not far from the Medina. there was also an excellent range of trips on offer. As I said previously we did not really need to explore having visited Marrakech before so lazing about at this hotel was just a great way to spend a winter week.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptygirl027
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gabrielle B wrote a review Mar 2016,10,WORST place I have EVER stayed,On first arrival I couldn’t be any more impressed with this hotel. The surroundings and hotel are beautiful and we were upgraded to a private riad with a private pool. But let’s just say this is as good as it got.  Firstly if you’re English forget it. The staff are very rude and abrupt with English people for example you’ll be waiting at bar for a drink for a very long time despite being first in line if there is French people about. I have never experienced racism like it. Dirty looks rude remarks you name it they clearly don’t like English people.  Secondly I had money stolen from my bedroom. The money was kept away in a safe place and I counted it every morning to keep on top of what I had. After an afternoon by the pool we came back to our room and I counted my money (English sterling) and I had £60 taken from a wad of twenty pound notes. I think the very silly and stupid maid thought I would not notice this but I clearly did. I went to reception and was told to be seated and wait until the customer service relations manager came to the desk. After 40 mins of waiting he arrived with a very ‘not-bothered’ attitude. He took us back to my room and made us look for the money. I assured him it had been stolen and he said he had checked all of the maid’s pockets and no cash had been taken. Well of course it wasn’t in their pockets because 6 hours had passed since then cleaned the room. When I said to him I know they’ve took it he shrugged his shoulders and said its “only £60”. He then said he could do nothing more unless I wanted to go to the police station. By this point I was fuming and told him to leave the room and from now on leave clean towels and bedding outside of the room and I will do it myself. For the remainder of the holiday I and my boyfriend carried all valuables on us at all times. We were heading out one afternoon and I could hear another row going on with an English couple in the reception as rings had been stolen from her room. I didn’t want to waste my time at a Moroccan police station but I felt like I needed to tell people about this dire place on here. PLEASE DON’T GO.  Thirdly I caught shigella from this hotel. Shigella is an infectious disease/ parasite that goes into your tummy after food has been prepared after someone hasn’t washed their hands after using the toilet (i.e. they have faeces on their hands). I have been in and out of hospital because of this and 6 months on I am only just recovering.  This hotel may look beautiful and yes its cheap but it’s really not worth it. This hotel has put off Morocco for life which is a shame as is seemed a beautiful country.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doe3984
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Isabel R wrote a review Mar 2016,20,The weirdest hotel,"I booked a room for 3 (me mum and sister) we were given 944. I made a point of phoning in advance to double check we would be given 3 beds (and not 1 sofa bed or similar)...when we got to the room we found it dusty and not at all like the pictures show. There was also only 2 beds. I phoned and was told quiet abruptly and with no apologies that a bed would come. Nothing. Phoned again. Still nothing. Went to the reception after a couple of hours to get a ""yes mam bed will come"" when?? The very nice cleaning lady was about so we headed to her and politely explain that we were tired and would like to get our room sorted. Yay! 3 beds in the room! Just a joke... this same attitude happened throughout our 4 night stay. Sometimes there would be towels sometimes not or toilet paper or sometimes we would have cutlery on the table sometimes we had to take it from the tables next to us because the waiters didn't like us going to their station. Maps are not available at the reception but my major issue was really the feeling that every question I asked of stupid. Even when it was cold and we wanted to still enjoy the sun and sit outside rather than inside the dark bar area the bartender was so rude when I asked if the outside heaters could be turned on? ""what? the heaters are for nighttime only!"" - excuse me for asking it is 10C but sunny...surely its okay to turn them on... ill just be good and go to my room then...And then... I decided to go for a massage. Oh the massage. So a 100 dirham note is left on a plate (the tip plate) next to where I had to leave my clothes.... mmmm... not a good start. The nice lady proceeded to demonstrate her disapproval at the fact that I don't speak French. Or Spanish. I do however speak fluent English and Portuguese (maybe these are the wrong languages to know?). I had a 30 minute massage of sighs and loudly shewing gum. The 100 dirham tip plate was closer to my clothes at the end. Don't think so - I was so embarrassed to be put on the spot! AND I had to fill in a service questionnaire of how the experience had been in front of 3 girls before leaving! which i totally lied and said it'd been fine because I wanted to get the hell out of there. I didn't understand this place and cringe thinking about it. I am not a travel snob by the way - I usually stay in tents or hostels but being a special occasion we decided to treat mum. This place is all about false expectations. When a hostel tells you it will be 4 hours to get linen that's fine you know what to expect. This is just a pretend fancy place that doesn't respect clients - or is it maybe just the ones that don't speak french or spanish?  The Positives and why I gave it 2 starts and not 1 - the food. very good. And the free shuttle bus to the Medina (the first one in the morning at 9 am is always late but gives the sponsored tour guides time to annoy you).",Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsabelCoimbra

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,NickBeenham wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Very Good,"Like so many people these days we scrutinised the hotel on Trip Advisor before and after booking and were alarmed by the poor reviews. However there were some good ones too and we got a great value deal so we made the decision to go. We're so glad we did. When you examine the reviews a little closer the poor/terrible ones constitute about 6% where as good/excellent account for 83% of reviews overall. There's a reason for this: the hotel is really good!  The poor reviews seem to cover just about everything from reception rooms staff food etc. Well I couldn't disagree more. The hotel isn't perfect I've yet to stay in one that is but I think some people are just nit picking. The majority of staff are polite friendly and efficient whether you're English French or whatever. The odd one here and there could be happier but I think that's pretty normal.  The food is excellent there's masses of choice unless you're very fussy and we never grew bored of it over our weeks stay. Yes it isn't piping hot but it's a buffet-style service and I've yet to stay in a hotel that can provide food piping hot in this manner.  If I had a criticism of the restaurant I would suggest more waiting on staff. The guys are tireless and work really hard but at busy periods they struggled to cope with demand. Don't get me wrong if you're patient they'll get to you but I hope they have more help in peak periods.  Wine is given to you by the bottle if you wish at mealtimes and is surprisingly good. The beer isn't great kind of gassy and tasteless but if you're used to British lager like Carling and Carlsberg you'll be fine. Also the spirits aren't great either but OK in a pina colada etc. The nights we did have a few we didn't go to bed sober!  Bar staff were great I found a 20 dirham (less than £2) tip here and there kept them on your side. And also the entertainment team are excellent aswell. We didn't join in but they were always quick with a greeting by the pool in the morning or in the bar in the evening.  We stayed in riad 9 room 929 which was handy for all amenities wifi was good most of the time much better than I'd expected after reading some reviews!! Balcony was small and view not brilliant but not unpleasant either. We think rooms 912 - 915 would be ideal. The highlight for us were the pool areas. One huge free form pool with slides and a kiddy section and one regular heated pool. Lots of sun beds as well as shaded bays. Pool bar handy for drinks perfect if you want a lazy relaxing time. Weather was really hot during the day (Feb/March) and cool mornings/evenings. View of the imposing snow-covered Atlas Mountains in the distance is breathtaking.    We went with the notion of having a ""quick cheapie"" and using the hotel as a base to explore Marrakech but we ended up doing the opposite as the hotel was so good we couldn't drag ourselves away.

AI so meals were buffet style All the staff were friendly and helpful. I thought the food was of a good standard with plenty of variety not sure how it would work in high season as the circulation space around the food display areas was limited. Good wines and the spirits and mixers drinks were all made with plentiful alcohol. Two large pools and a separate little ones pool. Used the shuttle service to get in and out of the city. This worked well for us. I would say that 80% of the guests were French however there was no difference in service offered whether the guest was French speaking or not.

One night we waited over an hour at 1am to get into our rooms.    Food was poor and one if my friends was food poisoned upon returning to the UK.    The hotel charge for every thing including 3 euros a day to use the room safe!!  Unbelievable!!!

The food was fantastic a huge choice of well cooked food. With cold meats and salad too. We went to the Moroccan restaurant that was a wonderful evening of local food and entertainment.  The large pool was absolutely freezing. But the smaller pool was warmer than outside...... Lovely.  There was plenty of entertainment and activities in the pool outside games and evening shows. Which didn't interrupt you if you just wanted to lay by the pool and or relax in the seating or your room.  There was a free bus from the hotel to marrakesh every day at different times and a return.  There was also your guides there that were very helpful for your day trips.

Although all the staff are all very nice and helpful they only have one bar operating in the evening and is not very large although I'm sure they will make the most of the outdoor space in the hight of summer. It's a bit out of the road from anything but they do run a free bus into town (about 7K away). If you do venture into the souq be aware of people offering help to get about as they will want to be paid,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,glasgow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fraser_macleod

My expectations of the hotel were met with a two pools outside one being heated and the rather offering a stunning view of the Atlas mountains...was magical!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ringtons wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Pleasantly surprised,Just returned. Had a very pleasant seven day break with my husband. The rooms in the hotel were very large and well kept ours was cleaned every day. The grounds of the hotel were lovely they too were well kept. The staff at the hotel was always welcoming right across the spectrum. The only gripe I had was the food. We never went hungry as there was always something to eat although at times a bit boring. I could never understand why there was about twenty different plates/bowls of cold salad ie:- rice potato beetroot etc. The plates for the hot food were always cold and as the hot food section was not that hotso the meals were just about warm. We tried the maroccon restaurant what a disaster all I can say to that is it was not to our taste. No wonder it was always empty. The hotel is a taxi ride away from the new town about 100d a one way trip. We did go to the old town on the shuttle and we couldn't wait to return back to the hotel as it was a bit intimidating for me. But we did go to say that we've seen it. My husband teaches Building and Construction so is very aware of safety factors in buildings. The block paving on the verandas was not safe a lot of jaggered edgesno warning of different hights on the floors although they were made of the same materialno safety rails on stairs leading to the Riads or on the slopping walkway some of the tiles round the edge of the outside pool were loose as well. These are things he picks out that might not matter to other people. All that said we can't say we had a bad holiday but I'm not sure we would go back.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wilmslow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ringtons

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,billyboy98 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,AN EXCELLENT SECOND VISIT,"Returned for an 11 night stay at the end of January. Surprised to find that many staff remembered us and gave us a great welcome. The room was identical to the one last year - spacious and very clean. We were given a room near the swimming pool which is also close to the dining room. The bed linen was immaculately white as were the towels. The bedding was regularly changed and the towels were changed every day. The maid had little English but was pleasant and very thorough in her cleaning of the room.    The food was very good and there was a great range of salads and desserts. Quite a few guests had breakfast and lunch outside as the weather was warm and sunny. Wine water and soft drinks were served by the bottle. The dining room is very large and the waiters are hard working. We were served by the same waiter at night as we had last year - Ibrahim who was always attentive. The two Moustaffas and Mehmed were always ready to help.    The animators were very active. During the day they were in charge of the many sports activities available e.g. archery shooting French bowls darts yoga belly-dancing etc. In the evening they played a large part in the entertainment and were very talented in dance and acrobatics. Their evening productions were held in the large conference room. ""Spider"" and ""Magic"" were particularly talented. Later there was disco music in the lounge bar. I was pleased to note that they no longer allow smoking in the lounge bar. The bar closed at 11.30. There was a wide range of local alcoholic drinks.    Most of the guests were Moroccan and French but there were a number of guests from other countries as well. Surprisingly there were a good few Scots there as well.  It has been mentioned that if you do not speak French you will not get good service.  Nothing could be further from the truth. For the first week there were a lot of children there enjoying the wonderful heated pool and the many activities.    We are looking forward to our next visit to Kenzi and particularly to meeting up with the animators who do so much to see that you really enjoy your holiday.",Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billyboy98
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,StuM wrote a review Feb 2016,50,Completely relaxing family holiday,We have just returned from here we had such a great time. It was really relaxing for us and the kids had loads to do and were never bored (which makes a nice change). It's an all inclusive food and drinks are served all day so no rushing around to get back in time for lunch or dinner and breakfast is served until 10 so a lay-in is possible. The staff are so friendly and team who provide activities for the kids are great. There's evening entertainment and even a show prepared with your kids as the stars. Highly recommend this resort for French or English speakers the first time I have seen kids with different native tongues getting on together. We were there for Valentines day and the room was made up especially with a bottle of wine and rose petals. Additional services include a gym hammam and massages though these are extra. There is wifi in most of the resort though the wifi in the rooms didn't work though this was actually nice as it meant a real break was possible.,Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Frome, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuMORRIS_EN

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,wgirll wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"Moroccan Dreams at Kenzi Club, Marrakech","When I was booking this venue I wasn't sure I would expect to get what I was seeing in the pictures. But was I ever impressed! I have always wanted to travel to Morocco and to have this come at an affordable price with more than expected accommodations I couldn't have asked for more. When we arrived they actually apologized for giving us an upgraded room! That was more than fantastic no apologies needed. The room was more than amazing it was spacious the balcony was beautiful and the washroom huge. I was comfortable in the bed and the temperature of the room was perfect. The food was good for the selection I was hoping for more authentic Moroccan dishes but the mixture of the food choices were good. We overate and realized that we had to cut back especially with all the desserts. They didn't provide room service and let us know right away about that and the snacks in between breakfast lunch and dinner were limited but sufficient. The cups are small so when getting a beer at the bar be prepared to keep getting up for the next one all the time. I didn't think of it but I should have brought my ""bubba"" mug so if you have one it would be useful. If you don't ask you won't receive that is the most important piece of advice. For example there is no alcohol in the rooms but after dinner I wanted to have some wine in the room and had to ask the server if I could have a bottle for the room. They give it to you gladly but make sure if its white wine that you ask for a ice bucket (with ice). lol Drinking warm wine is not pleasant and once I asked for a bucket too late and they had to give me cups with ice that i just filled the sink. We also didn't have an iron in the room I was afraid they would charge extra for an iron but they didn't. Which brings me to another point you also pay for extras use of the safe was extra $ charge (we didn't use it but some of our friends from Scotland did and they had to pay extra about $35 pounds for the week) they also charge a land tax it cost us $200 Moroccan Dirham (which equals about $30 Canadian dollars). There were so many things to do swimming tennis basketball ping pong target shooting dancing shows (they are good for the kids) and much more. It was really a nice resort and would recommend it to others. They did amazing things for families and the kids even performed in the show! For couples it was a great experience as well old and young alike! Make sure to do a tour - I would also suggest to compare the tour companies. The one with the hotel is safe and guaranteed and we didn't have to pay extra for our guide. We went with another company that was by the gift shop hotel for one of our other tours and it was less money but our guide was a little extra cash. On the resort you can wear pretty much anything but when going off the resort just remember for the ladies to dress more modest. Cover the shoulders and chest. I would say the wifi from our room could have been better and even in the lobby if there were too many people using it we couldn't get a signal at times. But other than that we had a blast! We went as boyfriend and girlfriend and came back as fiances! So getting engaged there helped with the experience!",Date of stay: February 2016,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Toronto, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wgirll
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,rachaell1971 wrote a review Feb 2016,30,winter break,So we arrive at this hotel and it looks ok on arrival we arrived at 10.30am due to flight times but our room wont be ready till 12.30 we were directed to the snack bar. As promised the room or riad was ready at 12.30. the rooms are spacious and have air con. We didn't need air con we needed the heating aspect of the air con as in January its a little cooler in the mornings and evenings.  The hotel was predominately Morocco's some English. Lots of children in the dining room this was apparent.  The dining room looks tired and worn. The coffee they serve is cold and has been sat in the coffee pots since service opened at 7am. If you drink peppermint tea your ok.  The hotel put on a bus that takes you to the medina so we book this for a 17.00 depart and 19.00 collection. You would think because it was a hotel bus it would drop you at the location as we as tourists had absolutely no idea where we were going. On arrival down this side street the doors open and a mass of men outside want to be your guide and take you to the medina and through the souks. Don't do it.  They say they work for the hotel and don't want paying but they will take you to their friends shop and you will have to buy something. As 4 Scottish people learned when they ended up with one of them!  Anyway back to the hotel.... now been a woman I need a plug socket near a mirror for hairdryer and straighteners. A man has clearly designed the room as there was no socket near a mirror so I called reception and a member of maintenance turned up with an extension lead. This was great for two nights then the end of the extension lead came off in my hand. this could have a been a very different ending to my holiday! I had live wires in my hand. I took this down to Reception who said ok Ill get you another one!! I'm in Marrakesh there are no health and safety rules.

We found a good deal on BA website to stay at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. All I can say is I'm glad we were only there for three nights!!    The hotel itself is nice and it was good to chill out round the pool for a few days. But I found the food and drink were shocking. Most of the time the tables weren't cleaned from other people there were plates with left over food every where trying to get a drink whether it be coffee at breakfast or something with lunch was hard work.    I found the actual food was very poor standard and it was always luke warm and never hot. The drinks just seemed watered down and all had the same flavour!    Whilst I wouldn't stay here again I do believe you get what you pay for and for a cheap three night break to catch some sunshine it did the job.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,June D wrote a review Feb 2016,40,Excellent except for food.,We had an excellent holiday at the hotel which has good facilities comfortable rooms and a friendly and helpful staff. The only slight down side which I think people should be aware of is that the restaurant is rather like a canteen. There are so many guests that the restaurant is noisy and since it was the Moroccan school holidays it was  at night like eating in a kindergarden canteen. Even so  the food was good and plentiful and we could always find choices to suit us. However don't expect 'fine dining.'  The spa treatments were good and the evening entertainment  put on by an energetic troupe of young performers was good fun. I think it is well suited to people with children who are well provided for but having said that we would consider going again as it was very good value.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,HRSM10 wrote a review Feb 2016,50,"Great weekend, great hotel, great place to stay!",Visited the Kenzi Agdal Medina for a long weekend in November last year for a friends birthday. The hotel made all 12 of welcome from the moment we arrived with some refreshments. The staff were very helpful and the hotel was lovely with nice decorations and sculptures scattered in the hotel foyer and around the grounds.    We had 3 people to a room which was comfortable and spacious. And to be honest we only used the room to sleep and freshen up as we were out most of the time lounging around the 2 pools or going out to bars and clubs. The large pool had cold water with slides and the small pool had warm water. The hotel has good amenities with lots to do and we even managed to squeeze in some Hammams in the hotel which were amazing and well worth it. And if you get a chance definitely do the quad biking which was excellent!    We went on an all-inclusive basis and were very happy with the variety of fresh food that was available to cater for all tastes during breakfast lunch and dinner. Evenings had a theme to the food so one night was Morrocan food and another was Fish. The only complaint I have with the food is that breakfast would close way before the scheduled 10.30. I even managed to drag myself in there at 10.15 after a night out and saw staff had packed up most of the breakfast which is not ideal. The hotel had a bar which would open in the evening for entertainment and being on all-inclusive you would get some local spirits and beers which weren’t too bad. The staff in the bar were friendly and the service was good.    Which now brings me on to the nightlife in Marrakech. Heard so many good things about the nightlife and lets just say it lived up to the hype! Our main idea for this trip was to relax during the day and party hard at night! And we so did that! Club 555 was good but Theatro is probably one of the best clubs I have been too in a while and if you can get a VIP table which would make a real difference. Luckily we had Shoaib who worked at the hotel who was very helpful in sorting us out with the nights out and even came out with us to make sure we were ok. Which is rare when you go away and found him very friendly and very helpful!    So whether your going for a family holiday taking the better half away for a weekend or like us going away with friends to celebrate then I would highly recommend this hotel as it caters for everyone… will definitely pay a visit to this hotel again this year!,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Barkingside, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HRSM10

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,katieanderson21 wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Amazing value for money.,Me and my boyfriend went for a holiday here in mid September 2015 on an all inclusive basis. The hotel was a short drive from the hotel we pre-booked a transfer online which was easy and cheap. The holiday was amazing value for money - for what we paid it was incredible and anyone who is moaning on here I think is expecting too much for their money. Yes it isn't absolute luxury but for the price you pay you can't expect that.  Good points:  air conditioning free safe in the room all inclusive drinks were OK beer and soft drinks from the poolside bar and bottles of wine at lunch and dinner waiting and reception staff were friendly language barrier wasn't an issue at all the food was really quite good. A range of fresh bread every morning which was excellent and fresh omelettes being made a long with pancakes etc. Dinner and lunch was a mix of different meats and vegetables and always moroccan tagines which i would recommend. For fussier people there were always pizzas and a big pile of chips! Puddings were a bit strange but there were nice pastries and ice cream which were good. There was entertainment on every night nice to sit and listen to singers or go back to the room if we didn't fancy it as all rooms had a little outside table and chairs. Hotel was kept clean fresh towels every day. We went on a half day tour of Morocco and it was really good fun would recommend it to all. Pool was clean (we used the square one near the bar as it was a bit nicer in our opinion) and there were loads of sunbeds never had to worry about getting one at all. Taken on a buggy with our bags on arrival and a friendly man explained where everything was and carried all our things in for us.  Negatives:  There was music by the pool which was a bit annoying as we wanted to relax. The wifi was only in the lobby (but it was good when you got there). That's it.  All in all for what we paid it was perfect.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jay Z wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Fantastic holiday, great food, lovely staff, nice rooms",This hotel has good reviews and when you spend time here you can see why. We got a very good deal and you can't fault the value. The rooms were a very good size nice bathrooms and clean with small fridge and balconies. Good Wifi in rooms and throughout resort. The rest of the resort is big and well kept different pools and loads of activities during the day - we really enjoyed the archery and shooting at 4pm and Spider from the Animation Team was great. One of the hardest things on an all inclusive is eating in the same restaurant and there is only one here but they do their best to vary it from night to night with themes - Italian Asian etc. (although largely similar). However there are a number of fresh cooking stations making pasta with sauce and omelettes etc in the morning so you don't need to eat the buffet food. There is a good selection of European and Moroccan food. Waiters were brilliant and helped organise a special breakfast for my mum's birthday - Monsef was our favourite and really made us feel welcome. Also Marrakesh is a (free) shuttle bus ride away with loads of great places to eat when you get bored. A lot of us did get ill - i guess that often happens when you visit other countries and the buffet food is left out though. The spa is OK we all enjoyed massages there but I didn't enjoy the hamam pools with wrap the staff were a bit miserable and didn't explain anything to me. But the rest of my families enjoyed the massages which are pretty good value. Animation team all very nice entertainment in the evenings was varied although pretty good after a few cocktails. Listening to a 4 yr old sing karaoke of Frozen at 10pm was a low point though ;( We did feel there was only one place to sit in the evening in the bar after food and often loud or live music in there - would have been nice for a second bar a bit quieter to have a drink and play a game.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,pc1265 wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Really friendly and perfect for a short break,Possibly because it was out of season we got upgraded to the Privilege section which was really great. The room is spacious and has all you need really. The balcony was bit overgrown with the bamboo growing up from the ground floor but hey who spends a lot of time on the balcony.    The Privilege section is a separate Riad of some 48 rooms around a private pool and you enjoy a private waiter service practically all day. The Riad is at the end and is a bit of a walk from the main hotel so we tended to spend the morning around the heated pool and after lunch spent the afternoon around the Privilege section pool. Very peaceful (though at this time of year the sun goes down behind the building quite early).    The staff are all great especially Yusef at lunch who looked after us well. Overall the food was really good; always plenty of choice (and nice to have all inclusive wine by the bottle and not from a pump!). There was always plenty of choice if not plenty of variety.    I didn't use the spa but did visit the gym. A little basic but enough equipment to be useful.    We only stayed five days and were here just for a short break to be lazy around the pool so on this occasion at least didn't visit the town - but then this review is for the hotel not Marrakech - but I'd certainly recommend the Agdal Medina both for a short break like ours or indeed a longer trip. In fact I'm already planning the next one.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pc1265
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Revd_Mark wrote a review Jan 2016,40,A few things lost in translation,This was a last minute change of plans having previously been booked to stay in Sharm el-Sheikh before the problems there meant that British Airways rebooked me to Morocco but not to worry it was a country I had wanted to visit anyway.    The complex itself is clean and well cared for and has a great collection of modern sculpture and artworks scattered aroundand the staff are very friendly.    It was sold as an all inclusive resort but there are a few 'niggly' extras such as a 150DH deposit for a pool towel voucher an extra 100DH for the Moroccan Restaurant (where I also think that the wine... The exact same wine which is available by the bottle throughout the resort... is charged for!) also apparently there is also 30Dh a day charge for a safety deposit box.    My room was simple and clean (although the double bed was in reality just 2 singles pushed together) it did have a working minibar fridge but nothing appeared in whilst I was staying here. It did take 3 whole days to get some laundry back.    The food which is served buffet style was readily available and in sufficient quantities although the staff had difficulty in keeping up with the numbers of tables needing to be cleaned and serviced. There was a revolving theme each night but to be honest the food was mostly the same most evenings albeit a different type was given prominence and some of the decor was changed.    There was a good and active 'animation' team with activities for all ages and inclinations.    There is a decent spa and gym availalbe (at a Price) and a shuttle bus is available to take you into town.    Be aware that if you don't speak French you will ned to rely on other English speaking guests to let you know what is happening and where as there is no 'in room directory of services' or the like. also make sure reception write down any alarm call requests in their book as they failed to give me my call and I almost missed a planned excursion.    I wouldn't hesitate to come back again for a short break but it is a solid 3 Star Resort with some extras.... don't come expecting a 4/5 Star Hotel but don't be put off because there is far more good than bad.,Date of stay: January 2016,Trip type: Traveled solo,"Clare, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Revd_Mark
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,HolidaySandra wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Fab stay in a friendly hotel,I travelled with a friend for a bargain 4 night break in early December. The room was basic and clean but not 5 star the only toiletries provided were soap and Shampoo so if you want shower gel and conditioner take your own. We were on an all inclusive stay and have to the say always found something tasty for every meal and the white rose and red wines were all very acceptable and the orange juice was freshly squeezed. Although cocktails were not to my taste. The staff were very good and helpful (tipping helps with great service). The shuttle bus does have to be pre booked but as long as there is space they will let you on. Where they drop you off is a bit of a walk to the Souks but also near other places to visit (you will be hassled by guides wanting you to hire them as you get off the bus). We did meet lots of nice people on the shuttle and one morning when the four people on the bus wanted to go the Majorelle Gardens the bus driver dropped us off there which we were very grateful for as it was quite a distance.  The entertainment in the evening was great fun and I have to say we really enjoyed our evenings and ended up talking to the many lovely people we met on the shuttle.  I would return here as I am sure my kids would love the heated pool and the activities that were provided during the day. They would have also loved the hot chocolate every morning. I liked the fact that it was a little out of Marrakech as the hotel was very peaceful. There was no problem checking out early and staying at the hotel. Wifi for us only worked in reception. Also you have to pay a returnable deposit for pool towels of about £11 and you have to pay for the safe in your room about 2.30 per day.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"East Grinstead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolidaySandra
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Perrott wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Overall very good needs some tweeking,We stayed here on a family holiday and overall it is an excellent Hotel. The rooms are excellent with plenty of space very clean and with all facilites you would expect. This is an all inclusive resort and the food was very good with plenty of choice and even though it was a Buffet you could also get some fresh cooked food and in the evenings there was a different theme each night. The Staff were very helpful and proffesional. The gardens and pool area were kept immaculate except for the pool bar which did not give the impression that it was clean and a huge amount of flies and wasps on the surfaces and on the drink bottles which was very off putting. The plastic tumblers they served the drinks in have seen better days and looked tlike they were dirty to be honest we only went there for drink on one day and didn't go back.  The main bar was very good at night and they had different shows and music each night especially New Years Eve. The Spa was like and oasis and was absolutely fantastic. I would go back and would recommend this hotel especially to families as our children quickly made friends and enjoyed the fun at the pool every day. The activities around the pool were also very good with Aqua Arobics etc and the sports facilites were very good too tennis football Basketball etc,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Kinsale, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perrott

I'm going back in January for my birthday. ...can't wait.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sapna A wrote a review Jan 2016,20,Not at all an ideal vacation spot,We stayed at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina for 5 days between Dec 28 - Jan 1 spending New Years there. We are seasoned travelers having been to various parts of the world and having experienced different cultures. But never before have I had such a terrible experience. The service staff were not overly friendly but we chalked that up to a busy season. However we started noticing special attention given to the French and European tourists (example the tables around us would get served coffee etc but we had to help ourselves etc.). But worse was the quality of vegetarian food. Not only was the vegetarian selection THE SAME every day (pizza pasta with the same sauce the dreary-looking and limited salad bar couscous of one flavor and the lentil tajine) the quality was god-awful. Shockingly when we brought this up to the chef his reaction was - if you don't like the food eat the salad. Now having spent a boat-load of money for an all-inclusive stay that hardly seemed fair. To me and my family a good vacation is incumbent upon good nutritious quality food with variety. If you feel the same way believe me Kenzi Club isn't for you. We even brought this up to the manager but his nonchalance was shocking. Additionally the wifi did not work at all during our stay and the pool customer service routinely ran out of clean towels. To vegetarians and to non-white tourists considering Kenzi Club here's my advice - please re-consider your choice.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"New York City, New York",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sapnaa2016

I booked this as a Xmas present for partner and will now have to do something else instead as it is so bad. We've got another 3 days to get through so will have survived hell by then.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Pria12 wrote a review Dec 2015,40,"Fabulous break, lovely hotel and all inclusive",I'm lucky enough to normally do reviews on luxury hotels so that will put much of this into context. It's great but I'll comment on the quality of some areas.  The Kenzi Medina is a 5* in terms of the facilities it offers and I do believe it is the better of the Kenzi group in Marrakech for adults whilst being accommodating and friendly to children.  The public areas of the hotel are kept nice and clean with the gardens well tended.  We stayed in a privilege room and that came with a small pool for the guests in that riad nicely private so we could have a really quiet rest during the day and join in the meals in the main part of the hotel for meals.  ROOMS/decor:  These like the rest of the hotel are well designed and aimed to be a trendy decor with a Moroccan twist. Nicely done cotton sheets etc but well worn and in need of maintenance or simple deep cleaning. The photos on the website were clearly taken when the decor was new but the leather sofas in reception are wearing and the tiles etc in the rooms in need to attention.  All the towels in the room and in the pool areas are now worn and fraying and some even came to us damp.  But the beds were always well made up and the flowers and displays a lovely touch.    FOOD/DRINK:  It really is all inclusive but for the Moroccan restaurant which needs to be booked for a price. The wines and spirits are fine and at times we had prosecco in the mornings and champagne as a hotel treat for a birthday!  The food is really beautifully laid out in the dining area but if you do not get in to the meal times early you will miss the array as soon as people start tucking in.  The dining hall is big. We had to get used to this usually going to much smaller hotels but it is spread out enough and you can sit outside in the day. (in winter it is freezing at night!)  My advice - got to it all early.  Whilst management were around I noticed a huge effort to keep the food areas clean & tidy - v pleasing.  I am vegetarian and didn't go hungry (lots of pizza and chips and salad) but be careful since some of the food is not well labelled so e.g. potatoes may have had meat mixed in but this was not in the description.  Christmas eve I only got bread & cheese - it was a real meat feast - but this was addressed with an offering of a meal at the Moroccan restaurant.  The Moroccan restaurant has live music - a lovely guy who tries to get you all involved.    STAFF:  Our customer relations manager was just lovely and addressed issues quickly and made special occasions just that. Champagne cake a special table at dinner.  Every staff member at meal times was warm and welcoming and looked after their areas of service really well. They were all so good with kids and families alike.    SPA:  This is well priced and probably the nicest area of the resort. It has the makings of what could be a lovely oasis but just misses the touches. e.g. some of the staff are nice and others could be a lot more welcoming. We are very vulnerable when we have many of those treatments so a friendly smile doesn't go amiss. Perhaps tea/drinks offered to all clients? Access to the spa pool and steam room for all paying clients?  It is large enough to accommodate this but you can only use the enormous steam room if you are having a hammam or paid for the facility.  Having said that the hammam treatment is good but I would go for the full treatments (e.g. longer massage & body wrap with hammer) as it can otherwise feel a little brief like you're on a conveyer belt.    SHUTTLE/Proximity to city:  This is just about 7-10 mins away from the city and worth mentioning because so many hotels are further out so can cost a lot in travel. The Kenzi puts on a free shuttle to be pre booked. Although we never used it we saw the value in it saving approx £10 cab fare per round trip per day. We had half day tours instead for a just a bit more than the cab fare and managed to be guided through the streets on historical & souk tours. Bargain.    VALUE:  I know that other people paid a lot less than we did and that the deals on this hotel can be incredible off peak. They're genuine.  Morocco has been hit hard by the tourist industry and they have not let it show in their genuine warmth and hospitality.  Would we come again - ABSOLUTELY and I would recommend it to friends and family.  There is sun food and culture all served up with a smile.  I don't often consider doing a package holiday let alone do it twice - but this one I would.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sussex, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pria12
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Usman M wrote a review Dec 2015,30,I would love to have given this 4 stars; but it got 3. Weak and strong.,Overall  A long weekend break; I booked two rooms for 2 Adults and 4 Children. I have summarised my experencie    Checkin. (Zero Stars 0*)  Having stayed around the world. Sadie is the worst and rubbish customer service lady. She should be sacked !!. I tried to call the hotel reservation and emails to confirm no issues with my booking. I had a big argument with them and was one of the worst experience ever. However another manger Tahir came to the rescue and resolved the issue. Not a great start to the hotel.    Room (2 Stars)  I booked a deluxe room; I couldn't believe it but felt they gave me a standard room. I complained and they changed.  Air Con - Not working  Toilet flush - Not working.  When it rained water leaked in from the front door.  Double Bed - was the size of a single bed.  Furniture very dated.    Restaurant (5 *)  I loved the food and the choice it was fresh and well presented. The staff in the restaurant were very prompt efficient and friendly. Best part of the hotel was the canteen. One of the best buffets.    Pool and facilities (4*)  Swimming pool was clean and staff at the bar where good. Plus only really engaged you if you spoke French. Which I didnt mind as when travelling as you get lots of hotel where staff dont speak French. So I now knew how they felt :-)    Staff  Check-in Staff are ok; but the Sadie the checking manager should be sacked. All the other staff in the hotel are excellent. And they have been let down by Sadie actions.    SPA. (5 Star)  Me and my wife really did enjoy the spa; very good well organised highly recommend. But do try to book in advance as on the day bookings they are usually booked.    Overall  Good hotel; good restaurant generally good staff. But the hotel was let down by Sadie checkin manager who ruined the start of the holiday and left a real sour taste.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OzieOz
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,UrbanArts E wrote a review Dec 2015,50,Great resort !,Have just returned back from a 5 night stay with my partner and quite honestly we can hardly fault this resort. All staff from cleaners caterers and bar staff were amazing polite helpful and a joy to be served by. Every part of the grounds were pristine clean including the pools. The grounds are beautiful.    The food was pretty good everyday. It catered for everyone. I don't eat red meat pork or shell fish so it was more limiting for me. The chefs made fresh pasta omelettes and crepes and what was always nice each morning was the freshly squeezed orange juice. One extra benefit was I eat dairy and gluten free and whilst it wasn't displayed they have options if you let the main chef know they will prepare gluten free bread and pasta if you ask. The same with the soya milk. This made a big difference for me.    The entertainment was ok if your 35-40 and wanting some good music forget it but hey the drinks are all inclusive and you soon forget what music is playing! (Always have no ice btw)    Things I should like to point are as things to be aware of or avoid completely.    1. The Moroccan restaurant it was the worst food I've ever eaten with a fixed menu for everyone with no preference for vegetarians (unless you like to eat lettuce for dinner) the service was appalling and the highlight of our meal was the musician playing live music. We didn't finish the course. We left after the second one and went back to the main restaurant. They had a cheek to charge 100 dirham.    2. If you book excursions avoid doing it though the hotel and if you do the trip to the mountains make sure the cost covers a guide for the waterfalls. We were not notified and the 'guide' tends to just bring you to all their friends shops and houses to get money for something or nothing on route to the mountains we were so hacked off that we asked them to turn around and go back home. Very disappointed and waste of money.    3. On arrival at airport global money exchange will try to encourage you to get a debit card only allowed in morocco which I did they failed to tell me that it costs 250 dirham and when I challenged it on the way back it was dismissed and I lost the money. Even in the professional desks be careful.    4. Don't forget you get charged tax per day per person. 33 dirham per night per couple.    5. Wifi was intermittent but always able to get a connection somewhere. Reception always very powerful connection.    Overall this resort is amazing just be careful out of the resort they're all out to rip you off for something even the taxi drivers outside the resort will try and get an extra 50 Dirham. Just stick to your guns they'll soon chase you back.    Be careful wherever you go marrakesh is nice but they just see us tourists as idiots and will do whatever they can to get your money that's the most disappointing thing about this country.

Lovely hotel all inclusive package staff very friendly reception staff very accomodating arrived before check in time so was able to go for lunch already whilst they got the room ready early. Bar staff by the pool-Siad and Niam were excellent. The animations team were very friendly great activities during the day interesting entertainment at night. Definately recommend a stay here and if we come back to Marrakech we will stay here again. Variety of delicious food at meal times and waiting staff were helpful. Had a full body massage at the spa -would definately recommend and use of the hamman was free included in the all inclusive package. Beautiful well maintained gardens and grounds. Free shuttle service to the center of marrakech which was only 10min drive away. Shopping mall (almazar) and Club/bar (555) just down the road which we took a taxi to (make sure you haggle the price down also make sure you know which kenzi hotel you are at (kenzi medina) as there are 3 in total in Marrakech and taxi drivers get confused) Room was lovely had a balcony and was tidied well from the housekeeping. Minor improvements could be made such as snacks could be available from the pool bar cocktails could be improved as was very watered down (although husband loved the local beer) heated pool could be a bit warmer wifi could be improved as could only pick it up in reception area and in our bathroom or outside our room. Bought some nice souveniers at the boutique shop which had the prices on which made a change from having to haggle at the souks. Two cash points available in the hotel and if you need change the cashier at reception are more than happy to do so. Also change currency at the hotel as better rate than the airport.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Smithfamily40 wrote a review Dec 2015,50,An excellent value for money week away,We spent 1 week at this hotel returning only yesterday we had a basic room 2 adults and a 10year old.  Firstly this is not a 5 star hotel it is however a very good 4 star we got a very cheap week away and it was certainly worth the money.  Rooms - our room was very comfortable always kept very clean no problems at all we were in room 830 which was in the block nearest the pool and dinning room.  Pool - lots of very comfortable sun loungers and big padded double sun beds only one pool heated but this wasn't a problem. The bar around the pool was plagued with flies and smelly at times. The staff in the bar were great and no problem getting served.  Dinning room - food ok but not brilliant not always warm enough. Service was good no one ignored us.  Entertainment - this was fantastic the team work very hard and are very talented the dance shows are impressive even our son put down his iPod to watch!! The staff in the evening bar are very helpful and friendly.  Spa - good value for money.  We went into Marrakesh which was ok we took a taxi and arranged for it to pick us up at a fixed time and place ( only paying them at the end) this worked well although there is a free mini bus from the hotel it drops you the wrong side of a busy road and the local 'guide' are waiting to pounce on you. We sat upstairs in a cafe to watch the sun go down over the square amazing experience.  Overall we had an excellent week the hotel was very quiet we did attempt to speak a few words of French and this seemed to go down well with the staff there.,Date of stay: December 2015,,"Bourne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smithfamily40

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Abu Patel 87 wrote a review Dec 2015,30,"Corrupt Staff, spa and reception staff are terrible. Hidden costs & bad wifi. Can be a great hotel with better managent",This hotel could be really good. It is just let down by a few issues which should really be looked in to.    My friend from the UK come in a taxi to come see me from the Pullman but he was not allowed to come in the premises. I can understand if it was an escourt. However the night shift reception staff and security guard should really be investigated by the police as they are hustling at night. They are charging 500dhs minimum to other guests to let them bring a girl in to there room. A 1000dhs and they give you a room and I am sure there owners do not know about this. If so they would be sacked and prosecuted.    I booked two rooms under my own name. My friends come a day later and I was not even allowed to check in for them. The guy named Mohammed said I cant. As far as I am concerned if I book and pay for ten rooms I should be allowed access to all my rooms. He thought I was bringing girls and wanted some money for him to let them in. When my two friends come he realised I was telling the truth. Everyone is trying to take a cut.    WiFi is rubbish everywhere. Gym and indoor pool you have to pay extra which should come as a standard for any 5 star. The pool outside should be heated and is cold.    Food in Moroccan restaurant cost money we thought it was free and trust me do not go as it is a waste.    Snack bar next to hotel is very poor and main restaurant food is average. If you have privilege room in Raid 4 then you get special made lunch which is amazing and free drinks in your bar. All rooms are same everywhere Raid 4 is one with private pool if you want to be away from everyone. However it is very far so if you struggle to walk do not upgrade. Said Idlamine looks after the guests at raid 4 and is brilliant. Speaks great English and will go out of his way. Also cleaner Salwa was great. She cleaned room everyday. Raid 8 where my friends stayed Aziz was great too.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Arfan K wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Excellent for price paid.,Got 2 rooms at this hotel for 4 friends in total. Was all inclusive and has to be really as it is a bit far out from the hustle and bustle of the main city. I like breaking down what I experience so beat with me. I can help with any questions too if I miss out anything.    The front staff at reception are good. Mohammed is I think the manager a nice chubby helpful bloke was there through the night when I stayed. He was helpful about where to go and what's available. Maria and Loubna were also very helpful and nothing is too much to ask these people. Although there are a few Mohammed so don't expect all to be nice.    They sometimes are a bit snappy but some guests are very unreasonable and stress sometimes gets to people and you can appreciate. Always professional with me even after a bunch of 18 lads on a stag turned up and shouted down the reception.    Visitors are not allowed in the hotel even if they are men and not hookers. My friend like in Marrakech and I asked him to come straight to my room and he was refused. Only hotel guests are allowed past the reception due to security which I think is not great especially when your lift which in my case was my friend arrived early and I was still not showered. Other guests are also not allowed unless you possibly have some spare cash and willing to pay 1000 dirhams as a bribe.    I booked and got told I would get free club entry which I didn't need or want although wasn't given it either. Plus the club they were advertising was closed down so another flaw. They also offered a free hammam (Turkish bath) which is what I thought. On going to the spa I was told yes it's use of our steam room that's what our hamam is. Jaw dropped said ok. I have that at free at home in UK but thanks anyway. Alfifa was the girl at the spa and they are all very moody. They all just stand around doing nothing in there. I guess that's why they are not busy. They all have the wrong work ethics. No smiles. We paid 400dirhams to use the pool anyway as the main pool was freezing in Dec for4 boys. No towels provided as promised and when I asked one of the 10 staff can she get me a towel as she was doing nothing just sitting with another 2 girls told me go back UP to reception when I am soaking wet in my shorts. 👍. Lamiya the manager then came and she was not impressed who had a few words with the staff. Came back later in the day and the same crap. Was it worth the 100 dirhams per person? Yes definitely but use it like there is no staff on hand. If you want a massage I would recommend maybe another place. I went to a hamam called Hilton hamam near the water and electric board and it was good. Not the best but good for price. I would pay once and use the whole day. Not worth anymore.    Food - I like my food and I have to say the food here was adequate. People generally tend to pay an average of £100 a night and expect an all inclusive Michelin star 3 meals. Come on. That's unreasonable. This place the breakfast has enough breads cheeses cereals fruits cakes crossaint a pancakes and more. Even a guy making you omelettes with your ingredients choice. Juice and more. I hope you get the point. Again it's not presented with rose petals and carpets but you aing paying 350 a night£. The lunch and dinner is the same. Lots of variety a bit plain. Won't say bland but they have sauces so you can add to taste.    Rooms are basic but clean. Good pressure in the water. Equipped with a tv fridge hair dryer safe and a nice balcony. Out block was 8. Kept clean by Aziza and she was very good. My mate had a room in block 4. Which was far away. The furthest block available. The internet is crap in the room although they say on the site only available in public areas. It's perfect in the reception and swimming pool. Non existent in the restaurant but I don't know if they class that as public.    They have a Moroccan restaurant if you don't want to have the buffet but it's very bland and not worth 150dirhams. Personal opinion but it's only a £10 so I had to try it.    Apart from that I still would go back here. It's definitely worth the money. I paid under £90 for a twin room and it's worth it for me. There is cheaper but assume you will get what you pay for.,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArfanK_13

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tashfeen81 wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Excellent hotel with wonderful staff,I had the pleasure to check in last week at this beautiful hotel my overall experience was enhanced with an amazing service I received by Mohammed at the reception.  Although I come from the hospitality background ( Front officer Manager at a 5* hotel in London) and I tend to get quite picky when it comes to professionalism and service I receive while staying at other hotels. My review might come across quite critical and direct. I was greeted with a big smile at the time of check in by this lovely lady ( Sana). She was very polite and helpful she upgraded our room with the private pool complimentary. ( Thank you Sana for this).  We dinned at the restaurant throughout our stay and I must admit the food quality was not what I expected. Not enough variety for an all exclusive resortI found pretty much every cuisine quite bland. Restaurant staff needs to be more engaging ( did not greet any of the guests whenever we entered the restaurant area).  Pool area closed around 6pm not sure if this is something across all the hotels in Morocco. If that's the case there should be hot tubs or heated pools with extended hours.  Rooms were quite nice and spacious. Wireless connection was alright but not the best.  Good entertainment every night after the dinner ( all the performers are working hard I would like to compliment them on their effort).  My whole experience was taken to next level when I got chance to talk to this amazing gentleman (Mohammed) and wonderful lady ( Maria) at reception. He went out of the way to guide me about the city and different tips to travel around the city. I was quite impressed with his hospitality skills and professionalism. Maria was also quite helpful and always there to sort things out for us.  Thank you for all your help and hospitality :).,Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tashfeen81

Having never been to Marrakech before we were a bit worried about what standard the hotel would be. All our worries were unfounded. Hotel has beautifully maintained grounds with metal sculptures scattered around. 4 swimming pools 1 outdoor pool heated & 1 indoor pool.  Buffet resteraunt had great food. We were never hungry plenty of choice. Bedroom was furnished to a high standard.  All the hotel staff were very friendly. We didn't expect entertainment since we were going during winter but there were activities on during the day as well as a nightly show. During the day archery/cooking class/shooting/french bowls/water aerobics to name a few. Extra praise for the animation team they were always do lively obviously enjoyed their job.  Theres free wifi in the reception & a free shuttle bus into the centre of Marrakech (10 min journey).    **WARNING** When you get off the shuttle bus tourists are sometimes followed by scam artists pretending they know you from the hotel & that they work in the hotel. They offer to give you a walking tour of the city then charge a ridiculous price for their service. We had a prior warning from our rep so when this happened we nicely said ""no thank you"" about 20 times before he took the hint.    Highly recommend the day trip to the waterfall wild monkeys there in the surrounding trees amazing.  Was sad to leave could easily have spent to weeks there.",Date of stay: December 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,scotland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxxdebbiexxxxx

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,EllenDraper wrote a review Nov 2015,40,"Good location, good service, good resort",I'd never done an all inclusive stay before and we ended up staying here because our holiday got cancelled to Share El Sheikh so didn't know was to expect.    It's about 15 minutes from the airport and about 10 minutes into the medina. Free shuttle buses run regularly although the driver doesn't point you in the direction of anything this wasn't a problem for us as we'd visited before. If you don't want to do the bus it's about 70-100dh one way.    Reception were helpful but not overly welcoming the waiting and bar staff were a mix.... all helpful just maybe not with a smile. Some were lovely and friendly.    Food was tasty. Good mix of food with themed nights every other day. I've read some reports of food being repetitive but I could have had at 5 different meals each sitting.    Cocktails in the bad had a funny taste to them but didn't stop us drinking them.    The big pool with slides was soooo cold. The heated pool was lovely. There were plenty of sun beds to choose from even after people had claimed theirs with their towel. Music round the pool all day it's not intrusive if you don't sit next to the ain speakers.    The room was tidy and spacious. I've seem a few photos that give the impression of it being in a poor state of repair if you look closely the walks have the odd band or cracking buthe on the whole it looked and felt lovely. Our show head wouldn't stay up we reported this and it was fixed bug broke again.... didn't ruin our stay though.    We had our free sauna. It was nice and clean. Again the spa staff weren't overly welcoming though.    WiFi was intermittent. We didn't get ithe in our room and in some of the public areas it wouldn't connect but we were connected all day by the pool fine.    On the whole a well kept clean tidy and quiet resort with good food and a plentiful supply of beer.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllenDraper
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,annamanita wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Nice hotel with lovely staff,This is a very nice  perfectly located hotel with beautiful and spacious rooms. The grounds of the hotel is filled with fragrant plants olive and orange trees and it is a pleasure to be walking around and staying here. The staff are very welcoming and accommodating and the customer service is great. Although it is worth noting that  most of the staff do speak just basic English and it can be a little difficult to communicate sometimes. The food is nice and there is plenty of choice with different theme every night although if you are staying for more than a week like we did it can start to get a little repetitive. The animation team were absolutely great and did a great job every night to entertain the guests. There is a kids club within the hotel which is so great and there is always something to do for the kids. The spa is nice with plenty of services on offer  although I did find it quite highly priced. There are a few small negative things that I could point out however I am not going to as I think that it is absolutely great value for money and I did not want to concentrate on small negative details. Overall this was a great hotel and I am usually not a big fan of the all inclusive hotels however this one is great and I would definitely stay here again.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annamanita
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,M1VHA wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Mother & Daughter - Winter Sun,If you are looking for a nice hotel in Marrakesh then look no further. I would like to start by thanking the the hotel management team for they secured a great room for my for my daughter and I. We stayed in room 808 which was just great - we were only two minutes (maybe less) from the Spa and the heated outdoor pool. It may have taken a minute longer to to reach the main restaurant and bar - we really could not have asked for a better location.    We were looking for winter sun in a nice location offering good food on an all inclusive basis and this was delivered in abundance. The hotel staff were very helpful and accommodating from our arrival to departure.    THINGS TO NOTE:    If you are a vegetarian the options maybe limited to salads and pizza - however this was not an issue for omnivore such as I who was well satisfied with all that was on offer - especially the fish dishes - which were a real success.    O-Spa visit - IS A MUST - the heated pool hammam (steam room) and treatments are all great and worth the money!!    WiFi - is limited in some area of the complex - but we were lucky we got WiFi in room 808 and around the heated pool. It works really well in the hotel reception. Unfortunately WiFi is not available in the O-Spa.    In short my daughter and I had a very good vacation we would return and we would happily recommended this establishment to all.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M1VHA

However following an accident on the first day resulting in not being able to walk we thought the holiday would be ruined.    However the hotel were superb - moving us to a room on the ground floor getting us a doctor and wheelchair. They spoke to the Pharmacist for us & arranged for the prescription to be delivered to the hotel. The on-site Excursion company arranged a car and tour guide for us so we could get out & see the sites. The tour guide even pushed the wheelchair for us. The bar and restaurant staff were always on hand to help.    The guest manager Mohammed Lahlou was really helpful and arranged anything we needed. Special mention to Mourad on Reception and the night manager who drove round and round for us at 2am in the morning (really sorry never got your name).    Lots of room around the heated pool.

I do want to go back for a longer trip if possible and I would happily stay at the Kenzi again. The staff were great even if their English was limited. They did their best to help especially if they knew they were appreciated. The spa had a good range of treatments all reasonably priced. The free shuttle to the town centre was good to have but taxis were plentiful and cheap. The pool area was quiet but the main pool was a bit cold and I didn't get to try out the water slides! Luckily there is a smaller heated pool. Plenty of sun loungers too. Not sure if that would be the case during high season. The animations team who provided the entertainment were all clearly enjoying their work and trying to keep everyone happy. The food at meal times was replenished regularly although it did get a bit repetitive by day 4. However it's easy enough to take a trip into town and try and cheap meal at one of the open air places in the Jemaa al-Fnaa - there are lots to choose from in the evening. The only real complaint I have is that the air con in the room didn't work properly. We had two separate rooms with the same problem and didn't know whether this was because it was low season and got quite chilly once the sun went down. We resolved the issue by sleeping with the balcony door open. Probably not wise however if you are on the ground floor. It was a minor problem so we didn't report it as it didn't spoil our stay.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracyl91

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,dellywells wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Lovely holiday,"Was looking for something a little different as opposed to a beach holiday. I enjoyed the experience. Like I have stated in my other reviews 5* hotels are really our version of 4* hotels. The weather was 23-27 degrees at the height of the day. Very cold at night so bring a cardigan or jumper especially at this time of year. The reception is grand. Staff throughout the hotel were hit and miss. We found some to be grumpy and others were pleasant. We navigated the monuments old medina by horse carriage which was 250 dirhams for two people then we navigated the souks ourselves. Get ready to haggle and say no thanks. People will chase you! My version was shaking my head and saying shakuran (not the correct spelling) which means thank you. I feel the carriage gave as an idea of where the meeting point for the free shuttle bus service for the hotel was for when we were returning. Far cheaper than a guide although I must say if you haven't read up on the history a guide might suit you better. We also did the chez ali night which was dinner and a folklore show. It was good and the lamb pieces were amazing but for the price I did expect more. I did not regret the trip to the atlas which was stunning. The trek to the waterfall is well quite ""trekky"". I saw people wearing heels! Please don't. The picture at the top waterfall was worth it. At the top we sat in the shade and drank mint tea. It was beautiful. One thing I will say is if you are doing the 4x4 atlas mountains try not to purchase all your things at the souks. Instead on your way back from the waterfall you will see Berber stalls. The price is cut in half if you haggle and the shop keepers may even know some of the artists and craftsman by name! I recommend the desert experience. The 4x4 was ok unless you want to take pictures from a high point or you want to see an oasis or thebvirgin guy Richard Branson's hotel.....mmmmm yh. The quad biking and camel ride at night under the stars for me was the most memorable activity. You will love it! Need for speed and then tranquility. After these activities you have belly dancing and a meal of tangine and cous cous. Probably the best we had on this holiday. At this point i was getting tired of cous cous unless you really love cous cous... The hotel food was hit and miss. Some items were great but most of the food was bland and lacked flavour and there were flies everywhere because not everything was covered. The deserts were lovely and the hotel provided a vast variety the best I have experienced with all inclusive package. Bottled water fresh orange juice  lemonade and snacks were all free. We never had to buy water. The bath in our room was faulty as it blocked easily and most of the irons we repeatedly asked for did not function. Housekeeping were good and cleaned very well. Toilet paper and towels always replaced.

The hotel is laid out as separate riads and nicely decorated though it was a little difficult to find our way back to ours in the dark on the first night!    The food was pretty good plenty of variety drinks (and cocktails) were all included - just avoid the ice which we forgot to do! The wait staff were very friendly.    Reception staff were a bit hit and miss some were very helpful others it felt like you were interrupting them. We booked a trip into the mountains through them we enquired what was available and just got put on a phone to the agency we use. Whilst on the trip we discovered the waterfall trip and lunch wasn't actually included in the 'all-inclusive' price and they take you to a restaurant with an English menu to pay about 3 times the price of the restaurant next to it which left a sour taste in the mouth. We also found out we had paid 200dhm more than the other couples on the trip!    The free shuttle is good but drops you a little way away from Jma-el-fnaa and we struggled to find it the first day.

The resort is large with a good sized pool and has a wonderful view of the Atlas mountains. On the whole the staff were excellent and very professional.The room was perfect. As I would recomend a day trip to the Atlas mountains for anyone visiting Marrakech    We chose Trekkinginmorocco.net and his 1 day Atlas mountains (Imlil) tour based on the recommendations on TRIPADVASOR and we weren't disappointed. The tour was one of the highlights of our holiday to Marrakech.    The meal in the Berber house and camel ride was something we will never forget - the experience was unique authentic and so delicious (one of our nicest meals on the holiday).    It was evident that Ahmed cares about the Berber children the local people and their community and giving something back to the community.    He has excellent English and explained so much about Morocco and it's culture allowed us to fill in the gaps for lots of questions we had about what we had seen so far in our holiday.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Baldavito wrote a review Nov 2015,30,"Ok for the price, but not a 5 Stars",My fiancee and I spent 5 nights in this nice hotel just outside of Marrakesh. I can just agree with many other reviews here. The structure is very nice although the rooms are not as spacious as we hoped. The terrace overlooks what seems to be a parking lot outside the hotel not the nicest view. Given the price I think it is an ok place to spend few days not more than 5 though. The food starts to be repetitive. What I would suggest for improving:    1. Just one restaurant for so many people creates problem. We have never had a waiter asking us if we needed something: we had to search drinks and cutlery ourselfs and take it from other tables  2. We spent 5 days near a pool: nobody ever asked us if we needed something  3. Please PLEASE PLEASE do not go to a la carte restaurant. It is a joke seriously. Really bad food. The buffet is much better or just go to the city center.  4. More space for the shuttle into the town people need more option  5. Keep in mind people who do not like smoking. We could not enjoy a dinner outside because every time someone would sit close to us and smoke. It happened in the pool as well: we had to move different time. Make same outside areas smoke free please!!  6. the gym! We had to pay 25 Euros for a week for using the week which had half of the equipment broken. With the money you make you can easily fix it and buy more equipment. I have more equipment in my bedroom.    The structure is well designed even if very busy it is easy to find a quiet spot. There are many activities to do and a nice little farm with cute animals.,Date of stay: November 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baldavito

Great private pool and friendly staff to look after your every need. Rooms always clean and well looked after.    The all inclusive food and drink was good for what we paid for. Tasty choice every night although lunch and dinner was often quite similar. The theme nights were every second night however and were a welcome change.    All drinks tasty and decent spirits. I've had much worse elsewhere.    Staff were all very helpful and couldn't do enough for us.    Yes there are a lot of French people but don't be put off by this your on holiday that's what it's all about!    The pools were both relaxing and always plenty beds to choose from.    Highly recommend Marrakesh at night time use the free shuttle bus and head in around 530pm for a few hours! It's a must.    All in all a brilliant relaxing week away and met some brilliant people which added to the experience.    Don't be put off by the folk who complain on here!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Carol R wrote a review Nov 2015,40,Good for a week away with some points to note,"The Club is only 10 - 15 mins away from the airport so no need to pay for costly tour operator transfers - taxi only costs 100 MAD (£6.70). The hotel reception is the main point for Wifi ( it is meant to have it throughout the resort and it does work intermittently at the pool but never managed to reach our room.). Check in was fine and a special mention for Maria who was always helpful. The grounds of the hotel are immaculate with some very interesting statues throughout ( pug in a bat mobile for example!!). The triple room we had was very clean with good housekeeping The bathroom and shower / toiletries are fine. The beds and pillows are some of the hardest I have ever come across and take some getting used to! You have to unfurl your back on the sun loungers during the day! There are a good range of sport activities throughout the day ( and the water aerobics instructors actually make you work which is great and necessary for the freezing cold main pool - as opposed to the subtropical smaller one!) including aqua bike and step. The slides were certainly a hit with the kids. Despite the various notices there were the usual sun lounger hogs but there are enough to go around. Be warned though this is a very large resort and my daughter had her new sunglasses stolen after 10 mins unattended. Apart from Maria the hotel didn't really care. ""well we haven't stolen them""!    The food is usual buffet style for an all inclusive and as other reviewers have said does become very monotonous ( 2 weeks would have been a stretch!) Although the restaurant area was kept very clean and food seemed very fresh and well cooked / maintained I did hear of several upset tummies and I returned home on Sunday and by Monday night had the most awful upset stomach. Bottled water and soda ( including Coke zero) is freely available at mealtimes as is wine and beer.    The spa is very nice with reasonable prices.    With regards to the available trips in the tunnel area we arranged a guide to go around the souk as it was me and two daughters - make sure you negotiate the price. Also the camel ride followed by dinner in a ""beautiful"" bedouin camp is certainly a night to remember in many ways!! You don't actually ride to the ""camp"" - you get taken to the base go for a ride on a camel up and down the hill then go back to the base camp ( which looks better in the dark!!) The food was horrid and the music was provided by a man with a box and two strings. You can have henna tattoos.    All in all a good place to go for a week of sunshine with many plus points but a few downsides.",Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolrE7426HM

When they moved us the following day into the family suite the sink was blocked the tv remote broken and yes no wifi. It was a daily trek to reception to get various problems addressed where some of the staff including the manager just didn't want to know.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DebzieJay wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Fab hotel and friendly staff!,My partner and I stayed at this hotel for a week in mid October. I had asked for a top floor room with a view and got a ground floor room with no view but it was lovely and included a small patio area. The bed was extremely comfortable aircon was included and there was a TV. The cleaner kept our room spotlessly clean and each morning decorated the bed with flowers. Shampoo and shower gels were provided and replaced regularly and the towels replaced daily whether you wanted them to be or not! My only negative about the room was that from a lady's perspective there was no dressing table and therefore no mirror to use hair straighteners! This was almost a crisis but the hotel very kindly and quickly found me an extension lead which solved the problem! Phew! I would suggest you take a lead with you. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom (!)    The grounds of the hotel are immaculate and the staff seem to work on them 24/7. All of the staff were cheery and friendly and the hotel has a superb entertainment team for both day time games/fitness and night time fun. Most of the evening entertainment consisted of kids party dances a show (nearly always dance) and a party/disco after. The shows were of a high standard with professional dancers in the team. Personally I found these a bit repetitive after about the fourth day but each to their own. There is a nightclub which went on until the early hours but this is a distance away from the riads so your peace is not disturbed.    The food was superb with a huge choice. They tended to have theme nights but pasta pizza salads tagines etc were always available along with an amazing array of deserts. One night there was a whole fresh Tuna that they were grilling steaks from! It was awesome!    The weather was between 25 and early 30s during the day but be warned it gets cold at night! One of the pools had the heating turned on while we were there.    We spent 2 days in the spa. An amazing relaxing experience quiet sunbeds a pool at 94 degrees and tea and water provided. We had a Hamman which is an experience! Between us we also had a full body massage a head and face massage a back massage and an argon oil hair treatment. Ladies be warned you will be topless! They don't take no for an answer! Once you get past this the treatments are amazing and so cheap compared to the UK.    You must have a cup of mint tea made by one of the guys in reception (it is amazing) and the Souks and the Medina are incredible. Open your mind and forget the pre-conceptions and you will have a fantastic experience. Oh and ladies you are best to cover up. I took my cardigan off as it was so hot and despite having everything but my shoulders covered the guy in the restaurant we were in wouldn't even look at me having been jovial beforehand. (Will do a separate review on the Medina!)    One last thing to bear in mind this hotel is predominantly used by the French. We managed to find some English people who we made great friends with and this made our holiday.

The staff are what make this place what it is they are hard workingpolite always smiling and happy to help.    Ok so there are some negatives if like me your a tea drinker id advise to bring a travel kettle as the hot water in the restaurant is never hot enough and there aren't any tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms.only one bar is open at a time which can mean along walk to get a drink where as a solo traveller you either have to take everything with you or trust that it will be safe while around the pool.

The wifi of the hotel is really strong in the hotel lobby but because of the layout of the place it gets weaker depending on where your room is. The room itself was quite nice and in terms of cleaningthe housekeeping did a relatively nice job of cleaning the hotel. The service from them however wasn't as good as I remember one off the pool staff said ""I won't respond unless you speak french!"" Other than that the hotel was a generally good one to stay in. Also the pool was really nice and the water slides were really fun and nice (They only open at 3 tho). Finally the food in the hotel was also decent. There weren't a lot of choices on what to eat and they always have the same thing everyday bar a few changes based on the theme of the dinner    The Hotel is quite close to Jamaa El Fnaa one of the best squares and markets where you can surely get a few souvenir's and bargins and also delicious fruit juices such as orange or lemon and it is worth going.",Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7750PEchrisc
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Belfasttravelguy wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Great value all inclusive!,I'm spent 3 nights here on an all inclusive deal which was great value for money. The hotel is nice with nice garden areas and well presented. On arrival we had to wait a bit at the reception desk for a member of staff to attend to us and the other guy was busy. Our room wasn't ready until 2pm but we were given out wristbands and told to go and get lunch and a few drinks and come back at 2pm which we did. Our room was ready when we returned and we were transported to our room with our bags on a golf cart. The room was clean and comfortable and fairy modern. We were in block 8 which was very handy for the pool area and restaurant. The bed was very comfortable and we didn't hear any noise at all in our room. Towels were changed and beds made up every day which was good! The only negative thing was I found that the wifi wasn't great in the room or around the hotel in general! It was very intermittent or didn't work at all in places. The only place it worked properly was in the reception area. The pool area was great with lots of si loungers and plenty of comfortable secluded bed areas to lie on. The slides are great for the kids but slightly noisier around there. All day long the entertainment staff have plenty of activities going on for those who wish to take part. Those guys never seemed to stop from morning until late at night particularly Spider and Nico! They're all pretty talented too! The pool bar is nice and has comfortable seating too. It can be a bit slow to get served at times as they tend to not serve in any particular order! Staff in general were all pretty friendly! I think if you make a bit of an effort with them in French or say a few Arabic words it definitely helps and even the grumpy ones start to come around a bit eventually! One in particular who worked in the main bar in the evening and also in the nightclub afterwards was a really nice guy and hard worker! The restaurant staff too were all quite friendly. I found the reception staff probably the least friendly and helpful of the lot. The food was actually pretty good! I can see how it might get a bit boring if you were here for a couple of weeks but I thought that there was plenty of choice and it was all properly cooked. The tagines in particular were very good. I have experienced a lot worse all inclusive food on my travels! I didn't like the fact that there were a lot of flies about but that wasn't the hotel's fault...it seemed to be standard for Marrakech at this time of year! It was a bit off putting in general though! We didn't use the shuttle bus into the town but it's handy to have. We did get totally ripped off by one of the taxis outside taking us to the airport though so be warned! It would be good if the hotel had some taxi deals or airport shuttle. All in all a nice hotel which is great for families -just needs slightly better wifi!,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belfastguy

We were looked after in the dinning area by MONCEF who looked after us and made us feel special throughout whole week. SAID barman at the pool bar also went out of his way to look after us with a big smile and ABDERRAHIM ensured our area by our beds was spotless and was always happy and had some great banter and fun with all three.  Magic looked after our ladies fitness with some aqua fitness on bikes not seen this before. You don;t need towells if your weight is close to limit for low deposit you can change daily at animation desk.  Entertainment every night and was enjoyable and varried with a very plesant entertainment team. Who although spoke mostly in French did repeat for the benifit of english speaking people.  Food was Excellent and they tried to give variety with themed nights.  Rooms (Block 8) were excellent very spacious comfortable and cleaned daily all you can ask for really  however last day out by noon but then not leaving til 6pm - we were told by reception that a room would be supplied so no need to keep room on we had travelled with relitives obviously having two rooms well they gave us one small room consisting of one seating for two and a shower really a bit of a struggle and if we had known would have kept room on  Highlight of week free shuttle the Marrakech market - paid for guide £14 for 3 hours and Abdul who was really informative took us through the maze of streets and alleys visiting all the diffrent areas of where the goods are made from leather to wood to ceramics to spices ect and finishing in the market square where the snake charmers were charming the cobras absolutly amazing day.

Everywhere was so clean &a well looked after.  The suite was lovely so big 2 toilets bath shower. Queen size bed lounge area 2 huge TVs. 2 patios areas. Each day the maid scattered flowers in shapes of hearts & made arrangements with the towels & bedding.  Restaurant was always good I don't eat meat & not much else but I enjoyed the salads & made up for it with their deserts which were to die for! Special mention must go to Mustapha who was our waiter for breakfast & lunch he was superb always made sure we had everything we wanted. One morning my husband had an upset tummy so Mustapha gave us his mobile number In case he needed medication luckily he was fine by lunchtime.  Pools we stayed around the rectangular one (not the private one) had no problems with sun beds or sunshades. Pool was cold but was lovely as it was so hot.  Evening entertainment was great especially the night Spider pretended to a baby say no more he is so funny! All the team did a great job in keeping guests entertained. Waiters one in particular but I cannot remember his name always made sure we had drinks & we didn't even have to ask for them!  We did give good tips to certain people & were truly looked after.  Taxis we always gave more than we should have.  Had a couple of trips into the Medina. First one we had a horse & carriage two hour ride which was wonderful saw so much!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RelishLife wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Average at best,Just returned from a 4 night stay here with my daughter (24 years old). It was half term in France so a lot of children around.    This is a very adequate hotel but overall pretty basic. The food becomes very repetitive and is nice enough but not great - masses of choice but the same most nights. Loads of pre-fabricated desserts which all taste the same.    The drinks at the bar are awful stick to the wine/lager and avoid their version of 'cocktails' - they bear no resemblance to the real thing. Despite paying a premium for privilege area and promise of wifi there was no wifi in the rooms. You get very slow wifi in reception and by the smaller privilege pool only but download anything you may like to watch before you leave as there are only 2 English TV channels and the nightly entertainment Is very much kids/family focussed.    Don't expect any luxuries such a conditioner shower caps body lotion in the rooms. It's all very basic. My daughter forgot her toothbrush and you cannot buy one anywhere on site.    The spa is pretty good but do book sessions in advance as they fill out quite quickly!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,solosunseeker2015 wrote a review Oct 2015,40,"Lovely hotel, shame about the admin!","Arrived at the hotel around 9.30 having got very lucky and passed passport control quickly. On arrival we were asked to fill out the standard form with your passport number etc however it also asked for the number of the stamp put in your passport on arrival which was so faint you couldn't tell! As we were mother and son travelling together we checked that we had been allocated a twin room as requested at the time of booking. We were reassured that we had and were driven to the room in a golf buggy.    The grounds of the hotel are lovely spaciously laid out and well tended. You do however occasionally have to duck for a low hanging olive tree! We were shown to our room which we quickly realised was a double but were reassured that it could be turned into a twin. We thought that the had just put two twin beds together to make the double however housekeeping turned up with a folding bed. We made it clear that this was not acceptable and so the maid rang reception. We were told that the hotel was fully booked that night but that we would be upgraded to a suite the next day.    Breakfasts are very good an array of cold meats and cheeses with eggs cooked to order merguez sausages and morrocan and danish pastries fresh orange juice etc. The pool area is very good loungers are well spaced and plentiful although a cash deposit of 15 euro per towel is required. The pool is very cold but as temperatures were in the thirties this was rather welcome.    After a couple of visits to reception over the course of the morning to chase things up we were given our upgrade at lunchtime and shown to our suite. This was enormous with tv and air con in both bedrooms two toilets and a bath and separate shower cubicle.    Lunch and dinner are often on a theme with different tagines and couscous always available. Waiters are very generous with drinks and give the bottle rather than a glass. This is useful as they can be put in the fridge in the room. Can't comment on the evening entertainment as we went into the Jem el Fna most nights. The shuttle bus parks to the side of the hotel so is easily missed and parks a little way out of the main square. Taxis into the centre are around 80 dirham but be firm and agree a price and location before getting into the car we were taken to the proverbial ""Brother's Shop"" but stood our ground and were taken to the square at no extra cost. Eating at the stalls is dirt cheap and very good fun.    One quite important point is that the safes weren't working while we were at the hotel. This meant that I had to carry our cash tickets and passports at all times which was a bit of a worry even thought there is a strong Tourist Police presence.    Overall I would rate this hotel quite highly once the original problems were sorted we really enjoyed our holiday and the staff are so good natured that it's difficult to be angry with them.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Martin H wrote a review Oct 2015,10,One of our worst holiday experiences,This hotel was very poorly managed. On arrival along with another couple we were told the hotel was fully booked and we would have to transfer to a sister hotel (1 mile away) for the night and return the following day when a room would be available. This was just the start of our troubles.    On return from the sister hotel we were promised an upgrade to a suite. We were given our room keys whilst the porter transported our bags. However on arrival at the room it was clear we had not been upgraded to a suite. We went back to reception to confront the manager who said he had no suites to give us and instead offered us a massage. We declined this offer. Following some discussions he did find us a more suitable room but felt we had to fight for it.    From our experience the rooms at this hotel are satisfactory. No more no less. It's certainly not luxurious and could do with more regular maintenance e.g. there were some defective light bulbs in our room and the shower head was loose. The bed and pillows are probably the hardest we've ever experienced. In a number of respects our room (528) appeared unfinished e.g. missing shower curtains. Room cleanliness was ok and the maids clearly work hard to maintain their standards.    Being all-inclusive the dining hall was self-service and a bit of a scrum. We suggest getting in early for a chance of a good choice and make sure all food is piping hot or cold as necessary. During one visit to the restaurant we noticed cockroaches in the food area. Staff were hurried to the area to remove them but indicated a poor standard of cleanliness and potential for disease. Worst of all we both suffered food poisoning symptoms during our stay. We both visited the nurse who didn't appear surprised and had appropriate medications waiting for us. When we told the manager of this experience he put it down to the heat rather than the hotel food and water. We found this hard to accept as we're both used to travelling and excessive heat and have not experienced this type of illness before.    Around the pool there were flies and in the pool snack bar a large quantity of wasps gathered daily around the syrups e.g. coca cola etc. Also the music around the main pool was very repetitive and at times very loud.    All in all this was a terrible experience and offering a one star is being generous.    We visited Marrakech in February 2015 and stayed in a city Riad. This was a fantastic experience with excellent personal service from the owner and staff. I would suggest anyone going to Marrakech to choose this option rather than an impersonal all inclusive hotel miles from the city centre.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,holidaylover1983 wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Fantastic Hotel but some improvements can be made,I stayed at the Hotel at the beginning of September with my sister and friend - we had booked a room for the 3 of us and I emailed the Hotel a week in advance to see if we could upgrade our room. I had a reply within a day and were promptly told we has been upgraded to a suite which was fantastic.    It was my first visit to Morocco my sister had been before but be prepared for passport control..it took us almost an hour to get through. Many people had failed to complete the boarding card passed out on the plane so this was being done when they got to the front of the queue causing long delays.    We arrived at the hotel at 11.00am after a short 15/20 minute transfer - checking in was simple our rooms were not ready but were advised to come back at 12.30pm to collect the keys. They have free wifi throughout the hotel which is great for those who want to stay in touch with the real world!!    They kindly kept our luggage safe and off we went to explore. The hotel is lovely very clean. We headed to the Pool Bar which I have to say didn't blow me away. The service was shocking and it took us over 10 minutes to get a drink the servers just seemed to ignore us.    We then headed to the restaurant to check out lunch. I was very impressed. I am quite a fussy eater and normally stick to brad and pasta on holiday (healthy I know!!) but the selection of food was great with a fantastic salad bar all looking nice and fresh.    They provide bottles of drinks to the tables along with water which is great.    We got our keys and headed off to check out our room. is was a suite so we had a living room a main bedroom bathroom and separate toilet - plenty of space for the 3 of us. slightly disappointed to see that we didn't have a mini bar but we did have fresh fruit and biscuits.    The pool area was lovely never really a problem getting a bed. We would head for breakfast about 8 / 8.30am and there were hardly ever towels out so bed hogging was not an issue.    As the week went we realised that some of the staff did not take too well to English people they seemed to favour the French so on the odd occasions we did struggle to get served drinks. In the main restaurant there were 2 exceptional employees called Ameen and Mustapha who always made sure we had a table and drinks thanks so much!!    We went into the Medina on the shuttle bus that runs be aware that you don't want to head into the Sooks after darkness its gets quote scary and the stench of bike fuel is quite overwhelming. The atmosphere in the Medina is great we ate there one evening and the price was great.    We also headed out to see the waterfalls in the Atlas Mountains - fantastic trip. If you do decide to check it out try to go as early in the morning as possible and remember to wear sensible clothing and footwear - not sure what I was expecting but we climbed up and over rocks for at least 2 hours and we only made it to waterfall 2....then you have to climb back down the same way which is really tricky when is getting busier!!    The weather well being an avid Egypt goer I was a little worried we may get rain / cloud but I'm very pleased to say it was great.    Mornings were quite fresh started to get warm about 10ish and reached about 30 / 35 most days. Evenings were also quite chilly so take a cardy or jacket to take the edge off.    The only negative bit I had is the spa and gym - you have to pay to use both. I understand paying for treatments etc but you actually have to pay either daily or weekly to even use the gym facilities or indoor poll which was a little disappointing.    In relation to the journey home make sure you complete you exit visa which is just before you head into security there are no clear signs so many people were forgetting to complete them.    Overall we had a great holiday the majority of the staff were fantastic even printing of off our return boarding pass we are already looking to back next year,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Midlands,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holidaylover1983
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Julie H wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Nice but with issues!!,We arrived about 9pm  checked i given our wristbands and asked to go and have something to eat.  When we got back were given our room keys but as some people in front of us were having issues i decided to check if we had a twin room as requested(i was travelling with my son) This was confirmed and we were taken by golf buggy to our room.As soon as door was open it was clear it was a double not twin room After a call to reception was told housekeeping would be over to sort it When housekeeping arrived it was to bring a fold up bed into the room Explained was not happy to accept this they walked away ! After speaking to the reception manager he advised that they had no other rooms available that night as hotel fully booked and would have to accept it and would be moved the next dayHaving no choice we accepted this and he said would get housekeeping back to make up bedwe waited and waited ! called back again and he explained they would have to get bed from storage. when i explained bed was still outside door so this was rubbish housekeeping then appeared and made bed up.All this took nearly 2 hours not what you want after a long day travelling and at that time of night.  Next day eventually after several trips to reception we were upgraded to a suite and in the privilege area.  Suite was lovely 2 big rooms flowers on bed fridge in room and a flat screen TV in each room didnt use the privledge area so cannot comment on that    Hotel grounds are amazing and really well looked after.    Pools ; there are 4 all really well looked after with lots of loungers and covered beds to use. The main pool has swimming shoots which are good fun and opened for periods during day.    Food: Breakfast very good lunch and dinner were ok and you could always find something to eat Most evenings they had theme nights Chinese was very good.Drinks were available both by bottle and glass if you could get a waiters attention.Bottles of coke etc were very useful as able to take back to room to keep in fridge.    Reception: very few of the staff could speak english and it was a struggle to make yourself understood at times.    There is a shuttle bus taking you near the main square you do need to book this usually the day before which is very good but be aware it dosent stop outside main door as you would expect but to the right of the hotel which no one explains to you because of this we missed the bus the 1st time we tried to use it.    There are always taxis waiting on road outside hotel which will take you into the square.Always arrange a price before getting into taxi and be very fir where you want to go as they try and take you to uncle/brothers shop etc.    Overall we were only there for 4 days and after issue with room sorted had a nice enjoyable time time enjoying the sun.    Not sure i would go back for a longer period.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8396DQjulieh
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Cheryl wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Lovely Hotel and Service,Don't let bad reviews put you off this is a lovely place. We stayed here for a week at the end of September and had a lovely time. I was concerned about the service having read reviews about how they favour the French but we had no problems at all. Yes they speak French first and then English but they looked after us wonderfully and we got on well with the hotel team and didnt find anyone to be rude even though we can't speak French. Our room was great clean and spacious with a very comfortable bed. The hotel itself was also very clean and smart looking. We enjoyed the evening activities before and after dinner as well as having a go at the archery and air rifle shooting. The hotel event team people are really fabulous so friendly and all good fun I can't speak highly enough of them. The food was lovely a great variety of food they always have a couple of Moroccan dishes in tagines as well as pizza pasta chips salads chicken fish a beef dish of some kind. I really enjoyed the food and probably ate too much! Overall I cannot complain and anything less than 5/5 wouldn't be fair.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylw686
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Philsgonemissing wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Pleasant hotel but had some issue's!!,Stayed here for one week with my partner. Hotel was nice and clean on arrival staff took us to our room which was good and showed where the restaurant and bar was. Room was clean and comfortable food in the restaurant was good and there was always plenty of choice  with tagines to die for. Waiters were polite and helpful. Pools are good clean and well maintained and the grounds were well kept....That's the good stuff now for the bad!!  So for the first 2 days our electric room keys wouldn't work properly we would go out in the morning come back at lunch and neither of our keys would work so we would have to walk back up to reception to get them re activated. Not major problem just a pain..Then our room safe stopped working once again no drama just a pain having to walk back up to reception then go back to the room to wait for the dude to sort it.  No the worst problem...After coming back to our room from breakfast one morning we walk in to find our patio doors wide open and no-one in the room so we look outside maids cleaning kart outside but no maid. A couple of minutes later the maid walks through the patio doors with a flower to put on our bed!! So she's left our ground floor patio doors wide open with all our belongings in the room while she went to look for a flower to put on our bed. Really not cool!!!!  Oh and watch for the daily room tax you will also get charged when you check out...Its not much but if you haven't accounted for it it may come as bit of a shock!!,Date of stay: September 2015,,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philsgonemissing

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sierra J wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Food and reception not 5star,After a chaotic two and a half hours at the airport we arrived at the hotel at around 9.15 pm. As the restaraunt was open until 10.30 we went to get some dinner and was welcomed by luke warm unappetising food. During our weeks stay the food was no better than average 3 star food which was quite often cold. There was a fair selection of dishes and we could always get something to suit our palates. We had hoped for a better selection of good traditional Morrocan dishes but compared to previous visits to Marrakech we were a bit disappointed.  The hotel and gardens were beautiful and lived up to its 5 star rating . We had a superior room which was clean and comfortable and the pool area was good and always plenty sun beds but maybe the music was a bit loud and full on at times. The animation team worked really hard we're welcoming and always had time to chat and have a laugh with you.  On the contrary the reception staff were unhelpful and even rude at times.  If I were to return to Marrakech I would not be using this hotel again and would prefer to use a traditional riad where you are better treated.  A word of advice for travellers to Marrakech:- don't come on Saturday as the airport is chaotic. With too many flights arriving about the same time the passport control just can't cope. We were over two hours in queues and when we reached the luggage area our suitcases were all piled up in the corner. On our way home the plane was late as it was not allowed to land because the airport was already overcrowded and we again had 2 hours to get through passport control.,Date of stay: October 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SierraJ_11
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,matyls wrote a review Oct 2015,30,Cluby Kenzi,The Kenzi Club Agdal Medina is classified as a 5 star establishment  situated on the suburbs of Marrakech in the Agdal district . The area is relatively quiet . There are a few good restaurants within walking distance (20 Mins ) and a sprinkling of night clubs including Pasha and 555. The hotel frequently operates a courtesy shuttle bus which transports the resorts guests to the Medina  a mere 10 minutes away .    Club Kenzi  is situated in extensive  beautifully verdant well tendered gardens . Offering panoramic vistas of the imposing Atlas Mountains . The external physical appearance of the rooms is likened to a typical Moroccan Riad . Interiors  are well equipped  with the latest mod cons  although we did find the beds rather uncomfortable and the daily contents of the fridge was only a bottle of mineral water ( not my perception of All Inclusive ) .    The food was what you would expect from an All Inclusive run Hotel . Massly produced and very samey . Breakfast was good with an array of options . Lunch was edible. However only too often Dinner appeared to be the remnants of lunch . A concoction of drinks were available throughout the day . Although apparently after Midnight  charges were enforced.    The Hotel offered numerous amenities  including spa  tennis  golf  kids club and animation team which offered guests various activities including dance classes cookery classes water aerobics. 2 swimming pools  one which consisted of a number of water slides.    Staff  the animation team were exceptionally friendly and courteous and respected your wishes if you didnt want to participate in the daily activities. Conversely  some of the crew in the dining room were unfriendly and in essence actually looked very unhappy at their work . A few of the reception staff were equally unfriendly displaying a rather coldness of manner.    If you want a cluby atmospherewith copious amounts of drink and mediocre food Then the Kenzis for you . In essence would I go back NO .,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matyls

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,FunkyMarshmallow wrote a review Oct 2015,40,Not 5 Star but if you are expecting 4 you wont be sad,We booked this hotel as it was listed as 5 Star however this can only be deemed 4 star at most. Everything about this hotel is lovely apart from a couple of niggles which could be easily rectified.    The hotel is in a beautiful surroundings which appears to be an old olive grove the gardens are beautifully cared for and lovely to walk around. The room was large had nearly everything we needed the food was good and the staff attentive.    There were no tea and coffee facilities in the room a must for a 5 star and somewhat disappointing as there was no easy way to grab a pre breakfast coffee from the restaurant for the room because of the way they served morning coffee    I booked a 50 minute massage I got 35 minutes I complained and the spa manager refunded the difference but the point that I wanted a 50 minute massage was missed.    We returned to our room after breakfast to find the patio door open (accessible to anyone) we were in the room for 5 minutes before anyone returned the room staff were collecting flowers to decorate the bed she claimed she had her eye on the door but there was a wall in the way so this was not possible. We complained stating we did not want to compromise security over flowers which would look better on the trees than then bin they stopped the flowers but need to understand the seriousness of this breach of security thay may be able to vouch for their staff but have no idea who is staying at their hotel.    If they can tighten up on these few problems our holiday would have been perfect,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyMarshmallow

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,seatwell wrote a review Sep 2015,30,"Pool is freezing! Nice hotel, needs improvement.",This should be classed as a 3-4 star hotel not 5. It's okay pretty average. Food isn't amazing but was again...ok. The only drinkable wine was the rose. the staff were polite ad friendly and the grounds were kept very neat and tidy. The mojitos that everyone is referring to are disgusting! I don't understand anyone that can think they are nice. Syrupy disgustingness. They have all the equipment to make a great mojitos and other coattails too but they don't know how to make them unless you like them trashy chav Benidorm style.    The pool is freezing to the point where you don't want to get in and it was baking hot weather. When you are on holiday you want to be able to spend time in the pool and take a refreshing dip... but it was a bit ridiculous. Even after a while my body didn't get used to it and I always had to end up getting out as I couldn't stand it any longer. They should heat the main pool it would be much nicer.    When we arrived we had a room without a bath even though we paid for a room with a bath we told the hotel and they said they would move us to a room with a bath the next day. They should never of said this to us as we paid extra for that bath. we kicked up a bit of a fuss and then they finally moved us to a room with a bath. But they should of just moved us straight away.    Bedrooms are lovely and big they could do with a dressing table mirror though.    The entertainment at night is quite cheesy we never stayed in the hotel at night and instead opted to go out for drinks.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,1969Princess wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Amazing hotel!!,i have just got back from a long weekend break and just have to write a review on this hotel!!  We flew from Luton which we found a stressful airport and be warned if you get the early flight at 6.30am the ryanair check-in desk doesn't open till 4.30 so don't bother getting there early cos ur just hanging around waiting!!  Marrakech airport is nice and much more polite than I had expected no hassle from locals trying to grab your suitcase. Transfer was easy and quick. Then we arrived at the hotel which was truly amazing as soon as we walked into reception the very early start was all forgotten. It was the usual with the room not ready till 2 and we had a wrist band put straight on us our suitcase was taken to a room out the back and we were told to go get drinks chill and have some lunch while we waited. The hotel grounds are absolutely fantastic with lush established gardens all very well maintained. Plenty of sunbeds and areas to chill my favourite was up at the bar on the huge sofas all around the edge and a nice breeze to keep you cool. The staff were respectful helpful and attentive and we would like to thank them all for making our break so memorable. The food is superb fresh orange juice and omelettes made to order for breakfast tagines fresh fish fresh bread the list is endless. Drinks for lunch and dinner come either by the glass or a bottle of whatever is your preference. Personally a bottle of wine in an ice bucket and a bottle of lemonade or coke for the room to put in the fridge - excellent service!!  Recommend the quad biking out in the dessert being sold by a lad in the hotel and again excellent service and manners throughout.  Went to Marrakech square and my advice is be firm do not get into conversation with any of the many who are after your money just carry on walking if you are not interested.  The local currency is the dirham and you can only get it once you are in the country so bring pound coins for tips early in your stay be warned the hotel did run out of dirhams and we had to go into Marrakech square to get it changed and the place to go is Hotel Ali which fronts onto the square and doesn't charge commission.  Save some dirhams for the airport but be aware that the duty free shop does not take dirhams everything is priced in euros but they will take plastic.  Like I say we went for 4 days and the weather was amazing hitting mid 30's every day even the cloudy times were still scorchio!!  The rooms in the hotel are amazing 2 beds pushed together with very comfy mattresses big flat screen telly with a few English channels some with movies if you want a bit of private chill time sofa power shower and cleaned daily to a high standard.  You will be charged a city tax when you check out we paid just less than £10 for the 2 of us for 4 days.  Taxi to and from the airport is 100 dirhams which is about £7 they might charge 150 dirhams from the airport to the hotel but that's only £10 and a 10 min drive. Taxi to Marrakech square from 50 to 80 dirhams.  All in all a luxurious break for a quiet getaway where you will unwind the minute you walk through the door oh and if u want to go to Pacha that's just down the road I would guess a ten minute walk but it could be longer.

Confirmation said check-in was 2.00pm. We arrived about 1.45pm and at reception it said 2.30pm. Nice and very open area. On checking in we were told that the room was not ready. Asked to go for lunch and to come back at 3.00pm. Left out luggage in the lobby and went for lunch.    Came back after 3.00pm and were told to wait as they needed to check that the room was ready. It was an hour later that they advised us that we could go to our room. Asked why there was a long delay the receptionist didn't have an answer. Got to our room to find that there were no bat towels and that some of the pillows had no covers. Luckily a member of house keeping was nearby so I was able to arrange for this to be rectified.    Having an additional toilet is always good. Nice clean room. The beds were comfortable. Had a fridge so we could keep soft drinks & water cool. Bathroom was spacious.    Staff at reception didn't really smile whereas all the staff in the restaurant and pool area did so constantly. Very spacious surroundings. They had a kids club.    Good variety of food. You just had to make sure that you didn't arrive to late at the restaurant otherwise you would find that some of the dishes were not topped up. Delicious desserts.    The pool area was excellent. You could get towels against a refundable deposit. The pool bar was well stocked and the bar staff were very good.    Getting to the airport was easy as there are taxi's outside. Asked reception how much was the cost. They advise 100 DH. The driver asked for 150 DH but agreed to 100 DH. The drive around 10 minutes. You need to get to the airport at least 2 1/2 hours before as getting through immigration is a very slow process and disorganised.    Enjoyable stay.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkpuri
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jenniwelly wrote a review Sep 2015,30,Great if you want cheap family entertainment etc.,This '5 star' hotel is very impressive with huge 'Alice in Wonderland' size chairs at the entrance and a large air conditioned stylish reception. The hotel staff are first rate - polite friendly and helpful. If you want non stop entertainment/activities all day every day and plenty of pasta pizza and chips then this is the place for you!!  Unfortunately if you are looking for a relaxing holiday by the pool with quiet places to sit and 5 star food then you will be disappointed!  The facilities are very good. There are two really nice pools next to each other. A very large family pool with great water slides and lots going on all day either in it or by it. The other pool is a normal shaped pool with plenty of sun beds and parasols a gentle waterfall at one end and looks very relaxing. Both pools also have giant sun beds some with nice canopies over them. Unfortunately the 'animation' team run the disco music very loudly all day (not just whilst the aerobics/water polo etc are on) and the speakers are right between the pools so both get the music full blast!  The main restaurant offers a huge variety at breakfast lunch and dinner. Sadly the same variety at breakfast lunch and dinner! Every day every lunch and dinner they had a pasta bar and pizza various tagines and either some grilled meat or fish. The meat/fish was usually cooked till there was practically no moisture left. They claim to do a different theme each night but it was hard to tell really!! The Spanish night had a large pan of paella but the rest was the same and the Italian night had the same pasta and pizza bar as the every day offerings. The International night promoted roasted turkey but this didn't appear until 8.30pm and (you guessed it) was extremely dry and hard to swallow! One saving grace though - the desserts were plentiful and tasty. Lots of little patisserie fruit and ice cream on offer. Unfortunately the same most days at lunch and dinner.  The gourmet restaurant was very charming. You paid a surcharge for a set menu. The food was good and plentiful though you had no options to choose from.  The rooms are large plain and clean. The beds not too bad with firm mattresses. The pillows were wired! Long hard sponge lumpy things!! Showers were hot and powerful. We did have to hide the towels from housekeeping as she kept trying to change them every day!! We were trying to be ecological and use them more than once inline with the hotels request! It became a fun challenge in the end! She tried hard and left petals and flowers every day but one day the bath mat disappeared never to be seen again. Then one day two quilted mats turned up by the sides of the bed! My daughter had a daily battle in her room as the housekeeper kept rearranging all her things. My daughter would organise her toiletries etc in the bathroom and on the dresser only to return (to get ready for dinner) to find the housekeeper had not approved of her arrangements and reorganised it all again!  The Spa is nice - try the Hammam but find out what to do! I had no instructions and did it all wrong so was a bit of a waste.  The hotel runs a shuttle bus to the Medina but the last bus back was at 8.30pm. Not good if you want to see the Souk at night (pretty much a big part of going to Marrakech!)  Overall this is a fun family/young people's hotel. Loads to do all day eat and drink yourself silly. However as is often the case with All Inclusive hotels the food tends to be repetitive and boring and the drinks mostly alcohol with a splash of mixer! I can't fault how willing they are to give you as much food and drink as you can take! Despite other reviews we found the staff very friendly and try hard to please. However if you are looking for peace and quiet and are a foodie - beware!,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hemel Hempstead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenniwelly
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tineke wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Wonderful stay in the nice hotel with great animation team!,We stayed during 9 days in this nice hotel...    + Food: we really enjoyed the buffet with a wide range of culinary offerings that are sure to satisfy each and every guest  + Rooms: room were very clean and the cleaning staff was very friendly. Every day our room was decorated with fresh flowers.  + Swimming pool: was also very clean. There was a nice atmosphere around the swimming pool and we almost immediately met some nice people.  + Animation team: waaaauw they were really great! Big thanks to this lovely team they made Marrakech and Kenzi Agdal Medina to an unforgettable vacation! It seemed that they were also always around we were even wondering when they went to bed :-) Only 1 member of this animation team we did not really like. Nanou was always nagging why we didn't want to Aquagym or dance. When we said no she even had the guts to call us lazy... I am convinced that every tourist has to decide for himself if he wants an active holiday or not and there is nothing wrong about being lazy! She was also constantly gossiping about the other people of the animation team. We heard the same remarks on the bus who took us back to the airport...    But in general we really loved this hotel! And we want to come back next year!!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Zoe_and_Will wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Wonderful hotel!,We stayed here for 15 days in a deluxe double room. The deluxe rooms are in their own riad with a quiet pool none of the animation team are ever around this pool! The riad also has a waiter service for drinks and at lunch time they serve freshly cooked food from a menu much nicer food than in the main restaurant. The team of waiters and the waitress who work at this pool are all very polite and friendly!    The rooms are nice with good air con and comfortable beds and good powerful showers.    Food in the restaurant is ok if you choose the right dishes some dishes aren't very nice but every night there seems to be a select few dishes which are quite nice.    Entertainment is good just your usual all inclusive entertainment team who put on a singing/dancing show in the evening.    It really is worth paying extra to stay in the deluxe double rooms the pool is amazing and the staff are wonderful we are very happy that we decided to stay here and would definitely consider coming back!,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Clerkenwell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoe_and_Will
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Clem010 wrote a review Sep 2015,10,Sentimental Jewellery stolen by housekeeping staff,Unfortunately I had an incredibly bad experience at this hotel. On my 6th morning I went to the pool as usual leaving my room in what I thought was in safe hands to be cleaned by the housekeeping staff. I had left my jewellery in exactly the same place when I took it off each evening and as I left the room that morning I took note that it was all still there.    Neither me or my boyfriend entered the room till that evening as our key cards had stopped working. When I went to put my jewellery on that evening I noticed that a ring my grandma had bought me for my 21st also being my most expensive and beautiful piece I had left out had gone missing. Me and my boyfriend searched the room top to bottom but couldn't see it. As I knew it was there in the morning and no one had entered bar the housekeeping staff I knew it had been taken.    Feeling incredibly upset I went down to reception to report my problem I was told to take a seat and was waiting 45mins before anyone came to see me. Eventually a guest relations manager turned up who told me there was nothing he could do till the next day and with no apology I was told to come back at 11am the next day.    I arrived at 11am but was told the manager wouldn't be here till 12 as he was in a meeting so to come back. I arrived in reception at 12 and at 12.15 he turned up apologising that he had had a problem with his car so either him or the receptionist was lying to me about why he wasn't there at 11.    He then came to us to our room and asked us to search the room again as he watched. This in itself made me angry as why would we make such a serious complaint if we hadn't already searched the room? On top of this on arrival to the room that morning the security man found the door had been left open by the housekeeping staff. I was completely shocked at this as the staff were trying to blame us for leaving the door open which clearly wasn't possible as the staff were the last people in there. Do they honestly think we would be so stupid to leave the door open after having something taken from our room the day before? I felt like the staff had left it open on purpose so they could blame us for my ring going missing. By this point I was so angry and discussing by the way we were being treated.    The next thing that happened was that the cleaner was asked by the guest relations manager and she denied knowing anything about it. After that the only solution that the manager could offer me was to report it to the police as he was saying as the cleaner was denying it it wasn't their problem anymore. I couldn't believe this and as by now it was my last two days of my holiday I didn't want to spend part of it in a police station my insurance excess also doesn't cover the value of the ring so I wasn't going to benefit anything from reporting it and wasting my time with police.    I am honestly shocked by how I and the situation has been dealt with. The staff clearly are not prepared to take responsibility and I can't believe they can't guarantee the safety of your belongings. This along with a couple of problems we have had with staff including racism and discrimination towards English I am absolutely disgusted and will not be returning to this hotel.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clem010

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hotpeppasauce50 wrote a review Sep 2015,50,Amazing Kenzi Club Agdal Medina - luxury 5 star hotel in the heart of Marrekech,Superb hotel in the heart of Marrekech!    Well I really do not know where to start.... But I will by saying this hotel is wonderful the grounds the staff the food the ambience all excellent. The hotel is set in 11 acres of grounds well kept with lots of personal hotel architecture iron models etc... And they have a market once a week under the tunnel area which takes you to the Riads worth a look some nice traditional stalls. The kiddies club is in this area as well.    My two daughters and I just returned from a 6 night stay which we really did not want to end. The weather was hot hot air conditioning in the room was a welcome respite from the Morrocan heat but we loved the sun just the same.    Check in  Checking in was seamless not sure why other reviewers had a different experience but all went like clockwork for us. Of course our room was not going to be ready until 2pm which is normal. Everything was explained to us. Don't bother to take a towel as the hotel runs a towel service where you pay 150 Dirhams per towel as a deposit get given a towel card that you exchange for a towel each day either at the main pool (orange towels) or beige towels in our Riad area. You get your 150 dirham back when you check out with your towel card originally issued.    Hotel rooms  When we first arrived we were given a brown All Inclusive wristband which changed to a lilac colour as we had been upgraded to a Family suite In Riad la Roseraie (room 448) which let me tell you was draw dropping. Thank you soooo much Saaadia you made our holiday extra extra special thank you:) :)  The suite was so spacious two rooms large queen bed all for me in the main bedroom with my daughters having their 2 beds in the 1st room with their own patio door and toilet. The main bathroom was so spacious with two wash basins a bath with shower and a separate shower and toilet and bidet. There were two balconies one was like a sub with comfy cushions for us all to stretch out and relax on when we wanted and a table with 2 chairs to sit and have drinks/play cards whatever. All of their rooms whether double/triple deluxe are spacious from what I was shown so no worries about comfort they are all comfortable. There are 9 Road areas so luck of the draw where you get a room but the staff who drives golf buggies are happy to collect you and drop you back to your Riad - Otheman excellent guy and driver worth giving him a tip he is so pleasant happy and friendly.    Housekeeping  Rooms cleaned everyday by the wonderful and capable Salouia who left towel swans and decorated beds with rose petals felt so spoilt. Salouia you are amazing!!!!  And thank you Omar you are brilliant too.    Pools and food  Our room was in a newly refurbished Riad area (La Roseraie) with its own pool bang in the centre a bar service run by the wonderfully lovely Sumia and (Thank you you were brilliant) & a daily lunch service. Each morning before 12midday Sumia would come round to all of us fortunate enough to have rooms there and ask us to select from a starter (Caesar or mixed salad) a main (choice of Lemon Tanginess chicken Mixed Grill Spaghetti Bolognese Spaghetti Arriabbata Creme Fraiche with 3 mini fruit tartlets or fresh fruit salad as desserts. It was nice to go over to the Atlas restaurant and have lunch for a change some days but I much preferred the Riad lunch. The only fresh cocktail you could get where we were was a Mojito nice and refreshing but alcohol Was available too if you wanted it. Much thanks to Said and Sumia and the young chef who cooked our lunches. The towel guy and the lifeguard were nicer young men too.  After eating and sunbathing there I did not want to go to the main pool area which of course is quite noisy but that is to be expected with the animation team water slides and children. The main pool was lovely actually with plenty of sun beds large beds and large beds under cover with comfy cushions - great for families with kids to keep their little ones shaded. We did not try the slides but they looked great fun and were always busy when we walked to the snack bar to the right of the pool. You could get orange and lemon slashes there for the kids and this is where the late breakfast food - parties etc. where brought if you did not get to breaking by 10am.    Main restaurant  The Atlas restaurant is where most people ate breakfastlunch and dinner - inside the restaraunt or outside where you were served with tea coffee and juice just the same as Inside. There is plenty to choose from for breakfast freshly cooked pancakes fresh cooked Moroccan pastry - these were yom yom. Freshly cooked doughnuts fresh fruit fresh Danish pastries cereals fresh bread fried eggs Arabic baked beans (they are much bigger and taste different from English beans) tortillas freshly squeezed orange juice - yes fresh! Freshly cooked omelettes Yoghurts and much more to list here there is something for even the fussiest eater. Trust me.  Lunch & dinner time was a bit of a scram as some nationalities are not great at queuing but you get used to this. Again there are so many choices of food for lunch and fresh soups dinner beef lamb Tangine dishes (at least 4) fresh fried fish cooked steak Turkey freshly cooked pasta to your preference with your own choice of ingredients cous cous rice drinks on tap coke lemonade etc. the lovely waiters seat you get you a bottles of water still/sparkling lemon/orange fanta coke zero. Puddings were slices of all variations of gateau/cake fresh fruit plenty of ice cream for the kids and ice in the centre which was either brought to you in little buckets or you can help yourself (the soup bowls came in handy for ice for the table).  All in all for me there was more than enough choice for all adults and kids alike.  Extra Special thanks to Mustapha Imad and Yassin who looked after us excellently.    Onsite Farm  Pay a visit to the farm on site behind the water slides - it is a hidden treasure for young children with a pony goats sheep rabbits peacocks chickens turkeys ducks a swan pigeons all well kept and fed which was a pleasure to see. Take your own anti bacterial gel though as none available if your children pet the animals which is allowed.    Nightclub  You have free entry to the famous Pacha night club which is a 5 min drive in a free shuttle from the hotel up until 3am when you will then have to get yourself a taxi which only costs 50 dirhams to get you back. Don't get to Pacha before 1am it will be empty!    Medina/Souks a must Marrekech experience  The hotel operates a free shuttle service which goes on the hour outside the hotel to the right from 9.30am with the last shuttle from the hotel at 7.30pm and the last one back to the hotel at 8.30pm from the stop where you are dropped off. Please note that the shuttle bus does not drop you opposite the Medina/Souks but round the back so you will have to turn left and walk up the road and follow the crowd. If you miss the shuttle a taxi should only be 70 dirhams - do not pay anymore than that.  A trip to the Souks is worth the experience my daughters found evening visits a bit intimidating as all stall holders are trying to get you to come and see/buy their wares. Plenty of bargains. Don't get taken in by the Henna design ladies unless you mind black hair dye (not real henna I am afraid) looks good as they are great at it sprinkle glitter to make them look awesome but they will not last but nice if you fancy it. Plenty of stalls are selling Argan oil just beware some sellers have a version that is mixed with paraffin oil best way to check is to shake the bottle and if there are bubbles it is mixed. This version is ok but if you want 100% Argan oil expect to pay around 100 dirhams but barter them down to 80/70 dirhams. In fact barter for everything!!!  A trip to Gueliz is worth it too plenty of shops Carre Eden Mall Zara. You will need to take a taxi from the Medina 30 Dirhams and ask to go to Gueliz.    The O.Spa by Kenzi  I had a 50min full body massage at a cost of 500 dirhams (£35) by a lovely young lady called Kareema. The spa area is lovely calming and tranquil. I really enjoyed my massage. The Spa ladies come round with special deals so if you want to take advantage of one please don't think too much about one as they are snapped up really quickly.    Personal property  One piece of advice keep your iPads tablets phones etc. locked up in your safe and make sure you keep track of them at all times.  .  I could add more but I could write forever. If you need to know more please feel free to email me. I would add my video and pictures but my mobile has gone to heaven and is not working at the moment but when I do have access to them I will upload them.    Enjoy your holiday at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina we did!! As it is the best hotel I have been to in Marrekech. Cannot wait to go back sometime soon in the future.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Victoria F wrote a review Sep 2015,10,Really disappointed - food horrendous!,Booked to come here for my husbands 30th birthday. Really disappointed in every part of the stay. We arrived at hotel after the check in time but had to wait an extra 2 hours till our room was ready -complained at reception they were so so unhelpful it was awful they weren't friendly or helpful just very rude!  Clearly says everywhere that can't reserve sun beds - nobody follows that rule as we could not get a bed at all every one was reserved.  The room was average when we actually got in we had no towels though had to call reception 3 times to get any.  The food has to be the worst part by far!!! We stayed for 3 nights however on the 3rd night we couldn't eat anything at all the food was just terrible worst all inclusive hotel we have ever ever stayed in. Feel sick even thinking about the food now!  Overall would never ever return to this hotel ever was just awful.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaF958
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RiccardoVercesi wrote a review Sep 2015,30,"Only if you really need a pool, activities driven experience",The good: The pool was great. The staff. The bed.    The bad: All inclusive is really not all inclusive. No room service or food after 10:30pm. There were hands printed on the wall above our bed (!!!). Wi-Fi was very poor. Most activities were in French. Pool rules not enforced (balls diving etc). The food was not that good. Thematic dinners were low quality. The sushi was hideous.    The worst: My swimming trunks were ruined because someone left chlorine on the side of the pool and as I sat down it discoloured completely and destroyed them. I complained to the administration and they said they would take care of it and would compensate me somehow. After that I went back to the pool and for the next several hours nothing was done. Children playing around that same area. I left 3 days after and I was not compensated in any way or form.,Date of stay: September 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lisbon, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RiccardoVercesi

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,N Sharpe wrote a review Sep 2015,30,Average,First off this is a primarily French resort - although most of the staff speak some English it is not always easy and the majority of the guests speak French.    This is a nice resort with good facilities (pool tennis table tennis football gym spa cookery demonstrations) and all-inclusive options (breakfast lunch dinner morning & afternoon snacks and soft & alcoholic drinks). Everything is clean but it's nothing special.    The food is very samey for lunch and dinner there is the same spread of salads pizza/pasta grill and traditional moroccan stews. Breakfast is defrosted pastries and fruit. It is perfectly fine but gets boring very quickly.    The free trip to Marrakech was a nightmare. We sat on the hot coach for about 20-30 minutes before it decided to set off then it dropped us about half a mile from the centre of the 'old town' so we had to walk through a quiet park with what looked like homeless men washing themselves from hoses in the grass - it made us very uncomfortable. When we'd walked through the park there was a large interchange where lots of tourists were being dropped off from other hotels and tours which was a much more safe and comfortable area - I don't know why they didn't just drop us there. We spent a couple of hours walking around before we decided we wanted to go back to the hotel (it was very hot and there wasn't really anywhere to sit down for food or drink in the area we were in) but realised we hadn't been given a time or place to be collected from. We walked back through the park to where we'd been dropped off and waited about 20 minutes until the next shuttle arrived bringing people from the hotel and luckily could get on it to go back. Again it was uncomfortable as it was a quiet area and we were approached by many taxi drivers and sellers.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Njaysharpie

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,StrahilChristov wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Great honeymoon destination,"The hotel lies on beautiful grounds with two large swimming pools and one private pool for those staying in superior rooms. The hotel staff were very kind to upgrade us to the superior room for our honeymoon which allowed us to use the private pool. The private pool also gives you access to ""a la carte"" lunch which is great and it is served by the polite and helpful staff even if you are lying in the beds by the pool. The large pools have a programme with music and entertainment/games/sports all day long so if you are looking for a calm place definitely book the superior rooms with access to the private pool. There it's so serene and calm which is a contrast to the large pools giving you choice to both the chance to relax and read or participate in the activities of the animation team.  Overall all staff are very friendly sure it happens that they sometimes forget something but it's normal and all you need to do is ask again. Our cleaning lady Fatima was amazing decorating our bedroom and bathroom with incredible different designs of towel-swans and rose petals every day. The barmen are also always ready to provide you with drinks - the wine and the beer are quite good! Of course good service deserves tips which is not a must but it's recommended for well-deserved work.  The food is very good and the buffet offers good variety for a week but tends to repeat on a weekly basis (if you are staying for more than a week). There is a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables for breakfast/lunch/dinner and always at least 3-4 types of meat and 1-2 types of fish. The ""a la carte menu"" at the private pool is limited to about three choices of starter/main/desert each which are all very well prepared but did not change our entire stay (and I heard the menu doesn't change for months there although it's very nice). I guess the idea is that you would eat lunch there 2-3 times and go to the buffet lunch if you want variety.  After visiting a few other hotes in Marrakech I have not seen one with such beautiful grounds - the vegetation the flowers the gardens the palm trees and the sheer size of it all allowing you to walk around for a good 20-30 minutes. The hotel also offer a free return shuttle to Marrakech every hour or so. You can also go for the paid activities such as the buggy or camel rides near Marrakech offered in the hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JohnDC499 wrote a review Aug 2015,40,A great family hotel in Marrakech,The Kenzi Agdal Medina is a large modern hotel in a newer suburb of Marrakech. The hotel is clean and has beautifully manicured gardens. The rooms are large modern and well appointed.    We had an amazing stay in one riad with its own private pool and attentive staff for whom nothing was too much trouble. Our children enjoyed every moment of the stay and found plenty to do in the hotel.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Spalding, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnDC499
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SC499 wrote a review Aug 2015,50,Fantastic All Inclusive Hotel,Ignore any negative comments that you ever read about this hotel. It's amazing. The all inclusive was incredible. So many choices of food at every meal time. Absolutely everything is included drinks and food wise. We visited in August and it was incredibly hot. The hotel management are keen to keep their guests well and hydrated. Two litre bottles of water were issued freely - even at breakfast. The hotel is beautiful. The grounds are well cared for - beautiful flowering gardens. We were upgraded to one of the riads with a private pool which was just perfect for us. Our teenage kids enjoyed the main pool too where activities were taking place. Make sure you book a table at the a la carte restaurant one evening - a great Moroccan night out and very reasonably priced. The one true quality at the hotel is the staff. They were all great and very welcoming. The hotel guests are predominantly French however staff are keen to converse in English and they appreciate any French you may know. We tipped our evening waiter on day one and he ensured a table was ready for us each evening as it does get very busy in the restaurant. I could say so much more about this great hotel - but I'm not going to. Just trust me ...... Go to the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina - it's a great family all inclusive hotel in an amazing country.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Market Deeping, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SC499
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,PallyWally345 wrote a review Aug 2015,40,Nice hotel. Clean rooms.,The hotel is nice and clean. There is a bar by the pool but it is not a swim up bar so you have to get out. The rooms are clean and spacious. Only negative thing that we encountered was that it felt like the staff at the pool bar gave priority to french guests when ordering drinks. (Most other guests spoke french).  I must have been waiting for 10mins to order drinks as it was busy. The bar man saw me and told me to wait. After a while a french woman came and stood next to me. When the bar man was finally free he came and told me to wait a minute and took the french woman's order even though he knew I had been waiting since before the other woman even came! So i had to wait even longer. This only happened 2 times so wasn't a big issue but was very annoying. Apart from that the staff are generally helpful and welcoming.  There is a few water slides for the kids/adults to have fun. There is also table tennis football and other activities.  Overall i would recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PallyWally345

Bedrooms are spacious and clean with ensuite but shower over bath. Everything is very clean. Large restaurant which provides excellent meals with different themes every night. It is best to be earlier than later for meals as it gets very busy.  The pools get very busy with plenty of activities provided for all ages. Must be remembered that it is French speaking. Staff friendly and helpful and can speaking English.  It gets very hot during the day with heavy showers in the evening.  Hotel provides a free taxi to and from the Medina but the walk from taxi to and from the Medina is at least 1000metres which is very exhausting during the day. It is expensive there so bargain very hard. Had a very enjoyable holiday.,Date of stay: August 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graham945

The local wine was excellent. The pool area was very well laid out and plenty of sun beds available at all times. After dinner the entertainment was superb.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Shadwala wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Wonderful resort,This is a resort very close to the airport. 100 MAD for a taxi ride from the airport to the resort. We were two families with 4 adults and 4 children. The rooms were very nice. King size bed in one one room and twin beds in the other little room with its own wc. A/c was used all the time as it was peak summer. The cleaning crew were very good with prompt cleaning and providing towels. The pool was quite good. Slides for adults and kids and bigger pools for those wanting peace and quiet. The cabins were used quite a lot as it got very very hot in the afternoon. We went all inclusive as we knew we couldn't go out at lunchtime due to it being Ramadan. There was a good choice of food. My husband and I are vegetarians and we found adequate choices. There were Moroccan pastry for breakfast among other things. Not to be missed. Various tagines also not to be missed. There were some typical Moroccan desserts too though these used to get finished quite early on! Every evening there was some entertainment and there was theme for food like Asian Moroccan Spanish etc. The cocktails were average as the drinks were pre made and hence not cold enough and sometimes too sweet. I would recommend the Toukal white wine which when chilled was quite delicious. Kids had a fab time in the pools slides and with the food. There were mini club and sporting activities like beach volleyball table tennis tennis etc. The free shuttle into town is a 10 minute ride and works well. They drop and pick from near the koutobia mosque. All in all we had an excellent 5 day break.,Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shadwala
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Steve B wrote a review Jul 2015,30,Reception Really Lets This Place Down,"My girlfriend and i have just spent a week at Kenzi Club and it was a very nice experience. The grounds are nice the pools are very nice (very cold though) and there isn't anything in walking distance but there are plenty of taxis lurking outside ready to take you anywhere.    What really lets this place down is reception. Their attitude STINKS! If there is someone French behind you they'll begin to take less and less notice of you and prioritise them. When i booked a shuttle bus ride (which is free btw very good gesture) they gave me a ticket. So i waited in reception until the time required... waited a little longer..... then after 25 minutes asked reception if it was coming and i was fobbed off to a better english speaking receptionist who said ""were you waiting outside?"" I said i was stood in the doorway of reception and she replied ""Oh well you need to be outside and round the side of the hotel"".... When i asked why nobody had told me this when booking she just shrugged her shoulders and then served the next person.    When i wanted to change some money into dirhams they were reluctant to give me their time and didn't want to break notes down into smaller money (for tips and markets) which really wasn't helpful when they wont change a 200 dirham note!    Apart from the total lack of customer care from reception the rest of the hotel was brilliant. Bar staff and restaurant staff were very welcoming on hand all the time. The food was very good nice variation with some different foods on various days (although there is always pasta pizza and chips).    The rooms were very nice too. I would like to say more about excursions etc but we had booked to go on a camel ride but the tour company never bothered to collect us and it was too late to rearrange because we were leaving that afternoon. SO WORD OF ADVICE GET TOURS IN EARLY SO YOU CAN REARRANGE IF THEY FORGET YOU.    I feel 3 circles out of 5 is harsh but 4 out of 5 is too good. I came to Marrakech not knowing anything where anything is etc and tourists rely on reception (im a receptionist myself so know how people get) if i was rude i'd understand or even if i spoke a totally alien language i'd understand but i speak a little French but well spoken English and they just wouldn't give me the time of day. When all the girls are on together they all just smile and laugh at eachother while they are serving. There was one man on reception however who was outstanding made conversation and asked how my stay was nobody else did this and i came into contact with 5 receptionists during my weeks stay.    I would visit again only because i have a better understanding of the area etc now.    The wi-fi was fine for our stay - not sure what these comments are about no wi-fi",Date of stay: July 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Paignton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3671CDsteveb

Had lunch and went back to get rooms they up graded us all to a block that had its own swimming pool think it was because some of the group had been there before. The rooms were very good and the swimming pool was lovely they have waiter service for drinks ( which are not bad at all) etc also we found out on the last day they do a 3 course lunch service as well which was lovely but I must say it was very quiet there. The larger pools were more lively with lots of stuff going on The pool bar drinks are awful stick to beer and cokes in fact all drinks are not good in main areas we took our own duty free. The food is not bad with lots of choice and the wine was drinker able but 2 of us had moroccan belly!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,GetteSetterNYC wrote a review Jul 2015,40,5 Days was not long enough at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,We (a family of three) stayed for 5 nights at the Kenzi Club in a family room a one bedroom suite with 1.5 baths. The rooms are large with a king-size bed in the bedroom and 2 sleep sofas in the living area and two TVs. The main bathroom has a separate shower and bathtub along with two sinks. The rooms are very comfortable with plenty of storage space (mostly closet). Bath amenities includes: bar soap shampoo and shower gel.    The food is quite delicious (particularly the tagine which I had every day since the type of meat changed) especially for an all-inclusive hotel. The free wi-fi worked only in or near the lobby. There was a free prompt shuttle that went to the medina eight times each day (four times in the morning and four in the afternoon) making it super convenient to go into town. We ended up going into town almost everyday since it was so easy. There are 2 ATMs in the hotel though the exchange rate at the front desk was very favorable. There are plenty of activities throughout the day and we enjoyed the nightly entertainment. The animation team was awesome talented and a lot of fun! The hotel did cater to the French but all activities (including nightly shows) were announced in English as well! We had a blast on the water slides and found that there were a decent amount of chaises and sun beds poolside.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,New York,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GetteSetterNYC

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,EmilyHobbs2 wrote a review Jul 2015,30,"Honeymoon in January, proved to be disappointing",My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon in January for a week. The staff were friendly and accommodating we were met with our own guide on the first morning who helped to plan our week's activities.  The resort during this time was pretty quiet which was nice. We found that it was quite cold though our room especially as it received no sun during the day and the in built heater did very little. The pools were also a bit too cold to swim in even the heated pool.  We enjoyed the various free activities; archery cooking class sports equipment. But I assume since it was off-season there really wasn't much else on offer in terms of entertainment.  The location was okay about 10 min drive out from the centre of Marrakech. The free shuttle service they offered was helpful. The resort seemed to be in the middle of an unbuilt estate area. At one point my husband got quite sick and we had to walk to a pharmacy about 10 mins away it was in a very dingy area and felt quite unsafe.  The all you can eat buffet was immense but we quickly became bored with what was on offer. It seemed the same things were available every couple of days which over a week meant we ate a lot of the same things. My suggestion would be to eat out in Marrakech as much as possible!  We really did want to have a wonderful time at the resort for our honeymoon and we don't often have complaints when we go away but I think we were disappointed in the end. I wouldn't really recommend this as a great place to honeymoon particularly in January.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Caloundra, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilyHobbs2
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Leah240296 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Fantastic hotel with incredible staff,Me and my boyfriend spent a week at Kenzi club Agdal Medina and we were really happy with the standard of the hotel and the performance of the staff. The hotel exceeded expectations as I feel their website definitely undersells what is in store; the decor in the lobby upon first arrival is stunning very tasteful elegant yet modern Moroccan. The pool side isn't photographed to its potential on the website either with various cabanas and huge mattresses available to lay out on in the sun and plenty of umbrellas dotted around if you need some shade.  We were originally in a standard room which was lovely had plenty of space and a balcony area however due to a small incident that was quickly resolved and handled perfectly by the guest relations manager; we were moved to a suite which was wonderful huge bathroom large balcony area everything you could want really. On top of the facilities and rooms the staff were impeccable! Moncef who works in the restaurant at breakfast and lunch looked after us extremely well everyday of our stay going above and beyond to make our meals delightful. The food was also to my taste with lots to choose from and a lot that was authentic Moroccan. Finally I would like to thank the Animation team (in particular; Magic) for providing us with entertainment and activities around the pool everyday of our stay but without pushing us to get involved so there was no pressure at all if you just want to chill. You should sign up for Aqua biking and aqua aerobics with Magic if you get chance :) overall we had a fab week and would definitely recommend this gorgeous hotel!,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Stockton Heath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leah240296
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,UKPatsy wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Relaxing week,We are just back from a week here and it does not deserve the bad reviews.  Our first room 938 was not made up or cleaned and had a dark overgrown balcony so after phone calls back and forth we were moved to 210 a ground floor room which was not much better dark room and patio overlooking the back of the neighbouring riad.    A very helpful English speaking receptionist called Miriam said that if we would spend our first night there she would move us the following afternoon. We were moved to 442 in the Riad with the private pool.    The pools grounds etc were lovely and well looked after we used the rectangular pool which was almost adult only as there was no shallow end. The private pool at our Riad was too shady.    No problem with ants mosquitoes or cockroaches. Only saw on cockroach in the ladies rest room.    The food was good lots of choice maybe not enough meat but no-one would ever go hungry! The waiters were great we had no problems at all they were very helpful.    The wine was good as was the draught lager. The cocktails and spirits okay. I only discovered on my last night that they have other bottles behind the bar that are available but not listed on the menu e.g. a drink similar to Baileys.    The entertainment was okay as previously stated the girl singer was very good. Yes it's in French but 95% of the guests are French.    Our only complaints would be the charge for the in room safe not expected at an all inclusive hotel and the huge charge for a late check out.    We had asked if it was possible to keep our room for an extra two hours and was told no problem just ask the morning of departure. We asked about it to be told it would cost 800 dirhams about €80! We declined.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kim196060 wrote a review Jun 2015,40,4 nights in Marrakech,Hotel was lovely food was very good but choice would be limited if there for a longer holiday. Entertainment was designed for the French audience and didn't take into account that there were other nationalities. Some of the staff were lovely others not so friendly but if you tipped regularly they were more attentive. The trip that was included in our secret escapes package was excellent and we had a guide just for the four of us who took us to the cultural sites as well as the market places. Be aware in an all inclusive resort that on departure they charge you daily taxes for each day you are there it was only about £6 per couple but good to know it will be charged. The room we had was lovely and was in fact a suite with a room with sofa and TV and then a bedroom spacious bathroom with bath and shower & large balcony very nice.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,510christinew wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Wonderful relaxing break !,Booked a six night break for me and my husband last minute with Low cost holidays. Wanted a break somewhere sunny and decided on Morocco. We booked the shuttle bus from the airport and would recommend. We arrived and found our guy who was waiting by a sign board. He checked us off his list and we got in a people carrier with just another couple. On arrival at Kenzi Club the doorman came and took our cases and we went to reception and were handed two mint cooler drinks. Our room wasn't ready yet but we were given wrist bands and advised to go to the restaurant as breakfast was still being served. We had some food and drinks and decided to have a wander around the really beautifully kept grounds. We found the majority of the guests were French and all the staff speak French very well English not always so well. This wasn't a problem for us. It was so so hot that we decided to get our swimsuits on and enjoy the pool. There is a massive pool with a couple of water slides great for the kids. There is also a pool bar and another pool with loads of sunbeds and big double cabana beds for lounging around. The reception and grounds are spotless as is the rest of the resort. We went back to reception at about 4 to be told we had been upgraded to an adults only riad at the back with a private pool and butler service. We were taken to our room by golf buggy with our bags and shown our room. The room was spotless and lovely with a massive bed scattered with rose petals. As others have said flat screen tv. mini fridge with water and lovely bathroom and a small patio area at the back. We were there to relax and we like staying up late and getting up late too. So for this reason we never made it to breakast or lunch in the main dining room. We preferred to have lunch around our pool in the adults only riad rather then getting dressed and walking up to the main dining room. The butler would walk round our private pool every day about 11.30 with a menu for you to order lunch. Then between 12-3 you just dragged yourself off your sunbed and sat at the tables in the corner of the pool and lunch would be served. You could also have your lunch served on your sunbed or on your cabana. Absolutely perfect. In the evening we would walk down to the main dining room about 7.30 as we found if you got there later the waiters would be very stressed the busier the restaurant became. We gradually worked out which waiters were more efficient. Some seemed to forget that you asked for wine or water and trotted off to serve other people completely ignoring your requests. We found by tipping certain waiters in the restaurant and bar area a small tip of 150/200 dhs would guarantee you perfect service. They work extremely hard and probably don't earn a huge wage so they appreciate any tips. The food served in the evening could not be faulted to be honest. You will not go hungry in this hotel. They serve everything from soups salads of every kind several varieties of pizza several pastas fish meat various tagines rice couscous chips along with theme nights with sushi paella beef stirfry with pancake rolls the list is endless honestly something for everyone. You would be hardpressed not to find something you liked here. They are cleaning up all the time too. I did see a couple of cockroaches in the toilets of this restaurant but it is Africa and I have seen more in Tenerife to be fair. After dinner we would go to the bar where they had the entertainment team working their socks off. Although it is very geared to the French we were happy to sit and be entertained while enjoying a bottle of wine. They had a great female singer who performed most nights. There wasn't much around the hotel but they did provide a free shuttle bus to the medina which we took one day. When the bus dropped us off there were lots of guys offering to be guides and show you around don't bother they are not official guides. It is easy to find your way around the souks just keep your wits about you and look for the mosque tower to guide you in the right direction. Be prepared to haggle here and only stop to look at stuff you really want to buy as when you stop the traders will pounce! We only had one guy who was quite intimidating. But most are friendly and the bartering is done in good fun. We got a cab back to the hotel which cost 70 dhs about 5 pounds. But you take your life in your hands as they have no seat belts or if they do there is nothing to plug them into! The drivers weave in and out of the traffic with your heart in your mouth. It was lovely to get back to the peace and tranquility of the hotel! The staff at this hotel work so hard to keep this place looking immaculate. It is so clean and tidy and the gardens are huge and are immaculate and very pretty. They are watering the gardens at 11pm every night and washing down the patio areas and cleaning everything. To be honest this has to be one of the most relaxing holidays I have ever had. I would definitely go back as value for money and service it cannot be beaten had fabulous holiday just what we needed.,Date of stay: June 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Epping, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510christinew
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Wilson2812 wrote a review Jun 2015,50,This hotel is even better than it looks...,We stayed for a week from 20th July 2015 and from the moment we arrived we were well and truly looked after by all the staff. First impressions of this hotel were of the amazing artwork outside and in the reception area. We arrived about 8pm and were given wristbands to go and enjoy dinner which was a great selection of Italian buffet. The desserts were amazing and continued to be throughout our stay. Our rooms were ready for us and we were taken by a buggy to our rooms which were more than adequate. The rooms are all based in separate Riad styled buildings bringing some authenticity to the hotel.    Special mentions go to Monceff who more than looked after us at breakfast and lunch each day. He will do anything for you and treated us really well. Magic from the animation team was great we took part in his Aqua Bike and Aqua Gym lessons which were a great workout and he made them fun in his own special way.    Free shuttle buses to and from the Medina ran on time and were very efficient - only 10 minutes away from the hotel. The Moroccan a la carte restaurant is worth going to for £10 per person you are served an enormous amount of food and the entertainment was great. A small number of artisans sold authentic Moroccan goods on the Friday at really reasonable prices - some lower than haggling got us in the souks.    This is a French speaking hotel - you're in Morocco so they will speak French! Many of the staff speak some English and are always willing to help as much as they can. Try and speak a little French and the effort goes a long way. It was refreshing to experience a hotel/country which isn't largely catering for English speaking tourists.    Even on the negative side - it really wasn't too bad. When 2 of our party were locked in the gym 15 minutes before closing (long story) the hotel took great care of them from that moment on upgrading them to a suite free gym for their stay and constant attention. The only other thing I would suggest could be improved is the evening activity as it was quite laid back - could have been more going on as the hotel is away from any other nightlife.    In summary this hotel provided a relaxing entertaining customer friendly holiday with a great variety of food.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Amy J wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Excellent hotel,Me and my boyfriend arrived home a few weeks ago after staying here for a week. After reading some negative reviews I was slightly dubious but didn't expect much therefore we couldn't be let down!    We arrived at the hotel at around 11.30am and even though our rooms weren't ready as check in isn't until 2.30 the staff in reception provided us with drinks stored our luggage for us and gave us our wristbands so we could go explore. We were both shocked how beautiful the hotel and the grounds surrounding it are it is incredibly clean and well looked after and throughout our stay we noticed how hard all the staff worked to keep it this way gardeners were still around even at 10pm!    Even though it is a predominately French speaking hotel we found that majority of the staff spoke very good English. After walking around the grounds we went and grabbed some lunch and even though I am incredibly fussy eater I didn't go hungry once. The selection of food is enormous. Breakfasts consisted of fresh cooked omelettes fried potatoes onions sausages and fried eggs or if you were after something else they had Moroccan style pancakes (which I had every morning!) with honey and sugar various breads and pastries fresh cakes and a huge selection of fruit yoghurt and cereal. I have to say how friendly and polite the table staff are outside and they really could not do enough for you. Lunch times consisted of salads pizzas fruit cakes breads cheese and hams amongst other things and dinner times each night was themed serving a huge selection of food and deserts. The waiting staff also bring you your drinks to the table but instead of just a glass of whatever you are after (soft drinks water juice wines etc) they bring the whole bottle!    We went back to the reception after lunch to which we were given our room keys and taken to our room which the member of staff insisted on carrying our bags to our room which was lovely. We were staying in a private riad which had its own private swimming pool exclusively for the people staying in that block of sorts it was incredibly peaceful with poolside service which included them giving you a menu which you could select your lunch from. The pool was cold but it was lovely considering the heat. All of the pools (they have another 3!) were very clean and well maintained.    Our room was spacious with a queen size bed TV plenty of storage and a large clean bathroom. Several toiletries are supplied which smelt exactly like the reception of the hotel! The room was very clean and had a mini fridge which was restocked with bottled water every day our towels were also changed everyday if needed. Very soft bedding which I really wanted to bring home with me!    The hotel had a huge range of activities for children or adults such as a driving range 2 full size tennis courts volleyball football pitch a basketball court a small petting zoo of sorts with a very friendly horse goats sheep chickens peacocks and rabbits all which seemed to be very well looked after and clean! Also a small children's playground which again was well kept.    Location wise it is in the middle of nowhere and not within walking distance but a free bus into the souks which needs to be pre booked the day before (where the bus drops you aloft of people loiter around the bus to offer tours just a polite no thank you and they do respect this and leave you alone. Walk directly through the park and left to the markets). Taxis are also outside the hotel at all hours don't make the mistake we did and to visit the mall as although it looks open it actually has no shops inside yet! Leading to a very confused taxi driver as to why we wanted to go! Unsure of the opening dates yet.    Wifi can be picked up albeit very patchy but we didn't go on holiday to spend all our time on our phones.    Overall we paid around £400 each including flights for a week and I would definitely have paid more. We have recommend it to everyone so far and would love to go back in the future. If you are after 5 star then pay for 5 star remember ratings are different in every country.

Pros  Gorgeous grounds  Spa with gym on site  Good varied foods (healthy and junk food options)  Clean pools  Daily activities  Large attractive rooms  Close to marrakech with shuttle if needed.    Cons  Preferential treatment to French/French speakers. Waiting Staff were notably cool with us English and reception are not overly helpful.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,madie09 wrote a review Jun 2015,20,Nice hotel shame about the staff,"We stayed at the hotel for a short break booked with Secret Escape. It was advertised as a ""spa hotel"" and that's what we thought we were getting. WRONG. We have stayed at spa resorts before and all indoor pool sauna and steam room have been included. Not here. We went for a 10 min swim in the indoor pool and were charged for a whole day spa. The sauna and steam room are extra. They don't tell you this until you check out. We questioned it with the hotel manager and he said if we didn't pay that they wouldn't release out luggage.    The reception and spa staff give this hotel such a bad name if you reed the reviews it's such a shame. In our deal we had a complimentary meal at the a la carte restaurant. We gave the reception the voucher...... And they refused to give it    On a positive note the restaurant staff and bar staff can't do enough to help you. The food is excellent and plenty of it.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,nickygUk wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Take no notice of the bad reviews - they are wrong!,Firstly anyone who gives this hotel a bad review is too fussy for their own good. Yes this is a 5 star hotel and no it isn't faultless but it's bloody good and people should just get over themselves and appreciate how great this hotel is compared to a lot of other all inclusive hotels.    The grounds are beautiful. And well-kept. There were gardeners tending to the grounds every day and they are doing a great job. The reception area is your first impression when you arrive and it is clean it smells lovely you are greeted by friendly staff (who do speak English by the way so ignore anyone who says they don't) offered a refreshing drink checked in with no trouble at all before your bags are taken to your room for you on a golf cart which gives you a chance to get your bearings as well. Perfect so far!    The pools are really clean. There are plentiful sunbeds including shaded big double mattresses lots of umbrellas olive trees etc for shade or full sun areas if you prefer. All well in reach of the pool bar which is open from 10am until 6pm and which is staffed by a friendly team (who again all speak English - although I think they appreciate an effort to converse in French). There are clean wcs near the pool area and water coolers scattered around. You really couldn't ask for more.    The rooms are big and clean. The housekeeping does tend to happen at different times but who cares as long as it's done?! The mini bar isn't stocked but you are given bottles of water coke wine or lemonade at meals so you really don't lack anything to drink (not to mention the bars being open most of the day and night). The towels are changed daily.    The restaurant is large and airy and there is a large outdoor seated area if you prefer to sit outside. It does get busy and the waiters did look a bit over-stretched at times but we found them to be helpful and friendly and I'm not so precious I can't get out of my seat to get a drink or a glass if I need one. You are offered wines by the glass or bottle as much as you like beer bottled coke zero or Schweppes lemonade still and sparkling water at every meal. The food is plentiful and is all fresh. There is plenty of choice with at least four pastas three pizzas three tagines eight salads plus every other salad item you could want chips grilled meat and fish couscous rice goodness knows how many cakes and pastries and fresh fruit at every meal. And then there is always something else depending on the theme. Seriously if you can't find something you like at each meal you are too fussy to eat out and should stick to the usual takeaways and ready meals at home. Breakfast in particular is very impressive. Where else do you find freshly pressed carrot cucumber orange multivitamin juices every morning and freshly made almond milk as an alternative to cow's? Not to mention all the bread pastries doughnuts crepes cold meats and cooked items you could possibly want.    There is a free shuttle bus to and from the medina several times a day which you have to book at reception. This is a poor country so you would expect to get a bit hassled by the locals who rely on tourism as their living but if you politely say no thanks or no merci they leave you alone. All you need to do is download a map of the souks if you feel you need one or just go with the flow. You will always find yourself back in the main square and you just head towards the mosque to get back to the bus. You can't miss it as the tower is the tallest point in the city. If you don't want to haggle just go to the artisan ensemble near the mosque where everything is fixed price and locally made and you get no hassle at all. There is also a clean wc there which you pay 5DH to use.    The only downside of the hotel is that the rooms can be noisy depending on how considerate your neighbours are. If someone decides to move their furniture around in the middle of the night the whole corridor hears them. This is a problem in hotels without carpeted floors and is down to inconsiderate guests rather than the hotel. The tv does only have a few English channels but we don't go on holiday to watch tv. If you want to catch up with the news you can but if you want Eastenders you're out of luck. You could probably catch the Arabic version though!    It is hot but it's North Africa. Everything is air conditioned and there are plenty of shaded areas but it is still hot. Surely you expect that if you travel to Africa. There are flies but there aren't swarms of them. We had no problem with bugs in our room at all. It is just that there are some flies if you eat outside but you would expect that.    I would recommend booking a private transfer from the airport before you arrive. The service is excellent. There is no hanging around and it takes the stress away from looking for a taxi and haggling over a price. They expect you when you arrive take you straight to the car and you're off. Coming back our driver was early which was actually a bonus meaning no waiting around and no queue when we reached the airport.    All in all this hotel is excellent value and you should have a wonderful time here. We spent a week here getting home early this morning and I would go back in a heartbeat.

We were a party of six and from the moment we arrived the hotel could not do enough for us. The rooms were clean and well appointed. The gardens and facilities were excellent and very well kept. You alway saw the gardens being looked after and the grounds constantly cleaned. The food was excellent and such a large choice pizzas made to order a grill huge salad bar pasta to order and various tagines. All cleared away after every meal time and new foods put out for next meal time (very unusual for AI) the daily activities were varied and free of charge with very good staff always happy and cheerful especially Spider and Magic. Activities include aqua aerobics archery rifle shooting yoga and dance lessons. The evening entertainment was varied and well put together showing the entertainment teams talents various local artists also were invited so you had the experience of Morocco.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Nige wrote a review Jun 2015,50,Puts the Icing on Top of a Fantastic Marrakech Experience,"Firstly if your arrival is due before midday make sure that you have a change of clothes and sun block within easy reach in your bags as rooms are not normally available before 13.00. Book in with reception where they'll give you your 'All Inclusive Bracelet' change in the left luggage area or the toilets have a walk round the complex to get your bearings and retire to the pools and the pool bar.  This was my fourth visit to this fabulous city (I used to live in Gibraltar) but my wife's first. We found this four day / three night break in the national press in March and the hotel and the reviews looked so impressive I booked it.  We were not disappointed!  The service overall is second to none. Our room was spotless very comfortable with very efficient air conditioning. A refrigerator is standard and handy for keeping bottles of water chilled.  The food is some of the best I have experienced at any all-inclusive hotel. The choice is vast so before you make your choice have a good look around first. Don't always expect to find accompaniments to be where you would normally expect them - the cold milk for the English tea is normally in the opposite corner next to the cereal and one evening I found the gravy next to the couscous! Assistance from the restaurant staff can be a bit difficult to get during the busiest periods but a table nearer the central service station normally helps.  The hotel mainly caterers for the French a few Germans and we Brits coming in third. The staff's English is generally quite good though a working knowledge of French (and a bit of Arabic!) is handy.  There is a free shuttle bus into the city at times displayed at reception but it is necessary to reserve a place the day before. If you use this you will be pounced on by guides to show you the city who say they are the hotel's official guides - they're not! Though they the city official guides and will display ID. Nevertheless if you want them to show you the Souks and the best sights it'll cost you around MAD300 for two to three hours. Be firm though. If you don't want to buy a carpet or leather goods tell them and do not be afraid to say ""No"" and walk on. And DO NOT pay them until the end of the visit.  Overall a fantastic short break only made perfect by this wonderful hotel.  To all the staff at the Agdal Medina ""Thank you!""

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Woody11354 wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Above average would revisit,"This was our first time in Marrakech and I would certainly go again.    We arrived at the hotel 15 minutes from the airport 15 minutes from Airport after paying 200 Dirhams.    Once out the taxi the bell boys took our bags and we were greeted with a nice Mint cooler drink.    Check in took 20 minutes and unexpectedly we got our room upgraded to the adult pool section.  At this part of the hotel you got waiter service all day at the pool but the only let down was that it was a ""quiet"" area and I mean really ""quiet""    We spent some time here and also at the large square pool next to the bar in the main area.    Food was plentiful but average you will not go hungry. It's just your normal buffet restaurant nothing more nothing less.    Entertainment was on all day and night mainly catering to French. This didn't bother us too much as the guests were nice as well as the entertainment staff.    Rooms where spotless large and very nice- no complaint there at all.    Hotel staff very friendly. The hotel had a small petting Zoo sports area pool slides so great for families also.    Marrakech centre(Madina) itself it's absolutely wonderful. It's like a step back in time. We went to Kasbar restaurant to watch the sun go down. This is a rooftop restaurant decored with a dark Morrocan theme throughout and the cost for a bottle of wine with 2 course meal each is around £30 including tip.    Outside on the streets is something else.... Completely buzzing at 11pm with locals and tourists.... Just sit at a bar on the Road and people watch.    The Market (square) can seem intimidating but it's just the way the locals are ... Don't take a pic of anyone specific or they will want money and don't shake their hands it's a sure way to get you in a shop. But in general the locals are very friendly and are in the most part very polite.    I would certainly go to the hotel and location again.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jen D wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Almost a 5 star,Fantastic large quadruple room although the room is supposed to cater for 4 adults the the two extra beds are very uncomfortable sofa beds.    Brilliant Animation team especially Magic & Spider!  Food was great lots of variety although No pool snacks you had to go into restaurant to have lunch. Waiters in restaurant took ages to get you a drink and many things missing from table ie: glasses and cutlery.    No tea and coffee in rooms which was a real pain when the rooms are quite far from bar and restaurant.  Pool bar closed at 6.30 pm which is a bit early when sun still shining and sat by pool. Staff at the pool bar were brilliant worked very hard and super fast service.    Did have a few cockroaches in bathroom a few nights in a row and our room was upstairs!    Room was a little bit tired mirror in bathroom was very worn and marked. Cleaner came very late in the day bit of a problem when it rains and you need to get back in room.    The whole hotel is more inviting for French people. All staff speak better French and staff seemed more helpful towards the French people.    The grounds of the hotel and the buildings were beautiful and very well maintained.    We had a later flight so asked reception for a room to shower was told by three different staff totally different times to come back. I think it would be easier to make a booking and stick to times. Also I asked if towels would be provided in shower room and was told yes however no towels were provided!    It is a lovely hotel and it was a fabulous holiday and if the hotel made a few changes it would war rent a 5* rating.

The hotel grounds is huge and well maintained with lots of activities and 2 huge pools and slides.  We got an upgrade to riad romaire which had its own private pool and chef. The room was nice and clean and we were able to get wifi every where although it meant you had to keep reconnecting.    The dining area is very big and you can also choose to dine outside. The buffet had a wide variety of food so even the fussy eater should find something here. I personally enjoyed the tagine dishes and couscous.  We used the shuttle into town one day and another day we paid 350 dirham for 4 hours to visit the main sites.  Yes most of the guests are French and most of the entertainment was in French but that didn't bother us at all. We found the staff to be friendly and polite especially the waiters.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hleskogar wrote a review May 2015,50,Delightfully Different,I and my husband visited Kenzi Club Agdal Medina for four days in April 2015. The hotel is five years old and very modern but at the same time in a traditional Moroccan style. The hotel is consisting of lowrising buildings around a beautiful garden in a riad style. The decor is very special and different from many international hotels that look the same wherever they are in the world.  We had a room in the Riad La Roseraie with a view to the Atlas mountains. There are about five minutes walk trough the garden to the restaurant and the reception. The garden is well kept with wonderful roses as well as other plants.  We were on all inclusive basis the food was really good and also the wine a bottled Moroccan wine.  The service at the restaurantsthe housekeeping and in the reception was excellent.  At the swimming pool there seemed to be quite a lot of activities during the day for children and adults. As we preferred the quiet swimming pool at the Riad La Roseraie we did only participate in two cooking lessons at noon which we found very enjoyable. Also there was evening entertainment for young and old.    For us an elderly couple this was a short but very pleasant stay and we also noticed that families with children and young teenagers seemed to have a great time.    Tips: To use the hammam you have to bring your swimsuit/trunks as there are not separate areas for women and men. Also if there are some extras included in your tour like a la carte menu or hammam you should take a spare copy of your voucher to avoid being charged for extra cost at the reception.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hleskogar
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,James H wrote a review May 2015,30,Disappointing - not what I would expect from an all inclusive hotel,A bit late with this review ... we stayed at the end of March when the weather was pretty wet and limited our time outdoors so really depended on the hotel facilities as there is nothing close by. And by nothing I mean nothing at all!  Check in took ages not sure why but after a long day's travel it's the last thing we need. English spoken widely in the hotel but everything is geared to French.  Rooms are nice but have no tea/coffee facilities which is annoying given the distance they are from the hotel bar and restaurant. Beds are pretty hard but not uncomfortable. We did come back to a giant cockroach one night which was a bit off putting! Rooms were cleaned daily at random times through the week.  Restaurant serves pretty much the same each day with small themed variations after a week is becomes a very monotonous. The bar is an awful place cheap alcohol and no atmosphere. The Moroccan dinner experience is not bad and worth trying for the small additional cost.  The pool areas are pleasant enough and but has non-stop piped music so take your ipod. The pool bar is pretty good and the staff very friendly.  The Spa is great - best experience of the whole week and very reasonably priced.  Overall just a big disappointment - next time will try a Riad!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sheryl P wrote a review May 2015,50,Girlie long weekend,Where do I start........ From the moment we arrived at this hotel the service received was impeccable. The staff were welcoming and extremely attentive when we arrived our rooms were not ready as we were before the check in but this was not a problem our luggage was stored and sent to our rooms whilst we enjoyed lunch in the sun. The rooms were lovely and clean and the grounds very well maintained.    There were three swimming pools one which had the flumes in and you paid a deposit for your towel and changed the towel when it was wet for a clean one. Upon leaving the hotel you just returned your towel and received your deposit back.    There were two restaurants the main one which was a buffet style and catered for all taste. The food was amazing and plentiful. The only issue we had was that we booked a la carte for our last night only to find out that this wasn't included in the all inclusive package and was a set menu. This was not a problem as we merely cancelled the reservation and returned to the original restaurant.    Staff remembered what you had to drink and where you liked to sit. They were attentive at all times and very helpful.    We wanted to book a couple of trips and had not seen our rep this wasn't a problem as the hotel sorted it all out for us and even advised that we were better having a guide if visiting the souks. Our guide was knowledgeable about the local history and culture which made our trip beneficial.    Entertainment was good and there was something for everyone. This hotel is definitely somewhere that I would return to. Was very impressed with the overall service.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/924sherylp
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mr_RichardR wrote a review May 2015,10,Very Disappointing- never again! :(,This was a disappointing holiday overall. Considering the money we spent and the rating this hotel had we will never go back there. All inclusive yes quality of food very poor and often cold. Limited selection and clearly on a shoe string budget.    Dirty cutlery and glasses on many occasions and staff found it a chore to help you. My wife asked for a glass and the waiter took a used one from his work station that had been collected the table next to us that he had just cleared. Its not surprising that there was a severe food poisoning out break a few weeks before we arrived    The grounds and surroundings make up for all the other small things that make a big difference and its obvious the Hotel is trying to claw back on profits. - Mini bar - empty- only one set of towels per room which means that its changed mid day and you have to wait until its all cleaned etc before you can use it- Not so good if you want to go out mid afternoon and there are no towels to dry yourself off! ( they are being laundered)    No tea and coffee making facilities in the room.- annoying    Temperature controlled pool ?? freezing to the point where no body was in it including Kids.    Some of the staff were antagonistic and quite aggressive    Maintenance in the rooms was poor    Taxis ( parked in the grounds of the hotels) were very aggressive and worked together having their own cartel to charge you as much as they want knowing you are out of town.    Tourist leaders hassling you the minute you walk out of the hotel doors( still in the hotel grounds) pushing you to take their guided tours around the town.    Finally young local men in their early twenties walking slowly round the hotel grounds looking highly suspicious. I'm not going to say anything more but do not talk to them even if they want to tell you about their university experiences .

Outside the walls of the hotel the area is semi derelict and you are some 4 miles from the centre of Marrakech. There is nothing to do in the area at all. There is a free shuttle bus which goes into the city and needs to be booked the day before. Safes should not really have to be paid for at an all-inclusive hotel.  The hotel setting is lovely with mature olive hibiscus and other trees making a 'garden-type' division between each of the blocks. The rooms are spacious and comfortable if a little 'tired'. Due to the size of the hotel it was impossible for the quality of the food to be 5 star but it was good and there is a large choice available. Flies are a problem in the dining room. There are also wild birds in there flying around and perching on the lampshades looking for scraps!  The staff generally were excellent. They were very friendly and would help in whatever way they could. If you speak French it is a definite advantage. About 90% of the guests were French.  The pools are well kept and there are plenty of good sun beds however the usual problem of towels on beds was evident especially those under the umbrellas! The notices saying the reservation of beds was not allowed was totally ignored! The pool bar was superb and the staff there outstanding! Lots of activities were going on during the day in the pool area especially for children. The related non-stop music and commentary was very loud and the speakers made sure the entire hotel could hear it! It was not the place for a nap on a sunbed!  There was regular evening entertainment at the outside theatre close to the pool. The only bar is a few yards away so again peace and quiet is impossible. There should really be another bar away from the entertainment area. Drinks were all non-branded in nature as expected but bottles of Schweppes tonic and bitter lemon were used. Cocktails were all made up to order. The local wine was surprisingly good although I only tried the white.  This hotel is good but not 5 star. If you are over 50 and looking for a peaceful holiday it is not for you! If you have young children then it is probably very good. The entertainment staff were brilliant with the children.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevors322

They charge you use the safes in the rooms. Housekeeping was very hit & miss. Rooms basic but sufficient for a short stay. All inclusive and the food was very good. Entertainment every evening again hit & miss. More suited to young families than couples. All that said we did enjoy it just that with a few small tweaks could have been so much better. Most staff very helpful & friendly but you really need to speak French.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShirleyW58
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Rah212 wrote a review May 2015,40,A nice hotel,I was here from 11th April -18th April with my mum. We were lucky enough to have use of the smaller pool two metres from our room and there were never more than six people at a time. I cannot fault the service of the staff serving us our drinks and food around this pool. They were attentive and constantly moving umbrellas to cater for people who were getting too hot. The pool is also heated which was lovely. We did not use the other pools (only because we didn’t need to). The food did get repetitive but I always find this in AI. I am quite picky when it comes to what meat I eat but there was normally chicken or beef most nights. The staff were really attentive and friendly. I cannot fault the staff at all.  Bottles of wine were endless at lunchtime and dinner time and it tasted really nice. We would share a bottle (or two) with dinner and then take one back to the room with us. We could always get a bottle of water to take back to the room to keep in our fridge overnight.  There was a bar by the two pools where you get a cocktail which were ok.  We had twin beds and every day the maids would push them together and place rose petals and towels made out of swans which was a beautiful touch and lovely for a couple but not for us (mum and daughter) so we just had to keep pulling the beds apart again but not a big problem.  I cannot comment too much on the evening entertainment as this is not my scene and I try to avoid the usual “karaoke” style entertainment where I can.  The receptionist kindly let us use the computer in the back office to print off our boarding passes  Things to consider when booking this hotel (not necessarily bad)  • There is a Moroccan themed restaurant but you have to book a day before which we didn’t realise and it was our last day so cannot comment on the food here.  • We did do an excursion to the Atlas Mountains one day which was nice but other than that there was nothing to do here apart from sunbathe by the pool.  • The rooms are very noisy we could hear people walking across the floor and opening their patio doors  • Balconies were very open and I felt like I was sharing with the neighbours  • Wifi is hit and miss.... you may get it for a couple of seconds one day and then the next for an hour or so... It made no difference where you were within the grounds  • Cats were always there at meal times (we didn’t mind we fed them and quite frankly wanted to bring them home) but if you don’t like cats or like them around you while eating this could be a problem  • The taxi from the airport ripped us off but we were tired and couldn’t be bothered to argue. This has nothing to do with the hotel though  Would I stay here again? Probably not but only because there is nothing to do in the area.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Aylesbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rah212

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RPNicholson wrote a review May 2015,40,"Great Hotel, helps if you can speak French though!",This was my girlfriend and I's first holiday together and on the whole we really enjoyed it. The staff are great and work really hard. Very friendly. We checked in and had to wait around for our room to be ready. We were met by a man from their welcome committee who told us about excursions which we booked. They gave us our wristbands as we were staying all inclusive and we had a walk around the grounds of the hotel. This was nice but we were pretty tired after setting off from home at 1am and driving to London to get our flight so when we got to our room we noticed quite a few flight and a swarm of ants so asked if we could change rooms. The housekeeping staff came in and straightaway got as another room and a bottle of wine. There are two pools a large one with water slides and smaller one that is more like an actual swimming pool which we spent our time sat around. All the entertainment is in French so if you want to join it it helps if you can speak it. It didn't bother either of us as we just wanted to relax anyway. My girlfriend used the spa for a massage which cost around £20 which she really enjoyed. The gym costs 80 dirhams a day to use which is about £5. The food was nice. They have different themed nights each day from Spanish food to sushi throughout the week. The grounds are really nice to walk around especially at night.    On the whole I would recommend this hotel. We went in May when the temperature was around 40 degrees C. There were quite a few families there with their children but it wasn't like a kids club. Helps if you can speak some French as all the announcements are in French. Very friendly staff.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,travelaslongasican wrote a review May 2015,30,Spoilt by a few things,I would give this hotel a very good rating but for a few things the last of which left an overriding nasty taste. We had checked out in the morning but then left our luggage and were given a room in which to shower before leaving for a late flight. Our taxi was waiting for us. We had started to take our luggage out when some officials from the hotel said we needed tickets for the luggage but we hadn't been given any. They kept saying they needed tickets and even when I produced my receipt for payment of the final bill they kept trying to hold our luggage. As nothing had been explained to us in the end we just dragged our luggage off them in order to catch our flight  I also had a fall in the steam room. I was ushered into a dark steamy place that has a couple of steps down to it so BEWARE if you go there as because I don't speak Arabic or French I wasn't warned.  I knew that French was the main language of the entertainers but it really was all geared to the French one evening there seemed to be some sort of quiz but we really didn't have a clue what was going on.  Food was good but we don't like sickly sweet puddings and it would seem a lot of other people don't either as one evening there were cheeses available that attracted people like bees round honey. When we asked if there was any cheese an other night we were told only on Saturday !  If taking an adapter be aware that it needs to be a round 2 pin that allows for the 3rd pin fixed in the wall socket to push into the adapter a normal 2 pin adapter is no good.  We had a bit of a problem with some very large cockroaches in our room which were dealt with by putting a glass over them then sliding the laminated TV channel card under the glass and flushing the cockroaches down the toilet.  The plug in the basin kept sticking so in the end we asked them to take the plug out  The hotel has 2 pools so it would have been nice if the standard pool was kept for adults only. I can only assume that the French don't have a problem taking their children out of school!  There wasn't anywhere with shade during the day that you could sit and have a quiet drink.  Sounds as though I'm moaning but these were all of the things that would stop us ever visiting again.,Date of stay: May 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelaslongasican
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Safferboy wrote a review May 2015,40,Great all-inclusive hotel,We stayed here as a family based on the resort being all-inclusive. It's rather large and spacious with decent rooms. The grounds are well kept and pleasant to walk around in. Swimming pool decent too although in January it was a little chilly to swim. Some reports have criticised the all inclusive dinners. They are in fact really good with lots of variety drinks that are always topped up and really pleasant staff. I'd rate this hotel as great value and would definitely recommend it for anyone visiting Marrakech. I'd placed a request for double room as I was going away with my mother for mom-son time away and we got towelled-swans and rose petals on the king size bed the night we arrived. Interesting and we had a good laugh. Nice touch guys ! The couch was comfortable anyway 😆,Date of stay: January 2015,,"Jensen Beach, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Safferboy
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kev B wrote a review May 2015,50,"5* hotel with 4* service, nothing to complain about",Writing this review a little after time so I will keep it short and highlight only those things which stuck in my mind.    The Hotel is quite a distance from the centre maybe 8 minutes by taxi from the main square although once there they offer a free transfer service at regular times which you can book at reception.    Upon arrival I was amazed by the hotel It certainly looked like the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The entrance was large and ornate with great lighting and even large blocks of sandalwood burning and sending up columns of incense to welcome the guests. We entered a large foyer and tried to check in as we were arriving late into the evening food service and were eager not to miss the meal as we had been travelling all day.    We were seen right away and then were told to sit and wait for someone to take us to our room this seemed to take forever and we had to ask several times if we could just walk to our room but we were told again to wait; For some reason they wished to take us to the room on a golf buggy. Once on the buggy the short and unnecessary ride to the room was fast and actually very pretty the grounds and the rooms flying past were very nice. I certainly felt out of place with a back-pack and a 2-week-old shaggy travellers beard rather than a suit and suitcase.    The room was amazing - we had booked a twin and the room had 2 double beds which after 2 weeks of hostelling were absolute bliss. The room was well appointed with television en suite and generally high standard of décor and repair.    The dining hall was a mixed bag the food was all perfectly fine (compared to other Marrakesh hotels) although they pull a large room divider over the food area at or near the end of service effectively cutting you off. This seemed a bit brutal and unnecessary. the whole dining hall was cafeteria style (although with wine waiters) and was obviously geared to getting people in through and out as soon as possible.    Next stop was the bar and past another plume of incense en route. The bar was like the large room of a labour-club with forced entertainment think holiday camp although the staff were all enthusiastic and seemed genuinely enjoying their work.    Drinks on the all inclusive were all of average/acceptable quality.    We noticed that the large pools looked very clean and well maintained on our walk back through more of the lovely grounds to our room. finally upon leaving we were able to take advantage of the free transfer and get a lift to the square for free to relax and make our way to the airport.    Owing to making an online booking I seemed to have booked our room at a considerably lower price than most other guests I spoke to. Maybe something to check thoroughly before you book. I would return to this hotel.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"St Helens, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevanY_12

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Cymru33 wrote a review May 2015,40,"Great hotel, great staff too many kids!!!!",We stayed here for 11 nights and thought we were clever by avoiding the easter holidays in the UK only to arrive in the middle of the French holidays which run from middle of April to the 10th of May and the hotel is predominantly occupied by the French. We stayed in the newly converted Rhiad 4 that has a private pool in the centre and some lovely people serving food and drink. Soumia Ziad Azim and Younes were fantastic and the setting is beautiful the only slight negative is it is a bit of a suntrap and gets very hot if they had some fans installed like at the main pool it would be perfect. The restaurant Manager Rachid went out of his way to look after us as did the 2 Sayings and Bira at the Bar. The entertainment in the evening was a little French orientated and a bit repetitive but Magic and Spider were excellent entertainers. As mentioned the kids were a bit of a nightmare as they were allowed to run around the restaraunt knocking into everyone and everything thy were also allowed to stay in the bar until closing which isn't ideal as a 10pm cut off would have been fair to all other guests. Just to mention I am not anti children but it was not expected and at times a real nightmare.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Wales,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cymru33

Well put between mature olive trees. Hotel is not too far from Marrakech with a convenient free shuttle to the down-town area. The guests are majority French speaking (staff speaks reasonable English) including local tourists (some in traditional dresses) mingling in a friendly atmosphere. There are great activities for younger kids the hotel even has a small petting zoo. Two large pools two tennis courts and various other sporting facilities. We enjoyed our vacation; point of improvement is the restaurant; the food is not too bad certainly if you like the Moroccan cuisine (which we did) with a pleasant local wine; however it is chaotic and poorly managed. (Management is not the right expression; ""laissez faire"" is a better description). For example the main course for the “fish evening” was... roast beef...

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JOAN B wrote a review Apr 2015,20,VERY DISAPPOINTED,PROS: Nice grounds which were kept clean with plenty of beds and brollies which was needed in a 34 degree heat. We had a nice quiet room which we asked for. All inclusive. Free shuttle bus to Medina but was an half hour walk from where we were dropped to reach it.    Cons: The mattress was so hard it was like sleeping on the floor so I had very little sleep although it suited my daughter  The food was terrible hardly any meat dishes and everything was cold because the tray which the food was on wasn't put onto any heated tray. If you liked salad or pasta for every meal you will be fine. To us the food is a part of the holiday and even my daughter who eats other countries food also found it very hard to find anything decent to eat so most of the time she was starving.  The entertainment wasn't very good so about 10pm every night we decided we would rather go back to our room and read our Kindle's.  Was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at regarding the food.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46joanb
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mas37 wrote a review Apr 2015,30,Fine,'Fine' is a good word but when you've paid quite a bit of money for a holiday you want a bit more.  The pros - pretty setting with lovely lights along walkways; very helpful staff - Reception staff in particular and Amine in the restaurant; clean and tidy; comfortable rooms; useful shuttle bus into the medina but would have liked it to run back later than 7.30pm; all inclusive drinks generous = bottle of wine at supper/lunch if you wanted it rather than asking for a glass; excellent exchange rate for dirham in hotel - although you need cash.  The cons - Loud music on occasion by the pool even the one that didn't have the entertainment around it; possibly the worst massage ever for £35; busy busy around the food so queues and problems finding a table most evenings; ants in the room - but the odd insect doesn't bother me much; a depressing view of other peoples balconies but arriving at night and unpacking before seeing it we couldn't be bothered to change; intermittent wifi in reception area.  So a bit of a balance on the scales for this hotel - nothing outstanding nothing dreadful ... just 'Fine'!,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mas37

So the beverages is included in the room price. everything was OK about this hotel except for the quality of food. The rooms are clean and specious the bed is comfortable. you need to pay a deposit for towels which is weird and you need to pay for the safe books which is also weird. All is fine except for the food. whatever we have tried during the 5 days stay that we had we did not like it. So I ended up eating pasta and ommelette for breakfast all the time.

When we said no thanks we'd like to wait and have them with us they glared at us and made it like we were inconveniencing them for having to do it straight away.    The Room: On arriving in our room it was dirty with hair on the floor bed and dead flies in the bathroom area. Wifi never worked. We were given a room next to the stairs so we were woken by guests going up and down and the housekeeping dragging there carts up and down the steps as them have to carry them. Later the same day my husband picked up a pamphlet that was in our bathroom to read and was greeted with a USED SANITARY NAPKIN attached to the underside! We did speak with the ""Guest Services Manger"" and were told our whole room would be cleaned straight away and that she was so sorry and would be sending something to our room as an apology...they did come and clean the room but not the used sanitary napkin. We had to call the front desk three times over a course of hours to get someone to come clean it away. When she did arrive to do so so tore it off the back of the pamphlet bare handed and placed the pamphlet back where it was in the bathroom!!!!!! As she walked out the door I guess my face was disgusted so she came back in a took that to. Our ""gift"" arrived TWO DAYS LATER and was fruit and cookies that were available at lunch in the buffet which we already pay for when booking the all inclusive. On top of this our room there after had ants the sheets were not changed our whole 8 day stay and we had to regularly call for water & towels.    The Staff: Rude and inattentive. Don't accept to be served in the dinning room  unless your a large group or a huge tipper from day one! The staff at the incursion desk are never around and the available staff aren't willing to help you in anyway. If you speak English they pretty much avoid you!    The Food: My husband has a peanut allergy so we asked what types of cooking oil they used to the kitchen staff and after being tossed from person to person were told everything is cooked in peanut oil. We went and spoke to the Guest Services Manger and she looked it up and said in fact it was sunflower oil and the kitchen staff were mistaken....as I'm sure you can imagine this didn't make us feel comfortable to eat at all! The food was repetitive and cold and very little meat offered. Meal hours are very odd and no real snacks are offered at the ""Snack Bar."" If your lucky enough to get there when they have food it's just coffee and small cakes.    The Pool: Water is so cold you have to pay for beach towels and have to walk to the bar each time you want a drink. Don't think about asking for a drink of whiskey from the bottles placed behind the bar though apparently there just for show.    The Spa: Paid for a 50 min massage each got 30 mins of barley rubbing/touching you and got to listen to the staff whispering & laughing back and forth in a cold room. Once done we wanted to shower off the extra oils before getting dressed and we were told no! They than just turned over our used towels on the the beds for the the next guests. We also got pedicures which was soaking your feet in a buck of warm water while sitting on a couch. We had to ask for them to use new files as we noticed straight away they were used. Which caused them to huff and stomp off coming back 15 mins later. They both once again just talked and laughed to each other completely ignoring us.    The Grounds: The only thing this place has going for it! It's beautiful and well taken care of.    So if your looking for a wonderful worry free holiday don't book here!!",Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"St. John's, Canada",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshine154964
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,curioustraveller104 wrote a review Apr 2015,20,Nice but A lot of room for improvement,The hotel is about a 10 minute taxi drive from the airport and a 10 minute drive to the main market square.  Good points:  - The main hotel area location and layout is nice – it is a really pretty hotel  - the pool area is laid out nicely there is the main pool and a large square one and a hidden third pool which is quiet.  - refreshing drink on arrival  - the rooms and bathroom are spacious and the bed is large.  - the Hammam treatment in the spa was very good.  - the entertainment staff in the bar do a really good job.    Bad points:  - wifi: The wifi is very poor in the rooms we were forced to stand near the safe if we were to catch signal there is not wifi around the main food areas or the pool and to catch a good signal you had to sit in reception  - Responsiveness to e-mails prior to arrival: I asked the hotel a few things before arrival. 1) do they offer airport transfers 2) we arrive late in the night where will we be able to have dinner 3) we arrive in Easter weekend so assuming the spa will be busy could we book our spa treatments in advance 4) in order to plan our itinerary could they give us timings of the shuttle bus to the market square. I e-mailed them approx. 3-4 times before I received an answer and even then they could not answer our questions. In case you would like to know. 1) No the hotel advised we should get a taxi from the airport. 2) Dinner in the main restaurant will be served until 10pm (they made no effort to accommodate our request for food after this time) 3) one line response – you have been booked into the spa for 11am (made no effort to be polite or give us alternative timings) 4) no response.  - Arrival: We arrived at the hotel quite late at night. We asked for one double room and one twin room. Staff told us that they would send someone to the room to set them up correctly they did not send anyone around for the entire duration and we had two double beds instead. We were also required to pay for our rooms in advance of the stay generally isn’t this supposed to be on check-out?  - We were also required pay for the use of a Safe box in our room 30 DHs per day per room. Other extras to pay for are the pool towels (as a deposit – keep the receipt in order to get your money back) and pay extra to eat in the Moroccan restaurant at the hotel (which is different to main buffet restaurant)  - The reception staff dropped us to our rooms in a buggy-cart with our bags and gave us vague directions of where to go for the main restaurant. But they did not come to collect us with our bags on check-out. Given that hotel ground area is large we walked with all our bags to the reception for checkout.  - when we reached our room one of the TV’s did not have a remote control. We tried calling reception 2-3 times but they would not pick up the phone we also walked to reception where staff told us that someone would come around shortly. No-one came with remote control until 2 days later.  - we were also greeted with a large dead cockroach just by our door inside of our rooms which was covered with Ants. Generally the room had a lot of bugs which were like wood-louse and small beetles some of which came off our bed when we lifted off the bed cover and throw.  - one of the beds on of the rooms had bed bugs so we had rashes all over our open arms in the bed.  - none of staff – apart from the reception staff could speak English. We had great difficulty communicating with staff in the buffet hall the night bar the spa the cashier desk in the reception and guest relations. All hotel related information is mainly written and catered to the French and seemed like they made no effort to cater for English guests. Announcements in the 9:30pm show and games in the bar are also in French along with the majority of songs that are being played in the bar and the pool area.  - no-one could tell me the weather forecast for the duration of our stay at the reception desk or the guest relations.  - aside from the food offered in the main food hall and the oasis snack bar – there was no other form of room service offered which we could pick from a menu to have food served to our rooms.  - when we were showed to our rooms the staff did not show us how to use the temperature control given that it is quite warm in Marrakech we tried to figure it out ourselves but it didn’t even seem to switch on.  - drinks at the hotel: there are no tea / coffee making facilities in your rooms or a kettle. The alcoholic drinks in the bar areas are either very watered down or too strong. The staffs need training on how to make cocktails.  - there is one A5 size book in your room which was very sticky and had not been cleaned the majority of which is in French Spanish or Italian. There were supposed to be two sticky pages of English but one of ours had been ripped out when I compared it to our other room. The book does not give full information about the hotel i.e. what sort of treatments are available at the hotel a map of the hotel grounds how to make calls other rooms the local area tips or hints about getting around Marrakech.  - the TV – we only found 4 channels in English – CNBC CNN BBC world and Sky news – so everything was about the news for us and there was nothing else we could understand.  - Lack of maps: We were due to go to the market square and visit a few other landmarks in close proximity so I asked the hotel for a map of the area which any hotel should have. The Guest relations did not have maps but they sent us to the main reception the main reception did not have maps and told us to go to the hotel shop (assuming to buy a map?). How can a hotel not keep maps of the local area or give us good tips / hints how to get around. The two men at the desk were playing on their phones.  - The oasis snack bar – did not have a menu and did not seem to be serving snacks when we went to the snack bar next to the pool. None of the staff came to serve us when we stood by the bar so we just walked away eventually.  - the bathroom – comes with standard things showergel shampoo bar of soap one glass two hand towels two bath towels bath mat and toilet roll. No other effort is made to provide things like a shower cap ear buds etc. The housekeeping will also come to rooms and collect your wet towels at 10am but will not drop clean towels until between 2-3pm so if you use the toilet and wash hands there is nowhere to wipe your hands.  - the spa – after finding the spa the staff could not speak English. The showed us to the changing rooms – each person is given some slippers (which were not clean) and a bath robe no other towels are provided. The changing room showers did not have showergel or shampoo or hair dryer. After changing my parents did a hammam whilst me and my sister paid for spa access only for the day. The Staff told us we could only use the steam room once and the gym access was not included?!. There was a warm room – which I am assuming was the sauna but it was not hot enough to be a sauna?. There was no Jacuzzi. The pool was heated however the pool area needs redecorating. The walls had been plastered in white where they were trying to cover up cracks and did not look nice. In the day time it didn’t look nice there were no candles on or any form of mood music.  Food:  - for breakfast I was quite disappointed by the lack of selection in terms of small individual buns muffins pastries. What was available was large breads and baguettes which had to be sliced by us there was some pastries but I found them quite dry and not nice to eat.  - lunch and dinner had the same food nearly every day – so if you’re staying at the hotel for a long period of time it can get quite tiresome.  - I am vegetarian and I had a lot of trouble finding suitable vegetarian food which was not chips pizza bread or make it yourself salad. There was always Tangines but the smell of these and the bland taste put me off eating them. On top of that the food was not clearly labelled not every dish had a sign next to it on what it was and nothing had a (v) next to it if it was vegetarian – even some of the ready mixed salads had chicken or fish in it. Coupled with the fact that no staff could speak English I struggled a lot during my stay.  - watching people mix up the serving spoons between the veg and the non-veg food really put me off wanting to eat.  - there was not enough salt and pepper shakers to go out on every table and there were no spoons already laid out with the tea cups or on our mat beside the knife and fork and we often had to hunt around for this because staff were not attentive to if we were calling them. The same staffs do the serving of drinks as they do cleaning the tables so they were often so busy due to the high turnover of people that they were not attentive to people calling them it was often easier to go to the cleaning station ourselves and collect what we need.,Date of stay: April 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/curioustraveller104

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,mrspastie wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Fantastic...,My mum and I stayed for a long weekend in March.    The hotel is well located for the airport and main square spotlessly clean and well maintained throughout.    The pool areas are amazing with plenty of sunbeds lots of cushions and shaded hideaways. You can hire pool towels for a deposit of €15pp    The pool bar is set out in comfy style over looking one of the pools and the indoor bar is wonderful dim lighting table service and a dance floor in the middle.    The restaurant is massive with a variety of good food choices and indoor and outdoor seating.    Rooms are clean with balcony or terrace and TVs I found the beds super comfy!!    Why didn't I rate 5 stars? In a lot of places paintwork was coming off curtains were broken and doors didn't shut properly minor niggles but if you go 5 star you expect excellence!

The resort is large with a good sized pool and has a wonderful view of the Atlas mountains. Our stay was all inclusive and I felt that they provided a large selection of food and drink to choose from. I'm vegetarian and usually struggle with all inclusive hotel and at this hotel there was plenty to choose from. One of my favourite things at this hotel was the way that they treat the cats there. The cats that live around the resort have their own little houses with water and food. I'm British and we LOVE cats! Stray cats can be a problem at some hotels. I love the forward thinking of this hotel! Accepting they ay are there and treating them well. I believe that all hotels should follow this idea. It would certainly stop me from running around trying to feed all the stray cats - if they were already been looked after.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CKDolbie

When we arrived we were a little early and the room wasn't ready so we went straight for lunch. Loads to chose from bottle of wine on the table bottles of water & coke zero when requested. Staff were busy so sometimes had to wait and they prefer the French to the English but they were still ok. Beer on tap.    When taken to our rooms they were clean large and modern.  Went to the pool easy to get cabanas and sunbeds pool slide open when requested great cocktails from the pool bar. Towels available.  The food is good we had 2 fussy and 2 more willing to try anything eaters and we were all happy. There is always bread chips pasta rice and pizza so everyone would like something. The salad bar is great and the puddings are lovely.    Got a bus to the market where you do get hassled immediately for a guide to show you around & even ignoring him for 25 mins he didn't give up. Ours was good in the end and expected 100lira (£7.50) tip per couple for showing us around which you could have done alone but he did end up taking us right in the market.. And getting us out again! But the market is very full on and children will beg for money.

On the whole the staff were excellent and very professional.The room was perfect for our purposes with excellent views of the snow covered Atlas mountains. Unfortunately we did have rain but on those occasions we used the gym the spa and had a fantastic energetic massage and enjoyed cocktails in the bar. The food was excellent. We ate tasty fresh produce which included crunchy salads tagine vegetables and an assortment of meat and fish. what was particularly good was that the restaurant even if arrived later to dine it didn't look light locusts had landed. The only downside were the chamber maids who defiantly has quite a cavalier approach to their work schedule. In fact on more than one occasion having been out most the day we would come back to the room late afternoon to find that they were still there which was inconvenient. It may be because the weather was unseasonably wet and residents were staying in their room. I am prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt and would go back and would recommend it to others.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaraO505

I guess like all these places that are geared for sunshine they become a disappointment in the rain. We thought we might be able to use indoor pool but children weren't allowed to use it and I could understand them protecting the spa area for adults. BUT it was too cold to use the swimming pools so very disappointing for the children!! Staff were nice but service its self was lacking. We ordered a room with cot and the cot wasn't there and despite booking with an infant we had to drag the pram up and down the stairs several times a day up to the apartment. The staff just weren't responsive enough. One found one self saying.. ""This wouldn't happen at Sandals"" quite a lot. On the other hand we didn't pay Sandals prices!!  I had become bored with the dining room after 4 days and this may have been due to the fact that all we had to do was eat and drink as weather was seriously too awful to do anything else.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,cls112 wrote a review Mar 2015,30,Just okay,I arrived around noon and while check-in wasn't for a few hours they had a suite available for me right away. They take you to your room on a golf cart which is good as there is really no way to determine how to find your room otherwise. The room was a bit shabby marks and scuffs on the walls dust on the surfaces. The bed and pillows were VERY firm (too firm for me) and the wifi only worked from one position in the lounge part of the suite and only had 2 bars even from there. Finally when the rooms are cleaned housekeeping does not replace the towels right away. They come around with towels later in the day around 5:00 PM for my room. So if it's raining which it did each afternoon and you're in your room relaxing there are no towels.    Restaurants: I only used the Atlas restaurant which was a buffet. The food was okay plenty of variety but lukewarm at best. Also the staff there to bring you beverages were not attentive unless you were a part of a large group. As I was traveling solo this made it difficult and annoying trying to get a glass of water or wine.    Pool/Spa: I had a massage which was good and the price was good. The pools were very nice I did not go swimming...too chilly but there were plenty of lounge chairs available.    Lastly the shuttle into the Medina ran to schedule but you have to book your space the day before.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sssswwwww wrote a review Mar 2015,50,Great Hotel bar some of their staff,After reading some negative reviews both on here and expedia I was admittedly a little bit apprehensive. However I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely the hotel and the majority of its staff were and all I can say is that perhaps these people who left negative reviews expected something on par with The Ritz hotel even though they are not paying for such a hotel!?    Arrived early and was no problem at all went to the snack bar and got some refreshments.    Free shuttle bus to the medina which was extremely useful DO NOT get the guides who stand outside the hotel they are scammers and will take you into over-priced shops for some commission. A guide is not necessary but if you want one for piece of mind look out for the guy with the broken voice box (absolutely amazing) and you give him whatever money you want to.    Dress respectably in the Medina as this is an Islamic country I did and everyone was equally as respectful to me and we didn't get ripped off or bothered as much.    The hotel and its grounds are beautiful!    One member of staff who was absolutely useless is 'Driss'. Unless you are a single half-naked female he will ignore you and make you wait whilst he serves everyone else first. Regardless of who was first. Female receptionists and night time waiters were absolutely amazing they will go out of their way for you especially 'Hassan'. However the male night-time receptionists are lazy rude and incompetent. Had to help him look for our own towel deposit (150DH per towel) even though it is his job!?    The food was amazing and varied so ignore the silly reviews.  I am so happy that I booked with this hotel and ignored some of the bad reviews as I would definitely return!    The hotel is predominantly filled with French and unfortunately the majority of them seem to lack basic manners and etiquette (they seemed to find the basic concept of queuing quite difficult) however me and my boyfriend saw the funny side of it!    TIPS:  Taxi to and from the airport should cost you no more than 100DH but even that seemed quite extortionate as it was such a short journey.  Change your money at the hotel there is no commission and they use the actual rate: £1: 14DH whereas we got ripped off in the UK.  If you're looking for a relaxing holiday whether you are travelling as a family solo or a couple then this is most definitely the right place!,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sssswwwww
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,TomWRDell wrote a review Mar 2015,40,Would of been an easy 5/5 if it wasn't for a few staff,"Stayed here for 4 days for a short birthday break.    Checked in early by 2 lovely helpful smiley girls on reception (who were amazing throughout more on them later). Was told we could get food from the snack bar. Had nice coffee and some pastries.    This is where the first problematic member of staff was working. His name is Driss. He is lazy rude and should be fired on the spot. Complete let down to this hotel chain. He won't serve you unless you meet his criteria of: A) Female B) Single C) Preferably just come out of the pool D) Carrying rather large melons. E) already intoxicated women. Strange. He served 10-15 women before us (a couple) a number of times each time I pointed out to him what he was doing was wrong he found that quite amusing which was infuriating. When he finally served us each time for our coffees he kept serving it our of the cheap machine rather than the espresso machine out of pure idleness. Each time we returned the coffee and made him make us a real one as if I wanted to drink muddy water I'd of gone and found a puddle.    The food was brilliant the cocktails were great but pretty strong for someone who doesn't drink much. All staff in the bar area were good and all but one at the restaurant were fantastic. Hassan was particularly friendly and went very far out of his way to make this a pleasant stay without battering an eyelid.    The next useless member of staff whose name I didn't get (wasn't wearing a badge) was almost as lazy as Driss but not quite. As a couple we wanted a peaceful meal so asked him to lay a table in the corner. He didn't like that and in fact wanted us to sit right next to him in the busier area to make his life easier & save him walking. I am not paying money to make their lives easier its the opposite in fact. He made such a big deal of laying a table only 20m from the main area and when previously I couldn't get his attention for so long and started laying my own table he came and pushed me as I was talking a napkin and got in my face. Not a good idea considering he was about 5 ft something and 10 stone. Never had anything similar to this in any part of the world. Amazed by his aggression & rudeness. Disgusting.    The rooms were big comfy and spotless. Had a nice private patio area and after they saw we smoked an ash tray was brought round to us. Maids and maintenance staff also friendly.    Cash point on site offered a good rate (£1=14) whereas in the airport £1=10.    Shop on site sells cigarettes 30 for a pack of 20. (£2ish)    Shuttle bus into town was efficient. Great markets in town.    The only other member of staff being difficult was the guy at reception who fancied himself (we couldn't work out why) and couldn't be bothered to look for our towel deposit. Few hours later we persuaded him and we had to help him. We paid money and ended up doing their job voluntary? Not sure how that works.    Would have been a solid 5 stars if it wasn't for those members of staff. Had a great time though may look elsewhere on my next visit to Morocco.    Ignore the stupid reviews nit picking this really is a top hotel if it wasn't for a select few.    Don't bother taking the ""official"" tour guy outside the hotel. He starts well with the history but ends up dragging you round the most expensive tatty shops for commission.    Also the ""official government"" spice/oil shop everyone will try and take you to is a complete con. Was solid harrisa and other spices we smelt. Got home and it was flour with red food die and a splash of chili powder. Definitely not the real thing. Buy it from guys on the street and open and taste the spices you buy before leaving the shop.    If you want a tour guide catch the bus into town and look for the guy with a damaged voice box. He was fantastic.    There are quite a few French at the hotel. Some of whom had no manners. I'd of rather shared the hotel with the company of animals. But if you like we did saw past their lack of sophistication they are bearable for short periods.    The hotel technically does have wifi but its so slow I wouldn't waste your time. You're on holiday anyway so this shouldn't matter unless you needed it for business etc.    The 2 girls on the reception went as far as to print out the weather for us one cloudy morning and even let us print our boarding passes :) The most valuable 2 assets of this hotel.",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bude, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomWRDell

Reception is comfortable and is the best place to receive the free wi fi and mint tea is served during the day.    We had a large very spacious clean room with a comfortable queen size bed and two pillows each. The bathroom was huge with his and hers basins large bath walk in shower and toilet and bidet. There was a hairdryer in the bathroom and shower/bath gel and shampoo are supplied. There is also a flat screen TV which you could get Sky news and a channel showing films in English. The downside of the room is that there was not any facilities to make tea or coffee and the fridge was missing but as it was not very hot this was not an issue for us. The room we had was very cold and the heating did not work. We asked Reception twice if the heating should work they said they would look into it but never did. Others said that their heating also didn't work. However this would not be an issue when the weather is very hot. The wi fi in the room kept dropping out.    Usual all inclusive buffet in the restaurant which had a different theme most evenings. Food was good and if you were a fussy eater there was always pizza chips and salad. Most of the time service for getting your drinks was very good but on the odd occasion it was a bit slow.    There is an unheated pool with water slides and another pool which is heated. The Animation team work very hard to keep guests entertained. The hotels runs a free shuttle bus every hour into Marrakesh which is best booked a day in advance as this is very popular.

The hotel was very clean and the rooms were spacious our bathroom were spotless although we did have to ask for toilet paper and towels on arrival. The food was excellent and there was a great variety to choose from especially on Valentines dinner the hall was all decorated with banners and flowers a lovely touch very memorable. I felt the hotel catered more for the French though. They had a small animal corner with sheep and goats for the children. Wifi had strong reception all over the hotel grounds for the colder days which helped pass a little time. A trip into the old town Medina is well worth it best get a guide so you don't get hassled to much its about 150 dirhams for half a day and you get to go places you would not if you do it alone. If getting a taxi from airport going out is 3 times more than getting back we were told its because they have to pay to park there !!! Also if you have any money left its advisable to spend it there before you get to airport as once inside the airport you can't spend it only Euros and credit cards. If you do bring any currency back you bought before travelling beware of the terrible exchange rate we had 30.00 left according to rate when we bought it but were only given 12.00 for it .

Unfortunately we both got very sick on our second night. We were careful to avoid meat and keep away from anything dodgy looking but still spent an entire night re-visiting the contents of our stomachs. It left us with achey muscles and no energy to go in to Marrakech the next day.

(one pc did not work and the other would not give access to airlines. My own laptop had stopped working.)    The hotel does not offer transfers to and from the airport but it was easy enough to get a taxi. Ensure the price is fixed with the driver before the journey! However the hotel does run a shuttle bus service to the Old Town - a place which is well worth a visit at the very least to experience the assault on your senses that is the market square.    One minor quibble - I had emailed the hotel to enquire about airport transfers at both email addresses on their website but received no reply. As it turned out the transfer was not a problem but it would have been good customer service if the email had been acknowledged.    Still overall it was a good place to kick back for a few days to relax.,Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9327IXsarahb
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gillian r wrote a review Mar 2015,30,Gill from Kent,We stayed from 28th February to 3rd March 2015 and had a great holiday. But after 2 days our party of 4 ladies all got stomach and sickness bug. We had to stay in bed as we couldn't move away from the tolilet. Even though we are now home 3 of us still have very bad stomach cramps and upset stomachs. I think the hygiene in the Restaurant leaves much to be desired. I witnessed children using their hands to pick food up and then put it back utensils dropped on the floor and then put back on the servery. Cats wandered into the Restaurant and guestsfeedingthem from the table. The glasses also did not seem very clean. A real shame as it could be improved greatly. We spoke to another w3 couples and two of those couples were also ill. There's definitely something going there as we also saw piles of sick in a few places. Hotel needs to be drastically cleaned and sanitised!!,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kent, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836gillianr
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sally h wrote a review Mar 2015,30,"Nice hotel, shame about the food...","We stayed from 1st March until 8th March 2015. The hotel was very nice lovely gardens and pools. The room was spacious and clean. This hotel is all inclusive but has no options for dining other than an ""authentic Moroccan"" restaurant which carries a 10 Euro supplement per person.  The staff were all friendly and helpful. The hotel is well situated for the Old Town airport and trips to the Atlas mountains.  We both became extremely unwell after eating in the Moroccan restaurant. Although this carried the supplement there was no choice in the four courses. The food wasn't very good at all.  We're not sure if it was this restaurant or the buffet which made us so very ill. The buffet had plenty of choice but you did see whatever had been on the menu the day before reconstituted into something else the next day. It was never very hot and lingered for three hours at each mealtime.  My partner and I both became ill within one hour of each other. We were so poorly we had to call reception to bring us water and extra toilet rolls. Sorry to be so graphic but we were totally unable to leave the room for 24 hours and were both so very weak for a further 24 hours.  The reception staff claimed that nobody else had reported any sickness as I had asked if they had received any other complaints. We felt they needed to know that there was a potential problem.  They did send their nurse to our room who dispensed medication which helped us toward our recovery.  We didn't trust the food after this incident and when we recovered an appetite we ate out in the centre of Marrakesh.  We noticed other people looking a bit off colour and either selecting just plain rice bread or chips or taking it back to their rooms.  When we had recovered we took a trip to the Atlas Mountains and discovered that several of the others on this trip had been unwell also.  The management need to accept that they have a problem with their food hygiene or this otherwise lovely hotel will suffer as a result of poor reviews.",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallyherdi
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,robbU7562EM wrote a review Mar 2015,20,"Could be a great hotel, but one major letdown...","I travelled with my girlfriend to this hotel for a week in March 2015.    First let me start with the positives. This hotel is well located both for access from the airport and for trips to visit the Souks in the Medina. The rooms were spacious and to a good standard (although not what would traditionally be classed as '5 star') and the grounds are excellent. Despite some comments on here we found the wi-fi to be excellent in all areas.    However the real downside was that both my girlfriend and I ended up with food poisoning after dining in the restaurant mid-way through the week. We had been very careful not to eat salads drink tap water etc and so this can only have been down to poor food preparation. When informed the response from reception staff was ""OK..."" with their only concern being that other guests didn't overhear the conversation. We spotted others eating along and taking back bread and water to their room so I don't think we were the only ones suffering!    It was such a shame as the place has the potential to be really very good. However when you are eating most of your meals in a resort you really cannot take the risk that you will end up ill for half of the week. As such I would urge caution when choosing your accommodation in Marrakech.",Date of stay: March 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbU7562EM

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JHeer wrote a review Mar 2015,30,You get what you pay for,This is a decent hotel with some good elements and some that they need to work on however in relation to the price paid one cannot really complain. The rooms are of decent size and clean I found the maid staff polite and hardworking. The hotel itself is mainly full of French tourists and we found during the first few days we were not given the same level of service as other guests which was weird as with a young child I would have thought some more attention would have been given to make it easier for us. Some examples are the first two days during breakfast were I had to ask three different staff members to clear a table for us the staff member didn't ask us for coffee. Weirdly the days after we found the service had improved. The food itself is ok at best but always a little cold. The fresh pasta stand was the best food by far. Also please note that the restaurant allows for cats to walk about freely. The bar area is nice and large and opens at 6pm. We didn't see any of the animation events as they were on at 9pm and with a little one we were unable to.    There is a small kids pool however we found the main heated pool better with our little boy. The pool itself is really nice. The hotel also contains a small section where they have ducks goats and rabbits which our little boy enjoyed visiting.    There is a baazar nearby where there is a supermarket pizza hut takeaway and a burger joint along with a few shops if you fancy a quick visit outside.    The Spa I felt could have been better for the price paid (£35). The lady used a push down oil release system which I can only describe the noise as squeezing the last bit of ketchup from a ketchup bottle.    One little irate I have is that it was my bday whilst there and the staff knew about this as I asked for an upgrade when we were checking in sadly they were unable to due to being fully booked which is fine. One evening during dinner my wife was approached by the manager who was asking about our stay when my wife mentioned that she was disappointed that a b’day cake wasn't provided etc. which I must stress isn't a given right. The manager said she will arrange something as they should have done so. Two nights after nothing!. That I find weird personally as the hotel manager if asked should have made the effort as she approached us.    For what we paid for the hotel I cannot fault it but just by adding a few extra quirks the standard off the hotel will dramatically improve.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JHeer

The food was delicious prepared to a high standard and all tastes were catered for. The entertainment was excellent with very good shows each night in the bar area and activities during the day including Arabic classes cookery lessons dance tutorials football and aerobics.

Felt safe with kids walking around the main square. carriage ride was also brilliant- go for the horses near the back of the line- more bartering power at 150dhs..

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Julie-Anne A wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Reasonable Family Hotel,This hotel was not actually what we were expecting (our fault not theirs). Overall it is very good but very much caters for families with children (which we were not) so lots of activities and stuff for kids to do - I have no idea why some of the other comments think otherwise here!    Wine was not bad and certainly better than most North African countries and the food was also excellent. A lot of French people so this is probably their influence. Grounds are absolutely lovely with Olive trees and well kept gardens loungers and garden art.    Really our only complaints were that the rooms were quite basic and not really in keeping with the communal areas at all (and definitely not 4 star never mind 5 star standard) and our other gripe was that it says 2 bars but really only one which was full of kids and very loud entertainment - with the other being a pool bar for during the day only. This meant we struggled to find somewhere nice to sit and chat before or after dinner.,Date of stay: February 2015,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Julie_AnneA232
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Priya I wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Very good,Entertainment and the team behind is excellent. Food and drink considering it's all inclusive was of a very good standard and they cater for different taste.  Rooms were disappointing and there were a few issues with the standard expected in a five star hotel. Beds are comfortable and rooms are clean and spacious. Can easily oversee this as the service provided by the entertainment team compensates for this real lack of quality.  However reception is the worst. Complained about the key not working properly and I had to change almost everyday sometimes twice a day and I got told its my fault as I keep it near my bank cards and coins and that this prevents the key working. Seriously!!!!! Even argued back that they saw my wife store it in her purse near her cards. Why don't you tell her instead of going to the room to realise it does not work.

The pool and spa were lovely lots of space clean and the spa was heavenly. We did all spend extra on a massage in the spa which was lovely however quite different to what you would get at home.    The entertainment was fab and we did nothing but laugh. Drinks were flowing and the people were so much fun!    A special thank you to Fatima for keeping our room so clean and the interesting decorations you left on our bed.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gillian B wrote a review Feb 2015,40,Not bad for winter,I booked a week in this hotel as a gift for my boyfriends 30th birthday. When we arrived our cases were taken from us immediately upon checking in we had to fill in a form (similar to the one you fill in on the plane when landing - please note these forms are all in french so you may have to ask for help when filling in). While we filled in forms we were given some Moroccan tea (mint with lots of sugar - was lovely) then we were taken to our upgraded room (junior suite) by a golf caddy with a tour of the grounds on the way.    The room was very spacious & clean however one of the balcony doors did not have a lock on it (we had a balcony in the sitting room and one in the bedroom) this wasn't a major problem as we were on the upper floor and we had another lock on the bedroom door also there was a security guard stationed at the bottom of our room. Our room was cleaned every day & there was always a fancy towel/bed arrangement left behind. We also had wifi in our room which is a bonus.    The staff/entertainment team were very friendly helpful and nice all round - mainly Asma Majik and Spider.    The hotel grounds were quite big we managed to find the restaurant easy & across from that there was the bar which had entertainment on every evening.    The food was themed each night although you always had a vast choice to choose from fresh pasta of your choice made in front of you every night & fresh made omelettes pancakes & eggs every morning. There was obviously traditional Moroccan food every day different tagines were made along with cous cous etc.    Unfortunately on our last night my boyfriend came down with food poisoning we suspect this was from a tagine that could have been out in the afternoon & was put out in the evening when my other half decided to eat it.    Unfortunately we went in winter so it was cold at night & sometimes quite cool during the day. This did give us a chance to take a trip into Gueliz and do some shopping. The easiest way to get to the main shopping street was to ask to be taken to Zara on that street you will find H&M & other stores in the shopping mall.    If we werent sunbathing or out during the day you had other ways to entertain for example the archery/shooting/tennis/basketball/table tennis.    We can't really compare this holiday to previous ones as you have to bear in mind Morocco is an undeveloped country.

We had to ask several times for the extra bedding and didn't get extra towels until the next day (minus 1 point for service) and cleaning happened at exactly the point late afternoon that we wanted to rest. So we only had a service once in 3 nights.  The gardens and pool area are well maintained the pool bar has great cocktails the food is good quality ( but it's buffet every meal and the choices don't change much) there is an a la carte but there's a supplement. During meals the soft drinks and wine were served as full bottles with beer on tap for self service.  Plenty of activities for all the family from archery to cooking demonstrations.  The evening entertainment was as expected- but be prepared for a smoky bar- even during the kids entertainment it was thick with smoke. - this prevented us from using the bar for very long - also the cocktails were served in champagne glasses since we were sat outside it seemed a long walk and a long wait for a couple of sips.  The location is good 15 mins from airport and same into the square- the free bus into town was great and we were prepared to haggle for our taxi back.  I would advise skipping at least one buffet and heading to the night market. The choice was amazing.

Had to fill in immigration cards in the airport going in and out.  The hotel has an impressive reception area. It is a huge complex with well kept gardens. Asked for a ground floor room near to reception and it was arranged. The room was large and very clean but would not describe it as 5*. It had a wall mounted tv but the only English channels were news. The maid was excellent and she did a thorough job each day. Towels were changed daily and the bed linen every three days. It was good to have the small fridge in the room.  It is one of the best all inclusive hotels I have been in. Bottles of water were always available and when you asked for wine at lunch or dinner you got a bottle. It was the same for soft drinks. All the drinks in the bar were all inclusive. They had a wide selection of drinks but they were all made locally even whisky. There were no imported drinks available in the hotel.  It has 2 large swimming pools and amazingly one of the outside pools was heated.  The weak point in the hotel was the dining room. It could be difficult at breakfast and at lunch to find a table to sit at. I enjoyed eating omelettes and pancakes. Coffee was delivered to the table in flasks and it was usually just warm. At lunch time and dinner the only way to be guaranteed hot food was to have a pasta made to your specifications. There was not a big choice for the main course - fish or meat and often the chips and vegetables were cold.  At dinner we had great service from our waiter so if you can sit in the same area at lunch or dinner you are more likely to be looked after. Coffee was served at the pool bar during the day and in the lounge bar at night. I did not like the heavy duty plastic glasses they used which showed a lot of wear inside from being washed repeatedly. It was hard to tell if they were clean which they undoubtedly were but they did not look nice.  Drinks and entertainment were in the lounge bar. The animators took played a large part in the entertainment but they did have outside entertainers as well. The programme was on a weekly cycle so if you stayed for two weeks you saw everything twice. There was a lively atmosphere in the lounge bar but smoking was allowed and there were frequently a number of small children there till 11.30.  There was a large group of animators who looked after all the sports activities - archery shooting French bowls table tennis etc. They were very friendly and most of them had fairly good English. ""Spider"" and ""Magic"" were especially friendly as well as being talented dancers.  Their shuttle bus into Marrakech was excellent. There were always taxis outside but prices varied considerably.

The Kenzi hotel is located 7 km from Marrakech Main sqaure El Fna. To long to walk but the regular shuttle works great. It drops you off a few minutes walk from El Fna. Rooms are all located in seperate buildings called Riads. Rooms are ok nothing to special but functional. There is a safe but strangly you have to pay 30 dirhams a day to use the safe... One issue is noise the last few days we had a lot of issues with noisy neighbours during evening night an morning so sleeping was difficult. There were large two really large groups that had a company conference and they partied or whatever. First days were really quiet. The pool is awesome one is heated the big one is not. So only the heated one is used in winter. During the day the bar at the pool is open and after six it closes and the loung bar is opened. These two bars are for youre included drinks. They serve alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks and cocktails. Keep in mind it's local alcohol that's served so the alcohol percentage is not high....    Food is great very verynkarge selections and different themes each day. One downside was that there was besides the otherwise enourmous selection only one meat choice each night ( except on fish night when there was no meat..). The meat that is there is grilled in the buffet and tastes great. The dessert selection is also fantastic. They have a big room with lots of tables and the waiters are suoer friendly some even spoke our language (dutch) and came back each night. They will serve you wine (red white rose) water and coke zero. For cat haters there are about seven cats living on site and they also enter the restauarant... Nothing to be bothered about but good to know.    Hotel staff is friendely there are ATM's on site and a spa. Spa staff was not so friendly...    All in all a great week superb wheather since it's winter at home. One thing to notice is that Marrakech itselve is reall Marocco so it's a complete mess dirty noisy etc. So it's great to have the Kenzi to come home to.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Eindhoven, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kb3131
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jeff T wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Moroccan Romantic Break,Just returned from a 3 night break at this hotel. Lovely greeting when we arrived with some mint tea. The room was spacious with a fridge safe and very powerful shower. We were on the ground and as previous reviews have said the 1st floor may provide more privacy. Food is very nice if a little cool at times. Staff are lovely especially Spider Ziko and Aziz. Entertainment on the Moroccan night was very good with belly dancers acrobats and musicians. I would return to this hotel especially when on the last day we returned to rose petals on our bed. My wife was over the moon!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Malmacs wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Bubble of calm in Marrakech,We've just returned from a 3 night stay - perfect January break. We chose Marrakech based on the chances of sunshine vs length of flight (we were travelling with our two year old). Marrakech was ideal for such a short trip. The proximity of the airport (10 mins in a taxi/150 dirhams) meant that we'd checked in to the hotel within 4hrs of taking off from Glasgow (thank you tail winds!)    On arrival at the hotel we were welcomed with mint tea before jumping on a golf buggy to be driven to our room. The complex is huge! Decent rooms - very clean fridge TV safe patio area. We were on the ground floor but would probably prefer to be on the first floor if we were to return.    The grounds were really well maintained with sculptures and hammocks dotted around. Both pool areas had an abundance of sun loungers and beds. The smaller of the two main pools was heated which meant it could still be enjoyed dispute temperatures only being 14-18 during our stay. The pool bar offered beer cocktails etc throughout the day. Behind the pool were tennis courts basketball volleyball table tennis and a petting zoo.    The restaurant offered a wide variety of food at each meal with snacks available outside mid morning and mid afternoon. lunch and dinner consisted of tagines meats fish salad pasta pizza bread soups fruit cakes - something for everyone (including me as vegetarian and our recently fussy toddler!) You could help yourself to draft beer and soft drinks or wine and bottled softs could be brought to your table. The bar offered a range of approx 10 cocktails and nightly entertainment (big dance floor Friday night was Moroccan night with belly dancers and acrobats). Can't comment on the nightclub or spa as we didn't make use.    The free 10min shuttle to Medina was great (last one's 7:30pm but no shortage of taxis) - just remember to book the bus the day before. Medina was a labyrinth near impossible to walk around without someone trying to offer you directions or sell you something. It was a great experience but we were always glad to escape back to the calmness of the hotel after a few hours. When booking this trip we'd questioned whether or not we'd be missing out by not booking a Riad in the old town but if we were to return we'd definitely look to book this hotel again as it offered the perfect opportunity to relax between hectic trips into Marrakech.    Being able to stay at the hotel after checkout to enjoy lunch before heading for our evening flight was also a bonus. All in all a great trip we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to chill between exploring the town. A great hotel for all ages be it couples family or friends.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malmacs
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DublinDow wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Good Value All Inclusive,For the price we paid this place was excellent. The meals were varied and there was something for everyone. It's not fully all inclusive as you still have to pay for the gym but it's good enough. The local beer and wine were ok and the spirits were a bit cheap. Rooms were large and modern with all the expected goods.    Good things:  Free bus into the medina.  Lots of space at the pool  Lots of activities    The down sides were:  We had a 8 month old with us and the high chairs in the restaurant were old and filthy (food options were great for her though)  Our room hadn't been cleaned when we arrived they sorted it out after twenty minutes of hanging around in the room  Not 5 star would say 4,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DublinDow
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,MissRoxy85 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Fantastic memorable stay!,"Arrived for a 4 day stay for my mums 60th birthday the trip my gift to her. Just the 2 of us. Luggage carried from our taxi to a ""holding area"" while we checked in which was fairly quick and easy. We were given complimentary mint tea which was a lovely touch. Only thing here was the deposit amount for use of towels for the pool amounted to 300 dirhams which you get back but still felt this was a bit steep. Anyway taken to our room on a buggy so you get a feel of the overall size of the complex. Beautiful gardens and sculptures at every turn. We were near the spa (didn't use it) and our double room was clean beautifully decorated and equipped with everything we needed. I had mentioned to the hotel before we arrived it was a birthday trip for my mum and the first night as we're getting ready for dinner there is a knock at our door and there's a waiter with a beautiful birthday cake for her! Lovely gesture and touch I felt. Great surprise. Food was always fresh looked and tasted fantastic and the staff in the dining area are very attentive and make sure you're enjoying yourself. Variety of meals/themed nights and everything I had tasted fantastic. Beer tap coke machine and wine available for you to help yourself if you wish. All alcoholic beverages were delish available whenever you wanted them. The bar in the evening always had entertainment on and this was good fun. The entertainment staff really go above and beyond to make sure you're enjoying yourself. Even if they see you around the hotel they come over and chat really polite and their English is brilliant (big shout out to Ziko Spider and Aziz!). The pool bar is always busy and has a lovely seating area where activities take place during the day with the entertainment staff (Archery poker darts etc) and the pool itself was lovely. Heated too which was great for the time of year as the breeze could at times be a bit chilly. On check out (which was by 12) we were worried about where to go and what to do as our flight wasn't until later in the evening. We checked out our luggage was stored for us (without us asking) and we were free to continue enjoying the all inclusive facilities. This was great as it meant we could have lunch and relax before getting a taxi back to the airport. I also had time for an Arabic lesson! All in all it was a fantastic holiday made memorable by all the great staff the hotel employs. A huge thank you to everyone for making it a special trip for mum and for making us laugh as much as we did. You are all absolute stars!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,mel l wrote a review Jan 2015,30,nice for a short break,On arrival check in was smooth and the staff were very friendly. The room was not on available for an hour but this wasn't a problem as they stored our luggage and directed us to the restaurant for food and drinks.  The restaurant is very clean and the food superb can't believe some of the negative reviews about the food. It was always fresh and hot. The pasta station is brilliant and you can have any pasta dish cooked fresh.  The pool area was empty. The main pool was not heated and that meant no one sat around it so we were able to get a kabana daily to spend the day relaxing.  The rooms were nice and spacious but the only thing lacking were tea and coffee facilities. If you are coming here in January then wrap up as its cold in the mornings and evenings.  Overall a nice short break away and we would return.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northamptonshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melly537
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tjs20 wrote a review Jan 2015,40,Great Hotel,The hotel is a short jouney from Marrakech. The hotel provide a free shuttle or you can get a cab cheap enough. Location for me was very good as I personally wouldn't be keen on staying within the hustle and bustle of the city itself.  The rooms were good - size cleanliness and facilities.  Swimming pools were decent in size one more child friendly pool and a separate one which was more popular with couples and groups. Suited us fine.  This is an all inclusive resort. In terms of drinks it was one of the better ones I've stayed in. The spirits were of good quality. Beer is from the tap and also in bottles. At dinner wine is provided by the bottle if you request it. Soft drinks likewise are bottled which rules out the argument that they are of poor quality or watered down.  Food was very good here. Plenty of choice and it varied from night to night. They have a couple of chef stations who cook a speciality dish. One night in particular was impressive - a whole tune (massive) in behind the chef who butchered it and cooked it in front of you as you requested.    The reason I liked this hotel was that you had the option of the city but also the option of relaxing by the pool all day. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family and I would happily return.  The only reason I have given four instead of five stars is as follows. The female receptionist I encountered was quite rude and aggressive. She would barely speak to customers or make eye contact. She appeared to see arriving guests or guests with questions or problems as an inconvenience. That said all the other staff from cleaners to other receptionists were friendly and polite.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tjs20
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tracey L wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Loved it!,I have always wanted to go to Marrakech as I have previously been to Agadir. Instead of Christmas presents we decided to book this trip for me and my partner as something to look forward to in January and we got a great deal.  As normal for any trip I book I spend quite a lot of time researching and was initially very happy with my decision. However I saw one too many reviews with negative comments after I booked it therefore became a little anxious that we would not have a good time - I needn't have worried it was superb!  I will try to summarise our trip with the information I think others will benefit from.  Rooms - very clean two stories high easy to find your way around. Lots of storage nice little balcony fridge good air con very comfy beds lovely bathroom clean towels.  Service - I read that people had a problem with the dominant French speaking staff and they could be rude on the reception desk. We did not find this at all. They spoke good English were very attentive and were able to help with any of our enquiries. We arrived a couple of hours before our room was ready no problem as we had full use of the hotel facilities from our arrival. Loved the buggies that we were driven in to take us and our luggage to our rooms. Nothing was too much trouble. All the staff throughout the hotel had a smile on their face tried to talk in English and made us very welcome. I would say I visit places to experience a different culture I don't expect everyone to be English speaking it's part of the fun. You have to go to a place like Marrakech with the right mindset-not expecting it to be just like the UK.  Grounds/facilities- beautiful and very well kept. Loved the random sculptures and hammocks dotted around. The hotel was definitely not at its capacity I would say perhaps less than half occupied which meant no queues pools & sun beds available at all times. Also loved the covered sun beds would certainly be needed at the height of summer. Pool bar was a hubbub during the day and the lounge bar the place to go when the weather was not good and during the evening. Didn't use the pools-too cold for me but they were very well looked after and extremely clean. Also did not use the spa.  The only faults I had with any of the facilities was paying 50 dirham per day for the safe. I found this way too expensive so we didn't use it and the nightclub on the premises. Great idea but could do with a better variety of music so much so we didn't stay long for our one and only visit.  The hotel even has a petting zoo where the goats and sheep can be seen wandering around in the morning. There are lots of sports facilities for those that want to use them.  Food and drink - here I was worried I shouldn't have been. It's a typical all inclusive hotel buffet style themed. Great choice loved the Moroccan food and the sushi night. Waiters bought drinks to you including bottles of wine and ice buckets bottles of water bottles of coke zero - nice touch and all included in the price. It was clean. Food not piping hot a couple of times but with any buffet to cater for hundreds of people this could happen. However there is a microwave if you feel you need it. All the food was cooked properly and we had no upset stomachs.  There is a bookable restaurant - we had it to ourselves for the night- fantastic! You have a 5 course set meal Moroccan style. There is a huge amount of food couldn't eat it all. You pay 100 dirhams each on check-out. Local alcohol good enough lots of coffee available.    All in all we loved this hotel. Yes the guests and staff were predominately French speaking but so what? And this is from someone that doesn't speak any other language bar English which is my problem and no-one else's.  We would go back to this hotel in a shot if we were to return to Marrakech but I don't think we willmuch preferred Agadir. There's not much around unless you use the shuttle bus but for a 6 day break this was no problem.  Weather in January-hit or miss which could impact your day.    Top tip- if you go to the Medina and souks be careful. Even though you get bugged for a guide take one. We got lost in the souks scary and intimidating. An experience at the time but would not want to repeateven though we were glad to do it.,Date of stay: January 2015,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyl231

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,grnwvs2013 wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Pleasant on most counts -- just avoid the spa!!,"Stayed for a week at the end of December 2014. The staff are lovely. There were many things that had to be rectified (asked for king bed got doubles -- key was repeatedly demagnetized required walking back to reception -- wifi was not accessible in the rooms and the wifi in the reception area was very slow). But no major inconveniences and the staff's very positive and friendly attitude easily made up for any minor annoyances.  The only thing that was truly notable was the spa--- recommend avoiding it at all costs. A manicure was 300 drs (about 33$ US) - and was exceptionally terrible. One spa worker worked on each hand -- one was sick and sneezed and coughed and blew her nose all over my hand. No base coat or top coat and only 1 coat of polish -- this ""manicure"" lasted one single day before it chipped. Other spa services were similarly expensive and a waste of $.

If a resort advertises Wifi please ensure it is available. It was only available in the lobby not even the pool area. They have a free shuttle which takes you into the city but it's not easy navigating back to find it again. The food was adequate but felt everything regardless of it was a different country day tasted the same. It was clean and again adequate. The hammam spa was without a doubt the worst hammam (spa) experience i have ever had. I literally felt like I was a horse hosed down by an elderly lady who scrubbed me so hard that I received bruises. The front desk was not very helpful resolving the wifi and TV issues.

The service is very pronto...  The food is good and diverse  The spa is lovely!!!!    Cons  The restaurant is more like a canteen and you really have to sort out everything by yourself. it is difficult to get a waiter's attention... However with the big crowds they handle it is probably difficult to serve every single client. They should also consider having a tea/coffee station at the canteen during meal times (i.e. lunch and dinner). Imagine finishing your meal and having to go and queue at the snack bar for a cup of tea/coffee.  A colleague lost her Samsung tablet which had been handed over (in a bag) to the reception staff (thinking it was the safest place at the hotel to leave it) - this was a really low moment for our group. They should improve the security within their premises.

The hotel and grounds are maintained to a very high standard and i could not fault housekeeping as our towels were changed daily and the bed linen was also changed during our stay.  We found all staff helpful and pleasant and if English wasn't their strongest second language they put most of Brits to shame with their grasp of more than one language.  The food was varied and plentiful with different options available  i would agree that sometimes it wasn't the warmest but it didn't detract from enjoying it.  Yes the hotel does cater predominantly for the French  but as they are their main source of tourism one would expect this  i for one  didn't find it a problem .

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sewell68 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,"Don't expect five star service, but do expect good value for money",We came for a 5 day break and were lucky my enough to be upgraded to a small suite. The hotel is 10/15 minutes from the airport and the centre of Marrakech. On the plus side the staff generally do their best to be helpful the entertainers try incredibly hard to get you involved the bedsheets are changed daily food and branded bottles of soft drinks/water are available in abundance. On the down side the food quality can be variable we could often smell the drains in our room be aware that cats are allowed in the dining room (not a problem for us but may be for some?) smoking is allowed in the bar WiFi was inconsistent in our room (always available in the lobby) and we were surprised that gym entrance is £8! The Indoor pool is £25!! When our door lock stopped working we had to go back to reception 3 times before someone came with us to confirm that it was broken - we were then told (very pleasantly) that the engineer was at another site and would take 40 minutes :/ So in summary don't expect five star quality or attentiveness but do expect good value for money and to have a good time. Outside of the hotel - take a good map with you (the one provided by the tourist office is impossible to follow). Top Tip - we weren't told by the hotel -Beware of tourist guides - they are mainly genuine even though they do pounce on you when you get off the bus - expect to pay 5 euros for two hours guided tour off peak (20 euros at peak season) - they know where to go and you don't get hassled as much!,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sewell68

The rooms are tired and lack the basic amenities you would expect from a so called 5 star hotel at best is a 2.    The food was always put out cold onto 'warm' hot plates in the hope that this provide hot food. It does not ... it just increases the chances of catching salmonella !!    The dining room looks like something from 1950's Butlins. The A La Carte restaurant serves much the same food as the main restaurant  also cold  but with a waiter.    There is only one bar [and no lounge] which blares out load music so there is nowhere to sit and have a quite drink and a chat.    There was crack in our bath that was razor sharp and the water would not drain from the sink there was a lack of towels on a daily basis. We moved our room.    They charge you to use the safe in your room and the indoor pool and also expect you to leave a deposit if you want a pool towel which had seen better days.    Despite choosing very carefully from the buffet all of our party still had gastric problems .

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kamaljit_mann wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Nice short break,Just returned back after a three night stay at this wonderful hotel.  On the day of our arrival our flight was delayed by three hours. As soon as we arrived at the hotel we were shown to reception. We asked reception if it was possible to have lunch before the restaurant closed as we had been on the flight since six in the morning! The receptionist said she would fill in all our paperwork whilst we could have lunch.  The hotel is beautiful and maintained beautifully The rooms are spacious and comfortable and decor is nice. The choice of food is brilliant but a bit bland and repetitive. No slippers or bathrobes provided as stated in the information pack. My husband and I both suffered sickness and chronic stomach pains a day before we were due back. Like previous reviews can't pin point the exact course. But we know of at least three other people that had experienced the same during their stay. Make sure you take some remedies! That spoilt it but otherwise it was brilliant,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leicester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kamaljit_mann

Marakesh is an amazing place to visit and we were glad to have such a lovely hotel to come back to. Beautiful gardens warm and clean pools spotless room with loads of space very fancy spa and really friendly helpful staff. Thr food was plentiful but a bit bland as other people have said but the salads and breakfast fruit made up for that.  Would definitely stay there if we go to Marakesh again.!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,245JoE wrote a review Nov 2014,30,"Not 5* but a lovely Hotel, could be improved",When looking for some Winter sun we got an amazing deal to stay at this hotel and on first impressions we were very pleased as upon booking thought it was too cheap to be as good as we read.  The rooms were lovely with a modern decor very clean and had most things you would want. We unfortunately had a view of the building site (far in the distance) outside the hotel so we kept the curtains shut most of the time. They don't provide slippers or bathrobes which I would expect when staying in a 5* hotel. There is a fridge in the room but this was empty I was a little disappointed in this as it is all inclusive I would expect this to be stocked upon arrival with what is available at the bars and then your responsibility to keep replenished which is what normally happens in these all inclusive resorts. I was also surprised our rooms were so far away from the main area considering it was quiet and felt that we were put here due to the overall cost we paid! You also have to pay daily for the use of your safe which I feel should be free for guests to feel secure and to avoid staff being accused of anything.    The food facilities were good there is the main all inclusive restaurant which serves roughly the same thing each breakfast lunch and dinner. There is a good selection for everyone but most of us did feel that it was missing food with some real taste and flavour. There is the freshly prepared bar that did omelettes in the morning and fresh pasta with sauce for lunch and dinner most of the time which was great but I can imagine in peak periods the queue for this would be massive and put you off going for these which is a shame as in our opinion this was the best thing about the food.  There is also a moroccan restaurant that you can pay an additional supplement to eat in we didn't do this during our brief stay as we were not impressed with the food on offer.  There are snacks from 4-6 which are great but as served and prepared outside there are flies all over them therefore the only things we went for were the fresh pancakes as you had to wait for them to be cooked and put straight on your plate.  The alcohol on offer was the main surprise as the wine is not normally something I find I am able to drink due to the quality but it was lovely and we made full use of this being available.    The Gym and indoor pool is only available at an additional cost per day which is not normal for a 5* hotel and isn't very useful when the weather isn't great as there are not many areas to go to stay warm and dry. You don't really want to sound the whole time in your hotel room.  We also found the Spa staff very rude and not willing to help in any way we were planning on having some treatments whilst there but firstly the cost was way over what you would pay even in a high end UK spa and secondly when the staff were rude to us we decided to save our money.    There are 2 pools one of which is heated and they are both very large and they were lovely the sun loungers are great but starting to look a little worn but we loved the large sharing beds. They do supply towels which you can exchange as many times as you lie through out the day but you have to pay a deposit for these when checking in but you get this back upon checking out of the hotel.    We cannot comment on the animation staff or what is on offer as we didn't participate in anything on offer whilst there.  We did take the free shuttle bus into town which you do have to pre book the day before to ensure you have a seat especially in high season.    I do have to say that I did get sick whilst there and suffered terribly but cannot say if it was food poisoning or a bug i picked up on the plane and feel it unfair to blame the hotel but also cannot 100% rule out that it wasn't something I got from the food and feel I should make people aware. Although one day we were talking at lunch too long and they started to clean it ready for dinner and we were massively impressed with how thorough they were with cleaning every surface including chair legs etc with watered down bleach so if i did get sick from the hotel it was not due to there cleaning standards as these are very high.    There are a few things about Marrakech we were unaware of that you may find useful:  - They do accept Euro's in the taxi's but not in the souk  - They speak basic English but are very good at French due to the high number of French tourists visiting the area so a basic understanding helps a lot  - If you buy currency when you arrive in Marrakech (as in the UK they have to order it in especially) you can exchange it back at the airport on your return journey at the same exchange rate and they will take all your coins and small change which is something we should have done as lost out on converting it back as we got it in the UK,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Walkern, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245JoE

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Anne-Marie H wrote a review Nov 2014,50,Fabulous,We spent a week at this hotel from 25th October and enjoyed every minute. We were slightly perplexed by some reviews but we needn't have worried. The rooms are large and very comfortable the staff extremely friendly and the food never ending and varied. We ventured out both using the transfer bus and taxis we also went on the hotel arranged trip into the Atlas Mountains which was a great experience.    There are lots activities to take part in if you choose we particularly enjoyed the aqua aerobics - however this can be avoided if you wish. We really enjoyed the hussle and bustle of the souks but enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere of the hotel away from the centre.    The main language of the hotel is French but we enjoyed trying to speak the language - however having said that when people realised we were English they immediately spoke English .For the price we paid this hotel is greta and am at loss why you wouldn't enjoy yourself here,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Aysgarth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773annemarieh

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Carole C wrote a review Nov 2014,30,Not 5*! Only just 4*,When I rated this hotel as only just a 4* it was after much thought! Where to start?  Well here goes. My husband and I wanted to treat out son and family to a holiday. Our son suggested Morocco as he had never been there. My husband did his homework as usual and we decided on this hotel after reading so many good reviews. We booked a week for the family but my husband decided that we would go for ten days so that we could familiarise ourselves with the hotel plus make sure that the family were in a riad near to ours if not in the same one.  My husband went to the Reception staff on the days following our arrival to ensure that the two rooms booked for our son his wife and Grandsons  were actually next to each other. He was assured that they would do their very best. On the Friday afternoon prior to our family's arrival he was told that they had marked two rooms together in the raid near to ours in the 600 block (we were in 900).  On the Saturday night after a long hold up at the airport our family arrived at about 9.30pm. They booked in and what a total fiasco they had to endure!! They were given two rooms. One in the 100 riad. The other in the 200 riad!!! That meant that my son would be in one of them with one of his sons and our daughter in law would be in the other riad with the other son!!! When they pointed out that it was unacceptable it was suggested by one of the staff that two of them could be booked into the other Kenzi hotel a couple of miles up the road!!! What a total joke! After all this the Restaurant was closed as it was 10.00pm so they couldn't even get a meal!! So we all retired really stressed and was at Reception early the next morning where they were then allocated the two rooms  in the 600 riad!! Bad start to their holiday!  So onto other things. The Reception is light and airy and always smelled really nice. The two girls on the desk that impressed us with their English were Myriam and Chima. They were most helpful when it became neccasary . The rooms are large spacious  and the bed we had was really large. We did see three rooms in our riad being redecorated as they became empty! The staff are cleaning  all the time! Our Housekeeper was a lovely girl and kept our room nice.  The food! There were beef lamb chicken and veg Taguines every day! There were lovely salads and fresh fruit. Every day there was a meat or fish special cooked. One day it was Tuna. A full massive Tuna that the Chef cut the steaks off and cooked in front of you! Having said all that we did get fed up of seeing the same foods day after day! And yes as one reviewer wrote the chicken was sometimes raw in the middle! My husband got sick one day. My son had a tummy upset and I  also had a poorly tummy! Heat maybe. Flies maybe . Undercooked food maybe. Who can tell?? Because of the French influence in Morocco we would have loved to have seen Beef Bourguignon or Chicken Chassuer etc instead of the Taguines twice a day! Also in the Restaurant the children as young as around 5yrs were allowed to wander carrying food or drink!! We actually saw a toddler riding a little bike around the tables whilst people walked past with their food and the waiters tried to clear tables! Not good parenting! Not acceptable in a Restaurant!!  The Animation Team! Well they always seemed to be busy but truthfully not once in 10 days were we approached by any of them to ask us to join in the activities! They did work hard at night times to keep you entertained however. We feel that there is more than enough activities boules  archery shooting etc etc plus the pools or just walking the grounds to keep you occupied should you so wish. The pool areas are large and not overcrowded with enough sunbeds for everyone.  Would we go back again? Probably not! If Management want to retain their 5* standard. They need to make sure that what happened to our family does not happen to other guests!!  I have written this review as honestly as I can. I usually do!! People might not agree with me but everyone sees things differently!  I will be happy to answer any questions that you might like to ask,Date of stay: November 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cheshire, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caroley60
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sallywallyBS wrote a review Nov 2014,30,Not the best experience,We have just returned from a week at the Agdal Medina. We have travelled a lot and were disappointed with the check in. No drink offered (after the airport passport experience this was needed). and the member of staff did not have good English. We were therefore taken to our room feeling completely uninformed. The very large complex is geared very much to families with the predominant language being French. The food was nicely presented and perfectly edible but lacked variety or imagination. The restaurant felt like a canteen with often a lack of plates or cutlery. The only bar was used for children entertainment until about 9 each evening. The area around the pool was fine with adequate loungers.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Furryflaps wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Great winter sun trip,I booked a 4 night short stay via Qwerty Travel for my wife's birthday. The package was all inclusive and included an upgrade to the A La Carte Restaurant for 1 night . I have to say that it was the first time we booked an all inclusive package at a resort but we were pleasantly surprised. The flights were with Easy jet and despite the rumours everything went well.    On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a doorman who offered us mint tea  dates and water. The complex seems new and has been built to a high standard. We were shown to our room and given information about the times for food etc along with facilities such as the spa  entertainments complex.    This resort is very French biased only 1 member of reception spoke any English but that was great as I got to practice my French. The majority of other guests were French or French speaking and initially the entertainment staff also spoke french / Arabic however when they discovered we were English they ensured we were made welcome each evening and included us in the fun and games. I have to say that the entertainment staff were exceptional and we became friends with them in the short time we were there.    The room was spacious and very comfortable  the view was somewhat interesting as this is clearly an area that is being developed. So a few new buildings going up but also a lot of waste land with guys herding goats around looking for food. The room was cleaned daily to a high standard.    The main restaurant area provided a large quantity and variety of food  from traditional tagines to more western style dishes of pizza and fries.. There was also a theme each evening where the chefs showcased a different cooking region / style. The food was produced fresh everyday and we couldn't fault anything with breakfast . lunch and dinner all being included. It did have a slight feel of a canteen at breakfast / lunch time but that was the only thing we could find that wasn't first class.    The pools were clean and had plenty of places to sit / lay and relax. There were opportunities to do sports / activities but as it was a chillaxing break we took in the chance to absorb some sunshine and admire the view of the Atlas mountains in the distance. The pool bar served cocktails  beer  coffee all day and although not branded spirits the cocktails tasted great.    All in all we found we had a relaxing 4 days without any major issues with very polite and courteous staff. The only issues we had were with the reception staff being a little frosty when we couldn't communicate well enough as my French was not up to standard and we never got out upgrade for the restaurant as it had already been fully booked by a conference party for the week. We will go back out of season again for another short break.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newton Abbot, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Furryflaps
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,AdamSomerset wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Lovely hotel,My wife and I visited here in June. On arrival first impressions were good. The hotel is big and imposing and immaculate from the outside. We were greeted by a luggage boy who showed us through reception while taking care of our cases. The receptionist was warm and friendly explaining everything we needed to know about the hotel. After filling out the check-in paperwork (bit long-winded) we were shown to our room by the luggage boy. As the hotel is rather large we were taken for a little ride on something akin to a golf cart. Enroute to the room the luggage boy was very informative pointing out the restaurant on-site shops etc.... Our room was lovely; good size beautifully clean with all the necessary amenities. The public areas were clean and well kept the pools especially. Sunbeds were never an issue even for the later risers. The main restaurant was excellent with probably the biggest choice of food I've ever experienced at any hotel. As a veggie I am sometimes limited for choice but not here. The veggie choice was every bit as extensive as for the meat lovers and the quality was really really good. My only gripe would be that the restaurant could get very busy at certain times and there wasn't the staff to cope. On a few occasions we couldn't find a prepared table having to clear then prepare our own. This really wasn't the waiters' fault as they all seemed to work hard there simply wasn't enough of them at peak times. Service not really conducive to a hotel of the this standard. However the food was worth the inconvenience as it was very good. We ate in the speciallity Moroccan restaurant and this was great. The staff were so friendly working very hard to ensure we had a good experience. There is a small supplement to pay to visit this restaurant but it is worth every penny as it's a change from the buffet restaurant and great to be served for a change. We really enjoyed our stay and should we go back to Marrakech I would definitely consider this hotel.  One tip not related to the hotel - arrange a private transfer from the airport. This was very quick and not much more expensive than the shared transfer. We heard a few people grumble about the shared shuttle service taking a long time.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Torrevieja, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdamSomerset
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,evans1975 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Don't get sick there,"My overall marks for the hotel are average to good as this if due to the hotel itself and the staff.  However location is a lowly one as we never actually left the grounds as we were both sick at different points during our stay (my mistake - my partner left the hotel to go to the local pharmacy for me).  Our first 2 days were great. Lovely surroundings and good weather. A great pool for swimming and all the staff were very friendly.  However I got food poisoning on our 3rd night (as a nurse I know the symptoms versus those of an infective gastroenteritis)- this left me feeling like hell and with no energy to do very much. By the time I got over it and was able to eat something other than bread or drink something other than water- my partner then got sick a day later.  Same pattern of quite amazingly explosive bodily expulsions four hours after eating another dinner at the hotel.  I hadn't complained after I was sick as put it down to bad luck and was able to manage my symptoms. However both of us was inexcusable so I asked to speak with the manager. I got fobbed off with a ""liaison officer"" who was no help at all and did not really try to hide the fact that she didn't believe me. Just because no one else had complained she saw my story as unbelievable.  This ruined our holiday as we saw the airport the hotel and the airport again a week later.    Be careful with the buffet is all I can say. Even though the blunt liaison officer harped on about their excellent kitchen standards at great length it came as no surprise that on the last night (when admittedly I was taking some chicken for one of the  hotel cats) - said chicken was not cooked through and raw in the middle.  A lovely French couple sat next to us got chatting and were so unimpressed with the cooking they had called home and put in a shopping lust with their daughter ""for some proper food when we get home""    Overall it was the managements response that has jaded my view of this holiday. We had 2 full days together in the sun in a beautiful hotel and thank god were both fit to fly.

I understand French but can't speak it. I don't want to play the discrimination card but seriously at this point I have to. We got in at 211 from the other (MUCH BETTER) Kenzi hotel the Kenzi Menara because we thought we would have kids play with the water slides before we left. We have one full day here (yes still here unfortunately). Rooms weren't going to be ready until 230 yesterday which is standard. We had a trip scheduled for the mountains so we didn't get to properly check in until 730. Well still no towels. We called saying we needed towels. The cleaning lady was right by us and she gave us 2...but there were 5 of us. So we called in again. They said 30mins. We went to dinner. Hung out in the dance club where they had the kids dancing. Got back around 11 still no towels. Whatever.    Went to breakfast after showering (and we all had to share the two towels amongst us). Was planning on going to the pool area right after since that was the main reason we made the hotel switch for kids to enjoy slides today. Well they need a deposit for towels. I went to reception with my bank card. They wouldn't help me because they only took cash. I explained we only had one day and wouldn't use the currency again. Lady went to manager next to her and came back to tell me he said we could have the money exchanged at the airport. We would lose money that way though so i didn't do it neither was i going to take out 150 Moroccan dirham FOR EACH PERSON out of the cash machine for stupid pool towels we were only going to use for a few hours. Manager Tahal (or whatever his name is) wouldn't even do anything to show understanding instead he said ""well you're here. You have to do cash"". Idiot. The lady suggested to use room towels. I explained they'd been used and we only had 2 to start with and haven't received a full set since we checked in. She said they'd send it right away. Went back to my room. An hour and a half later still no towels. I decided to check in on the rest of the family in case they had died from hypothermia (slide pool is FREEZING). On the way I found a housekeeping lady and asked for three towels and took those with me.    Everyone else is great. Food was blah considering we came from a much better resort but like I said we are here for the kids...even they weren't find of the food. Thankfully we leave tomorrow. Our initial plan to come back here for New Year with friends and extended family from the US is definitely NOT going to happen now. Oh and no wifi in our room at all. As with what everyone else said. I normally wouldn't care but for crying out loud. ONE DAY they could've made an effort to care enough to at least give us freakish bath towels when they said they would. Instead it's taken a whole day as it is. And the pool towels seriously? Obviously the guy just cared about money...unless you spoke French or Arabic I suppose. Coffee is terrible. But I guess that's the bad taste of a memory that awful man has left with me.    Mehh.    Past 4 went back to room. It was cleaned but STILL no towels!? I called and called. Twice told 3 and 5 minutes. Half an twenty minutes later I called and asked to speak with the manager. i instead spoke with the Asst Manager a nice lady finally I told her what the issue was and she made sure I received towels.

Layout of the hotel was superb with brilliant activities and facilities for youngsters (eg 2 pools football basketball tennis and archery to name a few). Food was delicious at the All you can eat buffet. Also a very desirable short trip to the buzzing Medina. However the new entertainment is no way near as good with Spyder and co far better than what it is now.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lawrence R wrote a review Oct 2014,50,Another great escape [from the UK],Our party of 20 children and adults had a great time - for the 3rd time.    What makes our stay so pleasurable is that it was hot - 36C [when its cold ands windy in the UK] the hotel is spacious well laid out and generally well kept the rooms are cleaned to a high std and the service in parts is exceptional.    We had 2 birthdays and an anniversary for the group and they prepared beautifully decorated tables big personalised cakes and did a bit of singing each time - and the people who looked after us on a daily basis did a great job - I will mention Rachid Lachgar who facilitated all this and also served us.....friendly pleasant unobtrusive but delivering special touches that really enhanced the holiday.    As a tip to those thinking of going there - talk to the staff....it pays dividends.    This year we felt that some of the food budget had been diverted to improved entertainment upgraded cocktails and wine [which was fine!] the food is still good and amply supplied with a little less variety.    The hotel is very French - 95% but we like it as we can't really understand what's happening and particularly when there is a small disagreement between friends!    We like Marrakech more and more - it's slightly crazy in the town and you have to take it in your stride but each year we feel more at comfortable with the contrast with our well order lives in the UK.,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Shepshed, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawrenceR44
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Esther P wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Great stay!,GOOD POINTS:    The hotel itself is very nice - spacious rooms lovely swimming pools plenty of sunbeds etc.    The staff are very friendly always happy to help.    The location is perfect. 15/20 minutes away from the airport & 10/15 minutes away to the city centre. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the city centre but even if you want to take a taxi it will only cost around 50 dirhams/5 euro max. (don't be afraid to haggle and make sure you don't pay more than this. Always agree a price with the taxi driver before you get in the taxi).    Good entertainment: dancing classes cookery classes aquagym football volleyball etc.    Free wi fi    Very clean    NOT SO GOOD POINTS:    The food is okay but not great. It's a buffet and you just help yourself. As I said the food is not too bad but it gets a little bit repetitive after a few days. One of the nights we had dinner in the Moroccan restaurant of the hotel (extra 100 dirhams / 10 euro per person). The food here was amazing but it's a set menu same everyday so you might not want to eat here more than once or twice. One of the nights we asked the reception if we could order some food to the hotel from outside as we were bored of the buffet and they were happy to help.    The entertainment in general was good the only thing is that most nights they play only French music (old songs that only French native speakers would know) so I wish they had played more variety of music or even more international radio music that everybody knows. Same French songs every night it gets a little bit boring...

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gaz H wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Turn the volume down,I stayed here for nine nights in September 2014. The hotel itself is nice. The pools were very big but as a result didn't warm up and weren't well used during my time there. The food was pretty good and if you're only going for a very short stay you are in for a treat. After nine nights It was really repetitive. The drinks were decent.    The hotel was in my opinion let down by the staff. None of them were overly friendly and many of them looked bored to tears to be there. We tried tipping some of the staff to see if that would cheer them up and in fairness it seemed to work but then they seemed to expect the same tip everyday. It made for one very awkward dinner when I showed up with no money.    We found the animation team/ organised events to be awful. They play their terrible music at top volume for most of the day which means that this is not a peaceful place to holiday. There was no getting away from the music but on the plus side I know all the words to “a line dance party”. The events are aimed at the French market which I have no problem with however when they weren't playing music they were offering commentary on the darts match/putting game or whatever else was going on. Again this commentary was at the top of the volume range and was even more unrelaxing that the music.    Our room was fine and we were happy to find a fairly decent English channel showing movies. There isn't really anything to do in the vicinity of the hotel. We walked a couple of times to the nearby shopping centre which had a bowling alley. The bus into town was a decent service but I felt it couldn't have went a little more frequently.    Overall the hotel is fine. If they turned the animation music/microphone down I would recommend it. Otherwise if you're looking for a quiet relaxing break Id check somewhere else. I have not been so glad to check out of a hotel in years but in fairness we think we stayed here too long.    Ps always negotiate with the taxi drivers before getting in. They will still rob you but at least you'll know how bad it will be. Given that the hotel is so far away from the town this was a real issue for us.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Belfast, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GazH_11
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CityPuss wrote a review Oct 2014,30,Some Truth in Other Reviews,Just returned from a five day break to the Kenzi Club. Having read a number of the reviews prior to going here's my honest feedback as a regular traveller:    Fact - the hotel is a 4 star and not a 5 star - the finishing touches of a 5 star are missing  Fact - there are a lot of French people there but then it is only 3 hours from France and French is the local language! But all guests were pleasant.  Fact - the reception staff are very curt I feel this is due to their grasp of English those that spoke more fluent English were better than the main French speakers  Fact - there is a lot of food to choose from the food isn't hot enough but I suppose that's to do with feeding the 5000!  Fact - the hotel is kept very clean (always cleaning) as someone said although there were lots of wasps and flys around the snack bar.  Fact - close to Marrakech 15 min drive 15 min drive to airport  Generally our stay was ok the pools were freezing cold so no-one was in them and the indoor pool wasn't heated. The spa and gym are lovely even though you had to pay a few dirhams for the use of it. The spa treatment we had was ok nothing special but the girls on reception were friendly. If you arrive after 10 pm as we unfortunately did due to a wait of an 1 1/2 in immigration call them in advance as there is no room service and literally nothing to eat.    Would I stay there again honestly no just not for me but as a good standard hotel its fine. One good thing you can get free wifi in most of the rooms we got it in ours full strength room 627. Not great views though!!,Date of stay: October 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CityPuss
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kipims wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Great Hotel but very average food,Had 7 night at The Kenzi Club Agdal Medina hotel which is an all inclusive resort. Great location Friendly staff lovely grounds and pool. Rooms are comfortable and spacious with a couple of english speaking TV chanels. Do remember 5* Morrocan is not 5* UK/US but its nice. Sadley the food is not great. Bland and pretty much the same every day. I got to the point that I just couldn't eat much at all and came home having lostr weight. I'm a big foodie and love taste and spice and this is not the place for me. I've given it 4 stars even though I probably won't return because of the food. The evening entertainment is fantastic and if you're so so about food then go as you'll love it. Drink the Rose wine as it's good and beer is fine too. They have a free shuttle to the City Centre too.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kipims

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Elizabeth456 wrote a review Oct 2014,40,An enjoyable stay,I stayed last month for 5 days and had a nice relaxing break.    The majority of guests were french but there were a few english.    Our room was lovely we were given a suite which was huge not a 5* but still a very nice room.    The food was ok got a bit boring but it was nice being offered a bottle of wine with your dinner and the waiters outside were always friendly. The spirits however were horrible so we stuck to wine and beer.    The annimation team did get a bit annoying encouraging us to get up to dance etc i think they would have got the message that we just werent interested but its still nice to feel included and i did enjoy watching.    It was a bit annoying having to pay to use the safe and a deposit for towels i feel these should be included in your stay.    The weather was great and we were glad we chose this hotel and would stay again.,Date of stay: September 2014,,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elizabeth456
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Straya wrote a review Oct 2014,40,Exquisite but helpful if you speak French,I've stayed twice in the last few years and am due to go back in a couple of weeks. Marrakech is a wonderful place but as hot and exotic the hustle and bustle of Place Jemaal Al Fnaa is this hotel is the extreme opposite. It is wonderfully calm and cool (particularly in the public areas which blast fantastically air-con and smell of orange blossom!)    I loved the three pools and and the beautifully designed rooms with cream marble floors white crisp linen and dark wood furniture. The food is great all day and cliché I know but there really is something for even the fussiest of eaters to enjoy. All-inclusive means all inclusive. The Moroccan red wine and beer are great but I don't think the bar staff are expert mixologists for cocktails. Waaay too much booze and some sickly sugary additive. Got me hammered tho and I ended up having a great night dancing in Pacha Marrakech up the road!    I'm half Moroccan so have been going to many hotels in Marrakech over the years but I'd have to say this is one of my favourites. Not everyone speaks English though those who do love to practise. Non-French speakers may feel frustrated however especially if mishaps occur (as it did with us with our booking). It really helps to gen up before you go.    Downside: Food stops at 10pm which if flying from Manchester on Easyjet means you may not be able to get anything at all on arrival. Boots Meal-Deal it up before you go!  Also the poolside animation team were a little annoying at first. Beer helps.  Location is a bit out of the way.    Plus-side: Food demonstrations; nightly traditional Moroccan dancing and cirque-de-soleil-esque entertainment in the evening; the ace buggies which drive you to your room; free shuttle buses (mercedes minibus) to take you to town and back throughout the day; Rose-petals on the bed abd in the bathroom; poolside covered loungers; close proximity to Pacha Marrakech    Top tip: pay a local Grand Taxi outside 150MAD to take you around the sites and wait for you at stop-off points such as YSL's Jardin Marjorelle. He'll end up taking you to his mate's spice shop for commission but it's really worth going there anyway.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Terelli81 wrote a review Sep 2014,40,A lovely stay in Marrakech but some little improvements needed,On arrival we were impressed with the exterior of the hotel and were greeted with the collection of our luggage and a cool drink while we waited to check in. The lobby is beautiful as are the hotel grounds which are big immaculately clean and well kept. The room was spacious with pleasant decor but we were disappointed at having twin beds pushed together having requested a double room. There were some complimentary toiletries but not to the standard you might expect from a 5 star hotel. The room was kept lovely and clean by housekeeping who work hard and nothing is too much of a problem so thank you to them. The waiters etc. also work very hard and are very attentive helpful and go out of their way to assist you with any request which we appreciated. The food was just okay and could be of a higher standard but was certainly plentiful. Desserts looked nice but were frankly awful bland and very poor in quality. On a positive note we got quite a taste for Moroccan wine which was served by the bottle at lunch and dinner.    Bad points/improvement points: The cocktails are horrific and do not in any way resemble visually or in taste that of what they are meant to be. They are cheap and nothing at all what you would expect in a five star hotel so do yourself a favour and stick to wine beer etc that is if you have any comprehension of what cocktails are actually meant to taste like.    Animation team: Now don't get me wrong they are super friendly and clearly trying hard but it's just sooooo tacky and cheesy and lacks any sort of class or sophistication you'd expect in a five star resort and resulted in us staying away from the main bar at night as you couldn't escape the noise and irritation of Michael Jackson tribute nights etc which was cringing at best. It also felt like during the day/evening the DJ has 10 songs on his playlist that he played over and over and over again. There was one evening that they had some traditional entertainment i.e. Moroccan Gnawa etc and this was the only thing we enjoyed.    Al la carte restaurant: The service and ambience was impeccable but the food was awful. The main course consisted of throwing sausage lamb chicken and all sorts into a tagine and didn't taste great and was perhaps made for someone who had never had tagine and probably wouldn't everest it again if they tasted that. However like I said the ambience service and in particular guy who played the Oud while we ate was superb - too bad about the food.    Pool towels; unlike any other five star resort i've stayed in these guys make you pay a 150 dirham deposit (roughly £7) per towel and you have to collect them with a token and get your token back when you hand them in. Every five star hotel I've stayed in simply replaces your towels each day in your room.    Having said all this most things felt like minor points as we personally often went out and enjoyed real and authentic moroccan cuisine and entertainment which the hotel certainly isn't serving up. Again a beautiful hotel with first class service from the staff in tranquil surroundings which made our stay very enjoyable.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terelli81
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Chris K wrote a review Sep 2014,50,"A great hotel, even if you don't speak French!",My partner and I have just returned from this hotel having spent a week there. We noticed the hotel was advertised with Thomas Cook and had received positive reviews but saved ourselves literally hundreds of pounds by booking our flights with easyJet and the hotel direct. The hotel is literally 5 minutes from the airport so the cost of the return transfers were £25. We arrived late on Friday evening and were immediately offered a glass of water and invited to go straight for dinner as we had had a long trip. We then checked in to our room which are separated in to individual blocks. The room itself was of a high standard although I would tend to agree with other posters that it doesn't quite reach the advertised 5 star levels. The bed is very comfortable and there were 2 pillows per person with extra in the wardrobe the bath/shower was very powerful and the water always hot. The downsides were that you have to pay 3dh per day for use of the safe which although inexpensive is inconvenient. There also was an absence of any tea/coffee making facilities or an iron which we had to call housekeeping for daily. Nonetheless the rooms were kept spotless and I frequently saw the housemaids cleaning the room floors.    The hotel itself is very well presented and the grounds are immaculately kept. There is always somebody tending the grass cleaning the pool or clearing the tables. Fortunately we went during term time so there were hardly any children about which was great. I would have to disagree with the Xenophobes on here regarding the primary language spoken at the hotel and indeed in Morocco in general. Is it unreasonable that a former French colony converses in the tongue from the Motherland in the same way it might be unreasonable that they speak English in Canada or Australia? Fortunately I can speak French to a point so was able to fumble through however the majority of the staff speak Arabic French English and German so I think most people could find a language to suit. As per the previous point the majority of the guests to tend to be from France so most of the entertainment is chiefly presented in French. As most of the entertainment is focused around musical shows this wasn't much of a problem because most of the music was from British and American artists anyway!    The swimming pool area is spotless and there are a number of comfortable loungers and Cabannahs for people to relax in. There is a pool bar open during the day serving a nice selection of hot and cold drinks. The choice of alcohol was sufficient and there was no scrimping on the measures which is always welcome! During the day the entertainment team try to rouse those in slumber around the pool to take part in their 'Animation Programme.' This usually meant a rather awkward looking dance around the pool to generate some interest for the days activities. Unsurprisingly the French lapped it up and were usually the first to participate in the aqua aerobics French Bowls and Dance lessons. The reserved British guests I noticed tended to bury their heads in their books or pretended to be asleep so as not to get dragged up to the front! I would recommend getting to the pool early if you want to A get a decent sun lounger and B grab a nice comfortable pillow to go with it. I also had a massage in the Spa which was very good value for money and recommended.    The hotel serves 3 main meals a day and 2 snack times if three times at the all you can eat trough isn't quite enough. The food itself was superbly cooked if a little lacking in choice. After a few days of eating we found ourselves sticking to a staple of Pizza Paninis chips and pasta - perhaps I'm just fussy? At lunchtime we sat outside on the terrace and were duly served drinks. Don't be afraid to ask for a whole bottle of wine to go with your meal- if you drink it all the offer of a second bottle will usually be made! The only slight annoyances regarding the eating experience were the hastiness of the waiting staff to remove your plate usually before one has finished eating and the fact that they do not appear to be top keen on giving metal spoons to diners. This does somewhat make eating desserts with tiny plastic spoons difficult. The only other gripe which I guess cannot be avoided when you are cooking food in a food eating hall is that whenever we eat inside our clothes stuck of grease once we had left. This wasn't a major issue as in the end I wore used clothes to go to dinner.    Overall the hotel was excellent and although I don't tend to make a habit of returning to the same hotel twice I would strongly recommend this hotel. I can't comment if it would be suitable for families my guess is that perhaps you would need to find your own entertainment for your children but as a couple it is the perfect chill out.,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Maldon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/252chrisk

The rooms were nice & spacious but only adequate in every other aspect. because in a five star establishment you would not expect to pay for a safe the bathroom there were only shower gel/shampoo soap & towel It lacked the refinements associated with ""5stars""  Other than that the grounds/pools were immaculate & clean all the staff very friendly especially the animation team. Who worked very hard all day & at night put together some very brilliant entertainment.  The main restaurant was adequate if not a bit chaotic at times. The all inclusive drinks were ok it would have been better if the bar staff were more knowledgeable on cocktails.

Hotel is more a kind of resort buildings in the beautiful garden. Personnel is lovely and really willing to help as much as they can. Animation and activities enough they do their best and are really good. The evening shows are professional and touch various themes.  Hotel is family friendly lots of activities for kids. Most of it in French but if necessary also in English.  Buffet restaurant is good enough choice; some may experience that the choice is the same every day. It might be but there is enough to choose and if you don't eat every day everything presented on the shelves you have lovely hygienic and healthy meals. I enjoyed it.  2 swimming pools: for quiet sport swimmers and a Laguna pool for families elder children activities fun!    Rooms are very good - not outstanding luxury but definitely cozy well equipped and spacious! Some do have sun some don't; if you go in the winter I would assume sunny room would be somewhat warmer in the early morning.

Also there is a nightclub on the complex so you can get a drink after 11.30pm in which you have to pay for drinks which is a little expensive there wasn't many people in which was down to the entertainment staff because they don't tell anyone it's there we found by accident!

At first my friends and I were dismayed at check in because they had informed us that we only booked a quadruple room for two people. After much discussion and trying to understand each other's side the supervisor/manager had told us to just relax and enjoy and he would take care of the paperworks with Expedia (which my friend had book the room from). After two days we came into the room with roses and rose petals all over our bed and sweets on the table. What a way to show their hospitable concerns. Location was good.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Stuart M wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Excellent Value For Money,My partner and I booked this holiday for relaxation sun food and booze. All 4 were of a plenty and to top it off we get excellent service a nice room and access to daily / nightly entertainment (if required). We are a young English couple and although there were a lot of French they were all very pleasant and there were also plenty of English couples around the complex. Access to the bar during the day was easy keeping a choice of beer coffee pop juice and spirits flowing. My favourite part of the holiday had to be the food. Wow the food. Every day had a different theme for evening meal and there was always plenty of other options including fish meats salads pizza tajjines rices potatoes pastas and deserts. There are 5 meal times breakfast snack lunch snack main meal. We enjoyed a bootle of wine chilled next to our table every evening meal. It's hard to really express the variation choice level of service and standard of the food here but it really did excel and will suit all ages.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kearney31 wrote a review Sep 2014,40,"Great fun, brilliant weather and lovely hotel",My sister and I just spent 8 days in this hotel and had a really great time. The surrounding area is dry and a bit desolate in places so in comparison this was something of an Oasis.    We were given towels and a refreshing drink upon arrival we had to wait a while for the room but we spent that time looking around. When it was ready a very helpful man took our bags and drove us on his golf buggy to our room.    From that point on it was almost perfect. Yes the music during the day could get a bit loud and the house spirits would probably be put to better use fueling a car but the room was lovely we came back every afternoon to a new decoration on our bed and the man who cleaned our room was so smiley. The waiters were always ready to find us a table and get us whatever we needed while we went to get food and the food itself was lovely we had omelettes every morning and there was always plenty of fruit and fresh salad which is all you really want in that heat. Overall the staff were friendly and helpful and the Animation team were great and full of energy.    Special thanks to Kimo and Mido for getting us up to dance and thoroughly entertaining us.    We went to the spa which was lovely and i used the gym which whilst a bit limited was very cool and had enough facilities to give you some reasonable exercise.    We met some great people over the week and I would definitely go back and i hear they are open all year so who knows!,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kearney31
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,amandypandy wrote a review Sep 2014,30,"Average. Not great for small kids. Great if you like booze, noise and dirt.","I visited this hotel based on the wonderful reviews on here and Expedia. I could be the wrong sort of customer or just have high standards but I do not see what the fuss is about it was quite average.    Not to be too down about this hotel it does have some great points. For starters most of the staff are lovely. The girls on reception especially were friendly and very helpful. Everyone was very accommodating to us (as travellers with a one year old). The hotel also has three amazing pools. The main ""lagoon"" is huge and it also has a adult pool for lengths which was great. The grounds are also really pretty and well kept. Considering the surrounding area is barren nothingness they have made a great attempt to create an oasis which you wont want to leave. They also have a daily (free) shuttle bus which goes to the centre of Marrakesh. Certainly much better than getting a no seat-belted metal heaps on wheels (also known as a taxi).  Now with the negatives. This is perhaps not a hotel to come to with a small child. Firstly the music the booming non stop awful music which is played what felt like 24 hours a day. If you want to sit back in peace by the pool with a book this is not the place for you. It is also not great if you have a sleeping baby. The lowlight was perhaps on one night when they had a wedding and we had to endure not just the music from the ""entertainment"" but music from a wedding. The second thing that was not great was the cleanliness. I don't understand how a hotel that is so tidy (no litter anywhere despite the lack of bins) could be so dirty. No matter what the cleaner did to our room the floor left a thick grey layer of dirt on my feet and on our crawling child's hands. The toilet from what I gathered was never bleached when the cleaners came (and smelt pungent on day 6!). The room itself was a good size but I think the pillows were made with some sort of cotton wool/lead hybrid and the sink didn't work (we had to empty it every time but fiddling with the metal underneath.  And lastly the food. It didn't bother my husband he thought it was ok good selection and lots of options for a one year old (fruit and salads etc). It all got a bit samey after a while and it was very bland. The pasta bar was my saviour. I think the chefs did much better with the food on Moroccan night cooking what they perhaps know best. I think their failure here was catering for the ""international"" market which mostly meant the French so it was all very bland non spicy boring stuff. Oh the wine and beer were ok just could have done with bigger glasses ;-)  Lastly I would warn about their liberal use of ""all inclusive"". If you want nicer food you have to pay extra to go to another restaurant. You also have to pay for the gym (about 10 euros a time) and the sauna etc. You also have to pay for the safe in your room which is really cheeky.    Overall this is probably a great hotel if you are young single want a few drinks and occasionally pop to the centre. Not so great if you are travelling with young kids other than the pool there is not a lot for them to do. The one playground is near the pool in the blazing sun with no shade so that was out. I would recommend the Salle de Conferences though - large carpeted area where kids and crawlers can play away on tables and chairs. Although perhaps not what it was intended for!!",Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Brussels, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandypandy
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Alison3965 wrote a review Sep 2014,40,Good base in Marrakech,We returned from Hotel Kenzi Club Agdal Medina at the end of August. We stayed for a week for my daughters 21st birthday. On arrival we were greeted by cold towels and lovely refreshing drink however we arrived early in the morning and were told our rooms would not be ready until 2.30pm.  We were upgraded from a double room to a suite which had a separate lounge area and fabulous big bathroom and also a second separate toilet.  If you want to use the safe in your room it is approx 20 euros for the week which is non-refundable you also have to pay for the sun bed towels however this is refundable at the end of the week.  If you do a currency exchange at the hotel remember to keep your receipt as you will need this if you have any money left at the end of the week to exchange it at the airport.  The hotel was lovely the grounds keep very well and the pool areas were all clean if you can try and get a Cabana as the sun beds are very uncomfortable and have no pads on them. If you cannot get a cabana try and get hold of some cushions from the cabana’s for the sun beds. There is an entertainment team at the hotel that provide daily activities but it seemed they were more interested in themselves and their own bodies (stripping off daily down to just shorts) to show off their bodies even one of the female entertainers (Thomas Cook I think) who usually looked after the children stripped down to her bra one day whilst the teenagers were playing water volleyball!!  The restaurant is very repetitive and unless you get there early there is not much food left it is impossible to get a tea spoon for your coffee or tea in the morning and it is pot luck if coffee is put on your table. Having said that the waiters we had were very friendly.  We used the spa and had a massage it was lovely and worth the money.  We were very disappointed on my daughters birthday having brought some champagne from duty free to celebrate we asked on 3 occasions for 2 champagne glasses to be put in our room but these never arrived they also forgot to put her birthday cake in our room as I had agreed with then on the day!!!!  Reception is a little hit and miss if you are English however Myriam was amazing she was attentive professional and did what she said she was going to do.  The hotel is very central for the Souks and the bus from the hotel goes regularly but remember to book you place because some times are very busy and beware the bus does not drop you off at the square it about 5 mins walk from the drop off and you will have lots of people offering to guide you when you get off the bus for 50 euro.  We also went quad biking in the desert with Quad Evasion Marrakech who were fantastic they were professional and the day was amazing. We also went for a day cooking course with L atelier Faim d Epices again a really amazing day and worth the money transport is included in the prices and you will have a fabulous time.  All in all a lovely week and a great base from which to explore what Marrakech has to offer.,Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Swindon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alison3965
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Laura W wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Fantastic hotel with brilliant staff,"Having just returned from this hotel after a week's break we feel compelled to write a review on this fabulous hotel.    Located about a 10-15 minute drive from Marrakech airport and the main Medina area the hotel is situated in a good area.    Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by friendly reception staff who offered us a refreshing glass of mint water before checking us in. Having arrived quite early we were expecting to be told that we could not check in but this was not the case. Our rooms were ready and we were taken by golf buggy to our ""Riad"". The driver of the golf buggy pointed out where several of the amenities and main areas were before helping us with our luggage to the room. All was very efficient and friendly.    The rooms were spacious and cleaned to high standards every day. The bathroom did however lack in some complementary amenities which you normally see in a 5* rated hotel. This however did not detract from the holiday in any shape or form.    The restaurant was large and well maintained. The staff were very friendly and always made an effort to engage in conversation with you which we found to be a nice touch. The food as with any all inclusive was slightly monotonous but we could not fault the quality. There was lots of choice available and most people would be able to find something to eat. The selections of salads was lovely and there were plenty of different tagines to try everyday as well as your usual pizza pasta chips etc.    A special mention has to go out to the animation team who were brilliant. For us their enthusiasm and general work ethic really made the holiday. They put on a variety of activities throughout the day ( darts archery dance class cooking lessons aquagym step aerobics etc) and never pushed you to participate if you did not want to. We however took part in a variety of activities and thoroughly enjoyed them. At night the animation team went above and beyond to put on some truly fantastic shows. We have stayed at many an all inclusive hotel and this animation team were by far the best we have ever encountered. Several of the team  we excellent dancers and we very much enjoyed watching them perform and dancing with them too.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,l l wrote a review Sep 2014,40,good value for money,"We stayed here as a family (19 and 17 year old ""children"") and found it very good value. The accommodation was all extremely clean and very pleasant. We had a quad room which had a large main bedroom and bathroom and a smaller sitting area with a separate toilet which was useful. The beds in this area were not really suitable for adult sized people though and my son was a little grumpy.  All staff tried hard to be helpful although sometimes lacked a little sense of urgency (we did go at end of ramadan /festival time though so fair enough).  Food was plentiful and fresh cooked counters were very good. Rest as you would expect from mass catering although bread and juice stood out at meals as being better than normal. Wine was perfectly drinkable and proper brand soft drinks. Cocktails were hopeless better to stick with rose. Coffee and snacks good.    Poolside area spacious and pools well maintained. Grounds lovely. Sunbeds were bagged very early by rude inconsiderate people who sometimes did not bother to use them at all. I was very tempted to chuck their towels away! This should be policed by the poolside people.    To those who have moaned - if you want English food don't go abroad! It is not a five star to UK standards but it would not be at this price so be real it is to a good 4 star (nicer than most Marriotts for example) and the weather is fantastic. Dont be rude to the staff you probably earn more in a month than they do in a year. Remember to tip the room cleaners.    Dont forget to go and see the place you are staying in.    Safety etc. I went with teenage daughter and we were wary but had no problems at all and we visited souks at night twice went quad biking and on a trip to see the berbers. Just be respectful it's not nice to show too much flesh or be unruly. The taxi drivers can be a real pain though dont let them hassle you agree a price (and make sure it is for all of you) and dont pay more. There is a lot of misinformation about taxis only taking 3 passengers we used lots and they always took all 4 of us with no questions.    Would recommend especially for families with expensive teenage drinkers and eaters! they both enjoyed themselves too.",Date of stay: August 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,cambridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luluCambridge
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Nic B wrote a review Sep 2014,40,Perfect place for R&R,We booked the hotel for some R&R following our trek in the High Atlas & weren’t disappointed. It's a great place for sun worshipping & relaxing.    We arrived at the hotel mid morning & was greeted with a lovely refreshing mint water whilst our bags were whisked away. Upon checking in our room wasn’t quite ready (but to be fair we were about 4hrs early so this wasn’t unexpected nor an issue) but we were given our all inclusive wrist bands and told to go & start enjoying the facilities and come back in half an hour for the room key.  The complex is quite big so I was really pleased when we were shown to a golf buggy which had our bags already loaded to be taken with us to the room.  Our room was lovely modern & very spacious. The hotels website states there is a mini bar this is quiet true there is a fridge but hey you’re at an all inclusive so it can soon become your very own mini bar! There are a few English channels on the TV & one channel that has regular movies on which was great as one night we were knackered so we took a bottle of wine back with us & chilled out.    Food wise; you are spoilt for choice in the main restaurant and the quality is good. They have a different theme on every evening with the usual alternatives on offer so you will never be stuck for choice.  I’d recommend sitting outside (in the shade) as it’s a little less hectic and the service is better.    Entertainment; they do try very hard and there is lots of choice. You can’t fault their enthusiasm! I loved the fact that they don’t push it upon you or announce every single activity on loud speaker. If you’re not on the ball this can mean you miss out on what’s going on but there is a list of activities on the wall near the pool bar.    Location; for us it was perfect as we weren't planning on going anywhere! There is a free shuttle bus into Marrakesh but you have to pre book this you can’t just go on a whim. However there are generally a few taxi’s just outside of the hotel too.  There is a small shopping complex just round the corner (5 – 10 min walk) which also has a TGI Fridays & Pizza Hut is your so inclined.  The transfer to the airport is 10/15 mins & should only cost you 100 Dirham regardless of how many people there are as always thou make sure you agree this before setting off!,Date of stay: September 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicB172
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,FOXY44Cheshire wrote a review Sep 2014,40,GREAT BASE FOR VISITING MARRAKECH,The hotel is located close to Marrakech airport and approximately 5 miles out of the city centre. There is nothing else to do close to the hotel but we knew this before we went and had chosen it as a luxury hotel to stay in and relax swim and enjoy the sunshine. We knew that we would be hotel bound unless we travelled into the city centre.    The hotel is beautiful. Very simple but stunning Moroccan style riads dotted around large grounds which are planted mainly with olive trees. There are formal pathways which are lovely to walk around dotted with clay Moroccan lights that look really nice at night time. The hotel lobby is salubrious and is beautifully scented with incense. Modern but with some lovely Moroccan touches like the silver tea urns.    We booked a family suite. We were not disappointed. It was massive and comprised two separate bedrooms – a master with the most fantastic bed I have ever stayed in and a smaller room for our son (but would fit two children easily) which had its own wall mounted TV and toilet and doorway onto the large balcony. The master bedroom was very large as was its bathroom which had a bath separate shower room his and hers sinks and a separate toilet area. It was very nice indeed.    My husband and I both suffer with bad backs and when we are at home usually wake feeling stiff and sore. For the duration of this holiday we both slept soundly and without a twinge. We did think of contacting Kenzi to see who their suppliers are but decided that it would probably not be cost effective to ship it over to the UK (more’s the pity). The most amazing bed ever (and it was huge too). There was a safe (payable locally) a small fridge another wall mounted TV and access to the large balcony. The room was very nicely decorated simple and modern with a Moroccan feel to the art work. There was plenty of storage space although the biggest wardrobes are actually situated in the child’s bedroom area. Can’t say this was a problem though really.    The hotel grounds were lovely and well maintained. There were three pools – the main freeform pool which had the added bonus of three water slides a large square pool which was close to the Pool Bar but was not used by the Animation Team for their games etc and a small separate toddler pool with its own mini slide which was set slightly away from the main pool and was quite shady and surrounded by cabanas. All the pools were very nice (we actually only went in the main pool but they all looked great). We spent hours every day in the pool and thoroughly enjoyed it but this is where one of our only gripes about this hotel happened.    We are a fair skinned family and quite keen on protecting our skin from being burnt by the hot sun. We used very high protection sun cream (30 for us and 50 for our 7 year old son) but still felt that during the afternoon he needed further protection. For this reason we would let him wear a t-shirt and his swimming trunks to go swimming in. For some reason (we’re still not entirely sure what that reason is) one of the security guys kept telling us that t-shirts were not allowed in the pool and our son had to remove it. The first time we complied but then we felt quite annoyed that our plans to keep our son safe were being put asunder. My husband took the matter up with the Reception staff and eventually the Duty Manager and came to an agreement that he would be allowed to wear it for the duration of our stay as a favour to us but it was against hotel rules. So be warned!    There is a mini zoo close to the toddler area. Not sure it reaches our expectations of animal welfare but the animals do seem to be well looked after even though their enclosures leave a little to be desired. I wouldn’t say it was a highlight of the hotel. There are goats peacocks turkeys rabbits and a couple of other things.    The restaurant is large and you could usually find a table (although it did seem to be very busy at opening times). There were also numerous tables outside if you prefer to dine al fresco. The staff were not that great at bringing beer or wine – quite slow. It would probably be better if you could serve yourself to it. The food was plentiful and varied but as is usually the case with all inclusive hotels very repetitive and not actually that great. There was always something we liked but our son who is admittedly very fussy lived on chips and ice-cream. The choices for children were limited (pizza and chips really). Also my son only likes to drink fruit juice. He doesn’t like water or fizzy drinks and this was a problem at lunch and evening meal as fruit juice was only available at breakfast time. I enjoyed the tagines – there was lots of choice of vegetable ones each meal time and usually a couple of different meat/fish ones too. My husband is a big meat eater and he commented that the meat was very poor quality. I tend to only really eat chicken and found it to be ok nothing special. On the whole the service in the restaurant was ok but would have been better if the staff were not so surly.    We tend to not join in with the Animation Team but they seemed to do a good job at getting people involved in the various daytime activities. They were also responsible for putting on the majority of the evening entertainment. This to be honest was just about passable.    The hotel IS more aimed toward the French guests but not as bad as some of the reviews on here would have you believe. There were actually quite a lot of English there whilst we were staying. We found that trying to speak as much French as you could (which for us was mainly just saying “merci”) went a long way and most of the staff could speak a bit (or a lot in some cases) of English too. It definitely wasn’t a problem for us!    There was an excellent free regular bus service into the city which we used a couple of times and would definitely recommend. You are told you have to book it the day before but it was never full so I would think it would be possible to turn up on the day and jump on.    There was free wi-fi in the reception area and in the room (although we found it a bit hit and miss in our room).    On the whole we had a wonderful stay at the Kenzi and would not hesitate to recommend it.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Knutsford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FOXY44Cheshire

Improved entertainment programme and there was much more effort to include the English which was nice. On a downside sunbeds were being reserved from the crack of dawn which is something I don't remember from our first visit and made it difficult to get a decent spot straight after breakfast. Grounds still beautiful. Improved evening bar service. Daytime bar still not great. Food and restaurant still to a good standard although slightly repetitive.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,crosslands14 wrote a review Aug 2014,50,"Amazing hotel, get it booked!!",Take no notice of the bad review some people must just be hard to please we travelled as a family 2 adults 2 18 year old girls we arrived at 8.30pm 10 minutes by taxi from the airport and were taken to our rooms in a golf buggy with a guided tour the rooms were beautiful comfy and very clean our rooms very cleaned every day and the towels changed we also had free wifi in our rooms..  The restaurant food quality was excellent and they did different theme nights every night lunch and breakfast was good maybe a bit repetitive but what can you expect when catering for so many people but with plenty of choice and certainly no complaints.  The bar and pool bar served drinks and cocktails all day and at night waiter service which was lovely spirits only local no brands which would have been better and maybe could do with more than one choice of beer but the wine was good and served by the bottle and the pool bar and bar staff were so friendly and very helpful.  Now to the entertainment team what a fantastic group of people so friendly helpful and fun and all could speak english The shows at night were very good and the dancing was amazing we took part in most of the activities during the day and met some lovely people.  Use the free shuttle bus booked at reception 10 mins into the Medina but walk round alone we took a guide but think he only took us places he got tipped if we purchased anything and we would have seen more alone visit the new town too lots of bars restaurants and clubs.  One thing when you leave make sure you visit reception and get a ticket you have to pay a local tax per evening which we did not know and was a bit of a panic as the taxi drivers wont take you without a ticket.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DJDJ10 wrote a review Aug 2014,30,Not that Good,This hotel could be a whole lot better if it actually concentrated a bit more on its customers rather than trying to make money. Arrived with a young family to be told that the room booked was not available so the staff seemed to think it was perfectly acceptable to allocate two rooms. Of course after challenging this and wasting half of the first day of the holiday having to repack and move to the new room it still seemed to fail to sink in that despite spending a whole load of money on a five star experience this was massively inconvenient. Did get a couple of free massages worth about 80quid and a few rose petals in the room however still viewed this as unacceptable whilst taking into account the cost of the holiday. Also when we arrived 10mins after the restaurant had shut we were refused food. Take note here other all inclusive chains would ensure its guests were catered for when they arrived late. Food was ok nothing special certainly not 5 star the tagine food was good however too much pizzapasta and chips for the mostly French guests -puzzling? Wine was half decent as was the beer. Wifi also not really working outside of the reception area. Very poor coverage in rooms. Also if a hotel professes to have a policy of not reserving sun beds they should carry this out. Sports equipment such as badminton and tennis rackets poor broken. On the plus side nice enough rooms although didn't appreciate the giant cockroach on the balcony one evening ah well it is Africa. Nice pool area with slides and of course great weather. Overall not a five star experience not worth the money paid which is a shame as this hotel could do much better.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJDJ10
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,netty85 wrote a review Aug 2014,40,Worth the deal!!,We visited the hotel in may for a friend's suprise birthday. We didn't know what to expect as we paid £250 PP so we imagined it to be a budget holiday. Much to my surprise it was far from that. As I was the organiser I felt quite conscious that we would get what we paid for.    Was totally brilliant. The food was constant!! You were given bottles of wine not just glasses. Bottles of coke and Fanta were given as sift drinks and food was good. They could have offered more authentic morroccon food though.    I particularly enjoyed the snacks by the bar which included crepes and pastas.    The only disappointment was the cocktails. Very watered down bad spirits with sickly mixers.    All in all this all inclusive holiday at the right price was a godsend.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sukhvinderu wrote a review Aug 2014,30,A little left to be desired,There are lots of positives about this hotel. However the not so greats first....    Upon check in the hotel staff couldn't find our reservation details even though we booked with a reputable company (last minute.com). This led to a delay with our check in until I was able to email my confirmation to the hotel. I contacted last minute.com and they apologised on behalf of the hotel and said the mistake was on the hotels behalf. The management of the hotel did not make any effort to apologise for the inconvenience caused.    Also the food variety is poor. Each night is themed with different cuisines however you find that the same dishes are served every night. After 7 nights this becomes tedious. For my vegetarian wife never wants to see fries again. The desserts look spectacular but are bland to taste. Therefore disappointing overall.    From a five star hotel I expect attention to detail however little cracks in furnishings in the room etc let the decor down.    The positives...    Beautifully kept grounds much attention is paid to the upkeep of the surroundings which is much appreciated. The staff are friendly and polite making an effort to speak to you in English once they realise that french is not your first language.  The rooms itself are extremely spacious each with a balcony at your disposal. Good sized pools with lots if fun activities all day for adults and children.    To conclude nice visit but if I were to come back - I'll visit a true 5 star all inclusive experience.,Date of stay: July 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sukhvinderu

For a so called five star hotel they have much to learn.....after moaning in the morning did get moved to Suites which were more of standard I was expecting only after I had to keep returning to reception to see the Duty manager who apparently was in a meeting and didn't come to find me as promised....obviously a meeting is more important than customer service...need I say anymore...but here goes!    Main issues were as followed:    Having to constantly ask for coffee in the morning and then to be told to get your own milk not 5 star in my books!.    Food was same they whole week apart from one night when a joint of meat was carved and my husband could finally eat something.    We ended up going out to eat twice to break up the week and went to Four Seasons Hotel  this was not a disappointment.....but be wary its not a cheap option!    For an all inclusive resort to be told you cant have 7 up lemonade what a cheek given the beer was so lousy and warm and my husband ended up drinking spirits that were brought at airport...if not you are forced to pay £7 for half a bottle of decent beer...these prices are more expensive than Dubai!    Everything appeared to be too much trouble in my books and only on day I was leaving did one of the waiters go and get me a bottle of water to take with me and I wasn't expected to have to go and find one myself....I was In shock and I told him so. He was working where the pancakes were served in the afternoon...thank you!    Best bit of hotel is the Spa....that was value for money and staff was professional.

Location was good with a shuttle bus to take you into the centre of town and back at various times. View of the Atlas snow capped mountains from the hotel is stunning.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Nax wrote a review Jul 2014,50,Absolutely amazing,I stayed at the Kenzi club agdal medina medina a couple of years ago and I have to say as a younger reviewer I was blown away so yes if your planning to take some young adults they'll love it. The hotel is beautiful very modern with a subtle moroccon decor and it is huge! The staff were very friendly and helped us a lot we were given bands to show the staff we were all inclusive we were also given green tea and juice. I was very impressed as we booked the hotel 2 days before leaving and found it hard to find hotels with options we needed the prices were so cheap in comparison to hotels in like Dubai so I naturally expected to be disppointed but wow I was smitten by the beautiful hotel with excellent facilities and the most pleasant surroundings. The hotel is also very close to a mall sorry can't remember the name but it had TGI Fridays and many other good places to eat. Moreover it's not far from the square either and taxis are easy to get as they line up outside the hotel. The location was also good as it was quiet away from any chaos of the medinas which I recommend you go to especially in th evenings djemaa el fna. I'm very eager to come back and hopefully will fingers crossed.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tallulah-hw wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Kenzi club I would,SO I will start from the beginning.    When arriving at the airport we had a transfer already book so this wasn't much of a worry for us. But i was worried about converting money. You do it at the airport as soon as get through border control there are kiosks.    So we got to the hotel and checked in no problem with staff speaking English. Very friendly and helped us with our bags onto the golf buggy to our room. My first impression of the room was looks nice. We arrived late at night and they had provided us with water in the room which was amazing and we were just in time for a the evening meal. They also explained that if we wanted a safe how much it would be and also that you could rent a towel for a small deposit.  When we were there :  Breakfast is served 8:30-10:30  Lunch 12:30-2:30  4:30 ish snack time.  Tea 19:30- 21:30  Food was mixture with plenty to choose from and this was good for us. As per all all inclusive you have a variety but sometimes dishes are standardised for every service. We liked that each night had themes and this meant a variety. We did find that both my partner and myself did have a bad stomach so I would say check what you eat is cooked. The most annoying thing was I love a good potato and they are always hard which ever way the came! The pasta station is amazing and you can choose what you want and watch them cook it fresh I wish i had caught on to this earlier as I loved it.    The drinks at the Kenzi were OK with this whole hotel and review I really want to stress you are in Africa in muslim country!! They don't drink its expensive to do so therefore meaning the cocktails are a bit naff and the wine is just ok. This is the same for the food whilst we were there i witnessed people moaning about the fact they didn't have full fat milk or simple stupid things like the cheese wasn't cheddar . The hotel does try and provide you with everything but if your super fussy and anything like i just said you bothers you don't come here or to Morroco.    We also ate in the A la carte Moroccan themed restaurant this was OK! You pay more money and the food is pretty much the same as Moroccan night in the main restaurant although there is a man that sings to you. (This was hilarious) Our chicken was not cooked though and although we asked for it to be re-done it was the same again! So be careful.    Day times by the pool there isn't any problems with sun beds you can always get one although there are french groups which take over certain areas so we tended to avoid them. The music and the 'animation team' really try hard to make the pool side fun and involve you in different activities. I really enjoyed going to the pool as it was never dull and if you wanted to join in you could and if you didn't it was fine. Whilst we were there there was: yoga zumba aqua gym polo salsa classes step classes football poker french boules darts archery shooting ping pong and boxing. SO a real variety that can suit anyone and everyone.    So another service the hotel offered is a shuttle to Marrakech. You can book onto this service it is free and you need to book 24 hours in advance. It was great for us and we went twice one small hiccup was they sent a bus that was to small. They sent a bigger one within 5 minutes.    Marrakech is CRAZY! (the souks that is). I am a 22 year old female and I can honestly say unless my partner was there I would of cried and gone home. As soon as you get of the bus into the centre people offer to guide you. They expect a charge of course and a lot of guests told us they just take you to their friends shops. We walked down into the main square and thats when it hits you. It is like all your senses are being violated. People are cobra dancing wanting to put monkies on you beg follow you with symbols and what ever else they fancy. This was rather daunting but by the second time me and my partner found it amusing. Don't take photos even from a far though!! (that of course costs money). So once you've done that you can go through into the souks we did first time holding hands. Again this isn't respectful so we didn't the second time when we realised.    Depending on when you go its nicer than other times. We found when it was busier it was more bearable as people weren't in your face as much. We haggled and there isn't ever a right price its what you are prepared to pay for it at the end of the day. We would walk away if it was too much and often get shop keepers follow us and drop the price dramatically. It isn't LOADS cheaper than the UK so don't expect to go into shops or the market and it to be dirt cheap. Don't eat food there and don't drink from glasses just bottles and No ice! all of the above will cause belly ache as I found out.    We got talking to a couple at the hotel they were dutch which is a rarity to have anyone who speaks English as the majority of the guests here are French and only speak french.  They told us about the new town so we went there and paid for a Taxi again had to haggle. This was more like a mall and with westernised shops like Zara and H and M. Not a lot here but was good to have a feel for the real 'Marrakech' other than the souks which are so aimed at tourists. We enjoyed it more and it helps us to relax.    Locally to the hotel there is a shopping centre with a supermarket (Caraphore) we went and got some essentials there like (biscuits and crisps) for the evening as I like snacks and hotels food didn't really offer this sort of thing.    In the evenings we would have our food and watch the animation team perform the were so good and I was impressed. They also had a mini disco which was great for the children! There would be live singers and dances for adults and WHO KNEW the French love to dance! They were up quicker than you could say salsa. It was good to chill and watch everyone have a good time.    During our stay we also paid for the gym its pretty small but did the job for us as we felt we needed some exercise after the large about of all inclusive we were eating.    On a whole I would recommend this holiday and the hotel as an experience. You shouldn't come here (Morocco) if you are looking for something luxurious and like Spain. Its a whole new experience . You do have to be mindful that the main religion in the country is Islam therefore women should cover their shoulders at very least and that if you don't you will attract disapproving looks. I found taking a scarf helpful and i wore trousers into the centre or a maxi skirt. People didn't when we were out but for me as I'm blond and small I found it helped me loads. Its not like Tunisia were everyone wants to touch you or tell you how pretty or how nice your hair is. They want you to respect their culture and religion which i think is fair. I hope my review helps you in your choice for both this hotel and Morocco.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tallulah-hw
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kezzabee75 wrote a review Jul 2014,30,"nice hotel, good quiet location, but not 5*",My husband and i stayed here the last week in May for 5 nights. This holiday was just for us to recharge our batteries and do nothing but lay by the pool !! The hotel is only 10-15 minutes from the airport we took a taxi from directly outside the aiport which cost 90 dirhams Don't change your money at the uk airport wait until you arrive in Marrakech we got a much better exchange rate in Marrakech airport. There are also plenty of cash machines that we used without any problmes good exchange rates too.  The hotel reception is beautiful and smelt wonderful. As soon as we entered the reception we were given warm towels to freshen our face along with an iced water. Check in was pretty straight forward and the staff did speak good english. You have to pay a deposit at reception for your pool towels do keep the paper receipt otherwise you will not get your money back.  A golf buggy took us to our room and the driver pointed out the restaurant/pool etc on the way. our room was on the first floor and was very near to the pool/restaurant etc.  The room was very spacious and clean although a little tired the walls were slightly shabby and so were the door frames/wood in the bathroom. Our room had a small balcony.  The food was a little repetitive but you do tend to expect this from an 'all inclusive' resort. The food was of a high standard and there was plenty of it. The waiting staff are very attentive and are quick to clear plates etc.  The daytime cocktails were lovely as they were made to order with plenty of ice the evening standard cocktails were made in advance and were stacked up behind the bar were served in glasses similar to champagne flutes with one cube of ice the fruit juice used tasted more like diluting juice however they did make a lovely mojhito and gin and tonic  .There were always plenty of sunbeds available they were a little uncomfortable but there were always plenty of cushions lying around for you to use on the bed too. We spent our first day around the main pool which we did find a little noisy as this is were most of the pool activities took place and the entertainment team would approach you and ask you to join in with all the activities. This was a nice touch you didnt feel left out but we really just wanted to relax so we then moved to the pool by the bar which was quieter.There is a small gift shop within the hotel but the prices are very high as we found out when we had to buy a plug adapter as we had brought the wrong one with us !!    There is a free mini bus that takes you into the main square everyday. you do need to book this one day in advanceWe ended up going to the medina on 3 occasions you can literally wonder around the soukes for hours the paths are very narrow and winding there is so much to see. Be aware of every trader trying to entice you into their shop and be prepared to barter the traders expect you to do this. On our 3rd shopping day we were getting much better with the bartering keep offering less money and then try walking away if you have offered too low the traders will let you walk if you haven't then they will call you back and sell to you for that price. The traders don't like to be ignored so try saying 'i'll come and see you tomorrow' that worked for us.    All in all we had a fab time the holiday was very relaxing the medina was very exciting so many stalls to see and buy from. We would definitely go back to Marrakech perhaps not the same hotel only because we would like to stay a little closer to the square next time so that we could walk into the square instead of bus/taxi.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kezzabee75
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jacky W wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Fantastic value for money,We were so impressed by this lovely hotel for the price we paid for our 3 night break. The reception area and surroundings were stunning. I'm not a big fan of all inclusive hotels because of the food quality but I can honestly say that the buffet here was excellent so much choice!!! The pools were great you could choose either the lively pool with entertainment and water slides or the quieter pool with shady cabanas plenty of beds for everyone. If I had any criticism it would be that the rooms are not really 5 star standard and nor are the cocktails but these are small niggles and as I said previously for the price I can not fault it. We shall all definitely bad going back!!,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Maidstone, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackyw659
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Nikbobs wrote a review Jul 2014,40,Really good value for your money,I booked this hotel back in Feb for a cheap week away in June.    I'm honestly confused by the reviews the British guests have given as we only had a positive experience staying here. This was my second and the bf's first time to Marrakech and specifically looked to choose a mid range hotel with a pool.    Everyone we met spoke some English and the reception team where very friendly and helpful.    The food was excellent. A huge fresh choice each day. I cannot understand these people that say the restaurant is like 'canteen'. I'd like to ask them what they expecting when a hotel has to cater for hundreds of guests 3 times a day minimum???    Water was readily available and alcohol too.    Make sure you keep the receipt part when leaving you deposit for your towels as no receipt means no deposit back.    We used the petit taxis outside the hotel which we felt were extremely reasonable when going to main areas which are less than 5 mins by taxi. We also walked from the carrefour supermarket one afternoon which is very easy to find and down one long straight road. In the late afternoon heat it took us 20 mins each way.    The hotel and food outlets are extremely clean with continual cleaning throughout the day. Watch out for the wasps though they can be a pain when your trying to relax with a cocktail.    All in all a really good holiday and we would return in the future.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lancashire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikbobs
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Salman I wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Little Heaven In Marrakech,We booked this place and after reading mixed reviews so were not sure what was to be expected.  However when we arrived the staff and place looked beautiful. We were taken around in a Caddy showed the whole hotel and everyday the staff were pleasant and very helpful. The rooms were nice we stayed in 310 and 309 as four of us brothers went together.  If you want to see the real Morocco you will have to travel away from Marrakech we went to the Atlas mountains and on the way did Quad Biking and Jet Sking this was all arranged by Jawad Motia the Guest relations manager. Jawad understood what we wanted from this holiday and everything he recommended was on point. I.E Darizlane Compteau So Lounge and many more.  The staff that were very helpful are Hasna the Housekeeping lady Osman The porter Hamza the security Mariam in reception.  We loved Marrakech and will definetly be going back to this place.  THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS HOTEL IS MARIA the way she communicates presents herself does not make you feel in a developing country. She assisted with all of our demands no matter how difficult they were. Thanks for making our stay the best.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,EllieTozer wrote a review Jun 2014,40,great pools for children,The most appealing thing about this hotel is it's comparatively cheap price.  The pool area is great for kids and so are the slides (although for some reason these don't open till 3 in the afternoon).  If you like mass produced canteen eating then the food is fine there is certainly plenty of it.  The staff are friendly and as long as you don't ask for anything outside of their norm they are helpful.  The rooms are clean and spacious.  The in room safe is charged by the day which is a ridiculous money making scheme as it costs nothing to run.  You have to leave a deposit for pool towels which is refunded on your check out and seems a little unnecessary.  The location is convenient for the medina and airport with a shuttle bus readily available.  If you like eighties style agadoo disco entertainment blasting all evening then this is the place for you.  The hotel is well kept and maintained. Overall we had a pleasant enough stay for the money that this hotel cost but would not stay here again. If we were to return to Marrakech with children we would pay the money to stay somewhere like Club Med or if we were without children we would definitely stay in one of the small riads in the Medina.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Esher, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieTozer
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Debbie Y wrote a review Jun 2014,30,Mixed emotions,I stayed here for 5 nights with my partner and son (22 months old).  I booked a family room/suite. I recommend a room on the 1st floor we had a private balcony and it was safe for the toddler as he couldn't run off anywhere and I could sit in the sun in private whilst he was asleep.  The room was massive with 2 loos a bath and shower. Take a hair dryer as the one in the bathroom was rubbish.  We arrived and check-in was fast. My son loved the ride in the golf cart. It was about 730pm so we dropped our bags and went straight for food.  The canteen is standard. The food can get repetitive if you eat the same things. Highs - potato tagine meatball tagine pasta made to order Moroccan pastry at breakfast. Lows- chicken tagine not cooked through.  Wine and beer is very palatable for an all-inc in a Muslim country.  I didn't feel food and drink was plentiful compared with other hotels I've been too. There is one bar open all day and a small area for a small selection of food until 5pm. Dinner was served from 730 which was difficult for us having such a young child. No ice creams during the day other than with lunch. I feel it was all very restricted. Cocktails were terrible.  My son loved the water slides and Animation team. The mini disco from 8-9pm was the highlight of his holiday even though it's all in French.  It's not a 5* hotel. My driver was due to pick me up from the hotel to take us onto the next hotel. He was late because he went to the wrong hotel. I asked reception to help me deal with the situation and they wanted to charge me for a telephone call. I was distressed and stranded and the lady on reception was useless in helping me.  Other than her on reception the staff were friendly and good with my son. Most staff wanted to pick him up or touch his blonde hair which we found strange but it was consistent where ever we went.  I probably wouldn't go back because I like good cocktails and more choices of food outlets. I'd recommend doing 3 nights max here and then move on somewhere else (if it's a place you are interested in staying)  It's hot during the day. The pool is a little cool at the moment. It didn't bother me but not ideal for my son.  Animation offer an ongoing menu of entertainment during the day. I didn't bother but it looked fun and kept spectators entertained too.  Leave your lilo at home because no inflatables in the pool. Though I did see one or two. No reserving sunbeds either.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Leeds, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/774debbiey
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Liam F wrote a review Jun 2014,50,Great Stay,Shortly after we booked this 4 night break the reviews on tripadvisor were terrible and we were quite concerned about what we had booked and were quite anxious about the holiday. After returning from the Kenzi Club I can clearly see that some people who have reviewed this hotel aren't living in the real world and aren't taking into consideration what they've actually paid to stay here.  When checking in we were upgraded to a suite for our wedding anniversary. The suite was lovely with a huge bed a separate sitting room large bathroom with bath and walk in shower.  All the gardens and the pool area are all kept neat and tidy. The larger pool with the slides seemed to be more for families so we stuck to other pool which seemed to be an older crowd. The pool was quite cold but was quite nice when it's so hot.  We found that in the restaurant there was always something to eat. There was always three or four tagines to choose from a night some nicer than others but all edible Pizza's are cooked fresh on site. Most of the desserts looked different but seemed to taste the same. We did book to go in the Moroccan restaurant but chose not to bother when seeing the menu.  All hotel staff were friendly and pleasant although some seemed to struggle slightly with speaking English. We didn't really bother with entertainment in the night so I can't comment.  Arranging the free shuttle to Marrakech was easy which we did while checking in. We had a taxi back to the hotel which cost 100DR.  The taxi from the airport cost 200DR. We did try to get lower but they were having none of it. The taxi from the hotel to the airport only cost 100DR.  My only issues with the hotel was the 3 euro a day charge for the safe and the 150DR (ABOUT £13.38) deposit for each pool towel which I thought was a bit excessive.    For value for money you can't go wrong with this hotel.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Pontypool, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282LiamF
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lesley b wrote a review Jun 2014,50,perfect break,Booked a break away as a secret hotel with lastminute.com. and was a little disappointed when I found out it was this hotel because of some of the photos and other reviews. My daughter and I had a very pleasant surprise at the beauty and setting of the hotel's rooms when we first arrived and our experiences during the rest of the break couldn't have been better. The staff were obliging and very friendly the food plentiful and good quality. As I'm not much of a meat eater the buffet was ideal with made to order omlettes and pasta dishes wonderful morrocan food and delicious pastries every dayas well as an extensive choice of other dishes. The Morrocan restaurant was well worth the extra euros with an excellent waiter and a very good local musician. The entertainment team produced some amazing evening concerts were extremely friendly to everyone and had incredible amounts of energy The whole package could not have been better. I just think the English reviews and the pictures on trip adviser do not do it justice.I will definately return when possible.,Date of stay: June 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesleyb652
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JMC16WR wrote a review May 2014,40,A first class stay...,We have just returned from a 4 might stay here and we had a wonderful time and would recommend based on our experiences.    The hotel arranged a 30 Euro pick up from the airport for us to save us the worry on arrival and that was really helpful but having more confidence by the time we left we got a taxi on the return journey for half the price.    All the staff at the hotel were really friendly and helpful. Couldn't fault them and there were no language issues. The welcome on arrival with a drink etc was most well welcoming.    Food was fine though it was quite similar each day but there was a lot of choice and it was all good quality. Drinks were fine also so no complaints. It is an international all-inclusive buffet so its never going to be gourmet. We didn't try the Morrocan restaurant. I have eaten my body weight in doughnuts mind.... mid afternoon snacks highly recommended!    Pools and leisure facilities were excellent (albeit ever so slightly cold!). Played tennis and equipment was really good. Shame indoor pool was extra but we were given a free sauna as part of our deal.    Rooms were spacious our 2 children were on sofa beds in adjoining room so we all had our own space. Beds we comfy and bathrooms excellent. Can't fault them - and housekeeping arranged nightwear differently each day which was a nice touch. Shame we had to pay to use the safe in our rooms though... we stayed in Jacaranda (600s) and it was nice and quiet.    Shuttle bus service to the city was excellent - on time and always available. The hotel is 15mins journey out of town and we found that to be ideal as it was good to get away from the madness of the city to stay in our little desert oasis.    Took trip to mountains as arranged by the organiser at the hotel - again the service was excellent. We decided late on Sunday to see if we could go on Monday at 9am and despite the lady not working (day off) it was all sorted smoothly.    In all amazing city and a really good hotel that delivered everything we wanted.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gyasu wrote a review May 2014,50,The Animation team made our holiday!,After reading some of the reviews about this hotel before we traveled my wife and I were both apprehensive about what to expect however we were both very pleasantly surprised! On arrival the reception staff were very friendly the porters were helpful and friendly and the Animation staff were really great. It is predominantly a resort for French tourists and along with Arabic French is the main language. But once members of the Animation team realised we were from England they made an extra effort to make sure that we did not feel left out in any of the events or instructions during activities that were carried out. On a daily basis activities such as archery shooting volleyball football table tennis tennis French bowls aerobics and dance classes were available. In the evening shows were put on by the Animation team which were of a very good standard. The rooms could probably do with a lick of paint but were very clean and looked after daily. The swimming pools and the grounds in general looked lovely and clean. The food may have been a bit repetitive but tasty nonetheless. And drinks were available until 11:30pm. There was a shuttle to the medina on a daily basis. We stayed there for 7 nights and we are grateful for Mido Robin Dora Mia Zak and the rest of the team for making it a memorable holiday.,Date of stay: May 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Blackburn, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gyasu

Lovely hotel room and grounds. Super friendly and helpful staff from luggage guys and reception to the chefs waiters and the car service guy. Immaculately clean everywhere and our room service cleaners were lovely they even folded our baby's clothes. Food was pretty good for a buffet with good choices throughout the day though we would suggest arriving on the early side rather than leaving it too late. We were given a room close to the restaurant which was good for the baby. There is a little animal corner with goats and ducks which was cute. Lots of activities to entertain everyone with enthusiastic and genuine staff. We aren't all inclusive people but were generally impressed. The only negatives for us were that they charged for the indoor pool hammam and gym. We would pay for treatments of course but the rest should be included.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davofrombr3

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Keylock100 wrote a review May 2014,40,A good choice for a group holiday,We went with friends to the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina in March booked through a deal on Travelzoo. The hotel was perfect for our needs with comfortable and spacious rooms a nice pool area (enjoyed the water slides) and a short taxi ride from the city. Reception staff were friendly and helpful.    I was a little disappointed with the food; while there was a huge variety (clearly aiming to meet all tastes) I felt this amount of choice was not necessary and compromised the quality of the food - I would have been happier to have eaten good quality Moroccan food.    Although this is advertised as 5* it is not comparable to European standards (based on the restaurant). However that said we went with these expectations and felt that the price we paid was very reasonable for a thoroughly enjoyable 4 day break in the sunshine on the doorstep of one of the most vibrant cities I've visited.

Deserts are a bit less interesting I wish there would have been more Moroccan delights... but it was OK.  The shows in the evening are not too bad.

The hair dryer was hanging off the wall with exposed wiring which we made housekeeping aware of but nothing was ever done.  The pool area was lovely plenty of loungers and beautiful pools. The loungers were very uncomfortable and definitely need replacing as you lay with metal bar in your back as they are so worn.  The spa was lovely we had a hamman and body massage which was very enjoyable.  The food was really nice lots of variety and nice friendly helpful staff.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,PuchiOki wrote a review May 2014,50,Fantastic holiday at Kenzi Agdal,Myself husband and two children (3.5 yr old and 6 yr old) had a fantastic time at Kenzi Agdal Medina. We stayed there from 22nd (early morning) till 26th April midday. As soon as we arrived we were offered refreshing mint tea and check in was very easy. Our luggage was stored away as you check in is at 2.30 so they directed us to the main restaurant (which is simply huge!!) where we were able to have lunch (very nice too!) before we were shown to our rooms in a buggy (much like a golf buggy).    We had a fantastic time because there was such a huge variety of food and with my two very fussy eaters who also have multiple allergies (dairy egg nuts and seeds) I was still able to find plenty of food that were safe for the kids to eat. They couldnt eat most desserts but even that was not an issue as there is such a huge supply of fruit (watermelons fruit salads etc). They even made a jelly cake for my daughters birthday so she had that on her special day!  The pool was perfect for children. We didnt venture to the adult swimming pool which also looked lovely as well as the laps pool for more serious swimmers.    They have a shuttle to the medina and all you have to do is book it a day in advance. Though they also accomodated our last minute changes in plans when it came to this too. Overall I would recommend staying near the main part of the hotel so in rooms 200- 300 so you are not too far away and also an upstairs room if you can get it as you do get more sun in those rooms.    Anyone with kids would love this place. Just absoutely amazing and the hard work of the staff to make it as great as it is really needs to be seen to be appreciated. They are constantly on the go from 6.30 in the morning till very late at night. And the great time we had - the relaxation we felt was purely done to them. I cant thank them enough.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PuchiOki

Family rooms are spacious and very nice and cleaned very well.    Animation team were fantastic - always polite and welcoming and keeping everyone entertained    After checkout we had several hours to kill and the staff were very kind in storing our luggage and allowing us to use all the facilities until we wanted to leave later in the afternoon - with 2 kids this was heavily welcomed as several hours at the airport would have been tough!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,L0uisaMay wrote a review Apr 2014,50,"enjoyable, relaxing holiday- Easter 2014",We had a lovely stay at the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Outside spectacular views of the Atlas Mountains with snow from the pool. We found it easy to get sunbeds and pool side 'tents' despite staying at Easter when the hotel was busy.  We had a lovely comfortable family room/ suite with and extra bed. We have teenagers and a nine year old and found this one of our best holidays so far- there was something for everyone and a nice safe/ calm atmosphere. The hotel were very helpful in giving my sister a room close to ours in the same 'Riad' when they joined us for Easter.  The teenagers loved the relaxed environment and it was nice and calm compared with the hustle and bustle of the Souks and the old city.  Lots of activities including Moroccan cooking (tagines and mint tea etc ) Belly dancingGolf and Shooting archery etc every day. Lovely pools and water slides!  The main language is French but all of the staff speak good English. Also Dutch Belgian and Germans at the hotel when we stayed. If you can't speak French you need to say.  Lots of variety in the restaurant and none of us were fed up with the food when we left . Sometimes the meat was a little under cooked. Mostly the food was of a very high standard. Tagines especially good!  The shuttle bus can get quite booked up and it is too far to walk into the centre which is a slight drawback.  The hotel is popular and it is worth reconfirming with them about the rooms before you arrive at high season.,Date of stay: April 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Padstow Cornwall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L0uisaMay

They put on a show every evening and also encourage people to do some activities during the day. Food was nice as well and they had snacks to keep you happy all day. The pool was a bit cold on a few days but apart from that i cant really fault them. Staff could also speak english which was good for english tourists like us. There is also a daily shittle to the sqaure which is a nice thing for tourists. Kids club is good and it keeps the little ones entertainee all day.

Entertainment great food great reception staff good - they do speak English. Visited when hotel was at full capacity. The only major negative was lack of sunbeds. They have a ""don't reserve"" policy which all the other guests ignored so if you didn't reserve your bed you were lucky to find one. I think they could have done with another bar staff person in the evening as it was a slow service. They don't take cards at reception so you will need to get cash out at the airport. There was a cash machine in the hotel but not working but understand there was an alternative at the local carfour shop but I dont know how local. Weather was fantastic pool warm and clean.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CTontour wrote a review Apr 2014,40,Would not hesitate to return.,A lovely relaxing oasis. A little outside the city (we concidered this to be a good thing). This hotel is only 4 years old and very well kept. The rooms very clean and fresh all the time. Comfy beds. The staff here are to be complimented they all work very hard to make everything welcoming hassle free and friendly. Main language is french but they also speak arabic and most speak at least a little english some speak lots of english and they are always readily and happily available.So no language problems. Pools are good and plenty of loungers - which cannot be reserved so it is always easy to find some. There is entertainment of many kinds both day and evening if you wish to join in. We rarely opt for all inclusive as we prefer to explore but as this was our fist visit to Marrakech we decided to play it safe. The food is buffet style and there is plenty of it with a good selection but eating at the same place each day does mean that some of it was a little repetitive and some items were a little bland. No tissues in the rooms so take your own. None the less we would return without hesitation and would love to go back sooner rather than later. We travelled to the City and surrounds on several occasion Marrakech is a fascinating place. Do your research and you should have some wonderful experiences. There is not a Boots the Chemist on every corner - if fact nothing like one so go prepared. If you are thinking of renting a car we would suggest you think again but if you really are determined to then there are 3 things you really should take with you. 1) A travel insurance policy that includes an air ambulance back to your home country. 2) Valium tablets or similar. 3) Your organ donar card.

He turned his back to me and spoke to another receptionist in ""his"" language which neither myself or my partner do not speak.  FOOD- Loads of choice meats section changed on a daily bases although cut the chicken before you eat as we found it pink inside.  BAR- full of arrogant staff and covered in wasps. Refused to give us BOTTLE of water?! We were all inclusive.. just like everyone else in the hotel.  GYM- don't bother unless you want to hurt yourself. Myself and my partner ended up tearing skin of our hands as most is either old and used or simply not safe.  POOL (main)- freezing. Impossible to go in. For the whole week we were there we only seen few people in it and they were struggling. Speakers weren't working and making very annoying noise which completely spoilt the atmosphere.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lewis C wrote a review Apr 2014,10,You will regret booking this hotel.,I stayed in Agadir last year and had a fantastic stay.    However this time round was terrible. The hotel looks nice from the outside however if you dive in a bit closer its not so nice. The food is not so bad But slightly repetitive. The rooms were a decent size but very dirty. Out sheets always had black marks on them. There was electricity plugs hanging off the walls. The water would go off at random points through out the day. The worst part of the room was the infestation of ants We complained around 9 times to have this issue fixed which never happened. Each time they just came back all over our bed at night and floor. One or two of the animation staff were extremely annoying never giving you any peace. Bugging you when you are trying to relax. One guy who decided he was a DJ plays black gangster rap as loud as possible on a rubbish old speaker system at the pool. That fades from loud to quiet. finally when checking out we did not have the receipt for our towels. We still had the plastic cards to show we had two. We were told we would not get our £30 deposit back. Unbelievable! Its not allot of money its the principle.After arguing for several minutes eventually we did.Last but not least you have to pay to use the gym. Being a professional fighter i have to use the gym twice a day so asked if some form of agreement could be made but no. They will not do anything to help your needs.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Pas wrote a review Apr 2014,20,Poor,A group of us arrived for a 60th birthday. We were greeted well with cold towels and a lovely refreshing drink. We arrived early as early flight so knew we weren't able to get into rooms straight away. We waited half hour to be even spoke to. As the tour operator left he whispered to a member in our group don't let them  Move you! We didn't think anything of it. Anyway head of reception came out and stated they have no rooms for us as they have a problem with the sewers and we will be moved to their sister hotel. We were obviously not happy about this as had booked her for the brilliant reviews. They will have rooms for us in two days and they will offer us a free shuttle bus all day between the two hotels. We complained and said this wasn't good enough and we would like to speak to the manager. Half an hour later manager arrived and apologised and stated the same. We stuck to our guns and explained it was for a birthday. They sent us for lunch and asked us to  Come back after and see what then can do. They had found four rooms?!? How bizarre that quickly. Went to our rooms 2 out of the four still we're not cleaned from previous occupants with dirty sheets empty bottles of water towels on floor etc. another hours wait! I wonder why the tour operator mentioned that comment before he left? Speaking to other English guests who has been there for 10 days before said they has the exact same  Problem. Seems they overbook all the time and send people to their sister hotel    Hotel was lovely and clean and buffet area was good. Pool bar was  Excellent and the pools nice but cold.  Morroccan restaurant was lovely but at added cost. Staff were not very friendly or welcoming. Free shuttle to centre and souks was overbooked so had to wait for another.  3 guests then became unwell with diarrhoea? Unsure from what.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Reggie5959 wrote a review Apr 2014,10,NOT worth a visit,This is by far the worst hotel we have stayed at. The air conditioning is controlled by the reception and is set to heat during the months of March and April. The rooms smelt of sewerage. The balcony was totally overgrown by plants and looked straight into the room opposite. After explaining all of this to the night reception manager he agreed to move us to another room which to be honest was a lot better. The food was always served Luke warm and lacked taste. The main language spoken was in fact French. When we asked for milk they had no idea what we wanted we had to draw on all our school French to get by. The reception and bar and restaurant staff were all very rude and unhelpful. It took approx 4 requests every morning to get a coffee. They definitely made us feel that we would have been made to feel more welcome if we had been French. The animation team on the other hand were very friendly they took the time during the day to speak to us and also sat with us during mealtimes and in the eventing. The evening entertainment is rather like a haven holiday camp so if you like this sort of thing this hotel will be great for you. We used the free shuttle bus from the hotel only to be accosted by a man just outside the hotel pretending to be from the hotel asking us for more money to be our guide. The hotel should take more care and not allow this to happen.

It's a nice hotel not very big but with a very nice friendly and polite staff.The rooms are organised as small riads in a garden full of olive trees.The beds are quite hard and the room is noisy you can hear everything your neighbours are doing.  The hotel has 2 outside pools one is heated. The spa fitness and inside pool is paying. The food in the restaurant is varied the breakfast is great unless you come at the start of the breakfast then it is very hard to find something to eat or to get coffee...  Drinks are very good you can get the wine by bottle and chilled.  What we were missing is some speciality restaurants and more bars. During the day only the poolbar is open and in the evening one other bar where the animation is always doing activities so you cannot drink something quiet.  The wifi only works in your room and at the reception.  To go to Marrakech you can use the hotelbus( to book one day in advance) or take a taxi before the hotel.  Excursions at reasonable prices you can book at the opposite side of the reception hall.  In the neighbourhood you find a shopping center with a Carrefour and the same shops as in your home town.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Asse, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne490

The staff were incredibly polite always friendly courtesy and service was second to none. The food and selection available was excellent for all three daily meals.Several evenings had a 'themed 'menu which was also good. We took our disabled dad with us on this trip and the Guest Relation Manager Jawad Motia did everything he could to cater for dads special needs. Jawad was extremely helpful at all times in the most genuine manner and is a great asset to the hotel. Miriam on reception also went out of her way to accommodate our requests.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,londonmatDE wrote a review Mar 2014,30,"Hotel is very nice, service should must be improved",Overall this is a very nice resort and we did enjoy our holiday here however there are some minor drawbacks which are clearly a lack of supervision and proper management.    Our room was very large with the balcony facing a construction site (working from 7 to 5) which didn't really bother us. If you want your room to be cleaned before 4 or 5 you will have to tip the maid rather generously - it works. Beds are comfortable furniture in a good state however air con/heating cannot be used as the smell is absolutely disgusting.    Wifi is a nightmare - it was working perfectly fine the first two days in our room - we asked reception several times to restart the router the standard answer is to come back the next day. The same was true for spa and gymn access which was included in our room price. Hotel confirmed it twice before our arrival receptionist pointed it out upon check-in however as I actually wanted to go to the gymn I was refused access. It took me 4 visits to reception and a couple of phone calls to sort that out not very professional at all.    Pool area is very spacious and clean we didn't have a problem finding a sunbed at any time. Unfortunately the animation team was a bit too loud and too desperately trying to find victims for their avtivities as most fellow guests just wanted to relax in the sun.    Food is excellent BUT in order to be served and get your table cleared you must tip generously. Better do it on your first day and you will get an excellent service if you tip the right waiter.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lucy_l0cket wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Good All Inclusive,Although we got off on the wrong foot when there were no pillow cases on the bed and crumbs under the pillows we found the hotel to be really good. Staff were constantly cleaning and the grounds were kept beautifully. I really liked the mix of architecture and decor - a nod to the old and new of Marrakech.    Great location close to the city centre and airport with a fabulous view of the Atlas mountains. Our room was the furthest away from the main parts of the hotel but it was nice and quiet. Although we couldn't get our air conditioning to work at all it kept blowing out hot air. Didn't bother us too much as it wasn't too hot at the beginning of March. The room itself was spacious with all the amenities we needed.    There was a huge and tasty selection of food at all meals and snack times again staff worked really hard to accommodate all guests. It was great to have a bottle of wine at the table rather than keep refilling a glass as at so many other all inclusives.    The cocktails at the pool bar left a lot to be desired – a cosmopolitan was nothing like it should be really sweet with some sort of strawberry mix in it. Although the staff worked quickly and efficiently and had to put up with bees buzzing about a lot – perhaps one of those blue insect lights would be a bonus as my husband saw one of the barmen getting stung.    The bar in the evening was full of children although there was a good atmosphere and one of the barmen learnt how to make my favourite cocktail which made my day as again the house cocktails were questionable! There was a kind of night club open when the bar closed this was fun but you had to pay for drinks.    Entertainment staff worked tirelessly always friendly and enthusiastic. Although could have done without the banging music round the pool all day long (especially after a few too many cocktails the night before!)

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Shrimp23 wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Short Break in the Sun,I went on a break with my elderly mother who struggles with walking and other members of my family. Prior to arrival we requested two rooms together and close to facilites to make the walk for my mother bearable. One of the rooms we had been allocated had a blocked toilet and we were surprised to find this had been passed to allow guests access. After this they found another room for my mother but this was not near me so made the trip more difficult. I stayed with my daughter in a room on the 1st floor and there were no net curtains which I think the hotel should invest in. The food was often cold but they always had one pasta station which was a appreciated. The visitors to this hotel were predominatly french which meant things were geared to the french guests. This did not cause us a problem as we just needed to relax and catch some sun. We made a mistake by leaving our tip until the last day so I would suggest having a central tip box in the restaurant area and all tips split between servers as we were not seated at the same table all the time and I would have wanted my tip to be shared amonst the servers and not just the person who picked it up on our last day.,Date of stay: March 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,Harrow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shrimp23

In the beginning of january me and my girlfriend was going to check out from the hotel and she had her flight early in the morning and mine was late in the evening. When I was going to check out I looked at the bill and there was clear indications that a hundred euros for a spa treatment had been paid( i work in a hotel reception so i should know) and I assumed my girlfriend had paid it but the hotel insisted there was something wrong and that I was going to pay again which I did. It turned out she already had paid it and we payed twice this is an honest mistake by the hotel and I was not upset about this issue initially. a few days later my girlfriend called the hotel and they apologized and said they would do a credit card refund and give me my money back. They never did give me my money back and we have been in contact with the hotel about ten times and they always promise that we will get our money back but we never have. The problem right now is not that I care about the hundred euros but the fact that they do not even answer us anymore and are intentionally ignoring us. To me this behavior is a complete disgrace. I do not understand how anyone can be treated this way by a ""professional"" hotel chain.

As it was very late they made sure they took us to the room in one of the little buggies and carried our luggage right up to the room. Jawaad also made sure he provided us with a late supper which was waiting for us in our room as we had missed dinner time in the restaurant which was a lovely gesture. Throughout the whole stay all the staff in the restaurant were absolutely lovely and polite and always had a smile on their faces. They made us feel like princesses every day. On our birthdays they arranged special treats for us and we had the best time. The hotel itself is beautiful lots to do with amazing swimming pools indoor and outdoor spa bars gift shop tennis courts beach volley court golf archery and a night club. The food was delicious especially the Moroccan food and the deserts. They also have different stations where fresh food is prepared at your request. They have theme nights like Chinese Italian etc. On Valentine's day the restaurant was decorated beautifully with lots of hearts and cupids and even the reception area was decorated with heart cushions which we thought was a lovely touch. The hotel is 2 minutes away from Pacha nightclub which was great for us as we partied till the early hours of the morning. The hotel also provides a daily shuttle to the town which is very convenient if you wanted to experience the culture. To be honest we loved the hotel so much we barely wanted to leave. We had a beautiful suite and it was always very clean the housekeepers even decorated our beds with beautiful pink rose petals it was a 5 star treatment and they never failed to cheer us up with compliments every day. We loved every minute of our holiday.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Alderley Edge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyCaruana11

The staff particularly male bar staff are rude and insulting...  Make you feel as if it is too much trouble for them to serve you as if it's an inconvenience to them for you to simply try and order a drink they do their best to insult and belittle you especially if you are an English guest.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,uksam wrote a review Mar 2014,10,Another Overbooked Excuse!,We booked a three day break but when we arrived they gave us some cock and bull excuse about problems were our rooms are located. After further digging we found out they were again like many other overbooked and had rooms for us at the palace hotel down road now the hotel was nice but not as good as the club hotel. We had no choice but to move and now reading the reviews it looks like a scam to getting bookings for their hotels in the area.    We got discounts for the spa as compensation. Food buffet was okay the Italian was terrible the Moroccan was always booked and breakfast was good.    Unfortunately preferable treatment was given to the French and Arabs when it came to the free shuttle bus only 9 seats available and again they lied to us that there was another bus behind to take the rest of the passengers but the truth was we had to wait half an hour for the first (and only) bus to return.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,johnpetersfield wrote a review Mar 2014,40,A Superior French Holiday Camp,"We booked this hotel through Golfbreaks in the hope of getting 4 sunny days and 4 good rounds of golf. We booked all inclusive and certainly we found that food (especially breakfast) and drinks were very good. The weather in early March is also perfect for golf (chilly in the morning and evening - hot during the day -actually too hot on the last day at 36 degrees but that was unusual.  What we weren't expecting was a French Bank Holiday and loads of families and kids away for short breaks. The first couple of days the hotel was packed to the point were near chaos was ensuing with service in the restaurant and please do steer clear of the large bar in the evenings unless you want very loud music an even louder MC and the chance to do daft things like burst balloons with a complete stranger in the middle of the dance floor !  Even in bar above the swimming pool the music and ""entertainment "" staff were in evidence - no chance of a quiet drink there then ! If you want quiet then go back to your room. The rooms are largely set down boulevard's away from the entertainment areas.    But do you know even given the issues above all 4 of us on this trip felt very comfortable here as long as you stayed away from the elements you didn't like - and there was room to do this. The breakfasts were superb (get there early !) and there was a great variety for lunch (for pancakes and doughnuts (get there late to avoid queues) and the dinners were surprisingly good once you found your way around the vast array of food( get there early) and the wine flowed and we played cards in or outside the restaurant in the evening without being disturbed. It all went very strangely quiet around 10.30p.m.    Contrary to some reports I've seen the staff were largely very friendly and trust me  compared to the lack of service we got at some of the golf clubs were very efficient. The porters need special praise the reception staff unfortunately are too few and we were subject to long delays there.    Overall then we couldn't help but like this hotel after we had found our way around and it was a good central location for the Marrakech golf courses.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kunal K wrote a review Mar 2014,30,"Hotel good, avoid spa at all costs","We had a pleasant stay here last week having bought Travelzoo deal. We got in on the easyjet flight arriving at around 10.30 and were in the hotel before 12. We were then told the rooms were not ready and we would have to wait 3 hours so we had lunch and loitered around the pool. It's annoying but not the end of the world.  Other stuff - a charge of 30dh per day for using the safe in the room?! Come on! That's just ridiculous. Qwerty Travel the agent also did not inform us that there are taxes to pay when you check out at the rate of 33dh/day/room but this is not the hotel's fault.    The hotel grounds are very well maintained and the rooms are simple and clean. Staff are very friendly. Towels are replaced a bit too late in the day though. Food was reasonably healthy and fresh but there was no variety day to day and it lacked flavour. The no flavour point doesn't really bother me as I understand this is a family hotel catering to a range of people but there were no separate chillis ginger strong pepper available if you wanted to change it to your own taste. This being Morocco I was shocked there was actually no houmous! How about getting some more Middle Eastern food? The chefs were however very nice - my mother is diabetic and they put out wholemeal bread one day and made an effort to get her some fruits from the back which was appreciated. Didn't use the animation team but they seemed very good from what I saw.    The bad part - the spa. We spent nearly 4000 dirhams here and the treatments were very average. The hammam was just not hot enough. The hammam scrub wasn't very thorough and it felt as though the staff were just disinterested. For one of the treatments lasting 90 mins the lady took us in at 3.45pm for a 3.30pm appointment (not even offered a drink while waiting) and then promptly put on her coat and left at exactly 5pm 15 mins short of the time. No water was offered during this fairly long treatment involving reflexology. Poor form. We then complained about the short time - the staff initially offered us an additional 30 mins the next day (at 6.30am!!) when we were supposed to check out and when we declined this she called her manager. Post the phone call things went very downhill. The staff member accused us of lying and said ""we have CCTV"". We walked out and complained at reception and then to Jawad the guest relations manager who was excellent. He resolved the issue to our satisfaction when we were checking out. The staff at the spa are very arrogant so complaints should be directed to him.    We would come back here again but we won't be using the spa.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,welovefrance22 wrote a review Mar 2014,10,Overbooked and inexperienced and rude staff,I stayed here last August but was too angry and incensed to bother leaving a review! Until now. We booked this hotel for 5 nights through Easyjet holidays. Travelling were myself husband 2 young children and my elderly mother who had been with us to Marrakech the year before and loved it. That time we stayed at the Riu Tikida Garden. We arrived at around 10pm and we were immediately ushered for a quick dinner in what I can only describe as a school hall. The food was dire. After some greasy chips and a plate of rice each we went back to the reception to collect our room keys only to be told there were no rooms available and we were being transferred down the road to another Kenzi Hotel. We were not happy especially with two exhausted young kids desperate for their beds and it was around 1am before we finally settled at the Kenzi Palace around 3 miles down the road. Now the Palace is a great hotel - like booking in to the Hilton in London - but not suited to our needs. Too formal dark and lacking any atmosphere at all. Great for a romantic break but not for a family with children. To cut a very sad tale short we basically spent 5 days going back and forth between the two Kenzi Hotels because no one could tell us if we had a room or not what our compensation would be or even if they ever had a room in our name! The staff here are a joke! They constantly lied and misled us. They had no sympathy for our plight at all. In the end we remained at the Kenzi Palace but our 'all inclusive' entitlement was severely limited and we were treated differently to the other Palace guests. We booked the Club Agdal for the water slides and spent every day waiting around for 'complimentary' mini buses to take us between the hotels - on one or two occasions only to find the slides closed early and no towels available. The drinks at the Club are completely vile and come in a tiny plastic cup. The food is rank and smothered in flies. In one way I was pleased we were moved to a much more classier hotel but I had more chance of audience with the pope than getting any compensation. I would never recommend this shambles of a hotel to anyone.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/welovefrance22
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Alastair B wrote a review Mar 2014,10,"Overbooked, not all inclusive and a disaster",We arrived having booked via lastminte.com with a confirmed reservation to be told they were overbooked and had no room for us. After a lot of debate a new hotel in the same chain was found for us. (The Kenzi Palace). This has no bed for our 4 year old despite many requests we eventually had to grab a member of staff and frog march them to a store room and bring a bed back to the room and assemble ourselves (by this time it was midnight!) The facilities here were less than was promised at our original they wanted us to pay to use the pool despite being all inclusive (£15 per person). We persuaded them to go back to the original hotel which now had rooms.Here we were given an ok room. But it was also billed all inclusive true for food and drink but nothing else. The outdoor heated pool was unable to be used most of the time as it was covered due to small amounts of rain the indoor pool was out of bounds to children not what they advertise. The gym cost £15 and most of the facilities unable to be used as it wasn't sunny. The hotel decision not ours. Multiple complaints got us nowhere including with last minute who were hopeless. When we said we were complaining and would write an accurate trip advisor report we were offered a 2 night stay (hotel only). We refused as flights and transport would have more than exceeded the value. After much wrangling on our return last minute offered us 1 nights refund.,Date of stay: February 2014,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Boston, Massachusetts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlastairGB

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sageyLondon wrote a review Feb 2014,50,Thank you Kenzi Club Staff,This is our second visit to the hotel same time of year-15th-21st February. Very clean hotel staff are lovely and even though their main language is French who are very well catered for here the staff always made you feel welcome. The food is good and the Moroccan pastries at breakfast (Mnemon) are delicious with the honey and the bread and cakes are good too. There is always something to eat even for a fussy child and older people and the chefs are really helpful.  Our thanks as always goes to the staff Murad in the Atlas restaurant (nights) a lovely welcoming guy who is very quick and always so polite and asks you about your day. Ayesha the maid in the O'liveira Riad who made the most beautiful decorations with our towels and made our room smell of flowers every day. Abdullah in the bar (nights) he looked after my Dad and made his drinks perfectly thank you! Also our thanks to Adel on reception a friendly polite and really helpful guy. Also the guy who looks after the animals in the gardens he made my daughters day by letting her hold the baby rabbits and also stroking the kid goat thank you for your kindness !  Great shuttle service to the main square it does get booked up quickly but it is free and really handy. The entertainment is slightly cheesy but the entertainment staff are friendly and do try their hardest to include everyone even though it is aimed at the French guests who seem to love it especially after a few vino's.  My only moan and this is minor is that the pool when we came the same time last year was really warm and heated this time it was cold and i know we didn't have perfect weather but it was most definetely not heated this year.

Breakfast was the best with freshly made omelettes of your choice range of fresh juices fruits porridge croissants assorted bread etc. Food at lunch and dinner could become repeatative & boring for some people after few days but freshly made pizza green salad and pasta provide a good alternative. Not to forget the desert - spoiled for choice.  Marrakech is a small city could be covered in one day. Would recommend to take a trip to Atlas Mountains. Hiking to see the water falls is not for faint hearted. You have to be fit to climb up the rough track. Don't trust the guides who would tell you the track is easy to climb.

With such a wide selection you can never get bored (just don't try and eat everything on your first day).  The holiday was well worth the price £400 all inclusive. More than a five star hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Travelling Couple wrote a review Feb 2014,30,Good and bad.,"A friend and I traveled to this hotel for a short 5 day trip and were really excited to have got such a bargain. When we arrived the weather was gorgeous and check in was fast and friendly - led by the customer relations man. He gave us a quick tour of the grounds and dropped us off to have lunch at the restaurant as the rooms weren't quite ready which wasn't a problem.  We were impressed with the facilities the hotel was nice and clean but the cash point was out of order. We enjoyed the opportunity to have a bottle of wine with lunch as opposed to glasses and felt like we were in for a treat.    Lunch is buffet style with lots on offer - when we sat to eat we discovered the food was luke warm at best but we put that down to us being slow to walk round or arriving late for lunch. Unfortunately the food all week was same day in day out (with a few little changes) and was always luke warm no matter what time we turned up or how quick we ran around.    We were shown to out room by one of the staff who then would not leave our room without tipping - we are not adverse to tipping for good service but he was sullen and we did not have any cash on us as the cash point was not working we told him this and he told us to give him english money this was a bit intimidating for two girls traveling alone so I gave him a fiver and he went on his way. The room was not a twin so we rang reception and they told us to head back and they would give us another room. Whist there we made inquiries about how we could go about getting some money/pool towels/ spa bookings etc and this was when we discovered how rude and unhelpful the reception staff could be. more most questions we got given one word answers or ""speak to my colleague"". We felt like we were being a burden and interrupting them and they did not want to speak to us. Unfortunately being our first visit to the country when we asked where we can get money to be told ""medina"" is not enough information for us.    We booked a massage and a facial each the spa looked great but the staff were again what brought it down all through our treatments they were popping in to each others treatment rooms and chatting to each other which really takes the shine off a relaxing massage the facial was a similarly disjointed experience with a grand finale of pimple squeezing with their fingernails (ouch!!!)    Any way to summarize the facilities are great the rooms were clean modern and tended to daily by pleasant staff (although there was not even water in the mini fridge) the pool area was lovely plenty of sun loungers and a bar area the spa area was modern and clean and full of potential but everywhere we turned there were rude unhelpful staff visibly annoyed at having to talk to us. I have to say the entertainment staff were the nicest and they work from sun up to well after sun down and always have a smile on their faces and a kind word to say to everyone.

The hotel provides a great range of food prepared to a high standard. We particularly enjoyed an excellent meal in the small traditional Moroccan restaurant. The hotel is generous with its alcohol and we had plenty of mineral water. We were able to take some back to our room to ensure we didn't need to drink the water. Overall the people we met in the city centre were friendly and very quick to say that they didn't want money to help you find your way. Naturally there are those people who see us tourists that they can make money from and we are seen as very rich. The overall experience of the medina souks and restaurants was an assault on the senses. It is a bustling and frenetic place interesting and full of history! Despite some comments from other travellers about the location of the hotel I was pleased that the hotel was situated away from the old town. It was a peaceful haven after exploring the city centre.

If you are going after reading the review make sure to ask about daily excursions in to the Atlas mountains by 4x4 and don't forget to get on the camels and catch a horse and carriage back to the hotel - was worth it!    The only negative thing is don't pay more than 100day/150night dirham's from outside the hotel taxis will try to charge you 200 so set the price before you get in.    I paid 60 from the market to the hotel as well.    Don't forget to haggle everything lol.",Date of stay: January 2014,,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moebee123
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,annapaola1 wrote a review Feb 2014,10,A nightmare not an holiday! Un incubo non una vacanza,PLEASE DON't MAKE RESERVATIONS TO THIS PLACE! Per PIACERE NON PRENOTATE LA VOSTRA VACANZA IN QUESTO RESORT! My husband and I just came back from Marrakech yesterday night 07-feb-2014. This is the first time I am leaving a review and I really hope that nobody else will go thru a similar nightmare! Sorry for those who have booked already just go there with no major expectations at all or you will be very disappointed: this IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMMAGINATION! We've booked this short holiday to give us the opportunity to relax and help us to find some positive strength after a very difficult time. We are easy going people friendly and sensitive and kind with everyone and use to real 5 star resorts and hotels. On our arrival at 10 pm the 3-February-2014 we've approached the reception desk to exchange detail and get the room and we've asked at the receptionist if it was possible to eat something. He turn to his colleague and ask information and he finally told us to go at the nearest KFC outside the resort because after a certain time the restaurant were closed within the resort. After a while discussing the situation and trying to explain that we were really tired he then agreed to send us some food to the room. The bellboy escorted us to the room and as soon as we opened the door we realised it was 2 separate beds. when we've book tre holiday my only request was to get a double bed. We had to go back to the main reception and beg them to give us a double bed room. The food they sent us was ridiculous and they forgot to give us the brad. As I got to the bathroom to wash my teeth a massive cockroach got close to my foot I start shouting as I have a massive fobia for cockroaches and my husband had to kill two of them! I couldn't sleep all night! Not a good start! The morning after we went to the reception and as I was explaining the situation a blond European girl who was speaking French was called to talk with us in English and she made a very sarcastic comments probably thinking to be funny about the cockroach maybe walking on your face whilst a sleep. We've asked if there was something they can do about it and they told us no that is normal. The washbasin was Brocken and we kindly asked several time if it was possible to repair it as we couldn't let out the dirty water it was fixed after 3 days. the bed sheet were the same from the first day to the end of the holiday. The room was fearly cleaned and the fridge bar was completely empty...not really the 5 star service we are use to! The amenities are well maintained and it was nice to be sat near the swimming pool to enjoy the sunshine. The breakfast was nice but the main meals not particularly good or testy at all in fact I would rather say they weren't even average! The smell of food wasn't inviting at all and the cakes looks all different and appealing but no testy at all especially if you are use to good food! The body massage are really good! but if you wish to swim indoor or use the stem room you have to pay extra even if you are on all inclusive base. The indoor swimming pool looks nice but the water is colder than the outside swimming pool....so we brought with us our swimming costumes for nothing! Really disappointing so far! The entertainment team was ridiculous to be really kind and use an euphemism! Don't book any exclusion this is a real robbery especially the camel ride! We've payed 500 dh and they didn't give us any receipt! We've ask for a receipt but we've been told it was not necessary....we wonder why? Did they not pay for tax like us all? The camel ride was ridiculous especially compared to the experience we've had on the Egyptian desert which was quite a remarkable experience! But this one in Marrakech was a real joke and also dangerous since they've made us cross main busy roads to take us the this ridiculous garden with a few palms trees and lots of rubbish! What a wast of money! If you wish to visit the monuments go without a guide it is not worth the price and the general experience! You can get better information by reading about the monuments on Wikipedia but at list you are free! There is so much I would like to say but I am sure by now you are tired already so final surprise was the check out. We were allowed to keep the room up to 3 pm as our flight was at 7:30pm. We've approached the desk at reception and the man behind the desk printed the invoice out. We were really disappointed considering we were on all inclusive base to discovered to have been charged for that horrible food we were served on our arrival in the room we were charged with additional vat for every time I had a body massage and bear in mind body massage are not really cheep and at the spa I wasn't advice about extra charges every time I was asked to sign the invoice after every treatment. We did complain politely with the man and ask for explanations but he told us this is the amount of money you have to pay. I told him this is ridiculous and this is not a 5 star hotel at all. All in all yes I am considering suing them 4 nights and 3 days of nightmare!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,NijelS wrote a review Feb 2014,40,Very pleasant,6 of us stayed for a week in January.  Rooms were a good size  quiet & very well cleaned. as were the grounds & gardens.  Plenty to do in the hotel & facilities well maintained. We didn't have great weather for a couple of days - not nice enough to lie by one of the pools but kept ourselves amused with tennis/ boules / table tennis & archery.  Food was fine. Plenty of choice but some of the dishes were sometimes luke warm. The restaurant staff were helpful. Our favourite waiter would have a table for 6 laid out ready for us at dinner with ice buckets at the ready for wine & beer. Nothing was too much trouble with glasses being regularly refilled & plates taken away.  Coffee at breakfast was pretty rotten so I ended up going to the pool bar for a decent cup most days .    Taxis outside the hotel if you want to go into town. Negotiate before you get in - we were quoted 150 dirham but usually paid 70/80.  We organised a limo from the airport for the 6 of us. Driver was waiting for us in arrivals & collected us at the end of our holiday from the hotel. Cost for both ways was 40 euro. We also hired the same limo & driver for a day out. Highly recommended @ 80 euro . check oy their website luxury-riads.com    Only moan we had was with reception. only the cashier can take money for towels & taxes for checkout so it was a painful process,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Stirling, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NijelS

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,joanna w wrote a review Jan 2014,50,fabulous time in Marrakech,My friend and I stayed here for 3 nights while competing in the Marrakech Half Marathon and it really was fantastic. Admittedly we got a very good deal but we really loved everything there. The staff were very helpful (as long as you speak French!) The pool and spa were beautiful and our deluxe room was really spacious. I was able to get wifi in pretty much all areas tho' I think it depends on your provider as my friend couldn't get it at all. We found the food excellent with masses of choice and were very impressed with the red and white wine. All local spirits and cocktails are also included and free flowing pretty much all of the time. Because it was January it was pretty quiet and we were very lucky with the weather. Because it is Africa it did become very chilly at night but the heating in the room worked a treat. It is slightly out of the way of the main areas but the hotel runs a free shuttle bus which was great. I thoroughly recommend this place for an out of season mini break.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joannaw7

For once in Morocco it felt professional.    the only issue was the distance. Expect to get a taxi to go anywhere and more so expect to get ripped off by every taxt driver in Morocco! Tip - Always ask them to use the meter if they so no inform them that you are aware that is forbidden by law not to use the meter.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,missvroom wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Not 5 stars but not bad if you get a deal,The hotel is attractive with beautiful well maintained gardens. It's located a fair bit out of town surrounded by half finished abandoned resorts. The rooms are nice large enough and always clean. Bathroom as well is clean and there was always hot water. You have to pay 30 dirham/day if you want to use the safe in the room. I've never had that before. One other negative about the room is that the walls are paper thin! You can hear everything so hope you're not a light sleeper.  The food is very very average. There was always loads of Italian food (pizza pasta) which is disappointing when you've come for good Moroccan food! Food is very repetitive. If you stay for any length of time I imagine you'd get very bored very quickly.  My advice is take the free shuttle into town and experience some proper food! I recommend booking the shuttle the day before as there is only space for 8 and it fills up quickly. It goes about once and hour.  It is mainly frequented by French tourists but the staff generally speak good English with the exception of the spa staff. I had a free hamman and was basically abandoned to find everything while the girls gossiped over tea. Poor.  There's entertainment which is cringe. It's supposed to be a five star resort not butlins. I hate enforced fun but perhaps people with younger children will enjoy this. For me it ruined it a bit as there was no escape in the evenings for a quiet drink. (only one bar).  On the plus side they are generous with the alcohol.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Winchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missvroom
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,C-Loh_brown wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Excellent on a deal,This hotel is beautiful amazing garden areas lovely pool and the room we had was fantastic and air conditioned. Where this place fell was with the food primarily often undercooked and definitely avoid everything with cheese in it. Secondly was the overall atmosphere while great for the family and I was there with my family so it was great. The place does have a butlins feel to it. Secondly was the taxi the hotel booked for us which was about 5 times as expensive as the rank outside the hotel we really did not expect that from the hotel itself.    I wouldn't visit again but my experiences of morocco unfortunately are marred and that is more to do with feeling that everyone was trying to rip me off as opposed to the hotel itself. Best idea is a short family break here 4 days and it will be a fantastic trip.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C-Loh_brown
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ceinwen01 wrote a review Jan 2014,50,Modern Hotel in traditional style,Lovely hotel -only two floors high built in traditional Moroccan style in magical gardens and courtyards. Big rooms. Great staff who were always cheerful friendly and very helpful. Huge variety of really good food for all tastes at all meals - different every day and spoiled for choice! - snacks available all day. We went in January and the weather was wet but we had free access to the spa pool and the hammam (I wonder if they'd taken notice of Maryanne's review?)which was amazing. We didn't see any night club and found it very quiet and relaxing. There seemed to be a lot of facilities for children situated to one side so that they could be safe and wouldn't be disturbing anyone else.  We walked outside the walls but it was in the middle of nowhere with nothing but roads around - best to get shuttle bus or taxi into town.,Date of stay: January 2014,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Edgworth,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceinwen01

It is quite a way out: don't make the mistake we did of trying to get there on number 19 bus from the airport. We had to get a taxi as well! Free bus from hotel into Marrakech but you must book it. Great choice of food in buffet and reasonable choice of drinks. Some things not open for winter and VERY DISAPPOINTED that the indoor pool (located in the spa) cost approx £10 per person for a swim!! We went in January and the weather was wet and it was not warm enough to swim outdoors. Even with the somewhat heated water of the one open outdoor pool you would freeze when you got out of it.

The spa indoor pool and Hammam facility were deliberately difficult to access and the staff extremely rude and awkward. When one of us managed to book and access the indoor pool he was charged £7 for the privilege.  We had many golfers in our group.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Caterina-Malorni wrote a review Jan 2014,10,Most untrustable and unattentive staff ever,"The location is ok ( nothing special really) but I've never been treated like this in my whole life. I'm speechless. First of all their english is pretty lame so unless you know french you won't have a proper communication with any of them which in 2014 I find it severe. Their level of care towards the guest on an escalation of 1 to ten can be considered -3. For example I've lost my hat and asked a couple of time if they found it or had a lost and found and all I've received from them is just a rude ""NO"" without even looking at me. I work in the hotel industry and I know how important it is to let the guest feel at his ease but there it looks like they don't have the faintest idea of what hospitality or at least a decent service is. But here comes the worst part. I was there with my boyfriend and had an early flight so I left at 7 30 in the morning. I decided to pay cash for the spa treatments and they said ""no problems madame"" so I gave 100 € and left. When my boyfriend had to check out and settle the bill which would have included only the rate of our stay without any extra he could see it looked like if the spa charges had been already paid. When he pointed them out they started lying saying I haven't paid. When I've heard what happened I called them and talked so someone at the reception saying he would have checked and called me back. He didn't. I called back after 3 hours and he said his manager wasn't there and that he would have solved it with him the net morning and that he would have called back. I'm still waiting for their call and judging on how much you can trust a staff that is trying to steal money from you I guess that won't happen.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,cherylb3007 wrote a review Jan 2014,30,NOT 5 star!!,We stayed here over Christmas and although the rooms were pretty clean they were very basic and dated. The shower went from boiling to freezing while you were in it and we considered it to be a real safety issue but after 5 visits from engineers and managers they decided it was just the way the showers were in Marrakech! RUBBISH! They just couldn't fix it and we had to suffer it every day.  The breakfast was...ok but nothing was really clean. Cutlery was dirty every day as were cups and plates and glasses!!  The entertainment in the bar on an evening was painful as they had a duo who sang the same songs (poorly) every night! Tell me kwando wore a little thin after 6 nights!!! And the bar carried on the theme of dirty glassware - every night.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ash12342014 wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Kernzi Club Agdal Medina,Had a great time with my wife for 6 days in December 2013. Staff were friendly and the food reasonable. There are 2 pools an outdoor bar and one in the club. There were not too many travelers and most of them were from France. There were quite a lot of flies around the place though. I guess this is common in most of these places and does not seem to bother the locals. Other good point nice and clean rooms and closeness to the medina. There is a shuttle available from the hotel and needs to be reserved a day in advance. Runs almost every hour until 6:30 PM. Bad points: At both the bars they always gave dirty glasses when you ordered any drinks Heated pool was more cold than heated. Not warm enough to use at the time we were there. Menu was repetitive and not worth a 5 stars hotel. They try to do a different theme every day but the food seemed to be the same daily. Choices of moroccan food and Italian seemed common. It was a bit cold and needed to be warmed in the microwave.    Spa was ok. Offered free hammam which is just sharing a pool bath with others. There are other packages but cannot get credit for the free if you choose those.    Most staff do not speak good English. French and Arabic was common but can get by. You can book tours from the hotel. There is a desk on the opposite side of the reception. A bit more expensive then what you can book in Medina. Again try to bargain. Most tours just include transportation tour guides are extra.    Taxi to Medina cost around 70 dirhams if you have to use it. Need to make sure you negotiate the price before you go. Taxi from/to the airport was 100 dirhams. They will try to charge more. Must bargain.    If you go to Medina stay in crowded areas. If you are seen looking at a map or are lost or look confused individuals will approach you to help and will follow you because they are expecting money for helping you. Even a friendly conversation has a motive to get money from you.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hillsborough, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ash12342014

There are two pools and there were more flies than guests!. Both the pool-sides were almost deserted with many sunbeds. Free courtesy bus down to the town but it got booked up very quickly not sure how good this service would be in high season but once you learn the right price for Taxis (approx. 50) rather than the rip off on arrival at the airport!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Gwyn L wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Surprisingly good Christmas break - The Llewelyn trio, Caernarfon, Wales.",We chose the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina in Marrakech 'online' with Travel Experience as it appeared to serve our purpose but is included in only a few main-stream holiday brochures. As a couple with an adult daughter with slight learning difficulties it was essential that we shared a room. A larger one was readily provided when we explained the situation. Indeed the ubiquitous guest relations manager Jawad Motia proved to be an exemplary ambassador for this hotel throughout our stay over this last Christmas week. In an all-inclusive resort the food inevitable becomes monotonous but here the varied and abundant choice meant repetition could usually be avoided. In any case any shortcomings were more than made up by the sumptuous Christmas Eve buffet! Having said that the reasonably acceptable white wine provided was not chilled neither was the drinking water: conversely tea and coffee was invariable never hot! The level of cleanliness in the rooms inside the public areas and in the grounds of the resort was exemplary. A word of special praise is due to the team of young dedicated entertainers whose energy with the young and not so young seemed boundless seemingly being on duty 24/7 but still finding time to chat to guests without being intrusive. Indeed all the staff were extremely courteous and helpful. As a couple we would have chosen a more individualistic ambience but for a winter family break in our circumstances we could find little to fault the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina.,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,Caernarfon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwynl2014

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,richard w wrote a review Dec 2013,30,"Nice Facilities, Mediocre Menu","We booked this hotel as a relaxoing break after a 4-day tour of Morocco. For the most part it met this intent.    The rooms were large and very comfortable. We had three persons (one adult and two children) in each room. The staff kept them clean and welcoming. The only ""gripe"" I have with the room is the empty refrigerator. In an all-inclusive resort it would be nice to provide some snacks and something to drink in the room (though the cleaning staff did provide one bottle of water each evening this doesn't do much for three persons).    The grounds were meticulously kept and beautiful to walk. The workers around the facility and at reception were warm and accomodating as was the wait staff in the restaurant and the bar-tenders. Our son is allergic to wheat and they were kind enough to get him some fruit and yogurt during snack time as everything laid out for sanck contained wheat products (all cakes and cookies).  I wish I could say the same for the entertainment staff around the pool. They were rude condescending and overall unpleasant to be around (there were one or two exceptions though few and far between). Generally these young employees seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves playing their own games or entertaining the younger crowd. It appeared quite ""cliquish"" and we just tried to avoid them. On one day my sons and I were completely ignored at an activity when a young group of French/ Morrocan men and women arrived at the activity. The hotel would do well to cut many of those employees.  The only other negative I have concerns the food. The selection was quite limited and not very good (flavorless). This may be because we had just travelled Morocco for the previous four days and expected the food to be similar. The meat selection is minimal and over-done (one lunch offered only fish and no other meat). Though they do try to add a couple (1-2 dishes) dishes each evening for their ""theme"" overall the food was disappointing.  Take advantage of the shuttle bus to the square and visit down there; it's a great experience. The hotel is about 15-20 minutes from either down-town or the airport. Be prepared to pay 50-100drh for a cab to either destination (though always haggle with the cab driver and agree upon a price before getting in; they seldom if ever use the meter).  If you have the chance also take an excursion through the Atlas Mountains. We did not use the hotel for any excursions as we had just completed another tour but the country is wonderful and worth visiting outside the hotel.  Overall the hotel is beautiful with wonderful facilities and a great chance to relax. Just try to avoid the entertainment staff (especially if you don't speak Arabic or French) and don't set the bar too high for the food.",Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Mons, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardw106
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Clare B wrote a review Dec 2013,40,"Enjoyable holiday , but....",We stayed here at the beginning of December. We arrived late evening at the hotel and was told that there was a problem with our booking and that we would have to stay at a different hotel for the night and return in the morning when our room would be ready for us. Not very happy about this but didnt have much choice. We were told that the other hotel would be all inclusive also and they would send a driver for us after breakfast.  The other hotel was indeed lovely and we had a nice evening meal before bed. The next morning we had breakfast then went to reception to meet out driver to take us back to Kenzi Club to be told that they werent ready for us and could we wait till lunch time. This was all becoming very annoying as we were only there for a short break and it was wasting our time! To top it of the hotel gave us a bill for drinks as it turns out they are not all inclusive which we had paid for.    When we finally got back to the Kenzi Club at 12.30 we were told that we could not check in untill 2pm so we could either wait in reception or do a tour. Getting very frustrated by now we decided not to waste anymore time and went into the city for a few hours until we could check in.    Finally at around 4pm on the 2nd day of 5 day holiday we managed to get to our room. We had room 511 which was fine apart from the single beds pushed together but we had lost the will by then!    The hotel itself is lovely and beautifully kept. Everything was cleaned everyday. They were hardly any guests so not sure why we couldnt have our room the first night.    We decided to forget about the first night and make the most of our stay. The hotel was lovely the food was good and we found all the staff to be friendly and courteous.  We used the Spa which was lovely and all the girls in there were very friendly and helpful.  Our last night we ate in the Morroccan restaurant. We were the only ones in there which felt a bit odd but the food was fantastic would highly recommend.  Didnt bother with the afternoon snacks as they are covered in flies as mentioned in previous reviews but really didnt need any snacks as ate to much at each meal!!  The weather for December was lovely and warm and we really enjoyed our stay.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,EllyBald wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Gorgeous food!,"Possibly the best food we've had in a large hotel. Everything was delicious and prepared to a very high standard. The chefs obviously care very much indeed about quality and presentation. The tagines were out of this world and we cannot recommend them highly enough. Everywhere was very clean and well ordered. It was low season when we visited (early Dec) and the hotel not that busy so the cleaning staff were all outside cleaning the sunbeds. The bedrooms were spacious and the king-size bed was high quality and extremely comfortable. The reception staff all spoke very good English and the waiters spoke enough to make a non-French speaker feel comfortable and at home. The waiters were superb couldn't do enough for us and anticipated our every need. Plates were cleared immediately and the entire dining room was a well-run machine; the lighting was soft and you didn't get that ""canteen"" feel that often blights big hotels.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Andy R wrote a review Dec 2013,40,December Treat,Visited this hotel last minute as a birthday treat  Stayed on a 4 night all inclusive package  Check in was easy and as a side note the foyer smelt lovely  Our room was super with a nice big bed and a balcony  All facilities were open except for the pool bar had no food snacks and the nightclub wasn't open both due to being out of season  Also some of the outside areas were not in use  There was another club which had entertainment on every night and I must say it was different every night and most enjoyable  Same with the food different themes every night  Food was buffet style and served breakfast lunch & dinner  There was also a Moroccan restaurant which was available at a supplement we booked it for my birthday and had a lovely night  There was a Moroccan guitar player/singer and also a cake courtesy of the hotel  Temperature was low 20's and very nice  Souks worth a visit again free shuttle bus courtesy of hotel  Most of the staff were amazing and very helpful  Would recommend a visit here out of season  Might return next spring when a lot more of the external areas will be in use and a tad warmer,Date of stay: December 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Camberley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyruss45
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Martin906 wrote a review Dec 2013,20,Hotel good staff terrible,Having never been to Morrocco we were a bit aprehensive if Marrakesh expecting it to be a vibrant place with good quality hotels.    If you come to this hoitel and you are british then you are not welcome by the staff especially the bar staff. When you are all inclusive the expectation is that you can eat and drink as you please this is not the case here. We were restricted to one drink from the bar per person even though I only wanted one drink for me and another for my wife. Mustafa the bar manager was very arrogant and caused a lot of unpleasentness.    Pool staff were excellent especially Milo and they got everyone to join in. Fantastic.    Room was ok  Marrakesh was a 10-15min taxi/shuttle bus ride away - you need to book shuttle bus both ways.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martin906
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Happy69Traveller wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Could not fault,"Stayed at the Kenzi Club in early November after moving from a Riad in the Medina which we could not tolerate for any longer! As soon as we arrived at the Kenzi Club we knew we have made the right choice. We were made to feel so welcome from the start. There was a slight mix up with the rooms allocated but once sorted with the booking agent they moved us straight away. The rooms were of a good size and very clean.    All the staff from the room attendants bar staff restaurant staff and entertainment guys could not do enough for you and always had a smile on their face. The pool areas were not crowded and there were always plenty of loungers to choose from. The restaurant always had plenty of choice and the pasta station was a particular favourite. As I am quite fussy about the temperature of my food it was a nice touch having a microwave available for if you like your food piping hot! Wine served at lunch and dinner was provided in bottles which were left at the table which was nice as you felt like you were sitting in a ""proper"" restaurant unlike a lot of all inclusive resorts where you are provided with a glass of wine or you have to help yourself from a self serve wine vat!    We are not usually ones for staying for evening entertainment but I must say on the couple of occasions we did the staff put on a good show which showed off their dance talents and humour and before and after the shows got the audience to participate in either quizes or dancing.    If I was to return to Marrakech I would definitely return to the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina!",Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Guernsey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy69Traveller
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Craig P wrote a review Dec 2013,40,My visit,The hotel was very good. Fresh mint tea on arrival and the room was very clean with a great shower. The facilities were very good and the grounds well kept. I would recommend this hotel for a few days of R & R you don't even have to venture out if all you want is sun food and rest .  The reception staff need to learn more English if the Brits are to made welcome as it is a very French influenced hotel. The food was excellent but the bar shut too early at 11 and if you want to party on you will have to go outside of the resort as it is a bit isolated. All in all a lovely place to stay and good value. The weather this week was 25 degrees pleasant enough to sunbathe. 8/10 for me.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Hitchin, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigP718
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Prrodney wrote a review Dec 2013,50,Wonderful!,We are a group of 9 & stayed for a long weekend at the Kenzi Club. I liaised with Saadia from reservations re transfers & room requests. She was extremely helpful & sent an email confirmation for all of our requests. On arrival our requests were all met & our transfers were very smooth indeed. At the hotel we were cared for by Kaoutar who ensured that we were comfortable & that our rooms were ready. All of the staff were very helpful & friendly. This is mainly a French speaking hotel but everyone went out of their way to communicate with us. The Animation staff were fun & very welcoming. They translated their shows into English & made us feel very welcome. The shows are of a very good standard & participation is at your discretion. There is no pressure from them for you to participate which is great. The food was great! An excellent variety of international & local fayre. There was plenty of choice & the vegetable tagines were especially good. Freshly grilled meats a pasta station pizza station salad bar - everything you wanted was available. We were on an all inclusive basis & we weren't disappointed. Local wines & beer were always available & were of a nice quality. Cocktails were available from the bar & the pool bar was also available. The hotel was immaculate. Very clean rooms & the public areas were very well kept. The walkways were washed down daily & the gardens were beautifully manicured. There are good areas for games including beach volleyball table tennis Boules football archery & shooting. The 2 swimming pools are very large & also kept very clean. We visited at a quiet time of year at the end of November & would visit at this time again. Thank you to you all at Kenzi Club. We had a great visit & hope to return again soon.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prrodney
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sian G wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Relaxing break,If you want a 7 day break with a good standard of accommodation and friendly service all round Kenzi is a very good bet. Be prepared for it to be cool in the mornings and at night if you are going now or in the next 2/3 months. Don't take loads of shorts and sun dresses you wont be able to wear them in the evenings think smart casual jeans trousers with a warm jacket However by noon most days lovely for sunbathing and it does get hot I got heat rash on my second day. We had the place to ourselves. There are plenty of lovely areas to sit around the hotel with a good choice of loungers and comfy chairs. We didn't use the spa we had a complimentary 30 minute steam room ticket which we didn't use. The rest of the spa facilities did have to be paid for including the pool. The prices seemed OK but it was so nice outside we didn't bother. The hotel and its grounds are kept beautifully clean and tidy by an army of workers. Gardens are very well planted and there are also lots of quirky statues and traditional lamps tastefully situated in the grounds. The all inclusive package gave a wide choice of food of a good quality. Having been on a Royal Caribbean cruise in summer where they really do spoil you I couldn't say the standard or choice of food was as good but even if you don't like exotic food plenty of pizza pasta options and always at least 4 types of tagine. You have to remember this is Morocco not London. The wine was moroccon but quite drinkable if you like a pinot or something dry. The beer both bottled and draught was local not an expert but I enjoyed it. Plenty of premium soft drinks ie cokes fantas etc. cocktails a bit on the sweet side and I did not see any recognisable brands but they tasted fine. If you do the Fantasia trip wear warm clothes as its mainly outside. Recommend trip to Atlas mountains. Be prepared to haggle on everything even the taxis and if you can't face it just shop in the airport shops when you leave where you can get everything that's in the souk for around the same price. If you want to get rid of your dhirrums you wont be able to spend them in the airport duty free they only accept euro and we would recommend that you use euros for everything easier to get a better rate at home and the Moroccans seems to prefer it too. Don't let anyone drape a snake over you or put henna on your hands when you are in the Medina. They will say its free and when you walk away will hunt you down!! I have visited Cairo and other muslim countries like Turkey and Sudan. I found the Moroccans pretty laid back with a good sense of humour and for me they gave the holiday another dimension. Get out of the hotel and do some trips you will get a taste of the country. Hotel is well situated and a taxi into town costs about 50 drm. As it was a quiet time we never had a problem getting on the shuttle bus but it does finish around 1830. We will definitely recommend this hotel and Morocco to our friends if they want to recharge their batteries during winter and see somewhere colourful.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Stroud,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SianG376
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sibbos wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights in November and can only think that the earlier poor reviews were written by total nit-pickers. The hotel staff could not be more helpful courteous or pleasant. Every member of staff we passed whilst walking around the site greeted us with a ""Bonjour!"" Our room was large modern and spotless in fact the whole hotel was always being cleaned tidied or having the gardens worked on. The food in the buffet was excellent there was always something to take your fancy and the Moroccan restaurant was a bit of fun. As we had gone outside of the peak season there was no shortage of sunbeds or cabanas at the pools. The entertainments team do work very hard and we enjoyed their nightly shows.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Trina H wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Good value for money,Stayed for 4 nights with friends. Hotel is very comfortable and has an amazing range of activities on offer. The massage at the spa was wonderful and reasonably priced (around £45 for an hours massage). Loads of sun loungers and cabanas by pool. The only thing that I didn't like was the animation team come to life in the afternoon so if you are trying to have an afternoon sleep it is nearly impossible as they come round trying to persuade you to join in the dancing next to the pool. Not really my thing but others may like it.    The food was pretty much the same every day although they did try to do themed nights these tended to consist of one or two extra dishes in the theme. That said there was always something nice to be found and the pasta station was really good. The wine is very drinkable but always served warm. We did add ice in our rose but 3 of the 4 of us had bad tummies so maybe not the best idea!    The minibus is a bit hit and miss. We booked our slot the day before as requested but when we turned up it was full and we were told to wait for the next one. This took about 30 mins to arrive. On the way home we turned up but there were loads of families already waiting so we decided to get a taxi back to the hotel. It was only 100 dirhams so not too bad.    Evening entertainment was of a very high standard and the team really do try very hard. The rope show was amazing!    For the price it's amazing value if you want a base 10 mins outside of the madness of Marrakech.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Reading,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/737trinah

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,jessica w wrote a review Nov 2013,50,great holiday,I just got back from a few wonderful days at Kenzi with a friend. I quick summary:  A spacious heated pool (and another massive pool but that was for summer as the water was freezing)  Lots of sunloungers and very comfortable beds  There is an indoor pool/spa you can pay £10 a day to use but as the weather was beautiful we didn't use it  Hotel staff and the animation team were extremely friendly from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  The buffet was varied and good quality and wine is served by the bottle at dinner so there is plenty!  There is a schedule of activities with dancing ping pong water aerobics cooking demonstration and in the evening there are dance shows in the bar and games if you want it but the animation team just leave you to relax if you're not interested    The only potential negatives for some people could be:  The resort is mainly French the staff speak English but announcements are mostly in French and evening entertainment is aimed at a French audience  If you stayed more than a week you might get bored of the buffet as although there is a big choice it is mostly the same choice every day  as we have some meals in our excursions that we booked with an excellent man Rashid speaks good english his contact in the hotel s reception who can tell you about good restaurant place to see and trips atlas mountains (nice to see). great warning about taxi drivers who may say jemma elfna squarre is closed and take you to their friends shop(lol)  There is music playing by the pool and frequent announcements about activities which might not suit older people who really want to relax.  We were there off season in February and maybe the restaurant and bar could get too congested in peak season  I'll definitely be going back to Club Kenzi as it was absolutely perfect for what I was looking for.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicaw444

The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially Kaoutan (on reception) and Mohamed Bargach (the reception manager).  One thing I think would be a good idea is if the dining room had a collection box for tips. I say this because we had a different waiter most days and most sittings and all were very efficient so it was difficult to choose who to reward.

I also have to mention the girls at the spa and the boys at animation who were very pleasant.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RLG137 wrote a review Nov 2013,50,Really Good Hotel,I took my mother on holiday for her birthday for 4 nights staying at this hotel and it was perfect.  All we wanted to do was get some November sun and relax. The hotel reception was the most amazing smelling place. A man took our bag for us as soon as we got out of our taxi and the staff immediately gave us all the details about the hotel and a complimentary refreshing drink. We were then informed of all the tours that the hotel operated what they included and how much per person. They gave us a map of the hotel and although our room was not ready as we arrived before check in time we were allowed free reign of the hotel and to go straight to get food and drink. They have two swimming pools. One with water slides and aimed more for children/ families and one (that was a lot warmer) for adults just between their main restaurant and their pool bar. All the staff were VERY friendly and helpful always talking to you and introducing themselves. They have activities throughout the day and into the night everyday and announce what is going on by the pool area. They also come and find you if you want to do a specific activity and you don't pay extra for this. They have sports courts and a spa on site. The hotel room was lovely and was cleaned everyday very spacious with a TV and fridge. The food was not amazing but very good for a buffet. It had all sorts of things on offer and was replenished regularly. We barely left the hotel which is exactly what we intended for our holiday and were perfectly happy. The hotel also offers a free shuttle bus to and from Medina for most of the day which is really handy for people that want to explore the old city. I don't ever stay at 5 star hotels usually so to me it deserved the status compared to some other reviews I read. They do charge you 30 Dirham per day for a safe though so we didn't take anything of value with us. The only issue I had is I could only pick up their wifi in reception although they claim the entire hotel has access. I would definitely return and recommend to anyone looking for a lazy and sunny holiday where if you choose not to you don't have to even leave the hotel.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLG137
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sam F wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Great secluded all-inclusive hotel for couples and families,Overall the stay here was very relaxing for my girlfriend and I and a well needed hot break from the miserable English winter (25 degrees in Morocco -2 in England).    For all of those criticising the resort for being french and not catering towards the English that's a load of rubbish! Yes there is a lot of french spoken here but that's Morocco's 2nd language! The natives speak French as fluently as Arabic. The resort definitely caters towards the english having all the food in the buffet labelled in English as well as French and all announcements are made in English or French with translation to English. My girlfriend and I don't speak a word of French and we didn't feel isolated in any way! On one of the nights I was roped into playing a game on stage with 3 other contestants and the host spoke in French and English to cater for all the players and audience members!    The food is good if you are experienced in buffet selection. The food is varied enough for you to have something different every day of the week. The drinks on offer with your meals are an unlimited supply of very good Red Rose or White wine Beer bottled still or sparkling water Fanta Coke Zero or Fanta Limon. One thing to note they don't serve tea or coffee at lunch time or dinner so you have to go to the bar for this which is something they definitely need to implement!    If you pay a small cover charge of 100MAD (Moroccan Dirham which is £8 ish) per person for the Moroccan restaurant you will experience some live music good service and a Moroccan dinner not too dissimilar to the Moroccan themed dinner in the buffet but it's worth doing just for the experience.    The Pools are great one is freezing with slides which is brilliant for the middle of summer but at the time we went (12th - 19th Nov) it was just a little bit too cold for us so we went over to the pool by the bar which is warm and a good size to do some exercise to make you feel a little less guilty about the mountain of food you've just consumed from your over zealous buffet visit.    Another thing to note about the pool bar there are a LOT of honey bees (NOT wasps!) flying around. They didn't seem to bother us but if you're a little scared of Bees then perhaps you won't want to spend so much time by the pool bar.    You do have to pay a 150MAD (£12 ish) cash deposit for each pool towel which is refunded in full at the end of the holiday so it's worth making a note of that cash expense before you go.    Regarding money you should definitely take the amount of cash that you want in English pounds and then change it in the airport when you get to Morocco as they don't let you take their money in or out of the country and cash machines are in short supply and will charge you! (make sure you KEEP your receipt when you exchange the money in the airport because on your return to change the Dirham back to pounds then they'll want to see your first exchange receipt)    Some may mention that reception was rude but it's not that they are rude that's just how they communicate.  The reception area is large and a pleasant experience until you have any problems with your room or wish to talk to reception as there is usually a large queue and they take forever to respond to anything you have. Apart from that they do eventually respond and are very accommodating. Our room's air conditioning was broken and we had two single beds pushed together to form a double so we requested a room change which after some time was granted to us and made the rest of the stay extremely comfortable and air conditioned!    The entertainment team was an energetic extremely hard working and very friendly bunch. They were extremely keen to get people up and dancing and involved with shows and combination dances! The shows were average at best but we do both work professionally in theatre so perhaps our standards are a little high. Regardless of the standard the shows were extremely entertaining!  One person who deserves special mention is Jimi he was a brilliant host and always put in an extra effort to make sure you're enjoying yourself and feel welcome.    In conclusion the stay was extremely relaxing good weather full of free alcohol and a lot of food. They do offer organised tours into Marakech and various Moroccan themed trips like a traditional dinner and camel ride into the sunset if you're willing to pay the price.    We very much enjoyed our stay but would probably go to a different part of Morocco next time as a week was long enough to explore Marakech and see what's there.,Date of stay: November 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamF612

As previously reviewed then animation team is wonderful friendly and everyone of them tries their best to ensure a good time is had by all. Also they are very talented and put on top notch shows in the evenings.  We also found the wait and bar staff to be courteous and hard working. A small tip now and then makes for ""extra"" special service. I tried the spa for a hammon and massage it was a bit less expensive when booked through our tour rep. 450 dhs. I enjoyed it so much that I returned for a 2nd treatment lovely and clean hammon and a great massage in beautiful surroundings.  We stayed in room 947 and found it ideal being close to everything without being bothered by any noise. The Internet connection could have been better but if you move around your room you should find a sweet spot. Ours was from the balcony doors all the way across to the entry door.  A caution on the balcony doors - they lock automatically behind you if closed! We had to call for help when we did this on our first night.  Be cautious of the food tap water and ice. We both enjoyed the food and the variety was sufficient however I was sick for a day with stomach problems. Others that we spoke with had also had some similar problems.

Also towels for the swimming pool are rented from the hotel at 150 dirhams each (cash only which is refunded on departure) so it worth factoring this in to how much spending money you take.

Bit abrupt and surly- I can definitely see what other reviewers mean about this. They don't speak good English but even my attempts at joking in French didn't crack a smile!  - strange issue with towels. Pool towels are 15 euro deposit each but they only issue them at certain times not past 3pm. Also they take the towels in the room and don't give new ones until late afternoon/early evening for some reason- once you know this then you work around it but bit of a mystery why they do this!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JBHolland wrote a review Oct 2013,30,"Nice hotel, but not really great",Let's start with the good news. It is a nice all inclusive hotel with nice food. But we had some small issues. First we arrive at 15 o clock. Check in is at 14 hours. We walked to our room where cleaning staff was still busy with our room. We had to wait outside for our room. We had no towels. At 19 hours I called fot the 4th time that we still had no towels. Finally we got the towels. Drinks near the pool are served in large plastic cups and there were a lot of flies there.  When yoy want a pool towel you need to deposit 150 R for a towel. We arranged that at the reception and went to the pool for our towels. We were informed that there were no towels left and it was not clear when new towels came. Strange. No standard bottle of water on your room.  Maybe all small things but in the end you pay a lot of money and we expected more of this hotel.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Haarlem, The Netherlands",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBHolland

Hotel staff food and entertainment are excellent and could not fault it. We were a big party and would recommend service transfers to get you to the hotel it costs £42 return for a minibus which was nothing split between the families.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,leics,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bartil40
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,grubs77 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Great first all in Louise experience,I'd never tried all inclusive before not really being someone to laze poolside and stay in the same place but after booking a few days last minute to get a rest mid holiday here I would seriously consider doing it again if all places were as welcoming and entertaining as this. The hotel itself is quite grand and when we booked in we were seen to efficiently and were treated every bit as well as the other guests (this is a French speaking hotel so keep that in mind!). Our room was spacious and well kept with a turn down in the evenings. Entertainment from the animation team was more than enough during the day and quite spectacular at night. They made very effort to say hello when passing. Food and drink choice was great although cocktails were a tad bland and prefabricated. Would definitely revisit if in marrakech again.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grubs77
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Josie C wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Exceeded expectations - not sure why anyone can complain,For the price paid the hotel offered good value for money. A short trip from the airport but there is no aircraft noise at the hotel (do not pay for transfers as it is only 100 dirham by cab). We arrived around 11am and our check in was fine the receptionist advised that our room would be ready within 30 mins. You are taken to your room by golf buggy and given a tour of the hotel on your way to your room. We were in Room 307 which was spacious spotlessly clean with a good sized bathroom. The grounds are superbly maintained. The pool area again is spotless and there were always plenty of sunbeds available either around the pool or on the grass with plenty of sun umbrellas and cabanas. The food on offer in the Atlas Buffet is plentiful with lots of choices at each mealtime great salads and deserts including lovely ice cream and wonderful fresh bread. At breakfast there is an omelette station and freshly cooked fried eggs. On occasion the buffet food is not as hot as it could be but choose wisely and you can have freshly cooked pasta or meat or fish at the grilling station and not take something which is sitting in the dish. Great pizzas on offer at lunch and dinner too. There is a microwave in the dining room should you wish to heat something up a bit more but once you get used to the system you will be fine. Would suggest you walk around the buffet and then decide on what you want then your food will be as you would wish. The pool bar can be busy during the day and yes there are some flies around but this is no different to other countries we have visited and it is impossible for the staff or hotel to do anything about this. The Gnawa bar is open from 6pm to 11.30pm for All Inclusive drinks the evening entertainment is based outside this bar. A better selection of drinks is available in this bar but these are all local brands. The entertainment team were excellent they are friendly and interested in making your stay enjoyable. There are activities each day in and around the pool area from 10 till 5. They also put on a show each evening at 10pm. The Fire Show on Saturday night is absolutely amazing. The entertainment team are probably the best I have ever come across and there are activities for all ages and abilities.  I did not at any time feel like the French tourists were preferred over the English guests and all announcements are made in English as well as French and other languages if necessary. The reception staff are extremely busy each day but can speak adequate English for any queries you may have. The shuttle to the Kasbah can be booked or on the day if there is availability but it is only 5 euros by cab. The hotel exchange rate is only marginally less than at the airport so unless you are changing up an enormous amount of money then use the hotel. Overall we had a really good time at the Kenzi Club and would recommend you give it a try and judge for yourself.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosieC426
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,NickTaylor333 wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Excellent Hotel,This hotel was everything that I WASN'T expecting - leading me to believe that if you don't do to much research and photo finding - you'll be surprised.  Having previously visited Djerba (Tunisia) to a 3-star hotel (it was shocking) - my expectations had been lowered for any Arabic country to deliver in standards. It was an unfair approach but hey I was annoyed.    This hotel blew me away. On arrival we were given traditional tea (warning very sweet and minty..!) and asked to fill out forms (standard really). We were then ushered onto the golf buggies to be driven to our room. Another warning this hotel and it's grounds are VAST. Very opulent and well maintained for the most part - but yeah huge.    Our room was fantastic! 3 rooms separated the living area bedroom and bathroom (x2 toilets). The bedroom was a large and very comfortable double with outer-wall lighting and atmospheric in-built lighting around the headrest. x2 televisions (one in the bedroom one in the living room) and a large bathroom with x2 basins and a large bath. Everything was spotless and for the most part faultless - (okay the shower curtain fell off big deal - we fixed it).    The food was great too nice variety of international foods mixed with their traditional offers of lamb tajin and other goodies to sample. Wine was free (all inclusive) and came by the bottle (including stand-alone ice bucket!). The beers spirits and cocktails were fine - as younger guys from England we felt it our duty to introduce the bar staff to a few of our home offerings such as Jagerbombs and so on - they enjoyed watching and learning.  The pool bars are great - they have a large mix of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks/cocktails on offer. I got through all of them (alcoholic) in about 2 hours and fell asleep under a palm tree in the shade!  Yes the staff can be pushy yes you may get hassled to buy this or try on some wares - this is their culture - embrace it!    Great place would happily visit again!!,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickTaylor333
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Phil45_11 wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Few basics spoilt otherwise good holiday,This hotel makes a genuine effort to enable visitors to have an enjoyable break. It caters for multiple nationalities however the entertainment leans towards the French who significantly numerically outnumber the Brits at the hotel.The room was cleanwell maintained and adequate although the balcony was always in the shade which was a shame.The food was freshalways sufficiently maintained and they did try to vary from day to day although the basis never changedthe only real issue was nothing is ever hot only tepid although their is a microwave. The staff are polite and friendly apart from the bar staff who seem to think serving people is outside there job description. The bars also ran out of lager on a number of occasions and vodka once which is not really good enough for a hotel this size. I do not really think they ran out rather that they try to work within a quota and would not restock once this was exceeded. It is also worth noting that the pool bar stops serving beer at 18.00 which was strange when they still served other alcoholic drinks until 18.30. The pools were always kept clean and tidy with no issue getting a sunbed however the deposit system for a towel was really unnecessary I do not believe people really would steal them especially as they were mostly faded and worn although clean.The transit to the city is regular and the driver was helpful and informative. Please be aware that they will charge a local city tax on check out which I had not been made aware off although should of read more reviews because many people mention on this site. When I protested I was shadowed by the security guard which was not necessary I was just trying to find out where the charge was listed and quantified which it was not. Luckily I still had some local currency so did not incur further exchange charges.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Canterbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phil45_11
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lisa F wrote a review Oct 2013,20,Not a great experience,We were a group of 4 women in our late 20's/early 30's who travelled to Kenzi Club Agdal Medina for our girly getaway in October 2013    Positives -    The animation staff were very friendly. Cheap getaway (£404 all inc 5 nights). No problem getting a sun bed each day. Good weather. Big bed and clean room    Negatives - Where do I start...    - Reception slow and ignorant staff  - Animation team. Although they were very friendly one in particular would often pester you to join in aqua aerobics or other games and would not take no for an answer  - Restaurant. Although there are theme nights it is very samey. As a strict vegetarian the pasta bar was a good option as I could see it being made up and knew exactly what was going into it but if you do have allergies or strict beliefs be sure to get them to change the pan they use as they won't do this automatically and were more than happy to cook my vegetarian meal in the pan that had meat stuck to the bottom left over from the previous meal. Moroccan and French guests seemed to take preference over us and we often struggled to get service for drinks in the restaurant. We were told by another group of girls who ate in the a la carte restaurant that they had found a maggot in their meal so we did not bother to eat there. Food is the main restaurant is a buffet so be prepared for all the kids coughing and sneezing over the food... this is not limited to kids though as I observed a staff member having a good cough over the desserts.  - Snacks. Snacks are served outside in the afternoon. If you have a wasp phobia stay away as the place was covered in wasps. I know they hotel cannot help that there are wasps in the area but they could do a much better job covering the food. You literally have to waft away dozens of wasps to take any of the food.  - Souks. Reception advised the best time to travel to the Souks was the evening. Firstly this is strange because the hotel shuttle bus only runs until 5.30 so you have to get a taxi. Knowing that we were a group of young women this was not the best advice and only upon returning from the market were we told that! No matter how appropriately you dress young western women will get unwanted attention that makes you feel very uncomfortable. I believe this is much worse in the evening and would recommend making your trip to the Souks in the daytime. Try not to withdraw cash in town. You will be told the markets are safe but we were followed after using the cash machine and the man only stopped following us when we walked towards a policeman.  - Ice. Do not have ice in your drinks this is made using tap water  - Stomach Bug. All of us had stomach bugs to some degree some much worse than others. We couldn't pin point one thing we had all eaten or drank. Strangely I ate the most salad but was definitely the one in the group that got away lightly.  - Nightclub. We only went once. DJ Sam is very friendly and is worth mentioning as one of the positive points but nightclub drinks are not included in the all inclusive price and will cost you approx 50 Dhiram (£4)  - Wifi. High speed??? This is not true. The internet was slow and would regularly drop. Not always available in your room as advertised. Good signal could usually be obtained in reception.  - Toilets. Toilets in the bar seemed to regularly have blown light bulbs found myself weeing in the pitch black (and then finding out that it had run out of toilet roll!) Best to hold it in until you get back to your room  - Cash Machine. This was out of order. Withdrawing cash in town is not advisable after our experience.  - Spa. Massage was nothing special I was not asked how I liked it. No head rest given (afterwards noticed there was one available but the staff were using this to sit on) I found myself with a sore and red chin afterwards from resting on it for so long.  - Gym. Not included in the all inclusive 100 Dihram (approx £8) per visit.  - Rooms. Towels will be taken from your room in the morning and not returned until the afternoon so bad luck if you come back for a shower in the afternoon. We hired a safe and we were spoken to like idiots because the code given by reception would not work. Eventually they agreed to send maintenance and said we did not have to stay in the room to wait for them. When we went back to the room maintenance had not been and were again spoken to like idiots for leaving the room when apparently we should have stayed. Maintenance eventually arrived and funnily the code I had did not work. I'm not such an idiot after all. Air conditioning smelt funny  - Check in. Check in is supposed to be at 2pm. But when we turned up at 2pm only one of our two rooms was ready and our room didn't yet have any towels or water.  - Golf buggies. Staff will regularly drive up and down the foot path in golf buggies ferrying guests bags etc... Don't expect them to say excuse me (in any language doesn't have to be English!). Or thank you after you have jumped out of the way to stop you being driven off the foot path.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Cambridge, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisau373

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,robberyj wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Very pleased - excellent value,We stayed here for only 3 nights but were very impressed.  A couple of website state this as a 5-star hotel - it is more 4-star but a very very good 4-star.  The grounds are beautifully done and rooms are very comfortable - a lovely bathroom suites and an excellent bed.  For All Inclusive the food was good - lots of choice and of good quality - even my very fussy veggie friend said it was good!  Beer wine Coke Zero (proper Coke!) and water are offered as you sit down and you are given a full bottle which is nice rather than usual all inclusive plastic beakers.  The poolbar is open all day - the cocktails are a bit sugary but fine!  Generally the staff are pleasant particularly helpful on the reception desk.  The entertainment staff are fun but the entertainment did burn out quite early in the evening - probably because we were a bit out of season and the hotel wasn't that busy.  But this meant the hotel pool areas were lovely and quiet - and it was still very hot. I'd recommend coming in early October!  There is a free shuttle bus to the centre which you need to book a place on in advance and the onsite Morrocan restaurant (£10 extra) is well worth visiting just for something a bit different to the buffet.  For the price we paid it was brilliant value and we would definitely come again - no need to pay for a more expensive hotel really as this did the job nicely.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,blueensign7 wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Well done Kenzi team,The staff manage to create a friendly atmosphere that all the guests join in with creating a very happy enviroment. The food was good for buffet style with plenty of choice and the wine and beer flows generously on the all inclusive package. There is lots of room around both pools and reserving sun loungers with towels is not allowed. The only criticism would be the volume of the music from the young animation team but this may be just down to my age.

I am an experienced traveller and must say this hotel deserves a 10/10. The attention to detail- even as far as fresh rose petals on our bed sheets daily; and the friendly and attentive staff especially the holiday reps who went out of their way to make it such a fun trip. One rep in particular Rabia Sebbane is an absolute star- he created such a fun atmosphere and made my mother who he called ""mama"" feel so welcome and encouraged her to have fun out of her comfort zone- dancing and taking part in daily activities by the pool. Rabia deserves a promotion he carries the team! The atmosphere at this resort was electric. So much entertainment- the fire show being my favourite. It was amazing how everyone from young to old stayed up for evening entertainment; no need to go out looking for entertainment as theres somuch in the hotel.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RachelAwad2013 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Don't believe the negative reviews!,Booked this for great price of £368 for 5 nights in October. Didn't expect much for the money and having read some reviews was expecting something mediocre but adequate as a base for my trip. How wrong I was! Resort was beautifully maintained clean and peaceful and tasteful. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Animation Team were amazing: worked tirelessly to put on entertainment day and night and multi skilled. If you didn't want to participate they left you alone but never failed to say hello and ask if you were ok when passing you. Relaxation pool was huge and really disabled friendly I have mobility issues and it was perfect for me. Moroccan restaurant was lovely and musician and waiter friendly and made a great atmosphere. Buffet restaurant was large clean and good mix of local and international dishes. Agree with comments that resort is very French orientated but that is Morocco! We shouldn't assume as Brits that the whole world should speak English to a high standard if you travel you should expect to try the language! In truth most staff could speak basic English and you can always get by with a smile and gestures! My only suggestions for improvement for this hotel are: stock the fridge with drinks and snacks (it is all inclusive after all and would make life easier) and make check-in a bit smoother. We were greeted by mint tea and cold towels on check-in but the process was a little confused with different people dealing with different parts of the process. Plus side was our room was ready on arrival and they moved room for me owing to my disability which was good. I usually stay in Riads so wasn't sure I would like this experience but it was great and I would definitely return and highly recommend.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jay K wrote a review Oct 2013,40,They Seem to Pay Attention to Reviews!,I just stayed in this hotel this month for three days. Previous reviews had complained about (1) lack of English and (2) same food everyday. The Kenzi Club seems to have paid attention. I found 90% of the staff I dealt with having at least a modicum of English-speaking capability. I did not have any problem getting help anywhere on the property.    Regarding food It is a buffet for three meals a day along with mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks (although I never found the mid-morning snack - it must be in a different location from the mid-afternoon snack). (1) they now have Spanish night Mexican night etc. Some things are always the same e.g. a pasta bar where they have two set sauces bolognaise and cream and you can add any vegetables they offer (about a dozen) to create your own sauce. They also had three set sauces/pasta combinations each night (already fully prepared pasta dishes). (2) full salad bar (3) three types of pizza each night; (4) probably 15 types of desserts (all miniature versions) - some are great and some just so-so; therefore take only one of each because they all look great; they also have 4 flavors of ice cream (gelato) (5) about 6-7 cold Moroccan salads - all very tasty; (6) two types of fish each night - although my girlfriend (Chinese) thought one of them was virtually tasteless (7) meat entrees were very limited e.g. first night we had steak and lamb and beef liver; the beef liver was fantastic because of all the Moroccan spices - it didn't taste like liver at all! Second night was steak and chicken; third night was turkey steak and something else I can't remember. Thus the meat dishes while okay are very limited each night. They expect you to fill up on other things which I didn't mind. The fresh fruit was limited; usually apples and one other thing at dinner; sometimes had honey dew and grapes. In all the food offerings/selections were HUGE! The only bad thing was that 50% of the desserts didn't taste like much.    You also have to be careful and watch the desserts even when you get your first plates of food - the tastier ones run out fast! Also anything made with pistachios was great whether mousse ice cream or in a tangine/salad.    The hotel is excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed everything. October is the best time to go: 80 degrees fahrenheit during the day (no humidity) and 70 degrees at night. You can sit outside on their huge patio to eat and we did - it was so nice. We shared a bottle of Moroccan wine (free) each night. They offer red white and rose. It was a lot better than many cabernet sauvignons I've had. You can buy higher priced imported wines if you wish.    They have an independent tour guide on the premises offering either dromedary (camel) or dune buggy treks. We chose the camel (dirhams 250 each) and had a huge amount of fun. They say the entire trip is 3 hours (including 1/2 hour travel back and forth each way). However we spent 2.5 hours (including about 20 minutes at a rest stop). Thus you are actually riding a camel for a full two hours!! They gave us Arab head scarves so we all looked like Lawrence of Arabia. If you go on this tour be sure to (1) go in the morning so (2) you can take a picture of your shadow on the sand.    The hotel minibus is free and runs almost constanty to the Medina (last trip is 6:30 pm) - it's only about a 7 minute ride - stopping only 10 feet from a KFC and across the street from the main plaza. Once you get off the bus many guides will try to get your business. One taxi driver offered to take us around the city for Dirhams 200 for 2 hours. I negotiated and got 3 hours for that price. Do not take the horse and carriages - they will be too slow if you are interested in actually going into any of the palaces/museums.    They have entertainment each night. We were there Friday - Sunday. Friday's entertainment was the best. I think most people check out by Sunday noon so the entertainment and food reflect that. In all I would definitely stay there again.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayK_13

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jennifer M wrote a review Oct 2013,50,Great Hotel,The hotel is lovely and excellently maintained by staff. The food was good better than other buffet style meals that I have had however there was not a lot of variety. Breakfast was particularly good in my opinion. There are two large pools which was perfect as we did not want to be sunbathing with a lot of kids so we lounged in the pool without the big slides. The service is good but the waiters required small tips to ensure that you were looked after promptly. Unfortunately I was mugged while walking 200km from the hotel (not a typical experience according to the hotel and the local police) but the hotel staff were incredibly compassionate and they accompanied me for 2 hours while making the necessary police reports. They helped in any way possible and checked on my every day for the remainder of my stay to ensure that I was okay. The nurse in the hotel was very useful for minor cuts and bumps that we got while using the slide or playing sport etc. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return myself.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Dublin, Ireland",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifermF6252TX
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,caramelmillie wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Unfortunately not the 5* advertised,I stayed here with my fiancé for a week at the end of September. Overall we had an ejoyable time thanks to the beautiful weather however the hotel certainly didnt live up to expectations. We arrived late on Sunday evening to be told to go straight to the restaurant for dinner as it was closing this was great as we were both starving after travelling all day!    The room itself was ok however it was begining to look a little dated marks on walls broken plug etc.They had provided a bottle of water in the room you can have as many bottles as you like from the bars so this is not an issue. The bed was uncomfortable absolutely rock solid and the pillows were also poor. The cleaners were friendly and attentive and i cannot complain about the cleanliness of the rooms however the towels were taken from our room in the morning and not replaced until late afternoon on some days which is rather annoying when you want a shower before going out.    The restaurant has a nice layout and the staff are generally attentive although they do favour the french guests...Breakfast is ok the fresh juices were lovely i must admit i mainly had the fresh pancakes! Lunch and Dinner; Wine is served by the bottle the rosé is definately favourable. We often took the bottles with there ice bucket to enjoy in our room our by the pool because at the bars it is only served by the glass?? The food itself is quite disappointing there is variety and you will get by for the week the best part for me was the pasta station particuarly at lunchtime when the chef is super friendly and speaks great english always a smile on his face! Everything else was lukewarm and by the time you got to eat it would be cold this to me was a big dissapointment as put me off my food it felt like alot of the time it had been sitting there a good while.  Breakfast 0630-1000  Lunch 1230-1500  Dinner 1930-2230    We spent most of our time next to the smaller pool near the pool bar. The pool is kept clean and your cups are collected often. Pool towels are available for a deposit and can be collected from the animation team station just make sure you get them in the morning or they run out. The staff at the pool bar again seemed to favour the french and i did feel ignored on more than one occasion whist waiting to be served. Yes there are bees that hang around the drinks machine but this cant be helped and i dont see how people can complain about it bees and wasps like sugar??    The entertainment wasnt really for us however alot of people seemed to enjoy it every evening. The fire show though is definately worth seeing if you get the chance. Each day there are lots of activities to take part in if you wish the staff are not to pushy which was great. In the evenings drinks are either served by the waitor who is very attentive or you can go into the bar. Each time i went to get a drink i was very disappointed the bar staff are very rude all much more interested in the football than bothering to serve drinks.    Like most of the reviews generally we didnt have a problem with the language most staff spoke enough english for us to get by easily enough. Manour and Spider from the animation team were both fantastic taking time to speak to us each day both very helpful! However we did have issues with the reception staff we asked if it was possible to keep our room on the last day for a few hours we were told this was not possible but they would hold our luggage and provide us with another room before our departure to shower and freshen up. We regretfully accepted only to go to reception on the last day to get a room key and the receptionist snigger whilst handing it over to be given back the same room! So off we went only to find the cleaner in the room floor wet changing the bedding etc she was equally as suprised as we were. She spoke no english and then was trying to phone reception rather puzzled.At this point we both gave up said to her to give us 5 minutes deciding to just get changed and get out of there.    Overall we enjoyed the holiday as much as we could the weather was beautiful and the medina is certainly worth a visit. You can book the hotel mini bus at reception they will do this for you on the same day if they have availability or you just book whatever day and time is best for you. If you need to get a taxi you can get one to or from the medina for 50 dirham. If i do ever return to Marrakech unfortunately i wont be staying at the kenzi club...    It is worth remembering that you will need to pay a room tax at the end of your stay for us i believe it was 16 dirham each per night.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Great Malvern, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caramelmillie
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Rocketqueen78 wrote a review Oct 2013,30,Delhi Belly,Myself and two friends stayed here in april. It was a really mixed experience some things were fantastic and others not so good.  The main downside was that all three of us became ill with Delhi Belly which really did spoil the holiday. We only ate in the restaurant the whole time we were there so it was definitely caused by the hotel food. I was extremely careful not to eat anything cold such as salad or fruit but still fell ill!  Onto the plus sides - the entertainment staff were absolutely amazing - so so friendly and genuine especially Aziz. We're not the type of girls to get involved in organised activities but their enthusiasm was infectious and we found ourselves doing everything from aquaaerobics to taking part in a tea ceremony. They were so good at getting people of all ages involved and they never stopped working even taking us to the nightclub at night (with no ulterior sleazy motives!).  The bar staff and restaurant staff were mostly lovely especially Rachid. The food in the Morrocan restaurant (you get one free meal here) was outstanding although we were so ill by that time that only one of us ate it.  The pools are great.  In contrast to the rest of the staff the reception staff were really unhelpful and standoffish. We had booked a triple room but when we arrived the third bed wasn't made up which was a real pain. We also struggled to get them to help us with anything e.g. the broken shower. They said they would call us back but didn't.  We went on a trip to the souks and squares which was very well organised and well worth it. Beware that you will only be taken to certain shops where you do feel quite pressurised to buy.  We went to the spa for our free Hammam - nothing to write home about you just sit in a few different steam rooms. I would pay for the scrub/massage next time although the spa staff weren't very friendly.  Would probably choose a different hotel if we were to go back.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rocketqueen78
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ABeelaerts wrote a review Oct 2013,40,Super,Home from a week at the Kenzi club Agdalnice large rooms cleaned every day. Food was very good and more than enough choice for everyone. Spendid pool but need some painting refreshment. But the animation team was JUST GREAT!they are very friendly and don't push you to participate all the time. They are just amazing they dance they make you laugh they make you feel at home in their city.Spider Jimmi Ratatouille and i can go on have their on style but wow! (all the staff by the way reception doorman restaurant security very helpfull and friendly) I saw a lot of negative comments on this tripadvisor concerning the reception to help English folks well I can say I was very surprised to hear all the time goodday goodmorning can I help you I even told them I spook French as I am from Belgium so even though it is normal they speak French they do try to help you in English. As for me I can recommend this hotel and I intend to go back next year.,Date of stay: October 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kraainem, Belgium",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ABeelaerts
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RoroP14 wrote a review Oct 2013,40,high end 3*/bottom end 4*,"Started off badly - we got there on a saturday evening after long day of travelling and were rushed to dinner as it was closing rather than given a room (which is fair enough) when we returned we were told there was a techinical fault with our room and we were shipped off to the sister hotel for one night which actually was 5*. Due to lack of communication between both hotels we were not allowed our all inclusive option at the new hotel. when we eventually solved this the bar etc was closed and we were offered no alternative. We wouldve preferred if they had sent us there straight away instead of wasting time with dinner etc.    We experienced a lot of frustration with the reception because it is very french orientated. eventually when we returned all we were offered was a comp massage on the spa which was not acceptable to us so pushed them for an upgrade which we eventually got. Nice junior suite. nice and big with lounge area his and hers sinks bath and shower and lovely balcony. Cleaned everyday with fresh towels. If you require an iron just phone and it will be sent to your room. So called wifi within the rooms was not great it would show as connected on your device but then not actually work. but when we sat on the balcony it suddenyl starts working    The food overall was very repetitive but cant expect much more from this kind of hotel. wasnt great the odd dish was nice. Worst case scenario the pasta station where you can choose your own ingredients.    Pool area was very good. There was the quiet pool if you just wanted to relax or the ""fun"" pool where there was always some kind of activity going on like belly dancing class water aerobics zumba etc. they had football matces volleyball darts etc. The entertainment team are by far the best part of the entire hotel...always willing to have a quick chat and let you know about any activities going on or about to start. very encouraging but not pushy if you dont feel like taking part. Between lunch and dinner the information booklet in the room states snacks are served at the hotel bar when in actually fact they are served just outside the dining hall.    Evening entertainment was also very good from dance acts to the amazing fire show around the pool. something different every night for everyone. We noticed they had the kids disco in the evening if you are travelling with the family this would be good for you. Being all inclusive was good because while watch the entertainment and shows the waiters were very pro-active in offering to refill your drinks. (we still dont know if we were tipping enough of too much)    There was a nightclub within the complex which was well publicised. We just heard about it from another couple at the bar. Spa was very nice - not too expensive. you do need to pre book though. Not sure i agree with their method of paying on check out and all they do is take your room number because then anyone can say any room number.    Lucky we had read about the tax per person per night before we arrived so we were prepared. Be prepared to pay around 25 dhirams pppn when you check out. if you have an evening flight i would recommend you go and settle up your bill the day before    overall i would most highly recommend this hotel.",Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoroP14
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,leannefinch88 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Best entertainment team I have ever had the pleasure of meeting,I have just got back from a weeks stay at this hotel and I want to be back there already. There were a few problems I could mention with the hotel such as the rooms were a little basic considering it was a 5* hotel and the special moroccan restaurant wasn't amazing.    The pool area was great the food in the main restaurant was good the sun was out constantly but what really made the holiday for me was the sheer friendliness of the staff and quality of the entertainment at night. Both myself and my mother have both said that the animation team at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina is absolutely second to none. They are all absolutely fantastic dancers with their own style.    I have never been anywhere where the entertainment and animation team were so lovely and friendly even if a little crazy.... (That's you spider....). They made me smile and laugh constantly and were always coming to chat to both my mother and me during the day. They made us feel welcome tout le temps. Every night I was made to dance and at first I was a little apprehensive but by the end of the week I was asking the DJ to dance for playing a special request. Thank you to all the animation team for making this one of the best holidays I have ever had.    If you want to go somewhere where your children will have fun where you can make friends with the staff and have some fun then this is definitely the place. There was never a dull moment and I will be back next year with friends for sure! A special thanks to Tito Spider Munir and Rabia. You made my holiday very very special.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leannefinch88
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Meg S wrote a review Sep 2013,30,3* at best,The rooms are nice enough a bit rough around the edges but I think that adds to the Moroccon style but be warned the beds are as hard as rocks and the food was enjoyable (apart from days when conferences were being held they would put no effort into the food for the regualar hotel guests and focus all their attention on the visiting corporates so food was cold bland and lacking!)  The resort has some really frustrating parts which meant that we had a very average week there! The reception staff are horrendous pay you no attention and just scowl at you when you try and politely ask a question - it was constantly like we were a burden to them! They lied to us about late check out - we were guarenteed this all week and i even requested this when i booked the hotel only to be told on our final day that it actually wasn't possible! For a '4*' hotel the service just wasn't acceptable the rudeness unwillingness to help and just general favouring of the French became extremely frustrating.  To call it an 'All Inclusive' resort is also a little far fectched when you have to pay £15/person to use the gym for 7 days (not a week!) and another £15/person to use the indoor pool for a week. You also had to pay roughly £10/person for the Moroccon restaurant which seems a bit extreme.  The shuttle bus to Marrakech was great but it was frustrating having to book the day before and having to choose drop off and pick up times in advance meant there was no flexibility in how long you were there for.  Another bad point for us was the sunbeds and how old and uncomfortable they were it made it really difficult for us to enjoy a relaxing day in the sun - these really need to be replaced with more comfortable ones!  Last but not least there was no water in the room there were flies/wasps everywhere - in the drinks/food and no effort was made to get rid of them and the pool has seen better days!  I would recommend this hotel for a weekend break to relax away from the madness of Marrakech however if you are looking as we were for a week long relaxing holiday in a 4* resort then this is not the place!,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/408megh
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,HoneyBunnyPB wrote a review Sep 2013,30,Rough around the edges,As a few of the recent reviews have hinted this hotel is not quite all that the previous reviews have it cracked up to be.    A lot of people mention the reception staff being unfriendly or unhelpful. When I booked the hotel I thought what does it matter you check in you check out what else is there? Little did I know that you need to involve the reception staff in just about anything else you do from renting towels to booking dinner at the Moroccan restaurant and of course anytime you need to complain or ask for anything.    Our room was in the same block of rooms as another recent reviewer - near where they were refurbishing a room. I am disheartened to hear that somebody complained about the construction before us as when we spoke to reception staff they claimed to have no idea it was going on. When we arrived at 2pm we had been awake since 4am and desperately wanted a nap but this was not possible due to the construction. We complained at reception nothing happened. At 8:00pm when we were absolutely exhausted and they were still banging away we called reception. They said they would call us back in 5 minutes. 30 minutes later no call. We called again and they said they would send somebody down. They never did. The next day we had to go to reception for the fourth time and speak to a manager who also said he didn't know it was happening. They finally moved our room which was better but an inconvenience overall and a waste of several hours trying to deal with reception nevertheless.    The hotel misses out on basic comforts like bathrobes slippers and our room even went several hours everyday where we didn't have bath towels. The room isn't stocked with water there is no alarm clock the wifi does not work etc.    In terms of facilities they claim to have bar snacks throughout the day but this is not the case it is drinks only at the pool bar and be prepared to wait to get your drink. The pool bar is the only bar open during the day and at night the other bar is only open from 6pm - 11pm. This was fine once you work it out and can plan around it but it was a bit of a shock when we tried to request a drink after this time.    The food is fine - a good mix of all cuisines. It's nothing above and beyond but there was plenty of choice even for a vegetarian. Wine beer and spirits are fine as well. Clearly the cheap and local option but this is to be expected from all inclusive. They don't want you taking bottles of wine back to your room so we had to go through quite the sneaky operation to enjoy wine on our balcony!    The room itself was kept clean and the grounds and hotel in general are well looked after. The animation team are incredible. The entertainment is in French but you can tell they are very dedicated to their job and the hotel.    All in all the hotel is nice but just missing a few basic comforts you would expect from a 4 star hotel. If you don't have to deal with the reception staff very often you will be fine but should you have even a minor problem which needs addressing be prepared to watch your anxiety levels rise on what is supposed to be a relaxing holiday!,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HoneyBunnyPB
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kiri_235 wrote a review Sep 2013,30,Things could be better,Just got back from this hotel where we stayed for three nights. Overall we had a nice time there but there was certainly areas that could have been improved on. Good points were that the hotel was generally well-kept we had a nice room not far from the pools and restaurant and we liked the pool area which at this time of year had a plentiful supply of sunbeds and 'sunbed huts'. We thought that the food was generally fine - what we expected for price paid. Some days we enjoyed the food more than others (some days the meat dishes offered were not great) - but you could always find something and there was a good pasta station where you can get pasta made however you want it. We had a complaint about noise as the room two doors down from us was being refurbished and banging started at 8.30am - but this was dealt with well we were offered to move rooms which we didn't want and instead requested they started at 9.30am which they then did.    Things that we were less good...staff in general were unfriendly particularly the reception staff. They kind of gave the impression you were an inconvenience to them - and I think this was particularly towards the English guests (rather than French). The reception staff did not acknowledge you - you would have to go up and start speaking to them before they would even look up to help you. In the restaurant staff were hit and miss- one night we asked for wine and it was brought over opened in front of us and put in a cooler. The next night we asked for wine and a warm bottle which was half used was plonked on the table.    There is not enough selection in terms of places to eat and drink. You can only eat in the main restaurant (unless you pay 10 euros to eat in the other one) at the times it is open. It said snacks were available at the pool bar but they were not. During the day you can only get drinks from the pool bar. The other bar (night one) is open to go in and watch football during the day but they won't serve any drinks until 6pm. The night bar is then open until around 11pm. The bar itself is awful (like a village hall) so no-one sat in it - everyone just sat outside around the entertainment stage. The entertainment wasn't really our thing but there was many people who did seem to really enjoy it. One night they ran out of beer completely - both on tap and in bottles.    A few of other things... You get asked to pay a deposit of 150d per pool towel so do not lose the towel! How they need over £10 to cover the cost of a towel I don't know. Also - the wifi is rubbish. You can sometimes get a bit of signal in the reception area but even then it barely worked. Finally there is a spa with a lovely indoor swimming pool but you have to pay 100d to go in and use the pool which we found unreasonable. When we booked we were told there was a free hamamam included but there was no mention of this when we got there and seeing as you can't get into the spa without paying I wonder if anyone actually gets this.,Date of stay: September 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kiri_235
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Johnharp53 wrote a review Sep 2013,10,Warning stay somewhere else,What can I say about this hotelI am struggling to find something good. I appreciate that I cannot compare a North Africa hotel with say Dubai but you do expect certain levels for a 4 star hotel. Here are a few things we found.  The rooms are very basic no slippersrobeswater the pillows we lumpy and old.  The towels we thin and very worn.  The hotel turn off the air con if THEY feel the rooms are cool this is purely to save money.  My sink plug was stuck closed the staff forced it open and that's where it stayed for the length on our stay.  The sink tap wobbled about two inches.  Some staff were helpful but the door and reception staff viewed you as a thing to be exploited. For example we asked the lady at reception to book a restaurantshe i think pretended to make the callor just didn't get through but then told us the restaurant was fully booked as a tour party where there but of course could recommend another place to eat. The restaurant in question was small we phoned direct and of course booked a table.  The wifi is not really there so don't bother taking an iPad etc.  If you want to sun bathe that's fine but be prepared to go through the following process of going to reception paying a 150d deposit per towel getting a voucher then handing this in at the pool for one thin worn out towel. Guard this towel or lose your deposit.  The food is the same every day as the hotel is cost cutting the wine and beer are about as cheap as you can getalthough if you are happy to drink it then there's no real restriction.  When you check out the hotel will hit you for some tax bill about 30d per day per person who knows if this is correct.  Every night there is an outside stage with some sort of entertainmentone night a guest decided to get on stage and start a fight for some reason.  And be prepared for a an argument with the doorman who doesn't want you to leave the front door without giving him a ticket? And also try's to grab your bag so he can justify a tip by dragging it to the most welcome site of the day the taxi back to the airport!  I cannot understand why there are some many good reports about this hotel if you read the guest book at reception a lot of what I have said is repeated in there but of course if you do it's to late for you.  Like I said I'm still struggling to find something good to say!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Deb123072 wrote a review Sep 2013,50,Relaxing stay after mountain visit,We booked via hotels website and got a good price at the time but noticed that prices had tripled by time of travel.  We found the lady receptionist a bit rude as she had conversations with other staff and answered the phone whilst checking us in.  We used the free shuttle bus to the souks but it failed to pick us up at the arranged time so we had to pay for a taxi.  Other than those 2 points the hotel and grounds are beautiful. The staff were so friendly always stopping for a chat ( we arn't ones for joining in much and after the first few attempts they didn't hassle us) Not much English spoken whilst watching Evening entertainment so if this bothers you then go to a hotel which is used by Thompson or an English company.  Food is good plenty of choice and even the most fussy eater would get by - pizza station pasta station (design your own pasta so only has your chosen ingredients) lovely salads fresh bread fresh fruit. Snacks available cakes crepes etc..

The staff are friendly and always took the time to smile or say hello. Most people there spoke french or Arabic with a few that spoke english very well. There was a slight issue with the room we were given being too small but that was sorted straight away for us. Rooms were cleaned daily and fresh towels too.  The restaurant food was nice something for everyone and drinks are served by the bottle The staff in the restaurant did everything for us as soon as they seen us walk in the door. As we were there for 4 days we made the most of visiting places.. We had a camel ride visited Atlas mountains which was a beautiful experience the traditional Berber house Argan oil factory and the Market . All i can say is if you visit the market Haggle Haggle Haggle.. you will get what you want!!! : ) We also visited the Monte Crital Sky bar that was fab too.    The Hotel has so many things to take part in during the day if that is something that interests you. We also did abit of Zumba i must admit that was fun!    If your just there to relax the sun loungers and four poster sun beds are perfectly situated near the pools and pool bar.    I would like to say a big thank you to Mohamed on reception ( Mr upside down badge haha our little joke) he was fantastic with us very friendly and always happy to help.    All the animation team are funny and very friendly especially MIdo Azziz Dj Sammy and Jimmy Thanks for keeping us entertained.    We would definitely recommend and will be going back real soon.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,pinkbristow wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Great hotel,Went here at the beginning of august on a great deal for all inclusive compared to many of the other choices around.    We booked the resort hoppa bus online before going to pick us up from the airport and the trip took about 15 mins to get to the hotel. As soon as we got there the porters were there taking our luggage for us.    While we checked in we were given a drink and wet towel. Reception staff were great especially with the kids. We got taken to our rooms in the golf buggy and the rooms themselves were clean and well stocked. We had clean towels every day and the kids loved the fact that the bed cover 'arrangements' were different each day. Beds were comfy and the air conditioning meant we could sleep at night without worrying about the heat.    The food in the restaurant was plentiful and tasty although if you got there at peak times there was sometimes a queue for the grill items.    The pools kept the kids amused for days and they loved the slides. Getting the best sunbeds meant going down and just dropping your stuff of before heading over for breakfast but throughout the day i could see spare beds and the staff were more than happy to help move spare beds and parasols for you.    Think what makes this hotel though is the entertainment staff. As so many people have already said they are great happy to chat to you and made everyone feel welcome. Although French is the main language here their english was fine. They are all hard working there from early morning until the end of the entertainment at 11pm. There's plenty of activities to do through out the day - aqua aerobics zumba belly dancing salsa water volleyball plus various races and competitions in the water that the kids love. There also boxing archery table tennis which they will walk round asking if you want to take part but aren't pushy at all.    There was always some sort of entertainment show each night along a theme usually running from 9pm - 11pm.  Yes they were sometimes slightly cheesy but it was to the right level!  There were always people up and joining in dancing along with the entertainment staff    Only minus points - had to pay for use of the safe and in the evening the queues in the bar were sometimes a little long    Would definitely recommend the hotel and would go back again,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pinkbristow

Parking: How the hell you can have a non-secure parking in an all-in club ?  Restaurant: If you don't arrive at the service start you will have to wait for waiters to prepare a seat for you and staff is poor !  Food: It's almost the same it seems that they are trying to fill the space reserved for food and they present the same meal with two or three different ways but it's really the same. Even in the thematic dinners there isn't any really original meal! Most meals aren't renewed at the half of the service and at this time you'll even have to wait for plates to be washed then brought back but you'll notice that they're still dirty! And above all taste is insipid!  Bar: Only one lounge bar from 18:00 ? What ?! Yes trust me I had to wait on the queue for 20 min for a cup of water !  Other:Wifi was not available on rooms for all the Week-end! Cellular network is almost inexistant in rooms !!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Minimesky wrote a review Aug 2013,50,An amazing hotel!!,After reading the previous reviews on tripadvisor we were apprehensive of staying at this hotel. We stayed here for three nights on the second week of April and the weather was amazing reaching up to 32 degrees plus.  Reception lobby- this was a lovely place to relax with the most beautiful mint tea I've ever tasted in Morocco. As for the reception staff they were polite and welcoming.    Rooms- we're large and very clean and had a balcony too. House keeping staff did not understand English and there were a few times where miscommunications occurred and instead of extra towels we got extra toilet paper! Speaking French would definitely be an advantage.    Food- We are vegetarians so food can be a bit boring and same in all inclusive hotels however we did think that the food choice was extensive and freshly prepared too. Desserts were delicious but you would need to eat early to get a wide choice as the best desserts did almost always run out and were not always replaced either.    Animation team- they did a fantastic job! The enertainment was mostly in French with a little translation in English. Aziz and his team were very friendly and made us feel very welcome as the hotel has many French speaking guests!    Try to get sunbeds as early as 7.30/8am as the good ones always get taken. Get your towels and place your Sun hat on the bed before going to breakfast. We did this almost everyday that we stayed and we got the beds which were so nice to relax in and cool down after being in the sun.    Our flight was late in the evening and we had to check out by 12pm but we were allowed to use the facilities and restaurants until we needed to leave to go to the airport.    Overall this hotel is beautiful and a lovely place to stay away from the centre Marrakech.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,AJ G wrote a review Aug 2013,40,Had an amazing time!,Have been back in the UK for 24 hours and am already longing to be back in Morocco and indeed the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina.    Prepare for my long (but hopefully comprehensive) review.    Having stayed in numerous hotels around the world this has got to be one of the best by far. Don’t get me wrong it does have a few minor (and I mean minor) issues but as a patient couple these did not bother us as much as some things seemed to have bothered previous reviewers!!    Oh two top tips before I review the hotel:    1 – don’t exchange your money in the UK. It cost us £98 for 1000dhms (10.20dhms to the £). As soon as you collect your baggage at Marrakech airport and before leaving the arrivals hall there is an exchange bureau where we got 12.6dhms to the £) – almost a £20 difference and it was so quick and simple    2 – if you are staying in Marrakech for a while and would like to book trips in advance we can recommend www.marrakech-trips.com. Please see separate review on this.    Right so let’s begin:    Reception  We were welcomed at the door by the porter who took our bags and immediately sat us down and offered us a cool mint and lemon tea and a cold towel – very welcome after the introduction to the Marrakech heat.    I cannot understand previous reviewers comments about the reception staff. They were nothing but friendly and polite throughout our stay and answered our numerous questions in ENGLISH without a hint of rudeness. In fact there were other staff who could take a leaf out of the reception staff books (but I’ll come to that later)!    Indeed the reception team wouldn’t even let us stand at the desk to check in they insisted that we sat down and relaxed and bought all paperwork wristband etc to us.    The only downside to check in/the room is that you have to pay a daily rate for the safe 30dhms a day which in many hotels is returned to you on departure. Not a mass amount of money but something to be aware of. Just like the visitor tax – you will get this on your bill when you check out – ours was somewhere in the region of 200dhms (£15) for the two of us for a week.    Oh you also get your tokens to exchange with the animation team for towels to use around the pool.    Room and Grounds  Our rooms was perfect for our needs. It was (as booked and as described) a standard double/twin room. We were on the ground floor had two large single beds pushed together a third smaller bed one large bathroom (shower bath bidet toilet) TV (only one BBC channel but who goes on holiday to watch tele??) large wardrobe dressing table and a terrace. Rooms are cleaned daily (and cleaned properly not like some hotels).    The grounds of the hotel are immaculate and so well kept. The maids sweep your terrace early every morning and the gardeners are out early pruning cutting etc    Pools  There are two main pools at the hotel – one what I would describe as ‘fun’ pool where there are 3 water slides most of the kids/families and where the animation team are based. The other pool (which we elected for) was a bit quieter and closer to the bar!!    Both pools served a purpose and were subject to personal choice.    Pool Bar  Well stocked with drinks decent staff quick service. Don’t be put off by the flies. They congregated round the fizzy drink machine. Staff were very good to make sure that they didn’t get flies in drinks and guest seemed to ignore the fact that they were there.    Restaurants  Atlas Restaurant (buffet dining) – this was above standard for all-inclusive there was a massive choice at all meal times and there was never a shortage of food no matter what time you went to eat. Even the fussiest eater would survive here! This is possibly one of the areas that needs tightening up staff wise though. At times (particularly lunch times) the staff were run off their feet and it was often difficult to find a table that was set or a waiter to clear one for you. As I mentioned at the top of this review a minor issue but a less patient guest may get annoyed!    Oh on the plus side water wine and some soft drinks served by the bottle and noone grumbles if you take them out with you!    Moroccan restaurant (bookable – at a cost of 100dhms per person – approx. £8) – we had a lovely meal in this restaurant. There were only 4 other people dinning on the same night as us and it felt very intimate and special. The food was great and was different to what we had had in the buffet restaurant. Worth a visit especially if you are celebrating a special occasion.    Animation team  Think many reviewers have said this before but these guys and girls definitely work the hardest at the hotel they are always around to greet you with a smile or a kind word they don’t bug you to take part in anything and they work late – they put on a show nearly every night and if they aren’t in it they still stay to support.    We were lucky to be there on the week that they did the fire show (they only do this every other week) which was one of the best shows of its sort that I have ever seen.    Evening bar  This was the only area that I felt let the hotel down. There seemed to be a number of staff behind the bar in an evening but only two serving producing long queues. The staff also didn’t seem too happy. Again only a minor issue but it did get a little frustrating having to wait a while for drinks especially when it meant missing out on the entertainment.    We had a fabulous stay at the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina and I could probably write so much more but I will let you discover that for yourselves!!,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Derby, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/235ajg
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kayfrey wrote a review Aug 2013,30,Good value hotel,For the money you pay this is great value.    Room - clean good size and cleaned daily very well. The air con for us did not work on the last night and if you go in summer this is a must!    Food - repetitive (pizza pasta salad and chips). Great if you are veggie. Tagines would be around one meat and one veggie. There were long queues for food and things often ran out without being replaced. However having said that there was always something I could find to eat as an alternative. Snacks provided are mainly pastries although one day they bought out sliced watermelon which is great for a scorching hot day!    Pools - very good my little one enjoyed the 3 slides very much.    Entertainment - didn't watch night entertainment but there is always something going on in the day which is good. (Aqua aerobics dance Zumba cooking lesson / demos)    Reception - We didn't find the language too much of an issue as reception and door men were fine and helpful. There is a taxi stand to the right of reception but be warned. We asked to be taken to the souk and he dropped us off first at his mates pharmacy for them to try and sell us argan oil (I just listened politely to the speech) and then when we got back into the taxi he dropped us off to a fixed price souk (like a department store) which was nice enough but it was 10 mins walk to the souk in 40c with my four year old in tow. I just wanted to go to the main souks!MThis is how it is!    When you walk to the souks as well then you get annoying people trying to attach themselves to you and 'guiding' you for money you are better off with the tour guides.    The hotel offers shuttle buses to places but you need to book the day before as the popular times slots get taken and this of course saves you the taxi fee. Even when booking through the hotel they will try and get you to join their tour guide as well.    The hotel could do with a few more covered areas to sit in but everyone here is the for the sun and the pool!    This is not a 5 star hotel if you have been to places like the Thomsons Sensatori brand but it doesn't cost as much as a sensatori holiday.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,uk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayfrey
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Seb1009 wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Heaven,We came to this hotel for 4 nights and when we got in we were asked to wait so the friendly staff greeted us with some drinks and they have luxury rooms with no noisy indoor corridors. The room service was unsurprisingly amazing and the housekeepers were very skilled and made them into beautiful scenes. We stayed all inclusive and the food was amazing. We had all sorts of entertainment like water slides and a kids' club and there was a slide pool a fun pool and a heated pool! There was lovely scenery at night and a lovely relaxing noise from the cicadas. It was very easy to get to sleep. Breakfast lunch and dinner had the biggest selection I had ever seen and it tasted good.    I would come here again and I would recommend this hotel to anybody and young children would love it too!,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Plymouth, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seb1009
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,NickJs76 wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Would go again,We only stayed a short while in the resort following 7 days of adventure in the Mountains and Desert. We were greeted with a beautiful glass of mint and lemon tea which was refreshing. The hotel reception staff were some of the best I've ever come across in particular the female reception staff member who sorted out a room almost two hours early and gave us a late check out on the final day - gratis. The accommodation and facilities were great. We sampled our fair share of cocktails which proved to be very strong and did put us to sleep in the afternoon sun without too much encouragement! We enjoyed the food the sun and cannot fault our time at the hotel. We arrived by the pool at about 9am and there were heaps of sun beds still available.    The taxi to the hotel is 100 Dirhams but we shared a taxi with another couple and paid 150 Dirhams due to the extra luggage. The taxi's are outside the front reception so no need to book.,Date of stay: August 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Adelaide, Australia",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickJs76
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Anita1962 wrote a review Aug 2013,40,Great All inclusive,Perfect place to go with young children or as in our case golfers who were there only to eat and sleep! All round great service from reception to Concierge to chamber maids to all the servers and chefs in the buffet restaurant. Service was always with a smile and happy to solve any problems arising ! Just one thing was not enough towels for golfers in 45 degree weather and needed to shower in between the 36 holes! It took forever to get towels everyday! Also no direct dial outside - have to go through reception and when reception was busy not to happy about making the phone calls! Outstanding service from Abu at reception! Spa was great but the massage I would not recommend! An energising massage turned out to be a soft relaxing one despite asking the therapist to apply more pressure.

Lots of activities to do on site the entertainment team was great. This is a french speaking hotel and knowing a bit of French would be useful. All of the entertainment team spoke both English and French. However reception staff only appeared to speak french. The food was lovely lots to choose from there was also a fresh option.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Carole H wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Short weekend break,We arrived to a good reception and was quickly taken by a golf buggy to our room. It was lovely and spacious had a massive bed 2 bathrooms and a large terrace. Very clean and tidy and probably 5 star by Moroccan standards but not the same as 5 star in other countries but perfectly suitable. The maid cleaned our room every day made our beds and we had clean towels daily too.The food was lovely plenty of choice and wine was served by the bottle. Occasionally it could have been hotter but there was a microwave if you wanted to heat it up. Lovely seating area both inside and out and waiters were always polite and found us a nice table. The pools and pool areas were kept imaculate didn't really have a real issue getting a bed because they brought one out for you if there wasn't enough. The pool bar was adequate they did run out of some drinks from time to time but not a major issue. The majority of staff were extremely polite but there was the odd one that wasn't perhaps getting job satisfaction...............The entertainments team were absolutely fabulous always came round and spoke to all the guests. You could get involved in as little or much as you wanted to and there was no pressure if you just wanted to watch and chill.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tulsi P wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Amazing holiday-best time ever,We went to this hotel for 2 weeks from 22nd june to 6th July 2013.    On arrival we were greeted by a porter who took our bags to our rooms.we were shown around the hotel by a buggy which we loved.    We had no problems with rooms at all they were cleaned very well and the maids made decorations out of towels on our bed which was really nice    The entertainers were excellent. Especially Mouss for golf I never played before but he was really nice and friendly. yousif used to do cooking lessons everyday my the bar at the poolside which was really fun he was a real gentlemen.    During the day the other entertainers would provide various activites including archery poker volley ball aqua fit football French balls rumba etc. Our days were always filled up and time flew by very quickly. Our favourite entertainer was Jimi who would always say hello to my family and involve us in all activites.    Food was okay towards the end it was getting repetitive but we had no complaints. Vegetarian food was okay aswell lots of ravines and fresh pasta bar.    The hotel provides a shuttle bus to the town which is hood. Taxis are provided outside the hotel but make sure you negotiate rates.    We used a tour agency outside the hotel for our excursion. We did atlas mountains Berber village waterfalls camel riding.    All in all we had a really fantasic time and would recommend to others!,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tulsip_13
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mini10 wrote a review Jul 2013,30,Ok,I stayed on business for a few days so unfortunately didn't get to experience all the leisure facilities and the sun!    The conference room and facilities were great and the breakout rooms really good and spacious too.    The rooms were also very clean and the staff made different shapes of all the towels and sheets everyday which was unique!    Unfortunately the food lets the hotel down although it looks like there is a huge buffet in fact a lot is repetitive and not much is cooked fresh apart from the pasta which I had most days.    Sadly I was very ill on returning home despite drinking only bottled water and washing and cleaning my teeth with bottled water. I can only think as the hotel is all inclusive that perhaps it was the wine and it may be watered down slightly.    I would return to Marrakech but not at this hotel.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,Kent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mini10
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SimSim L wrote a review Jul 2013,40,Good hotel - staff not as much...!,"Only just got back after 7 day stay at this hotel. And unfortunately we've had trouble with the reception staff from the beginning please be prepared if you do not speak a word of French you'll not be treated well the staff were really unhelpful and rude! As soon as they realise you don't speak a word of French they attitude changed instantly ! We checked in at about 9pm and found that we were allocated a wheelchair access room - not that there is any problem with that - but had no bath-only a wet room and 2 single beds (was visiting with my boyfriend) which I did not like so went and explained that I'd like to change the room  after a rude ""WHY"" was told I have to wait until the next day to see if they have another room to move us to. Which happened - got a proper bathroom  but still was left with 2 single beds. No kettle in room either - which I was really missing. Apart from that rooms were clean and tidy and spacious.    Food was ok very 'French' orientated various pastries and breads for breakfast pizza and pasta as standard for lunch and dinners and all the rest depended on what theme was on ... Overall OK always something to nibble on and never left the dining room hungry.  Tried the orangina restaurant be aware you have to pay to eat there- really silly and really not worth it to be honest! All that was served there was available in the canteen anyway so I don't see any reason why should anyone pay 100dih per person to eat there- you need to book this at the reception and when we did there was no mentioning of paying extra only found out when we were leaving the restaurant (it's added to your room bill) ...!    Bus to the medina is for free and you need to book it a day in advance this was good !    You will have to pay to use the gym too - my partner and his friend paid 200dih per person to use it for 5 days again this should be included in the all inclusive in my opinion...    Poolside was lovely with plenty of sunbeds. Entertainment staff were lovely - unlike the reception staff - a lot of different activities were on throughout the day however if you wanted to play anything after 17:30 - NO CHANCE - which I thought was a bit odd and disappointing !    Bar staff were ok always smiling and chatty but very careful with the drinks we were a party of 4 and rarely would they serve us more than 4 drinks at the time  in fact most of the time they refused - all inclusive I think I could have as many drinks as I want but hey! They also stop serving at 23:30    Overall  it's a good hotel and we got it at a good price so can't really complain! Only thing I would change is the staff attitude and the needless charges for stuff that should be included in the price apart from that I give it 3.5 but I don't think I'd be returning here in the future.",Date of stay: July 2013,,"Oxford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimSimL_12
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,rishigudka wrote a review Jul 2013,50,One of the best all inclusive hotels I have been to!,The hotel is around 10mins from the airport so best to take a taxi rather than organising per booked transfers. We paid 150 dirhams but if you are good at bargaining you could get it for around 100 I guess.    The hotel is very clean and the reception is well laid out. Check in was good. We were at the hotel around 2pm and as we wanted 2 rooms next to each other on the upper floor we were asked to first go for lunch and then come back. The dining room was huge and had plenty of tables and waiters. We were quickly received by a waiter who realised we were new and showed us to a table and asked for what we wanted to drink. We ordered beers a coke and water and were surprised to find that all drinks were served in bottles which was a first for me for an all inclusive hotel. The food was excellent with a pizza station a pasta station a salad station a taking station and plenty of desserts ice creams and other foods. A brilliant choice for someone who is vegetarian. In fact 70% of food was veg which was great for us.    The hotel has 4 pools- 2 large pools (one of which had slides) one baby pool and one pool located in the spa. Plenty of sun loungers and cabanas laid around the pool and the immaculately kept gardens.    After lunch we went to get our room keys and although one was ready and one was not we were asked to keep all the luggage in the room which was ready until the other room was ready. We were taken our rooms in a golf car and luckily our room was quite central to the pool restaurant and reception so were quite pleased. The rooms are huge with all the amenities you would need except for a kettle which would have been nice. The bathroom is nice with a shower over the bath.    The evening meals were good as well with a different theme every night eg. Spanish night Moroccan night seafood night etc. The evening entertainment was also very good with different shows every night. My best was the fire show across the pool. One of the best shows I have ever seen. On other nights there was world dances snake charmers etc.    The hotel offers free shuttle to the central square and souks however one needs to book the time slot a day in advance. Also there is a tour desk where you can book tours with Karima who is helpful. We did 3 excursions and all were good and well arranged. Unfortunately our guide in our tour to Essoura was not very good and demanded a bigger tip at the end of the tour which wasn't very nice.    The slight negatives for me were the availability of pool towels from 9am to 2pm only. Hence on the day we checked in I had to go through a lot of hassle to get pool towels since we got to the pool area around 4pm. After that we ensured we got our towels early. However this policy needs to change or else towels should be provided at reception on day of check in if required and towel policy clearly explained to every guest checking in.    The other slight negative was that a lot of reception staff did't understand English and spoke mainly in French or Arabic. The waiters in the restaurant understood English well. Also the evening entertainment was mostly spoken in French with a few English words in between. Nice to see there were a few Bollywood dance numbers included in the shows. The singer was good too.    The drinks in the bars were pretty good with plenty of cocktails on offer. Loved the gin and tonics. White and Rose wine was good but red wine was not. Beer was very good too. Didn't try other spirits.    Most bookings come with one free Hammam session per person. Hammam is basically a steam room session. The staff at the spa were not very friendly and most couldn't speak much english either.    On the whole I would definitely give a big thumbs up to this hotel despite a few negatives. I would ideally rate this hotel as 4.5 stars and not 5 however as I can't choose the 4.5 star option I am giving it a 5.,Date of stay: July 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rishigudka

The hotel looks fabulous and has much to offer such as the indoor restaurant to dine the outdoor space to dine but I would not say that they have a variety of choice for vegetarian food. Bar lounge and also shows in the evenings that the animation team at the hotel put on which I must recommend highly in particular the Fire Show! This was amazing and me and my boyfriend enjoyed very much.    The hotel is located to the night life reasonably well so if you would like some evenings out in clubs Pasha is not far or club 555. We enjoyed the Night life as KISSFM events were taking place at the time. However on a normal night there seem to be more men then women in the clubs and felt slightly uncomfortable considering I was there with my boyfriend.    The spa is great do try the full body massage I actually fell asleep and heard my boyfriend snoring next to me. worth the money!    The square is not far and the hotel does provide a shuttle that you have to book to take you and bring you back but just be warned the staff in the hotel do not speak ENGLISH very well mainly French! or Arabic. so at times with reception staff we did struggle.  The Rooms were always clean however they do not always change towels due to trying to be environmentally friendly which we thought was a good idea.    We had great time overall and would go again the only thing we would make sure is that we learn some French!,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyandaP
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ali_Cat027 wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Highly recommended,Stayed at the hotel mid June for 10 days with mother (80) and ex-MIL (70). Nothing I can say about the hotel would aptly convey how wonderful the staff and the facilities are. Got there 4 hours before check in and was treated to hot mint tea in the cool spacious reception area. Lovely lovely Othaman took us to our rooms in our Riad via a handy golf-like cart. We often saw him about the place in it during our stay and often hitched lifts. We stayed in the furthest Riad but the walk through well kept gardens was a delight. Also a plus for us Brits – they had pet cats on site with their own kennel. Spent many a happy time watching the kittens play. Two main pools – the larger one I would say is the family one with the water slides and then the smaller one by the snack bar if you want a quieter time. All the staff extremely friendly with my mum often being hugged and kissed (on the cheek of course) by the managers and staff as well as the staff often fetching and carrying for them. I note in previous reviews that the reception staff came in for some criticism . I can understand it in a minor way. When booking in the fact that I had a 70 and 80 yr old with me didn’t stop them putting me in the furthest away Riad. It took Othaman to take them to one side and complain on our behalf. It was only once I found out what he was doing that I was able to put his mind at rest that we were fit old birds. My only complaint of the reception staff is that when dealing with one guest they should not allow themselves to be interrupted by other guests. When checking out there were 3 separate incidents where guests just butted in with their queries. It was only when I forcibly shooed a guest away that they got the message. Special mention to Othaman Khalid (Derary) in the dining room and to Karima on the tours desk. Both fantastic and couldn’t do enough for you. Karima made sure that on each trip that we took there was always an English speaking guide. If you do the free trip to the square/souks may I suggest you do the guided tour first? It’s only about £20 and the guide finds out what you are interested in and tailors the trip to suit. Our guide took us to a largish shop first then onto a shop that sold creams oils etc then onto the spice stalls plus the most amazing olive stalls. Also showed us how to barter (go half of the asking price then go up a bit) Then do the free trips – once you know where you are going. The trip to the Berber villages/Atlas Mountains was absolutely fantastic. We went into a villager’s home and had tea with him as well as visiting a pottery a village that housed a Holy Man a female co-operative producing Argan oil Couleurs Berbères plus wonderful views when in the mountains. A whole day for £55. Brilliant!! And the camel ride trip – what a hoot!! Again we had an English speaking guide (Mohmet) who was super.    Would have been nice to have coffee making facilities in the room tho.    5 Star hotel 5 Star holiday. Would recommend to anyone.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jaime R wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Best Holiday I have ever had in Marrakech,I stayed at the Kenzi Club Agdal for two weeks originally booked into the Eden Antalou but due to the big “Kiss” event we were pushed to the Kenzi. I am so glad. I cannot say enough great things about our stay here – it is a holiday in paradise that I will always remember. But here is the low down to help you:    Rooms – Good size very clean – great housekeeping Modern. The only bad thing is that you have to pay for the use of the safe maybe management could look into having this service for free.    Food – I never went hungry – considering I was there for 2 weeks I would have usually been bored of choices but there was always something that tickled my fancy they catered for every choice especially Lunch and Dinner.. There was always a choice of Moroccan pasta pizza grilled fish grilled meat salad bar deserts. It’s a wonder I didn’t come back much fatter. They have a pancake bar that opens at 4pm near the pool which was very lovely too! We sat in a regular spot for 2 weeks in the restaurant and therefore had the same staff that learned our names and drinks after a couple of days. Very polite and very professional.    Pools – choice of two pools one where the main activities take place and then another which was much quieter and a place to relax. Excellent choices of where to sit/lay down covered bed type sunbeds and standard - plenty to choose from! close to the pool OR further away if wished. Although my mother stayed in the relaxing pool I was often bouncing back and forth between the two which leads me to my next point:    Activities – there seriously couldn’t have been any more choice or variety! This made my day times so much fun that there was always something to do! The team were never pushy but they were so full of life and joy that you “wanted” to be a part of it. Volleyball basketball golf poker ping pong boxing (watch Mido he beat the cr*p out of me at boxing but excellent teacher and pushed me) archery water polo belly dancing shisha darts French boulles tennis water side dancing and fun cooking classes!    Animation Team – The best animation team I have ever come across. This hotel has got it right. The current team work so well with each other it’s like watching a family. They are very talented and very friendly and you just loved seeing them every day. The shows they put on every night were outstanding. Better than any I have ever seen in any other hotel. They ranged from the funny to the contemporary to just fun dancing. They really got you involved in the fun and games of the dancing and I have to say now I am back I truly miss this as part of my evening’s entertainment. Shows start around 10 but there is always something going on leading up to this.    Animation Team special Mentions – 1st on my list is the crazy yet professional and friendly Spider. That boy can seriously dance and entertain. He was great with ALL guests of all nationality and ages from the old to the children. He went out of his way to show me and my mum a good time and I was very impressed at just how far is talent extended. If Spider doesn’t get you up and dancing then no one can! If you are going out to Kenzi any time soon – look for him – he is the one with the crazy hair and the funny face lol Spider is also the best Archery teacher I have ever had – make it a point to do Archery with him. 2nd on My list is Aziz – a true professional – Aziz got you involved in sports you have always dreaded because you were scared the ball would hit you in the face (Volleyball). Aziz was so friendly and truly spent the time to make you feel part of the team. I have to Mention next the Choreographer of the shows – Yassir – He is a true gentleman and it’s no wonder he has been with the hotel for so long – what a professional. His talent dancing knows no bounds. Yassir greeted you with a hug and a smile every morning and every other guest I spoke to only had great remarks about this guy. DJ Sam was just such fun – great music and a really pleasant guy. Mia – what a sweetheart – amazing dancer lovely girl and a great dance teacher. I shall not continue going through ALL of the team – I would be here for days – they are simply all amazing and saying goodbye to them was the hardest part – they are what made my holiday a truly wonderful experience. I would like to see the hotel show more appreciation to them if I am honest these guys start at 9am and do not finish until nearly midnight with 3 hours rehearsals in-between they only get a couple of hours to themselves each day – they must be seriously commended for their abundance of energy and zest for life  they love their jobs and it shows. They will make your stay the best you have ever had.    Kids Club – WOW – I have never seen a kids club so organized and well looked after. If you are going as a family I would recommend your kids go to the mini club Omar and the team do such a fab job with them they always seem so well behaved and have such fun the hotel are doing something right with the current set up. On an extra plus side to the adults it means no screaming kids around the poolside – only us naughty adults splashing about!    Bar Staff - I found 99% of the bar staff to be absolutely amazing whether they spoke great English or not I made it my business to order using the little French I know and they were always so attentive and helpful. There was one bar man (not the main manager who did an amazing job with my mum when she got poorly) he was pretty rude to me and my mother whenever I asked for a bottle of water (I drink around 3 litres a day and he refused me a bottle and told me to use the machines around the pool which meant I would have to visit them like 20 times a day) in the end he started letting me have the water but always grumbled and towards the end didn’t even greet me with a hello when I came to the bar. However the rest of the staff were more than happy to help regardless of their boss’s attitude.    Reception – yes I realize there are a lot of people on here who say there isn’t much positive attitude at reception or the lack of English – I kept going to the younger guy whose English was great although I did struggle when the girl spoke to me she didn’t do a bad job by any means I think I could have used my French better!    Onsite Shop - My only bad point about the Kenzi is the shop onsite – an absolute rip off – way over priced – wanted to charge me £5 for a standard lipsol and they charged me 175 Dirhams for the most basic and useless lilo I have ever bought – BRING YOUR OWN! The older lady in the shop was rude and wasn’t much help when I had to take the 1st lilo back after it immediately started going down when I 1st purchased it. The younger lady in the shop was a great help!    If you are a smoker and run out and the shop is closed – Reception sell cigs all hours of day/night.    Gym – way over priced but because im an avid trainer I paid for it. Its 100 Dirhams PER session or 200 per week. ALSO the opening times are completely wack. 9am-7pm. In most hotels I have been to the gym opens at 6am so you can train before breakfast and before your day starts. Because the gym closes so early you have to cut your pool time down to 6pm just to squeeze the hour in. Management need to change this pronto to 6am-8pm.    I cannot say a big enough thank you to everyone at the Kenzi who made my stay so special. This was a birthday present from my mum and they made my birthday the best I have ever had. I was sung Happy Birthday about 10 times in all sorts of languages throughout the day and there was even a pool party and early Mojitos.    I would recommend this hotel for families friends and couples even if you were to go alone you would soon make friends. My advice – make sure you get involved in as much as possible – it transforms your holiday.    I shall return for my next birthday – I only hope it’s the same animation team as they work so well together – the hotel need to work to keep them and are VERY lucky they have them. I would very much like them to pass on this praise to their team because they deserve to know how happy they make peoples holidays.    If anyone has any questions please let me know I will be happy to help.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaimelouiser
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,fitrix wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Amazing pool,Loved this place from the minute we arrived. We booked it ages in advance and had forgotten it was all inclusive so that was a bonus. all the food was spot on apart from if you had the last bits in the tray of the buffet they were a bit cold but just wait until it fills up again. Huge selection of european and moroccan food. Drinks flowed easily even though the cocktails were made with squash instead of fruit juice but at this price who can complain. I loved the fact that adults went on the waterslide too that was the height of my enjoyment lol. The 4 poster sunbeds were brilliant too so comfortable and the curtains were necessary to block out some of the 40degree sun! All the entertainment crew were fantastic I loved their dancing and they all looked like they were enjoying themselves unlike some of the miserable staff you get in Europe. They had a cookery class too which was great (in French but easy enough to understand with school level french) and I made la pastille when I came home and it was perfect! Al the staff everywhere are polite helpful and happy. Can't fault the place.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hanifad wrote a review Jun 2013,50,An excellent relaxing break!,I came to here for a week in the middle of June with my family. We booked the deal last minute and actually based much of our decision on reviews that we saw on Tripadvisor. We chose the all inclusive option as we were looking for a week of complete relaxation - and that is exactly what we got. This hotel is perfectly designed for couples young people and families as there is something for everyone. This is possibly one of the best relaxation breaks that we have ever had as we didn't have to worry about anything.    I wasn't feeling very well when we first arrived at Marrakech airport so it was great that hotel was only a short distance away from the airport. All I wanted to do was sleep - I was sharing a room with my sister and the room was really spacious and my bed was really comfortable. It would be good if the hotel organised airport transfers as we had to do this separately.    The food was fantastic. There was a great variety which changed slightly everyday so there was something for everyone. There was also themed nights which we got to taste freshly prepared food from all over the world. The Moroccan night was my personal favourite.    During the day there was always something going on - I like the fact that there were two outdoor swimming pools - one was the quieter pool which is where we spent most of our time and the other was louder and this is where activities such as water polo aqua gym darts belly dancing and more were taking place. It was possible to therefore choose whether we wanted to relax or take part in the activities that were going on. In some hotels that I have previously stayed in - I have felt forced to take part in activities by the animation/entertainment team. Here it was not the case! - the entertainment team is the best that I have ever seen. There were attentive and always smiling.    Continuing with the entertainment team - I enjoyed getting involved with the darts lesson with Ayub poker with Mouss and cooking with Yousef! I learnt a lot in the cooking lessons and will be certainly trying out some of the things now that I am back home! I also didn't know how to play poker very well until I played with Mouss and got involved with his poker lesson. My game has certainly improved.    The entertainment during the day was on going and so there was no chance to get bored and it continued well into the night as well. At 7pm there was live singing which was lovely as well as music from DJ Sam too. The shows that were put on were just amazing - the dancing was incredible and the fire show that was put on one night was just WOW.    There is a nightclub in the hotel which is good if you don't want to go to bed at half 11! The music was great and it was possible to put in requests for the songs that you wanted to hear. There is no clubbing on a Sunday night though!    I used the hotel gym everyday - this was good in terms of the equipment available. They do need stronger air conditioning though because on the days when it was extremely hot - the gym did become a bit like a sauna. The cost of the gym is not part of the all inclusive deal. It is about £16 extra for the whole week.    The reception staff were not very helpful and they were not able to speak very good English - this could be improved and is the only complaint that I have about the hotel.    This hotel is somewhere that we will certainly come back to in the future when we are looking for a relaxing break in the sun.    Thanks for a great week!,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanifad
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sabina D wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Excellent Break,"My family and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. We loved just about everything including the choice of food the spacious bedrooms the fact that it is so near to the airport the swimming pools as well as the entertainment.    There is a massive selection of food - breakfast seemed to be the same but about 20% of the food changed each lunchtime and at night.    The hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport so is very conveniently located in terms of transfer times. The hotel doesn't currently arrange transfers but this could be something that might be useful for some travellers? We used Travel Republic but there are taxis which might be competitive in price for 3 people or less.    We were so impressed by the entertainment team! Throughout the day there were always things going on - golf poker aqua-aerobics archery boxing dancing darts arabic classes etc so there's not really anytime to get bored! We particularly enjoyed poker and golf with ""Mouss"" as well as the cooking lessons with Youssef.    You can see that the entertainment team put a lot of effort in to their shows which start at 10pm most evenings - we saw a couple of dance shows and an amazing fire show. The team seem to be very enthusiastic and try hard to get the audience involved which we appreciated.  Thank you to DJ Sam who played all the songs that we requested.    We spent a lot of time by the swimming pool and the facilities around the pools are excellent - toilets sunbeds drinks parasols and towels.    As other people have mentioned the reception staff some of the waiting staff and one of the bar men (in the evening bar) really could use some help at being more helpful/friendly. That's our only negative.    We would recommend this hotel without a doubt and we will most likely be back again in the future for another break.",Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SabinaD244

There was a mixture of young couples older couples familes and groups of friends. The staff are very friendly and there is always entertainment on; dance classes aqua aerobics tennis table tennis archery basketball pool games and evening shows.  The food is lovely! We ate at the buffet restaurant all the time and there was always plenty on offer. You're never hungry!! Very clean too.  The room are nice and modern. We had a normal Twin room to start then moved to a 4 Bed suite. If it's just 2 of you the twins/doubles are more than ideal. Plenty of room and nice clean ensuites. Every room has a balcony too.  The location is only 10mins from the airport and 5 mins from the main town.

Food was lovely different theme every night rooms were big and very clean. Gardens of the hotel are amazing and very well looked after. Animation team are fab! Getting everyone involved but not being pushy. Medo is crazy and can't talk like a Geordie at all. DJ Sam is fab played some great songs in the club and Omar is fab too!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sammiet73 wrote a review Jun 2013,50,Fantastic,My friend and I have just returned from a 4 night stay at Kenzi Club Agdal – and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Ok - so the reception staff are miserable; but that’s where any negative issues end! The food the room service the restaurant and the amazing animation team were brilliant. Now I am the first to admit my French is extremely limited (which is obviously the main language spoken here) – but I had fun trying and even a simple Bonjour was enough to receive a friendly smile from everyone around the hotel. Rooms were clean and spacious and shower was powerful – very important. The food was varied hot and plentiful at all times of the day and night. We were greeted by each evening by Rashid and nothing was too much trouble for him or his staff. Jimi and the entertainment team were full of energy and smiles; and although never pushy made everyone feel involved and part of the poolside games even if only watching. I have to also mention Spider who is as crazy as his hair! He continually bounced and danced everywhere he went. The evening show the guys put on were also impressive and professional – the big guy swinging from the curtain was incredible! Each show ended with a disco – my legs still hurt from all the dancing. Spa treatments were excellent and very good value. To summarise the staff and the hotel really are wonderful and everyone we spoke to was having a great time and could not fault the hotel either. Definitely recommend.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammiet73

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,EmmaColchester wrote a review Jun 2013,30,Very nice hotel – but a few niggly hassles,We stayed at the Kenzi Club Agdal after being transferred from the Kenzi Menara Palace as they didn’t have a record of our booking. Nice hotel but please please please tell the staff at reception to be a bit more cheerful and to look up from what they are doing when you are standing waiting for some help. You could stand there for 5 minutes and they will totally ignore you.    The waiting staff pool staff animation staff and cleaning ladies were totally different they couldn’t do enough for you and went out of their way to make your stay as pleasant as possible.    The rooms were nice and big the only drawback is that there is not a socket near the mirrors on the wardrobe so you have to use the hairdryer in the bathroom. Our keycards also stopped working 3 times during the 4 days we stayed there which meant a trip to reception to change them – we didn’t even receive an apology for this inconvenience.    Plus points the food was really good lots of choices everyday and in the evening the wine provided was of a good quality. Loved the large swimming pools and the pol    Would I recommend this hotel? Yes but give the reception staff some training on customer service.,Date of stay: June 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmaColchester

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SHAM5TA wrote a review Jun 2013,50,FANTASTIC,I initially booked aqua park hotel in Marrakech but due to refurbishing they booked me the KENZI which was more dear but I got it for the same price (£400) all inclusive including flights and transfer. The place is very welcoming clean bedrooms very spacious and large. Room service was great. The food was excellent nothing like Tunisia or turkey where the food was pretty much same thing everyday. The staff were very help full although the room staff don't speak English only French or Arabic. The only downside was we had to pay tax separately on the day we leave and there is a charge for using the safe in the rooms.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,tracy709 wrote a review May 2013,40,3 day break in Marrakech .,My boyfriend and i had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for a 3 day break from 26th May 13 til the 29th May 13. The moment we arrived we were greeted by friendly reception staff and offered the traditional mint tea drink and a cold flannel to freshen up with . We did have to wait for our room but did manage to get in it by 1pm  an hour earlier than we had expected anyway as check in was supposed to be 2pm. In the meantime our luggage was whisked away to a storage room but not before we retrieved our swim wear so we killed time with a drink by the pool and a swim . The pool is very impressive and the pool and surrounding areas are kept spotlessly clean . Once in our room we found it to be spacey and well equipped  the air con worked a treat . The beds were comfortable and the bathroom had a hairdryer that did the job . The food we thought was of good quality with a choice of a fish  meat  pasta and salad option every night so if like us you arent a fussy eater then it was never a struggle to find something to eat . The drinks were certainly fine too  beer  red wine rose wine and the cocktails all got a tasting from us  maybe a little too much at times ..lol .. The entertainers do their jobs well and never pushed you to join in if you didnt want to  but made you feel welcome if you did . The majority of guests at this hotel are French but if you make the effort a simple Bonjour makes a difference . So to sum up would i stay here again or recommend this hotel ...well the answer would have to be a big fat yes .,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Chessington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracy709

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sn0z wrote a review May 2013,40,Great hotel!,I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend in March 2012 as part of an all inclusive deal which was very reasonably priced. The food was good the buffet can get a little boring after a few days but there was a good enough variety really and for the price we paid we were happy. Can't comment on alcohol as we don't drink.    Staff- did not find them especially friendly but definitely were not rude either. No issues with our room at all it was spacious and well kept.    Unlike some of the other reviews we did not find security of personal belongings to be any issue. We left our laptop with the front desk and went on a Desert Trek for 3 days/2 nights. When we got back it was returned to us without any problem.    The only issue I would say is that this hotel is a little way out of town however there is a minibus that can take you to town at regular intervals during the day. The hotel grounds are beautiful and peaceful we did not find them noisy or full of children but then going in March is off-peak and it was during school time in UK. The pools were well maintained and very inviting.    If we went back to Marrakech we would probably stay in a Riad just for the experience since we stayed in a hotel before but since we had such a good deal we were very happy staying here and would definitely recommend the hotel to others.

Great access to excursions (thoroughly recommend the Souk tour) but be warned - although totally STUNNING the trip to the Atlas mountains takes nearly 4 hours to get there so prepare for a bit of a journey but was really worth it to see more of Morocco.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Manvir J wrote a review May 2013,50,One of our best holidays!,The Hotel...........  Kenzi Club Agdal is a huge complex and is very clean.  We never experienced any problems in regards to the food or the service. The hotel is a huge site and sometimes it can get busy during meal times but there is never a long wait. They have a good selection of cocktails in the bar during the evening and also serve coffee and Moroccan mint tea.    The Animation team................  This is the best animation team that I have ever seen. We had so much fun. Not having been involved by previous team in our other travels this team made sure we had a good holiday. They were truly genuine people. MIDO would make sure that you are always involved in activities if you wanted to join in. SPYDER was full of energy which rubbed off on us. JIMI was full of jokes and kept us laughing. AZIZ was always calm and had enough time to sit down and have a chat with us. The manager of the animation team is an amazing talent and well worth the money we paid for what we got to see with their shows. I would highly recommend this hotel because of this animation team. They even taught us how to salsa etc and we are still dancing now! ;-)    Thanks Kenzi for such a memorable holiday we are definitely coming back soon!

The reception staff were really friendly on arrival the hotel lobby looked amazing and the room was nice and clean. The best part of the holiday was the animation team; took time and effort to interact with everyone. Everyone knew our name!    The guys at the animation team Mido Spider and Yasser (notably) and the rest - made our holiday. Mido even stole my cap and fake raybans (actually I gave it to him before I left). Food was great plenty of variety shuttle service to the market was also great - learnt to haggle in the market amazing fun.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,blondie099 wrote a review May 2013,30,It's okay but it's not a 4 star,"I stayed at this hotel in May through Travel Zoo on a special deal for 4 nights for £400 which included hotel flights and transfers and a couple of other extras - for the money I paid it was totally worth it but if I paid the nightly rack rate of between £250-£350 per night just for the hotel I would not have been at all happy! Personally I wished I had spent more and stayed elsewhere. I loved Marrakesh it's a great place and don't get me wrong the hotel isn't bad it just isn't 4 star and a few things did let it down.    The hotel is only 3 years old so it's fairly new. The pools and pool bar area are very nice and very clean. Plenty of sunbeds. The gardens are well kept so overall the hotel has a nice look and feel.    The room - it was ok clean and there is wifi but - the tv are mostly french channels the patio doors didn't lock the pillows were lumpy it took 3 days for them to deliver bath robes there were no flannels they didn't replace the toilet roll the hairdryer wasn't very powerful and there was no electricity plugs near any mirror making it difficult to use your own hairdryer or other appliances there was a safety deposit box but you had to pay for it on check out which was a surprise as was the local tax - 235 dirams for 4 nights for both. The decor was ok apart from someone had clearly splashed a cup of coffee up the wall and no one had bothered to clean it.    All inclusive - I would say it's probably more full board with drinks thrown in. All food is served buffet style at set times in the same dining room which looks like a huge canteen although there is outside seating if you can get a table. The food is ""very average""  if you are a foodie then I would suggest you make arrangements to eat out. If you arrive a little later at any meal time you get what's left you wont starve but after 2 days of eating here we decided to eat either lunch/dinner out as the overall quality isnt that great - although the salads are good as is the pasta (freshly made) and tangines but alot of the hot food is cold by the time you've sat down. You can pay a supplement and eat in the Orangery personally I didn't think the food was particularly any better although the ambience is much nicer and you get waiter service.    Drinks - plentiful as in you can drink as much as you want but there isn't a huge variety and the quality of the alcohol isn't great for example if you have a particular type of vodka or gin you like then I suggest you buy it at duty free and bring it with you as there are no well known branded labels. The wine is just about drinkable but there's 3 choices red white and rose unless you eat in the Orangery Restaurant which you then pay extra for.    Service - it's ok the amination team are the most friendly and engaging as they should be i guess the reception staff can be a bit patchy depending on the person you speak to. The evening entertainment is a little cheesy and all in french but if you like that type of thing then you will probably enjoy it....    Towels - for a four star hotel you would expect clean towels you can collect from the pool area every day but you get given 1 towel each for your whole stay you are given a voucher on check in and then you have to collect it on your first day at the pool area but before 2pm as they close thereafter so arrive later - then no towel until the following day. When you check out you have to return your towels and they will give you a ticket which you have to give to the door man otherwise they wont let your suitcases leave the hotel !!!!! Never heard or seen anything like it !!!!    Cabs outside the hotel - agree the price before you get in it should be only 50 dirams to the Medina and then pay for a guide (25 dirams) separately to take you to your destination if in the souk as it's a maze and you can easily get lost.    I would say the hotel is great for families mainly.    Final tip - the hotel has ALOT of french clientele and the main language is French although some english is spoken.

Infact I am finding it difficult to come up with any negatives apart from maybe the service and prices in the spa are not so good although the spa itself is very attractive. We loved our stay and feel the hotel is great for both families and couples and indeed all ages. Furthermore it is only 10 minutes by courtesy shuttle every hour to the main square in Marrakesh.

On arrival was taken to room and it had not been cleaned after previous guest.  Cleaners came as did manager and apologised. After they left we had a shower and my partner tried to use the hair dryer but it would not work I picked it up and promtly got a very nasty shock!  turns out the conection form the lead the the hair dryer wires were bare..  Manager returned again and apologised again and moved us to a junior suite. Great room and couldnt fault it.  Over all for the hotel and rooms Nice location Very nice rooms and great pool areas and bar.  The food however war pretty much the same every evening. the staff however were very good in the restaurant.  The food area however was very unorganised.all food in random places and all repeated.  Hotel is very very popular with the French.  At the end when we went to leave the hotel tried to charge us again for our room. After 35 minutes of argument we were allowed to leave only catching our flight by minutes!!  Would i return No Would i reccomend Maybe... the hotel itself is very nice rooms are good but food is really poor and if you read good reviews of this hotel they will say the same.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,vickydd wrote a review May 2013,30,Nice Stay But not 4*,Had a nice few days at this hotel with my husband. Weather lovely and sunny for the time of year and hotel clean. Pool area very nice (although pool bar and patio being renovated during our stay so not very peaceful but hey guess they have to do it sometime). Staff ok and on the whole very friendly and helpful although somewhat disorganised in the restaurant. Coffee could never be served hot for some reason but Rose wine good and food freshly cooked and plentiful. Had a nice massage in the spa (extra charge). Our room was ok with a nice balcony on the ground floor near to both restaurant and pool area (although very cold at night). We are not a couple that need or require evening entertainment but on the couple of evenings we did spend in the hotel clubhouse we found the whole thing quite amusing as all quizes etc were in french (not a problem for us but some other guests found it very annoying not to be able to join in). We just thought it funny and nicknamed it Haven Marrakech ha ha. Overall had a nice relaxing stay but this hotel should be a 3* rating and not a 4*.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Beckenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vickydd
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,brightonbelle32 wrote a review May 2013,40,"""Very enjoyable stay""",My friend and I have just returned from a 4night stay with travel zoo.  Check in was easy and straight forward and we were able to get our room early.    I had already emailed ahead for a twin room in a quiet location and we had that ok.  Our room was clean and we had a little terrace at the front.  there is a hairdryer in the bathroom but did miss my powerfull one i had left at home.  There is a lack of powerpoints next to mirrors so my hair straightners didnt leave my suitcase!!  Our fridge was missing but we did get one after we asked twice.    The food is realy goodwith lots of choice. Especialy the evenings they had different things each night which you dont often find with all inclusive hotels.  Our last night they had the most huge fresh tuna which they griddled. Very impressive!  The service in the restaraunt can be a bit hit an miss but they were very busy. We noticed we were more looked after after they got to know our faces. I did tip most times but it didnt realy make much difference to us.    There is only one bar open during the day for all drinks which is the pool bar. We found the bar staff very good and service quick.  Entertainment at night is aimed at families and to be honest our latest night was 10.30pm so I dont know what its like later.    The entertainment staff (jimi etc) are very enthusiastic and friendly and do all kinds of sports and excercise during the day. but they arent pushy which is nice.    The swimming pools are great with lots of seating and towels provided!  The grounds and the kept so well and the design of the hotel great.    The only down sides were the suprise tax they add on at checkout.  They should inform you off this when you check in!!!  The hotel mainly has french guests and we had lots of children there.  But we didnt have any problems with this and it was actualy nice there wasnt many english there.  We very much enjoyed our stay and marrakech is an amazing city!!,Date of stay: May 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brightonbelle32
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,annie1023 wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Crazy (in a nice way) marrakech,"Firstly - Ignore other reviews saying that staff are rude. Yes This is predominantly a french hotel and all of the staff speak french with limited english but don't forget you are in an arab country. If you are prepared to try they will accommodate you and will respond to you as you do to them (in other words give them a smile and a friendly ""bonjour"" and they will reply accordingly) the rooms are typically rustic moroccan style. Nothing fancy but adequate. The grounds are extensive and VERY nicely kept with lots of nice shrubbery. The 3 x pool areas are large with plenty of sun beds  & cabanas. Animation team are all very friendly and will encourage but not force you to take part. In particular we liked Aziz whom we met last year at riu Tikida palace Agadir. The food was VERY nice with plenty of choice. (Typical moroccan style -cus cus tagines etc) Alcoholic drinks not the best but ok. Entertainment - depends what floats your boat. Its worth taking the free shuttle to check the medina out. we went for 1.5 hrs which was enough just to get the feel of this crazy (in a nice way) city. We went during the morning before it got too hot but i believe that at night its all about food and is very vibrant.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,KarenCharente wrote a review Apr 2013,30,Bit disappointing,We came to this hotel last year same time of year for 2 weeks break with our two children who love the activities and ado club. Last year we came with Jet tours.  We cannot fault the entertainment for the children who are 16 and 14 and the animators are very hard working polite and friendly team.  The downside was to our understanding booking through Booking.com. We feel like second class citizens. This is obviously due to Booking. com taking their commission rate. We were frowned on and clicked at when reception looked at our reservation on arriving and said oh yes you with Booking..... and it is evidently not one of their most lucrative reservation points. I have to say that I did indeed try to call them direct and ask for a reservation of two double rooms for two weeks and was told that they were full. I asked how was it possible that Booking.com website say they have availability. To which I was told well book that way madame as we are full.  Anyway we are here and the children love to meet new friends in the club.  Good side the hamman gymnasium and spa treatments and golf pro are lovely.  The restaurant and service for dinner is a massive let-down.  How the hotel can be called a 4/5 star is beyond our comprehension.  The food is very tedious and many nights poor quality. I suppose this is to be expected with such a large number of people to feed and children always eat pizza and chips anyway so they are happy.  However the breakfast is fab. Loads of choice and a lovely start to the day with some extremely helpful staff outside on the terrace.  The evening meal staff are a different story. They can ignore you for ages if they feel pressured with so many guests arriving between 8 and 9pm. Do not arrive too late otherwise they are very keen to close down cooking areas and shut the curtains and the table staff are overly keen to clear tables and take your plates away. Sadly not the opposite when you arrrive. Do not feel the need to wear smart attire as it is very much a self-service canteen situation with the first come first served.  Another poor side. No coffee area outside after dinner. You have to go and queue up in the disco and ask for coffee there. It would be so easy to have a simple hot water urn and baskets of coffee tea sugar etc outside on the terrace so guests can go and help themselves.  A good quality are the gardens and pools. They are beautifully maintained and a very pleasant place to wander around in.  Another downside we understand they take all reservations to keep them full but we were there the week they had 50 odd 18 year old students arrive together. Nice enough kids during the day but lots of drinking during the evening. You can imagine noise ! Then there was a family who had obviously paid the staff handsomely be waited on hand and foot by the pool and this family had plateloads of foods arriving all day had taken over an area of the pool terrace food smells everywhere left the terrace looking like a bomb had hit it and not very savoury really. It would have been better had the hotel given this family !! a few tables out on the lawn area with parasols and they could have troughed there instead of staff coming over with plates of this chairs here parasols there and ice buckets full of beers etc. Not very appealing to the other guests. Have never seen so much attention given to a client ! They were the only people being served around the pool !  Opinion is that this is very much a 3-4 star hotel now.  Many hotels that we have stayed in their staff come and ask if you would like a drink. Here you have to go and stand in a queue at the top bar and wait till a member of staff meets your gaze and understands their job.  All a bit disappointing really.  Cleaning of the room was a bit sporadic. On 5 days they forgot to give us any towels ! They never in two weeks gave us clean glasses in the room or in the bathroom. We had to clean them ourselves before brushing our teeth. Again all a bit disappointing. Not even a bottle of water in the room. We all had to make sure we remembered to get one from the poolside bar every day. Why they couldn;t put a bottle of water in each fridge...would be so easy to do.    BUT the weather did not let us down.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,Charente Maritime,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenCharente
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,wenwill777 wrote a review Apr 2013,30,Positives/Negatives,Booked a four night break with a friend April 2013. Positives: Hotel clean fresh towels every day. Most of the staff friendly. Ten min drive or so from airport. Drinks always available the wine is not too bad although always too warm and we had to ask for an ice bucket every time. Large pools lots of sunbeds. A large variety of foods but the same every day. I turned vegetarian for the week as couldn't face the meat! Entertainment staff seem to work hard with the kids all day and then they do a show at night. There is a singer outside on the patio area at night until around ten.  Negatives: Love kids but they are everywhere. Think it may have been a school holiday? Agree with previous comment keep the pool without slides for adults. Mostly French guests only a handful of staff speak a little English. French seem to be heavy smokers! Always smoke wafting across to us from all directions by the pool. Loud music playing around pool games for kids etc. This is definitely not a 5 star hotel.  We took the shuttle to the markets very smelly and dirty but expected that. Expect to be hassled immediately you enter the square shops all sell the same stuff. I bought a kaftan which started out at 500 dirhams and ended up at 200. Well worth a visit. We took taxi back to hotel - the driver wanted 110 D. but then accepted 50. They do stop and pick up others if they are flagged apparently its the done thing. Marjorelle Gardens is beautiful and worth a visit also.  This hotel is fantastic if you are taking kids but if you want a quiet time forget it. First time I have flown easy jet great for short flights - on time in fact got back into Manchester 20 mins early.  Advised not to drink the water by rep - but bottles of water are in abundance. The smell in reception is wonderful ( burning oil) they sell it in the shop for 200 dirhams. No bargaining in there though tried it. Bar staff at the snack bar a bit rude could stand for ages waiting to get served - have to be firm and make yourself heard. Wouldn't go again but I think it was good value for money and great if you have kids.,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Usk, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wenwill777
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Dolly099 wrote a review Apr 2013,40,Very good hotel - good value,"Going to start with the positives which is the majority! Very nice clean hotel big bedrooms great food with huge variety and very generous with all drinks. Close to Marrakech - good shuttle bus service into and out of town. Close to airport too. Huge swimming pools and lots of sunbeds so a real treat not to have to ""run for your sunbed"" as in some hotels. (Having said that there were still the usual people who ""bagged"" their sunbed at 7 am despite notices asking you not to do it.) A great place to go for a few days in the sun. Would definitely recommend it and would go back there.    A few things for the hotel to think about! I emailed twice before I came asking if they could arrange a taxi to collect myself and my three daughters from the airport when we arrived and was basically told ""no - get a taxi from outside the airport"" which surprised me slightly! I was hoping not to have to haggle with the taxis as we didn't arrive until the evening and were 4 women. However this is what we had to do and of course learnt we had paid far too much for the taxi during our stay! There were lots of taxis meeting people from our flight so I was not sure why this could not have been arranged. Needless to say our taxi back to the airport at the end of the stay was half the price of the first one.    There are two huge pools and I think it would be much nicer if one could be kept as an ""adults only"" pool. The pool with the flume is clearly for children and is actually a bigger pool. It was very noisy around the pool with loud music played most of the time and lots of shouting and activities going on. Again would be nicer if that was more confined for the majority of people who didn't actually want to join in with the group activities.    The dining room was generally very good but breakfast was rather chaotic. Obviously most people come to breakfast around 9 am on holiday and we found that most days the tables were not being cleared quickly enough and we often ended up clearing our own table and then having to wait for it to be laid up clean for us. There was one waiter who was always particularly grumpy so we avoided sitting in his area after a couple of days!!!    The Moroccan Restaurant for which we paid a small supplement wasnt very exciting - or perhaps it just wasn't to our taste. We only went once and it was very disappointing with no choices. The Atlas Restaurant is so good. They need to make the Moroccan Restaurant better than that if they want people to use it.    It's a great hotel to go to but don't go there for a peaceful time as it's noisy in the public areas!    Basically well done to them though - we had a great time.",Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,Cambridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dolly099

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,M15Rou wrote a review Apr 2013,40,What a fantastic week!,Having read many reviews in the 6 month run up to this hotel I was a little worried. I needn't have been; we had an absolutely wonderful holiday! 8 girls traveling from London for 1 week.    Airport to hotel transfer was 30Euro for a minibus for 6 of us (two girls arrived on a different flight the next day). This was arranged via the hotel directly. Relatively good price. The driver and his guide were very informative and friendly giving us helpful tips - not too sales pitch like at all. Transfer took less than 30 mins.    Morocco has a closed currency you can change cash at the airport but wait until you are in the main lounge not the baggage hall as the rate is better. Also there are two desks next to each other their rates differ so check this too. Avoid changing at the hotel the rate they show is not the rate they give you.    Lovely cup of mint tea on arrival and you can return for another glass (or 10) during your stay. We arrived very early and were given access to our rooms almost immediately. Staff transferred our luggage for us via buggy as we were at the very back of the hotel (Rosaria Riad rooms 400-412).    Hotel grounds and room are immaculate and well kept. Everything is very clean and tidy.  There is a small shop near the children's area which has lots of basic amenities. Not massively over priced but not cheap either. Spacious and modern rooms with flat screen TV and mini bar. Water pressure was fantastic and always hot hot water! Can't fault the room at all!    Food had a great variety but did get a little samey after 3 meals a day for a week there. We ate out a few nights in the city center to break this up a little. Would have been nice to have some of the dishes refilled more frequently but again we never went hungry and there was a different theme most nights. The Orangery Restaurant is a la carte and there is a small charge for this. We did book to eat here but after reviews from other guests we decided that we'd give it a miss. Alcohol is plentiful in all honesty the cocktails are awful but the wine is great and they give you a bottle instead of by the glass. We took a few back to our room same with the soft drinks/water which we kept in the fridge in our rooms.    Hotel itself is huge with 2 swimming pools spa etc . One is absolutely freezing with 4 water slides the other is a little warmer but could benefit from some heating. Weather was a little overcast some of the time so it was difficult to make the most of this. Does get very busy so get your sunbeds early. People have a tendency to try and reserve multiple beds so hold your ground! Nice beach towels available and pools are clean too. Wouldn't bother with the spa. The hamam is horrid and you have to pay to use the gym (!!!). Staff in the spa reception need some people skills training. Not a pleasant experience at all. Main reception girls on check in could have been more pleasant but not the worst we have dealt with.    Restaurant & Other hotel stuff were always helpful and polite. House keeping took ages to bring fresh towels after the room had been cleaned so I had to go hunting for these a few times. No big deal but would be nice not to have to ask. Life and soul of the hotel is definitely Mido and his entertainment team! They are fun and energetic and try and get everyone involved all day. They run activities from first thing in the morning until 11.30pm when the bar closes and even after this they can be found in the hotel's own club (yes they have their own club! drinks here are not included on the A.I basis but still not expensive). Happy to socialise and answer any questions they were a delight to have around. Crepes and snacks in the Gnawa bar between meals are ok - crepes are good! Gnawa bar is where the evening entertainment happens and can get a little smokey. Outside seating is nice.    Free shuttle into the city is useful but remember to book as spaces are limited. Free wifi is not great in all honesty. Bad reception and continually cuts out. Works very well in the bathroom in all rooms for some reason!    Overall I would definitely return and recommend to a friend. It's close enough to the Medina/city centre for easy access but far enough that it isn't dirty etc. Complaints of builders etc are unfounded we didn't hear a thing day or night and they were right by our block.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M15Rou

On a percentage the hotel I would say is 90% french the staff all speak french and a little english.    Food.  very good with lots of choice .  We booked the themed Morroccan restaurant and bearing in mind you are on an A.I. deal you would of thought would of been included in the price wrong!! on checking out we was presented with a bill for 200DH still very cheap but pre warning that the hotel charged for this restuarant would of been welcome .    Drinks .  Beer ok its called stork with your meals you can have full bottles of red/white wine and bottles of soft drinks .    Pools.  there are 2 pools neither very warm in fact one was freezing other luke warm Plenty of sunbeds and the towels were good clean and fresh.    Hotel staff .  Well lets just say that at times you seem invisible the recpetion staff seem some what Put out if you ask them a question and at times were seen laughing with each other when you walk away from the front desk in the main restaurant you can ask the waiter for a table and be left standing there you then ask again and the same happens this seems to be the same at the pool bar they see you standing there but just ignore you why i'll never know .  The staff at the spa also seem to have the same issue they are just lacking customer care and seems that they would rather be elsewhere but helping you.    entertainment .  poor.    Grounds  very well kept and spotless    Taxis/market  if you go to the main market there is a shuttle bus from the hotel this will drop you at the main maket (free of charge) then the fun begins  you will be hassled from the moment your feet touch the pavement every thing is over priced the traders will increase prices at evey opportunity my wife wanted a shoulder bag in the UK £8 MAX we was told 350DH and after haggling we got it for 180DH which I know if i kept on I could of got for much less but the haggling becomes boring after a while.  A taxi back to the hotel will start at 100DH tell the driver 50/75DH and this will work for you.    Check out .  Be aware you will be charged a daily tax rate for each night you stay there is also a charge for the safe in you room this you are not told of when you check in .    You have to be out of you room by 12pm we asked if we could extend this at we was allowed to have our room until 1pm .    Would we return? I would say yes we would but staff and entertainment needs to be addressed,Date of stay: April 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beavers247

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DumDum32 wrote a review Mar 2013,30,"Nice Hotel, Good location, Good Food but watch out for the Towels",This is a really nice hotel with good food (and lots of it) as well as some nice entertainment in the evenings.    However three things to watch out for:    The towel situation is a joke. Your towels are taken from your room in the morning and not returned until approximately 5pm making it somewhat difficult to have a shower during the day. So plan around this by either borrowing some extra towels or using the shower faciulities near the pool or Spa (neither of which is ideal). We also had issues with a lack of towels around the pool area one day resulting in a 3 hour wait for pool towels and so a swim.    The second issue is the Spa. It is beautifully decorated but you really do take your chances with the treatments. One treatement was spectacular prompting a return visit which was spectacular only in how awful it was. However a prompt complaint about the second treatment did result in an offer of refund or repeat treatment.    The third issue is extra charges in the hotel. They charge a daily local tax and a daily rate for use of the room safe neither of which were explained to us when checking in. For an all-inclusive package holiday this came as a bit of a surprise and judging by the reactions of some of the other hotel guests when checking out they were as surprised as us.    I guess this really should come as no surprise in a city who'se sole aim is to take as much money out of tourists as they possible can. It really does get very tiresome after a while.    So would we go back to the hotel ? Possibly now that we are forewarned about some of the issues. However would we go back to Marrakech ? Probably not. It is certainly different but not in an altogether pleasant way and the continual bombardment of locals trying to fleece you gets very irritating very quickly.    Istanbul for me is a better choice.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DumDum32
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ukska wrote a review Mar 2013,30,Mixed Review. not 5 star.,Booked with travel zoo for a cheap family birthday treat for 5 days. Having read the reviews we sort of knew what to suspect. We were meet by the med rep who booked us in quick and easy. As room was not ready headed for Lunch We sat down and asked for drinks and was told to help ourselves. were other people were being served at their table. Now the food was not bad at all plenty of mixture Rooms was nice & Clean but small silly things werent right the sink didnt empty or if it did very slowly. We found a crock roach in our room the 2nd night!! but thought look we are only here for a few days but checked the room each time  Now the service at the bars was very hit and miss. they run out of vodka one night run out of beer now there were 6 of us on many occasions we were ignored completly yet other times lovely service. but as we only had spent a few hundred each on the holiday we made the most of it.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Keith T wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Perfect for relaxation and adventure!,Having read some of the reviews we too were not sure what to expect when we stayed here for 4 nights (18-22 March 2013). We went for a short holiday to celebrate a friend's birthday (there were 4 of us) and we all thoroughly enjoyed the trip.  The hotel is clean and well planned - like a collection of riads leading off from the main pool area.The rooms are large and at night very quiet. The beds are large and comfortable however a little harder than I am used to so did wake up once or twice in the night. The bathroom was clean and had a good shower. Not a great view from our balcony but we didn't sit out there anyway so no problem. There are 2 pools - one massive and free form but not heated (just about ok now and I am sure no problem in the summer) - the other very large and heated. There are plenty of sun loungers good towels and a poolside bar. The restaurant and evening bar/entertainment area are also close to the pool and the main reception building.  The restaurant is very tastefully set out with very pleasant outside seating amongst the olive trees and shades and the food is always good and sometimes excellent! We couldn't understand the reviews saying choice was limited or repetitive - there was always rice pasta couscous potatoes (chips and sauted) pizzas flatbreads and other breads. What else is there for your carbohydrate/starch fix? There were always plenty of veggie dishes saladseggs fish and meats to go with it so please use your imagination before complaining about choice. There were also delicious tagine dishes and on the Thursday evening they decorated the restaurant with royal blue tablecloths and featured an enormous fresh tuna (took 3 chefs to turn it round) where you could take a cut and cook to order and a huge piece of beef which was carved for you.  We didn't use the Spa facilties or room service the wine served was good and brought to your table in a bottle the beer was cold and refreshing but local spirits were average only.  As with all buildings in Marrakech the architecture is Moroccan themed and blends well with traditional Medina architecture. The advantage this hotel has is that you can truly relax yet feel at the same time you are actually in Morocco. When you want to venture out it is a 50 dirham (about £4) taxi ride to the main square in the Medina where you will experience the buzz and excitement Marrakech has to offer - this includes people coming up to you and trying to sell you things or guide you but a polite firm no thankyou normally suffices.  This brings me to the language criticism we have read in some reviews. Marrakech is in Morocco where the main language is Arabic and the second language is French. English is normally only taught in some schools mainly private and at an older age so most Moroccans are self taught and make a great effort to speak English and are quite happy to do so. It is nonsense to say if you don't know French you will have a bad holiday! I can speak French but my friends don't so I only spoke English to the staff and we experienced no animosity - only a friendly smile and willingness to help.Try learning a couple of phrases in French before you go - bonjour merci and non merci will enrich your experience!  We had a great holiday and would definitely recommend this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Chertsey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151KeithT
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,jayne953 wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Wonderful holiday and a pleasant surprise,After booking a 5 day break for myself and 3 girlfriends I became exceedingly worried after reading some of the reviews that people have written.  The hotel is very clean.All of the rooms are situated in courtyards that run from long olive tree lined avenues.Large clean rooms with small patios or balconies.They were cleaned daily.  The pool areas are surrounded with Beduin tents just in case you would like to be out of the sun.No need to take beach towels as these are provided daily.  Food was excellent with an array of choices ..from Morroccan tagines to fish pasta salads meats..and numerous wonderful vegetables which is something that I always miss on a foreign holiday.And the table wine was good quality.  The service is fantastic..Everyone of the staff were pleasant ....especially the entertainment crew Rabir and the barman Mohammed.  The only thing I would say that if you dont like very sweet 'savoury' food then I would take a miss on the Morroccan restaurant..Lovely ambiance but food very very sweet.  All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our break and would certainly visit again for a little bit of winter sunshine especially as it is snowing here now:) And find it difficult to understand what people actually want when reading the negatives..,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Coventry, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayne953
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Alan_N-C_Redditch wrote a review Mar 2013,40,A garden of peace away from the city life,We really did not know what to expect here as we did this trip via Lastminute.com but we were pleased with what we found. We were here for 4 nights (16-20/03/13) and our room was in the middle of the complex (Room 717) the room itself was clean and tidy though if you really wanted to find fault you could i.e. the balcony doors let the wind blow through a bit and some oft he skirting in the bathroom have water damage but other than that it was large spacious and comfortable. The bed was 7ft x 7ft... massive. One night there was a party going on next door at midnight but a quick call to reception and they dealt with it so can not complain about that. The food was fine and they tried to offer a mix of local dishes as well as european so there was always something to eat. The wine was plentyful and of a good quality. The grounds were immaculate plenty of room by the pools though I am not sure how it would be in high season. Legend has it there is a shuttle bus to the city centre but we never saw it but a taxi ride varied from 50-100 Dihram depending on the time of day a tip here is that the hotel taxis will come back into town and collect you at an agreed time/location these are cheaper and less hassle than the taxis in town.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Redditch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alan_N_CRedditch

Had a great time stayed in room 445 furthest away from reception but very quiet and gorgeous views of the Atlas Mountains. Food was very good a great selection the wine was ok spirits weak. Great customer service and really friendly staff. Not speaking French did not cause us any problems at all. We payed 100D from the airport or 10 euro. Quiet a few people get ripped off hold out for your price. One couple paid a local taxi driver £50 to take them both into the mountains for the day whereas the hotel wanted to charge £130 for the day!  We walked up to Pacha nightclub (15 mins) and got in for free with our hotel wristbands.  got the free mini bus into the city but caught a taxi back again had to haggle for a while but only 50D/£4.50.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sam2870 wrote a review Mar 2013,40,Lovely base for a city break,The staff were all so pleasant without exception and are such an asset to the hotel....I am a stickler for customer service and I couldn't fault them.  HOWEVER the miserable specimens in the spa need to take some lessons from their lovely colleagues in the main hotel. Showed up for our free hammam their faces dropped like stones when a said we were there for our free treatment made to feel like second rate citizens.....here's the thing our free session would have almost certainly led to further paid Sessions throughout our stay...but after this shoddy service there was no way we would have returned! Note to spa manager-sort out your staff they are a disgrace! We were sulkily shown to a room told to leave our belongings and shoved into the marble lined sauna...which would have been lovely had we been given advice to take towels and our welfare checked...or shown ANY courtesy whatsoever.  The food was fine plentiful and fresh...I like good food and enjoy gourmet experiences and wasn't expecting perfection but it was perfectly adequate with different themes every evening.  The rooms were fine the cleaning staff making a real effort every day with towel origami and fresh petals and floral goodies too....even leaving little notes wishing us well...how sweet!  Animation teams are not my cuppa tea and unfortunately they were unavoidable...using their PA system at full blast despite being no more than a couple of feet from the people taking part in their activities ....we could have done with some peace to be honest...does it really have to be do loud...and repetitive?

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Farnesy71 wrote a review Mar 2013,30,Could do better,We have just returned from a week at Kenzi Club. The hotel was large and the rooms were spacious and very clean. However we found that the maid often removed all the towels and didn't return them until the evening which created a few problems if we needed to have a shower in the afternoon. We took to hiding towels in the wardrobe to overcome this problem.    The food left a lot to be desired - we seemed to have the same most meal times and the signage wasn't always clear. There was a complete lack of fresh fruit - just sliced oranges apples & pears. Last year we stayed at Decameron Issil which had an abundance of exotic fruit so we expected the same having paid more for this hotel. The restaurant was very badly arranged with hot food all over the place -you virtually had to walk all around a large area just to check the different dishes.    We were surprised to have to pay for the gym and there was no air conditioning as we were still in their 'winter' time. I think if you are on an all inclusive package there shouldn't be a charge.    We found there was nowhere to go in the evening for a quiet drink as there was only one bar open and it was full of children and loud music and people were allowed to smoke. It was too cold to sit outside although there were some heaters but they soon ran out of gas.    The animation team were very friendly and did their best to include us although they mostly spoke French - one young man Rabia was extremely helpful and made a point of looking after us.    I don't think we would go back to this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farnesy71

Room was spacious and cleaned everyday our maid was very nice we were in Rosemarie Rhiad a square of rooms in gardens very pretty & quiet. Restaurant had so many choices of food all very tasty could not fault it at all staff all very friendly and attentive especially the animation staff who made us laugh and always ready for a chat tribute show was brilliant. The pool areas were especially clean 28degrees in march made it lovely & relaxing (although came back to snow) The tourists were predominately french but again we found them to be friendly with always a bonsure or bonjure! afternoon pancakes & cakes on the terrace were a must. Visit to medina suks was an experience everyone should go shuttle buses provided by the hotel but we came back by taxi bata with the taxis and you can get a good deal. We would definately recommend this hotel lady with previous comments last week who gave negative comments we dont understand!! we found the hotel definately 5 star accommodation and friendly & accommodating staff. We had to vacate our room by 12 but they let us have it till 1pm then we went to the spa for showers (they provided us with towels) before we left at 5pm at no extra charge. Will definately return.

The hotel runs a free shuttle bus to Djemaa el-Fna though we usually got a taxi back- decide on your price first!  The food is good in the main with tagines and meat & fish though even after a few days the dishes were repeated. The freshly made omelettes in the morning were lovely.  We felt that the table service was a little unbalanced sometimes- possibly because it was easier for the waiters to deal with the French speaking guests- but they were always polite once we had their attention.  I'd probably try a riad next time in the hope of a more authentic experience but as a last minute all inclusive deal this did the job.,Date of stay: July 2012,,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cattyrina
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,louloubells wrote a review Mar 2013,50,We Heart Club Kenzi!,Club Kenzi is the perfect hassle free relax-sanctuary. A friend and I were in desperate need of some time out from hectic London life the rain and cold and we came across Club Kenzi on Expedia and it couldnt have been more perfect. The hotel is in a gorgeous complex and catered for our every need. It is a all inclusive french resort and in other all inclusive deals I have been on before you have to pay for at least something - wine drinks snacks etc. but here everything was included and meant a completely hassle free stay. If we were hungry we ate; if we were thirsty we drank; if we were bored we did an activity or went for a swim. It was perfect. There was even a complimentary shuttle bus into Marrakech centre which ran throughout the day. Also the food was much better than I was expecting - a huge buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner and a great selection each day.  The weather (February) was perfect. Even though very cold in the morning and evening from 10-4 each day was gorgeous brilliant sunshine and was definite bikini weather.  The staff were always helpful friendly and the animation team brought a great vibe full of fun and so much energy!  In February the resort was relatively quiet which was nice. For me I wouldnt go back in high season when the place was full as there would be too many people around (they have 900+ rooms) so wouldnt be as relaxing.  Also as a 95% french resort if you have trouble with the language that may become a hindrance. Luckily my friend spoke fluent french so we were ok. Also they allow smoking in the bar which we didnt really like.  By the end of the trip we didnt want to leave. We will definitely be back and I think this has now become an Annual ritual trip! Thank you Club Kenzi for a wonderful stay we returned home relaxed refreshed and re-energised which is just what we needed.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,nancy l wrote a review Mar 2013,30,Nice Hotel but not 5 Star,We got this hotel from a Travel Zoo offer so couldn't really complain for the price we paid to stay here.    On Arrival the Lobby was beautiful and smelt amazing we were offered Moroccan tea and got driven to our room which was nice. When we entered our room we was impressed by the cleanliness and the size. But when we opened the balcony curtain we realised we was right next to a building site! The builders started work at 7.30am everyday so this woke us up most mornings. We didn't bother to complain though as the reception all spoke French and hardly any English! There was a lack of plugs in the room which was annoying as none of the plugs were near a mirror.    First few days were freezing so we took advantage of the Spa and had to pay extra to use the indoor swimming pool. Which was cold!! The Spa Staff weren't very helpful..I think because of the language barrier they just ignored us. But having said that I had a great facial and the prices were quite reasonable and we got to use the hamman steam room which was so dark and scary at first!    There was one buffet for breakfast lunch & dinner and then one Moroccan Restaurant. The buffet was average. The restaurant was always full and the food didn't get replenished so a lot of the time most of the food was gone if you got there late. There was hardly any meat and not much variety we ate mainly pasta rice and chips most of the holiday! The food got repetitive every day. The lunch buffet seemed to be better the breakfast was average. As it was a 5* hotel my friend and I dressed up for dinner every evening as you do when you are on holiday but we felt completely out of place. NO ONE at all dressed up for dinner. Everyone was dressed so casual in tracksuits etc. For a 5* Hotel I believe there should be some sort of dress code. We kept getting funny looks from other French guests which made us feel uncomfortable. Some of the staff in the buffet were helpful others just ignored us. We had to wait to get a table for about 15mins one evening and all the waiters just ignored us completely.    The Moroccan Restaurant was quite nice the waiter in there was very good. It was set menu the Moroccan food is very sweet though.    The hotel bar is quite nice and open until 11.30pm and the animation team are very friendly and try to get everyone in a good mood as there were quite a few moody guests staying at this hotel! Some of the bar staff were great fun others just ignored us again! We had to wait to get drinks quite a lot...    There was a club at the hotel but we didn't know this until the 3rd night was a proper club with good music but no all inclusive drinks... There was also a show every night aswell we didn't know this until halfway through the week. We didn't get informed of this!    Great location was only 15 mins from Marrakech Town and the hotel offered a free shuttle bus there and back.    All in all it was a good hotel just a few things that let it down... I think if they opened a few more restaurants it would be good sort some of the staff out and maybe advertise the hotel to people other than the French!,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,london,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyl294
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Victoria L wrote a review Mar 2013,50,To use the word magnificent would not be an overstatement.,Aesthetically.  The site captured our vision of a luxury 5-star resort whilst retaining a solid heritage and Moroccan accent. To use the word magnificent would not be an overstatement.    Service/Staff.  From the moment of arrival to the moment of departure we found the staff to be more than accommodating. I would urge you to disregard comments that Brits were/are ostracised due to it being a predominantly French resort this is not the case and to be frank this is a blinkered and ignorant view. The staff were courteous altruistic and genuinely went out of their way to be of help – from the cleaning team to security – I couldn't find fault.  The variety of activities/services on offer was astounding. From the choice of 3 pools to going to the on site club after hours – Kenzi Club has the whole package; tennis dance classes archery football and cookery to name but a few. The 'Animation Team' were superb in this respect – they planned optional activities from 10am – 10pm. A stalwart group with unyielding energy and passion for what they did.  There were also a most useful free shuttle bus to Medina Square (10 minute journey) which we used regularly.    Facilities.  To attempt to describe the layout of the site would do it an injustice. Whether you wished to indulge in sport or relax on the plethora of lounging options the options are a-plenty. I personally indulged in using the spa. Comparative to the UK the treatment (Hamman Massage) surpassed I have had previously. Charging a very reasonable fee I felt rejuvenated reenergised and perfectly tranquil – smashing.    Food.  My friend and I had heard horror stories of all inclusive food. Kenzi Club quashed these; breakfast lunch mid-afternoon snacks and dinner saw variety impressive presentation and something for everyone. As a somewhat fussy yet inquisitive eater I found my taste buds excited but also enjoyed the option of plainer food.  We did not sample the Moroccan set menu available in the second restaurant but by all accounts it was descent.    Outside the resort.  There were many planned excursions available of which we id a short tour of the gardens and palaces. Though useful it could be done without a guide. Note – do not go on a tour of the Souks total scam.  As two 24-year-old girls alone we were rather intimidated by the Souks/Square – this was expected due to our being in a predominantly male orientated impoverished Muslim area. This is not a slur on the experience or place merely and observation. Once we had escorts in the form of two fellow holiday-makers (male) we felt much more confident and thoroughly enjoyed shopping in and indeed getting lost in the warren-like Souks. The traders are persistent and rather cheeky (bordering on rude) but confidence is key and eye-contact is not recommended.  We ended up going clubbing having henna tattoos and trying unusual local delicacies – the orange juice is out of this world.    Summary.  I would regard myself as well travelled and I have stayed in a variety of hotels – ranging from 1*-6* Kenzi Club was simply superb. I could gush further about my experience littering my description with superlatives but in summary I would recommend Kenzi Club entirely – I would 100% visit again. We had an absolute blast.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/79VictoriaL
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Andrew T wrote a review Mar 2013,20,Third World and Third Rate,Luckily we are here on a golf holiday so we can at least have something to do to get out of the resort for. I should have realized that you cannot have Five Star and all inclusive at the same time particularly at this price. To call this a Five Star hotel is ridiculous. It is large size average quality multi -facility family resort aimed at the French tourists. There are many things for families with kids but unless you enjoy lying out around the pool all day this is not a hotel for couples. The location is a short distance from Marrakech city and airport and is in the middle of an area of major hotel development. Unless you take a tour or take the shuttle into Marrakech there is nothing to do around the area outside the hotel. The facility is beautifully laid out with nice and well maintained gardens. The rooms are fairly ordinary. There is satellite TV but almost all channels are in French. BBC News and CNN can get a bit tedious after a time! Luckily there is WiFi so if you understand IT try to get a proxy server on your laptop so you can watch the BBC iPlayer or ITV Player if you want entertainment.    The staff at the hotel reception are very poor and unhelpful. If you want any tours everything is in French and if you are lucky you will find someone who can explain things in English. We did actually manage to get a English speaking guide on a tour into the Atlas mountains. For the rest of the hotel the food is very ordinary and often almost cooked to death in the main restaurant. All you can eat buffets are not places where one often gets good food and this is one of these. Deserts are horribly sweet and sticky. There is a Moroccan restaurant however there is a €10 surcharge. The menu if fixed and does not change so you only eat there once. For us it was once too many as the food was very poor and the service haphazard with the sauces for the main course arriving almost 10 minutes after the food.    If you want a coffee after dinner (not that you would as the coffee is so bad) you have to go to the bar. The bar is large and until 9.30 pm acts as a children's dancing area with loud music. At the same time the predominantly French parents and adults smoke their Gitanes and Gaulois cigarettes so it is very smokey. Luckily you can sit outside if you find a seat.    There are three swimming pools but only the kiddies and smaller pool are heated so the main pool is not used until well into summer. There is an indoor pool in the spa but this is at an extra charge. You cannot swim in the main pool after around 5.30 pm. This is a real limitation as you may have come back after a hot sticky day but cannot get a swim to freshen up. The problem is you often cannot freshen up in your room as all the room towels are taken away when the room is made up in the morning and not returned clean until almost 6.00 pm. If you are coming to the hotel bring a towel for use in the room in the day.    I was as you gather very disappointed in the hotel and would certainly not recommend it or come again. As many UK holiday companies are now selling it in the promotions the hotel really needs to sort out how it handles English speaking guests.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Truro, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewT328

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Roselee1966 wrote a review Mar 2013,30,Really for the French,Chose this hotel because the reviews were quite good. Stayed here for 5 nights with my partner. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the friendly doorman who helped us with our luggage into the foyer. First impressions was that the staff was very friendly and the reception area was very clean and well presented. Problem started when we went to the reception. The receptionist spoke little or no English (one could argue that we English should not expect everyone to speak our language which I agree with). However there seems to be a them and us situation where if your French your ok. Our room was not ready so we just about worked out that they said we could go and get some lunch - we had to work out where that was and how it all worked in the dining room etc. in fact for the whole 5 days we had to try and work things out for ourselves. When we finished lunch we went back to reception only to be told that the room is still not ready and we had to wait until 2.00.    When we finally got to our room after seeing how beautiful the grounds and surroundings were we were greatly disappointed. The quality of the grounds did not reflect the quality of our room. The room was dark an dingy we had no towels the shower curtain was stained and it was one of those cheap £1 plastic ones. Not something you expect in a delux room no iron no tea/coffee making facilities. To top it all at this time of the year feb/march it gets quite chilly at night and our heating system was not working.    When we tried to complain because of the limited English it was a hard job to get our complaints over to them. We did get towels the shower curtain never got changed someone looked at the heating - we thought they said they would return but they never dd.    On a plus the steam room is fantastic and free the grounds are as previously said well kept and clean and you can get wifi in rooms reception and some parts of the grounds.    The food is ok can be repetitive - would have liked more food options on the go rather than set times.  Would go back to Marrakech but not this hotel.,Date of stay: March 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roselee1966
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,andreashabby wrote a review Mar 2013,50,Great place to be,In October we spent 3 days in Marrakech looking for the good weather nice temperatures and most important:a QUIET place. We found it in kenzi club staff very polite multi language starting from reception bar and restaurant ending with massage centre.  Very relaxing place all inclusive you could eat from morning till evening no stop if you wish so. Great variety at the bouffet of course the most popular food here is the local Moroccan cousins with plenty of vegetables and chicken tajin. Bottles of wine water and soft drinks served at your table from very professional staff.  Rooms big and clean 3 swimming pools outdoor: for kids medium deep with slidesdeep for adults. Another pool inside the Ammam massage centre. Free shuttle bus to and from martakech downtown running all day Pacha disco 15 min walking from resort.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,tracey187069 wrote a review Mar 2013,30,god help you if you are not french or you are a woman!!,we visited here to celebrate my 40th birthday. We were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous very spacious and clean. The complex and grounds of the hotel were very nicely laid out and catered for everybody. The food in the restraunt was nice varied from night to night although we did steer clear of what they labeled as chicken as it did not resemble what we would call chicken. Breakfast was disappointing and the coffee minging! The staff thoughout the hotel were very ignorant and at times rude. i would be left standing at the bar and wouldnt be served yet if my husband went he was attended to. they would open the door for my husband but then let go when i was going through. the fact that we wernt french was also an issue no attempt to converse with us was made we were often overlooked and ignored when seeking help i.e booking trips or shuttle bus.  We visited the market in marrakech and felt very intimidated and constantly mythered that we couldnt stop to look at anything. We also went on a daytrip through the atlas mountains which was very nice though not for the faint hearted or for people with mobility problems.  Changing money was a problem here we realised that is why people queued up in the airport on arrival to do so before leaving for their hotel.  The trip to the airport opened our eyes to another part of marrakech we would not have seen shopping complexes cinema and even a macdonalds!!  The airport experience was shocking to say the least. men and women are seperated into two queues and make sure you have a pen to complete a essential form otherwise if you are a woman you are refused through passport control (if you are a man they will fill it in for you!)  glad to have the experience but would not visit this country again where women are 2nd hand citizens!!!,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracey187069
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,sageyLondon wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Wonderful Relaxing place to stay,I stayed here for 6 days from check in to check out the staff are professional and welcoming. If you are a Brit it can sometimes feel a bit like you are not as involved as the hotel caters for the mass of French guests staying there which is understandable but all the staff never made us feel uncomfortable nor the other guests. The cleanliness is excellent and the staff are constantly cleaning the pool area the dining room and the grounds and bedrooms. The buffet is very good there is always something you can eat even if you are a very plain eater their baguettes were amazing and the lovely Moroccan pastries they cook fresh is the mornings are great. Avoid the cake area of a night as it is really tempting and i could feel my waist expanding by the day yummy...The main pool near the bar was great with what i would call pit area's or these huge double bed things with squidgy cushions on that you can chill out on after lunch or if you are feeling sleepy. The entertainment at times is slightly cheesy but the team work very hard to get everyone involved and some of it is funny so it is worth going in the bar/nightclub for a drink or coffee. Thank you to all the staff who made our holiday so great especially Omymma on Reception Abdel Rahim the tv engineer Murad in the dining hall and especially Nozha our maid they were fantastic.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,hols2709 wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Fantastic!!,Just returned from a lovely 3 day break with my husband and our 6 year old. We arrived about 10.30pm and were dealt with very quickly at reception. A golf buggy took us to our room but when we got there the single bed was not made up for our daughter. This was very quickly rectified by the guy that took us to our room making a call to reception. The beds were very comfy and the room was exactly as the photos show. Had air con for both heat & cool but we didn’t need to use as our room was warm enough. Rooms were cleaned daily. We overlooked the tennis courts and a view of the Atlas Mountains. All areas were kept very clean and tidy. The food was fantastic and very varied. Pancakes at breakfast were delicious!! Mint tea was lovely. Plenty of drinks available. We were able to get the same table every time but we did notice that people were struggling to find a table in the evenings if they left it till after 8pm. This would not be a problem later in the year as you could sit outside. We enjoyed a really nice meal in the Morrocaan restaurant. The weather was sunny/cloudy approx. 20 degrees while we were there and as previous reviews have said it was chilly until about 9.30am and then once it got dark the temperature dropped so you definitely need some warmer clothes. The heated pool was good and was covered every evening so was kept clean. The larger pool with the slides was too cold although some people did try out the slides. Loads of sunbeds available and they supply towels for the pool so no need to take your own. Entertainment was generally in French. Lots of activities during the day if this is your thing and entertainment every evening. We wouldn’t normally visit this but did take a look on our last night and had a laugh. Overall we had a great time and definitely a great place to go for a winter break.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Great Dunmow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hols2709

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,rmi_1 wrote a review Feb 2013,50,"excellent quality, value, location and service, smoky bar",We stayed here for one week 9-16th Feb in two standard rooms 3 adults one child on all inclusive basis. Weather was 23-27C and sunny every day. We booked direct. This was our third trip to Marrakech & we've stayed in a Riad and boutique hotel previously. We understand that the hotel was almost full during the week. We don't usually take any prisoners when it comes to service and standards.    Reception and check-in welcome and check-out was excellent and efficient staff in the Hotel speak French and many of the clients are French so if you can speak a little that helps (as it does anywhere in Morocco) but there were many who spoke excellent English. The hotel clients were predominantly French    Rooms were exactly as shown on the web-site were clean modern and v comfortable beds. Cleaned daily to a good standard. All facilities worked and the rooms looked fresh. We stayed near to the tennis court which was some way from the main facilities but was v peaceful    The food was excellent and varied with a different theme each evening. The main dining room is catering for a large number of people but there are quieter areas and it is v pleasant and modern and service and presentation standards was generally v good even at peak times. Sometimes there were slight delays in replacement of dishes but food was clearly being prepared fresh so this is only to be expected. The salads and desserts were fabulous and if you're vegetarian there's great variety.    We didn't get to visit the Moroccan restaurant and didn't use the childcare facilities    The grounds were immaculate and v pleasant to walk around with various places to sit with a book in peace. Even though nearly at capacity the hotel didn't feel crowded at all.    The pool areas were v pleasant and clean. We used the heated pool as the main pool was too cold at the time of year although there were children using the water slides. There are wonderful enclosed loungers around the pool areas. People do tend to 'reserve' these with towels but we never failed to find a free one.    We used the Spa throughout the week. It's a v relaxing and tranquil place to escape to and staff were v attentive. Treatments were authentic and reasonably priced compared to UK and other local Spas. The gym works out at 200MAD per week and the pool 100MAD per one hour visit. I guess that it so that the pool doesn't become a cheap overspill from the outdoor pools if the weather isn't so great.    The pool bar does hot and cold drinks throughout the day. It stocks only local beers and spirits (as described on the package) The terrace is a pleasant place to end the day as the sun sets.    Throughout the day there's an 'entertainment programme'. We were a little apprehensive about this as it's not our usual style but it was great and not too intrusive. The team are v enthusiastic good fun and there is plenty to do if you want to join in.    Later afternoon cakes and pancakes are served. This wasn't always pleasant as cakes were totally covered in wasps within minutes of being served although the pancakes are great. Staff try their best by making make-shift wasp traps but the hotel really needs to invest in a few electronic insect killers for the service areas (including pool bar) and this would be sorted.    There's an hourly free shuttle to the Medina - this needs to be booked the night before if you want the 09:00 or 10:00 shuttle but its v efficient. Even if you miss it taxis are outside and only 100MAD return. Some of the taxis are v dodgy so a tip is to pick a safe and modern looking taxi from the rank on your first day (even if this isn't at the front of the queue and if there isn't one go have a coffee and return later) and then ask for the driver's card and stick with this for other trips during your stay. Drivers will put together a trip to main sites city tours or up into the mountains (though best get a 4x4 taxi) for much less than the booked tours especially if you use the same driver.    The main let down for us was in the evenings. There's only one main bar and smoking is allowed inside (non smoking in all other areas of the hotel) By early evening the bar disappeared behind a fog of burning Gauloises and Gitanes and was quite an unpleasant place to be or even enter for a moment if you're a non-smoker. It meant we couldn't enjoy the entertainment or drinks in an evening within the hotel. It's a shame as there's heaters (although not turned on) and seating outside so it would be easy to enforce a non-smoking policy inside and keep everyone happy. That said the bar could be v pleasant is modern clean plenty of seating and the cocktails are great the hotel just need to clear the smog.    We paid about 50% of the advertised and rack rate so we felt we had good value. As other reviewers have said maybe this isn't 5* compared to European standards and it can't compare to some of the boutique hotels or riads in Marrakech which are fab for a romantic stay or short break. However it is a v good quality large modern hotel in a good location with excellent facilities and a great base,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,chester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmi_1
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Helen wrote a review Feb 2013,50,"Clean, friendly and well-run",I'm not normally a fan of all-inclusive holidays but needed a completely relaxing break at a budget price so booked this via TravelZoo. It surpassed all expectations and I would even say it was the best value deal I've ever had. The resort itself is very clean and well-organised and we found the staff very friendly and helpful but not obtrusive. It annoys me when other reviewers criticise somewhere for not being English speaking or have tea-making facilities in rooms. This is a resort in Morrocco where 80-90% of the tourists are French so why should they speak English or adapt to English customs? I have never seen an English resort make announcements in Arabic or French!  We had a quiet room at the back of the resort which was modern ample and comfortable. The food and wine was plentiful and delicious - there is something for everyone. The French-style entertainment in the bar was not to our liking but it was good-hearted and we only went there for pre-dinner cocktails (these are a bit sickly but hey they're free!).  The spa was amazing. The prices are quite high compared to some of the spas in town (I would recommend Easy Spa) but we paid for one of their special deals and with the 20% off coupon we received from the hotel it was good value. The massage was amazing and very professional but ladies be warned that you go topless - best to tell them up front if you are shy about them touching you all over!!  There are two massive outdoor pools - one (with slides) was cold the other pleasantly heated. There are some wonderful cabins to relax in around the pools. There is also a tiny indoor pool as part of the spa but it's about £7 to use it and the free hammam experience doesn't include entrance to the pool.  My tips would be make sure you book all your shuttle journeys into town and back as soon as you arrive there as well as your free evening meal in the Orangerie restaurant as both get booked up very quickly. Also bring warm clothes as although it was warm in the day (February) it was chillly at night and we didn't find the hotel room very warm. The best time to eat in the buffet area is when it first opens as it's not too full then and the food is hotter.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventurousBrit
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kiran wrote a review Feb 2013,30,Un-impressed by Kenzi Agdal Medina,I have to say that I just retuned from Marrakech and I was not impressed with this hotel nor will I return here or recommend to friends. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms very spacious but the staff at the Front desk were not helpful in the least.  I understand that being in a French/Arabic speaking nation it would have been difficult yet I found all the waiters and housekeepers in the hotel extremely helpful and understanding and the front desk completely useless. I am not sure why these people at the front desk are so useless.  The food at the hotel was very dull after the first day we were sick of the food. Lunch and dinner being basically the same thing. Unlike the other guests at the hotel we ventured into the city often and ate at restaurants outside the hotel so we did not have to deal with the pasta and pizza all day everyday.  There is only one restaurant in the hotel that offers a dining experience it was lovely. The service was great but being a set menu you could only eat once there.  I was quite surprised that you had to pay for the use of the indoor pool something which is not stated on the website. And furthermore the lack of being able to communicate with the front desk was very frustrating we had many issues throughout the week.  I was also very disgusted on my final day I always like to tip the gardeners and security guards as they usually don't receive any tips yet I was informed they are not allowed to accept any tips and only certain members of staff are.  If you enjoy eating the same food everyday doing the same thing by the pool everyday then I guess this is the hotel for you. Unfortunately this was not my cup of tea.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiranD587
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,dunwomblin wrote a review Feb 2013,40,Great all-inclusive resort hotel,Just had 4 days here and all the previous reviews are pretty spot on. Very large complex which is well maintained.  Others have mentioned the climate and it's worth mentioning that during the day it was lovely and warm but first thing in the morning (until about 10ish) and after dark it was really cold: 1-2 degrees C so you needed winter clothes for breakfast & dinner.    Pros:    Rooms were big & spacious with good heating/ air-conditioning comfy beds & flat screen TVs (Obviously very limted English TV though)    2 outdoor pools - one was heated and the other massive one was not so is really only for when it's really hot. There were plenty of loungers available but this may be different in the summer.    Staff were very friendly - on the way back to the airport the bell hop negotiated a good 100 dirham deal with a taxi for us.    Free bottled water in room.    House wine was good and included in all-inclusive.    Cons:    Food was OK - lots of salads etc but not much authentic Moroccan fare and what there was looked a bit dubious. Also a little limited unless you like pizza pasta and chips.    We emaled in advance to get 2 adjoining rooms with views of the mountains (as suggested by other reviews). They said that was fine but when we checked in we got 2 rooms at least 20 rooms apart neither with a mountain view. This meant that for the first night my 17 year old daughter was on her own in a room that was in a very dark & dingey corner of the complex which was a little concerning having just arrived. We asked for her to be moved the next day and after some negotiation she ended up a floor lower and about 5 doors away which was better but still not ideal.    The safe in the room was expensive as was the use of the indoor swimming pool - 100 dirhams per visit (~£8).    Both my daughter and I succumbed to bad stomachs by the end of the week - we're not sure whether it was the pool water or the tap water (brushing teeth etc). This is not really the fault of the hotel though.    There was nowhere to get a quiet pre-dinner drink as the only bar was effectively a disco/ club so that at 7pm there was dimmed lighting loud music & people dancing. The pool bar closes as soon as it gets dark so is not really an option.    Finally if you don't have a little French you may struggle as most staff & guests are French speaking. We have basic schoolgirl/boy French so managed to get by OK - without that it could have been a problem.    Other than these niggles it was an great place for a short break and to get a bit of winter sun!,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Marlow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunwomblin

Lovely hotel speedy check in and given a lift to our room on a golf cart. I had emailed the hotel and asked a lot of questions all of which were answered quickly by Abhoune Saadia who also upgraded our room to a Junior Suite for my wifes birthday at no extra cost.    Room was brilliant. Did smell a little funny at first but jusr run all the taps for a few minutes and it soon disspears. Probably only occurs when room hasnt been used for a while. Beds were comfortable balcony lovely fridge in room safe (30 DH per day) and had a great view of the Atlas Mountains. The grounds are all well kept and nice to walk around.    Breakfast lunch and tea where all pleasent experiences. Plenty of food available. My wife is a vegetarian and i was worried by other reviews on here but i need not have been. She found there was plenty to had and we enjoyed the Tagines (eggplant / sweet pototes / lentals all very good). Plenty of chips pizzas salads etc for the kids. Pastas were nice too. The pudding were ace small portons but then you can try lots of them... and i did!!    2 outdoor pools one heated one not. We still found the heated pool a little cool but was still nice to have a dip for an hour then sit in the sun. Drinks in the bars are nice. Whiskey sours being my favourite. Entertainment is good though not my cup of tea and all in french.    Paid 250DH for taxi from airport to hotel. We where ripped off but just paid it as it was late when we arrived. We paid 100DH to return to the airport and between 70-100DH to the town centre.    Great hotel. Would go back again. No negatives at all.

I quick summary:  A spacious heated pool (and another massive pool but that was for summer as the water was freezing)  Lots of sunloungers and very comfortable beds  There is an indoor pool/spa you can pay £10 a day to use but as the weather was beautiful we didn't use it  Hotel staff and the animation team were extremely friendly from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.  The buffet was varied and good quality and wine is served by the bottle at dinner so there is plenty!  There is a schedule of activities with dancing ping pong water aerobics cooking demonstration and in the evening there are dance shows in the bar and games if you want it but the animation team just leave you to relax if you're not interested    The only potential negatives for some people could be:  The resort is mainly French the staff speak English but announcements are mostly in French and evening entertainment is aimed at a French audience  If you stayed more than a week you might get bored of the buffet as although there is a big choice it is mostly the same choice every day  There is music playing by the pool and frequent announcements about activities which might not suit older people who really want to relax.  We were there off season in February and maybe the restaurant and bar could get too congested in peak season  I'll definitely be going back to Club Kenzi as it was absolutely perfect for what I was looking for.,Date of stay: February 2013,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Cuenca,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosieTopp

The entertainment was varied and mostly directed in French however they did try to include everyone.  The only complaint i had was that we had arranged transfers through the Travel company (We booked through Beat the Brochure) however although our flight got in early there was no transfer to meet us. We waited an hour but as it started to get dark we took at taxi at 220 dirhams. When we arrived at the hotel we received a warm welcome and a glass of tea and an invitation letter to the welcome meeting the following day.  When we arrived at the meeting with Rashid from hotels4u & Medhotels he advised that they had collected 2 other passangers by mistake but offered no apology or refund. I asked for confirmation in writing that we had advised of the no show however he was unable to provide this as he ""had not been sent any"". I then asked for confirmation on headed paper but he said he was not allowed to do this.He then said that there had been someone there but we had missed them. This was not the case as we waited one hour and constantly checked the boards of the Reps that were in the arrivals hall. I have raised this with Comet Street Travel Ltd who are still investigating the matter.  It didnt spoil our holiday and the weather was brilliant all week.

We arrived with 2 children a girl and a boy 3 years old twins from Lithuania came 11 a.m.. but we met very warmly offered to go to eat drink and 2 pm we got the room. The room was at the end but very quiet. An area are large well lit. The food is very varied and delicious in restaurant. New national dish is made every day. Waiters are very nice even the pan helps to bring to the table. Morocco's day is every Friday waiters dressed national costumes national dishes but you can also found pasta pizza and more others. The most impressed by the animation team! We were in a lot of hotels in the world but animationion is the best here. If you arrive allone you will feel as you have a lot of friends. Throughout the day they offer a variety of entertainment. We most enjoyed the culinary display shows at 12 o clock. It begins with a national cooking training ends with dancing. Different shows every day 7 days a week. From the children's disco acrobatic performances dances parodies snake shows and belly dancing. We were 10 days but did not want to leave. Vacation gone wonderfully. If you have a few days free be sure go and unwind at the hotel - will not be disappointed!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,625flarebear wrote a review Feb 2013,50,A stunning hotel with every whim catered for!,We booked a 4 night All Inclusive stay at this hotel as a package through Travelzoo. I have been to Marrakech twice before and both times stayed in lovely riads so we decided to try this for a change. I was not disappointed. Although you lose some of the intimacy that a riad offers the grounds are stunning and the rooms are in blocks like riads so has a similar feel but with all the benefits of a hotel.    Our room was overlooking a construction site and I imagine this is because we were not full paying guests but it really didn't bother me and the windows have good sound proofing. Tip - ask for a room that looks in towards the hotel not towards the outside.    I asked for a double room and we had 2 single beds pushed together - it was not a double bed!    All staff were very polite but the reception staff were a little less so. Food and drink excellent although as with any AI hotel the food does start to come around again quite quickly. My tip is this - you will be asked if you want wine with your lunchtime and evening meal we asked for the wine menu and chose one and added the cost to our room but if you order the house wine it's free! This also applies to the other restaurant which is not part of the AI deal.    We had a meal in the other restaurant as part of our deal and it was very nice. Lovely decor and atmosphere. Have had better Moroccan food though.    The location is quite far from the souks and you will need to get a bus or taxi into this area. The hotel supplies hourly buses (apart from lunchtimes) but we just missed one so got a taxi.    There is plenty to do at this hotel. The Animation Team are very good at keeping you entertained.    I can also thoroughly recommend a massage at the spa. Not too pricey and very relaxing. The Hammam was not what I expected just a sauna and steam room.    I must stress though that these are just niggles but the hotel is really stunning and I would thoroughly recommend it.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Brighton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/625flarebear

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Vincent R wrote a review Jan 2013,50,beautiful property,Very nice hotel on vast grounds and fairly close to the medina and airport. Rooms are amazing high ceilings mine was on the ground floor with a terrace. I only slept one night here before I went to the medina. Since I was getting off a very long flight and in a completely new country to me I thought this all-inclusive was the easiest solution. And indeed it was. The food was good wine is so-so. This place is ideal if you have kids. A lot of Moroccans vacation here.  Taxis well... it's Morocco. anything between 5 to 40 euros. I was so tired after my flight I paid 20 euros.

For the price we paid we got such good value for money including the bar/nightclub where the entertainment was great on the one night we stayed in. The staff were very friendly and I have to say very accommodating on any requests we had. It's a beautiful hotel very clean and although we didn't do any of the spa treatments they all looked very good value for money.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,susan a wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Wonderful,Had a lovely time there last week. The staff are friendly and couldn't be more helpful! The animation team were always laughing and their cooking demos were hilarious. Wish we'd ventured to the entertainment sooner were cautious as we thought it might be a bit Hi Di Hi and we had other things we wanted to do. Food in the dining room was plentiful and varied enough not to be boring. Even the pickiest eater would have found it difficult not to like something. The previous comments about the pasta station puzzled us as even though you might have to queue sometimes the pasta was cooked/heated accordingly to each individuals request. The omelettes at breakfast were cooked fresh to order. The wine was ok and the beer pretty good. Our room was kept really clean on one occasion we had to ask for towels as they hadn't been replaced. The bed for me was a little on the hard side but it was fine for my husband. We didn't find language a problem as I speak French but most of the waiting staff spoke sufficient English which is actually their third language.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hampshire, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanaG5157VP
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LAW34205 wrote a review Jan 2013,40,"Beautiful hotel, great short break.",Overall we had a great time (couple aged 24). We stayed 4 nights and that was probably about the right amount of time.    The room was lovely very spacious/clean/balcony and lovely bathroom.  Pools were amazing too - great bed things which a couple/family can share with pillows etc.  Drinks were always available (alcoholic too) and we took wine/coffee back to the room which was fine.  Food was good on the whole - a bit repetitive sometimes but lots of great Moroccan tagines and fresh fruit etc.  The downside for me was how quiet it was in the evenings lots of funny entertainment things but not a great deal to do once that stopped at 11/11:30ish. We went to Pacha once but that was also dead and completely overpriced. Marrakech was also overrated in our opinion - local's all seemed dodgy rather than friendly and would grab you to make you buy things. Also could not find anywhere to have a glass of wine with dinner (which was probably to be expected in an islamic country - but disappointing nonetheless).    Would 100% recommend the hotel for a weekend away if you just want a short break lazing around the pool and in bed!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CoCox_London_Travel wrote a review Jan 2013,40,5-day stay,I have just returned from a 5-day stay at Kenzi Club Agdal and had a nice relaxing break.    I booked the holiday to unwind and the spa and service of the staff helped me do exactly that. The food is good with a wide variety - we were never hungry and always spoilt for choice.    The hotel is a very nice complex and the grounds around the hotel are lovely. However we are English speaking only and this restricted the amount of interaction we were able to have with all staff - most speak only French and Arabic.    The downfalls to the hotel are the condition of the rooms - ours look tired and was never cleaned well. We were always short of supplies (ie we were in a twin room with clearly two ppl staying in the room however often left with one towel or one item of toiletries when we expected two (ie shower gel shampoo toilet roll etc). We also noticed a cosmetic item of ours was missing once we came back so would defo recommend locking your items away if u are not in the room!!    The spa is fab and the staff will go out of their way to help you. Have had many massages in different countries but the massages and facilities here are fab. The heated pool is a good extra but you will need to pay to use all facilities including the gym (which is a shame as this is usually free in hotels).    Good short stay but not sure would return to the hotel or Marrakech.

Super hotel very clean with beautifully kept gardens. The rooms are built riad-style with a central garden. Ours was a bit smelly but it was changed on request. It gets very cold at night in January but the heating in the bedroom was excellent. There were 2 pools one was warm and the other freezing! The staff were delightful helpful and polite. Food was varied and plentiful with wine and drinks at lunch and dinner. The cocktails in the bar were lethal! The hotel provided a shuttle bus into the centre and we explored the central square and the souk. We expected to be pestered by the traders but it was fine.We went on a tour of the city gardens and a ride in a caleche with Abdullah who was a wonderful guide and very informative.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Bettie42 wrote a review Jan 2013,50,GREAT stay! Recommended,"I travelled with 5 friends and stayed here 14th-18th January. From the minute we walked into the foyer we were treated with courtesy and smiles. We were given sweet Moroccan Tea as we arrived which was welcome as we have been travelling since 5am.  Check in was smooth and we were told about being able to use the Moroccan Restaurant for one free meal during our stay More of that later.  We were told about use of the spa facilities. The only thing that might have been helpful was a map of the resort.  We were taken to your rooms in Rhiad Dalia so not far from the bar restaurant and pools. Then we went straight to lunch. The restaurant was fabulous - a good selection of fresh salads tajines wonderful breads delightful deserts and a fabulous pasta station where you could choose what you wanted in a sauce which type of pasta then it was all cooked freshly for you. Wine was brought in a bottle and left at the table for us and we were waited on by delightful friendly and helpful staff.  A welcome meeting with the rep Rachid was brief and to the point and we booked a 1/2 day trip with a guide which took in two gardens including Yves Saint Laurent then a horse and carriage ride around the walls of the old city and then a trip into the Souk where we went to an ancient chemist. The guide was invaluable and helpful and friendly and I can thoroughly recommend the trip. For £22 it was great value. The best piece of advice from that trip? ""When crossing the roads - just walk. Don't stop just walk!""  The rest of the day was spent in the glorious sunshine by the pools on the great sheltered comfy beds.  The cocktails in the bar were immense and very tasty - I can personally recommend the Strawberry Dacquiries  The animation team work hard in the pre-dinner slot getting people on the dance floor and they are all once again very friendly.  Our room was very comfy and with effective heating which was required at night. The bathroom was fine with a plentiful supply of boiling hot water. The towels are changed every day IF you put them on the floor. If they are hung up it means you are happy to use them again.  We had one free meal at the Moroccan Restaurant which normally costs 100 Dirham (about £7.50!) I thought this was excellent. We were the only people in there and Mustafa our host was charming. Tasty Moroccan soup a fish dish Lamb Tagine Oranges then sweet pastries. Our evening was serenaded by the musician and helped along by a couple of bottles of delicious House wine.  All in all I cannot fault this hotel - excellent food; friendly helpful staff; lovely pool and of course the all important sun.  A trip with a guide is worth it and so is the trip to the garden of Yves Saint Laurent.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,nigel j wrote a review Jan 2013,50,LAID BACK BREAK,"My wife and I stayed at the Kenzi Club Agdal in Marrakech between 7th and 11th of January 2013.  Check in went smoothly and we were given Moroccon tea as we waited for the golf buggy to transport us to our room. We were allocated room 206: (A BRONSE GRADED ROOM). This was sufficient clean well maintained with a shower bath tv two single beds and a small ground floor balcony. The room unlike some was close to the SPA and not far from the main action. The room was cleaned with fresh bed linen daily.  The location is very quiet. There are no shops or restaurants outside the large hotel complex in fact it is like a dried up field.  The hotel caters for all ages including: children's nursery spa indoor pool two out door pools (one heatedthe other not) outside and inside bar snacks sunbeds and an animation team providing entertainment in the day and evening. The dancers and music in the evening is worth watching.  The weather is rather strange at this time of year. In the morning and evening it is like an early spring temperature in England. However between 11am and 5pm the climate is very warm with unbroken sunshine. Take a light coat for morning and evening!  The restraunt for breakfast lunch and dinner is hygenic no (FLY'S OR INSECT'S). However there is a well fed ginge cat roaming about. I think he get's bored being on guard.  Although there is a shortage of English speaking staff they are very polite in their attitude towards you. If you leave food or any drink at your meals you can be comfortable leaving it and just getting what you want next.  There is one very big problem the hotel has to get a grip of and eliminate. Kenzi Club Agdal read this for your own benefit. If you look through recent reviews you will see this marked.  The shuttle service to town with the guide is not for the hotel customers benefit but a little man not even trained to explain any Moroccon culture.I got the impression as did the recent review of another person that all this guide wanted too do is take you to his friend's shops and get you to purchace over priced goods and get you back at the hotel quickly. He also asks for tips when you are waiting for the shuttle. If you say ""no"" he stands near you pretending to sulk. He then asks you again.  If you want to purchace anything you can haggle at the mini market at the hotel on a Friday.  We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and thought the 5* rating was justified. We would like to go back. However we would want to go in a small group to take advantage of the atmosphere.

Beer and food was fine accommodation excellent however the spirits were totally shocking. We tried a few cocktails which tasted like combination of how you would experiment with fizzy drink combinations as a kid. I then thought I would play safe and drink straight whiskey. Prince Albert was the brand I was given well all I can say is that it tasted like it came from where Prince Albert had his piercing. Cannot believe that they can pay so much attention to the decor and the food and then serve up watered down warm tasteless cocktails and whiskey that tastes no better than the simple linctus I was guzzling over Christmas when I was laid low by a nasty chest infection - what a let down! How did u get 4 stars on trip advisor? Also there is only one bar open - although very classy decor is home to the teenybopper disco mob so loud thumping music annoying buntlines style redcoats to accompany the shizene drinks - not my idea of bliss.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helmutnumber15
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lemonpie1978 wrote a review Jan 2013,40,Good but with some issues,My husband and I stayed for four nights from 2nd January.    We found check-in to be smooth and our luggage was swiftly loaded onto a golf buggy and we were shown to our room. We found the staff to be courteous and efficient at reception at all times. In fact we found the majority of the staff to be friendly and polite. We don't speak much French but found that everyone spoke English with the exception of our cleaning lady.    We did find the French a bit of a problem especially when announcements were made only in French and we could not understand what was going on. It would have been nice if they were repeated in English.    Our room was nice and the beds comfortable. The bathroom was a little shabby round the edges with a couple of chips out of the bath and sometimes the towels looked like they had seen better days but it was clean. Our room was kept clean but as mentioned by one other reviewer it wasn't always cleaned in the morning and we came back to the room at 5.30pm to find the floor still wet from just having been mopped. It didn't cause us any problems particularly though.    We had room 508 and if you get allocated this room and like a lie in then I'd suggest asking for a different one. We were right next door to what was obviously a cleaning cupboard and the cleaning staff were in and out of it from about 8am clattering about chatting etc and woke us up every morning. If you're an early riser it probably won't bother you.    We found the dining room to be chaotic but this was largely down to it still being school holidays when we went and there were hundreds of children running about. You don't have to wait to be seated in the dining room so when you first arrive you don't really know what is going on. Just find yourself a table and if you are really lucky a waiter might come and ask if you want a drink. Or then again maybe not! Most meals we just helped ourselves to soft drinks from the machine by the buffet and had no contact with waiting staff at all. I don't eat red meat and found lunch and dinner to be a bit of a struggle - I also admit to being a bit of a fussy eater. The food was pretty much the same every meal time and I ended up eating pizza for lunch every day and pasta most evenings. The wait for the fresh cooked pasta can be quite long but if you want something hot to eat it's one of your only options. One night my entire dinner was pretty much stone cold.    The pool area is nice and the heated pool is a nice temperature. No one was in the other pool because it was very cold. We didn't use the gym or indoor pool because quite frankly I wasn't prepared to pay for them.    We enjoyed the weather and sunbathed every day. I wasn't aware that it would be quite so cold in the evenings though. We were wearing coats and scarves sometimes while in the bar as it wasn't warm enough to take them off. Pack something warm for the evenings.    I read in another review that the evening entertainment was 'stunning'. Well I have to strongly disagree!!! We sat through five minutes of the show on the first evening and managed ten minutes the second evening. After that we didn't bother. The first show consisted of a big white rabbit lots of kids and some dodgy music. The second started more promisingly with a dance routine to Mama Mia but then went downhill with a very dodgy comedy sketch which started to involve members of the audience joining in and having to re-do their bit until they got it right (all in French). The bar had no atmosphere whatsoever and we returned to our room fairly early to watch films rather than sit there.    We went on an organised 'Souks and Squares' tour which cost £15 each. We basically followed our guide round the souks and pretty much only saw the back of him. We were told it wouldn't be an opportunity to shop but our guide seemed to have other ideas and we came to the conclusion that he was dropping us off at various friend's shops. We went to a carpet shop where we were told they would tell us more about the process of making them but it was basically a sales pitch showing us different rugs. Having said that we would never have found our own way round the souks. They are huge a maze of streets that you will just get lost in on your own. The guide was worth it for that alone really. There are lots of people and it's pretty chaotic. I preferred the (relative) calm of the hotel.    It sounds like I think this hotel is terrible but it wasn't. I just think you need to have realistic expectations and depending on what you want from it you might want to go out and about a bit more in the evenings (we're lazy so we didn't bother). We enjoyed some winter sun and a relaxing few days.,Date of stay: January 2013,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Purfleet, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lemonpie1978

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,bbgtpog wrote a review Jan 2013,30,Good hotel but poor in key areas,We went over Xmas 2012 - family of 4 kids 13 & 9 – ALL INCLUSIVE  Our rating & summary with details comments below  Reception 2/5  Management 1/5  Guided tour 1/5  Room 4/5  Spa 4/5  Pools 3/5  Food Hall 2/5  Bar 3/5  Activities 5/5    In summary it’s a nice looking hotel with lovely grounds good facilities & very good staff on the whole but fails to justify a 5* rating. Do we recommend it…yes if you can get a good deal but No if other “5*” hotels are offering similar prices. A pleasant & relaxing week but not the 5* experience we had paid & were hoping for.    Reception  Arrival was pleasant enough buy as we got a welcoming smile & a cup of Moroccan tea which was very nice.  Check –in was a bit clumsy as we arrived at 2:30pm & they did not seem to have a room allocated for us. The staff also looked miserable & unwelcoming….first impressions count right?? As we were hungry we asked them to sort it out while we went to get some food where service was just finishing.  We were taken to our room in a golf buggy which was fine but it was like an express introduction to the hotel what is where (hardly 5*). The guy who dropped us was not particularly cheerful & dropped our bags in the room & left in a huff. Maybe he was expecting a tip….god only knows. Here you might think its mean not to give a tip but my feeling is I had paid a lot of money for the hotel & given that we were there for less than 1 hour my 1st impression were not good & the guy was not exactly friendly.  ROOM  Anyway…we had a family room & it was a good size with 2 TV’s 2 toilets but only 1 sink which was in the main bathroom. It overlooked the tennis courts with the Atlas mountains in the background so very nice. The finish in the room however was not very good & the walls were painted with a marble effect….not real marble. Acceptable but again not 5*    Note. There is a safe in the room but you have to pay for it. I cannot remember the last time I went to a 5* hotel where I had to pay to use the safe….not only that we were not told this when we checked-in so we had to go back to reception pay the money (200 dirhams) to use it….ridiculous    There was plenty of storage so no problem there but no iron or tea making facilities. You may argue it’s a 5* hotel so why would you want to make your own tea but I like to have the option in case you down want to walk to the bar…I will come to that soon    There is no room service so you have to go to the main food hall or the 1 Moroccan restaurant which was never full    The rooms were cleaned well enough but never on time. 3 days in a row we had to call reception at 5pm to get the rooms cleaned. On the 4th day it was 5:30pm & I went and complained to the manager who apologized quote: “we are very busy”. 1 hour & another phone call to reception later they poor girl who did our room turned up. She was clearly not too happy & we felt a bit sorry for her as not her fault…its just poor management. As far as we were concerned we left the room at approx. 9am & its reasonable to expect the room to be cleaned by 5pm    Spa  The Spa was nice & there were lots of treatment to spoil yourself & at a reasonable price which was a pleasant surprise. The staff were also friendly.    Gym  Yes there is a gym not very big but good enough. Unfortunately it is in the Spa building which is in the hotel grounds but as its in the Spa building it is not free for guests staying at the hotel. You have to pay 200 dirhams per person to use it for the week. What a cheek.    The spa also has the only indoor pool which again is charges 10 dirhams per hour to use. We were stunned to find out.    Pools  Of the 2 free pools thankfully 1 (the smaller pool) was heated so 99% of the guests used this. The main pool was a good size & had the waterslides but it was so cold. Why they could not heat this remains a mystery…cost savings no doubt.    Bar  There is only 1 bar which is open in the evenings come dance hall floor in this hotel & its not classy at all. There is no restriction on smoking so if you do not smoke & wanted to sit for a quiet drink with the kids its just impossible to relax & enjoy (this is where the tea making facilities in the rooms would be useful)    There is a bar near the pool which is open during the day. I don’t know why but every time we asked for coffee or English tea they simply should not serve up a decent HOT cup. We had to ask them each time to heat up the water. That said the bar staff were friendly & were happy to make you drinks all day    Food Hall  This was by far the worst experience I have had at a “5*” hotel. I know it was all inclusive & & know there are certain dishes they have to serve to keep everyone happy i.e. chips pasta pizza salad but the hot food was never hot. Unless you queued for some time at the pasta station or turned up as they opened you stood a good chance of getting a hot meal otherwise they would make the food & put in the bowls/plates for you to serve.    Breakfast was always cold (eggs tomatoes beans). Once the tea pots were finished tough & the same was true for the hot milk. On the 3rd day my wife complained to the management who said they agreed & would try to put things right. The next day it was same as usual. If you ended up towards the end of the breakfast lunch or dinner then it was a case of having to eat what was left as never once did I see them re-stock any food.    If you are a vegetarian you will struggle for the week as I did. My wife & kids are not vegetarians but even they were not impressed with the quality and the variety of the food. Each day they had a food theme i.e. Continental Italian etc…but essentially it was the same dishes as the day before with the 1 or 2 changes.    Avtivities  This is one of the few areas where the hotel did well. The entertainment team always happy friendly & welcoming. They laid on archery basketball table tennis badminton football boules tournaments & were also active in holding belly dancing Zumba water aerobics & many other exercises throughout the day.    Kids club  There is a kids club but I can not comment on it as neither of our kids went but I did see them around the hotel doing face painting & other activities & the kids seemed happy enough.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Crawley, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbgtpog
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,BenKates wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Great Team Great Spirits Great Dancers,"We had a wonderful vacation in this property for 8 nights from 21st Dec. Reading the reviews there were some (mis)apprehensions regarding few aspects but after coming back we can confidently recommend this property to anyone.    PROPERTY AND STAY: Check-in was smooth rooms were clean and the property was constantly being cleaned and maintained. We were 'not' upgraded to a suite though this was our first time to Morocco too (did not matter though as the rooms were spacious enough). The gardens and pathways and pools were always spotlessly clean.    FOOD AND DRINKS: Food was plenty and drinks were flowing all the time. Variety could be a question for some but for light eaters like us there was enough variety. Every night there was a 'theme' plus the regular fare of tagines pastas pastas and salads. Presentation was excellent (we were there during Christmas). Spirits might have been a bit watered down but that took care of the need to drink more without conking out.    SERVICES: Everyone was friendly and talking (even though we do not know French or more than a couple of words in Arabic) but the smiles made up for a lot of language gap. A small portion of the service staff could actually speak in passable English and always were helpful in getting around. So many of them were coming and greeting and asking if everything is ok.    ANIMATION TEAM: Now this team scores highest of all. They were always around and we had to wonder if they are ever not on duty. They were in the morning having breakfast with guests in the afternoon managing kid clubs belly dancing lessons zumba classes cookery lessons archery French bowling and other activities in the evening dancing with the guests a kids dance session at 8:30 and then at 9:30 putting up full-fledged shows - different each day. When they would practice or how can they dance after being on duty for over 12 hours is a wonder. Especially without letting down their smiles or rhythm - ever. And the dances were amazing too - full-fledged choreographed and well produced shows. The 'Michael Jackson' Belly Dancing Ropeway dancing and Stilt bits were awesome and absolutely brilliant though each of the dancers were dazzling with their own 'special' bits. There were also special day time shows like 'Santa on a Camel' giving presents to kids followed by “flash mob” Gangam Style dancing. Every show was amazing (Did not like the Circus much though). The success of the shows was evident from the fact that there were hundred-odd guests dancing after the show is over (sort of an everyday ritual). Excellent talent and amazing spirit. If the purpose of Animation team is to keep up the spirit of guests they were extremely successful in doing that. Hats off guys and girls! - if we would ever come back it would be for you.    SPA: Very good and reasonably priced (compared to prices in UK) - we used 12 different treatments/ facilities (between the two adults) and they were consistently good.    TIPS AND SUGGESTIONS: The hotel could have included the safety lockers and gym/ indoor pool within the pricing. Though the amounts were not much it was annoying to be told 'you have to pay'. Marrakech in general demands that you like to bargain though we do not like to at all. Even for petty things there was a need to bargain and end up not knowing whether the price is right or not. Hence our comfort zone was the resort itself and Carrefour (no bargains at all). We also had the misfortune of going to Fantasia at Chez Ali - the worst 4 hours we spent in Marrakech - first walk through some cheap film sets sit for dinner while being constantly pestered for money by incompetent and noisy dance groups then the 'grand show' - meaning 200 people walking around the arena for 35 minutes 5 guys in horses riding and shooting in the air a dozen times 3 guys doing the mount/dismount from running horses and some incompetent dancer doing what was supposedly a belly dance but turned out to be gunny sack on a treadmill. - absolute waste of time and money.    We totally regret that instead of giving money to this pathetic excuse of a mis-show we could have given the money (about 380Dhs a head + tips - aka ""shut-the-f*** up-money to stop the annoying dancers"") to the completely deserving Animation team in Kenzi Club.",Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenKates

As another person has mentioned we were also asked to come here because the hotel we originally booked had closed for renovation... thank goodness!! this Hotel was far superior. From the minute we arrived our every need was catered for staff collected our luggage from the taxi we were given welcome drinks and then taken to our rooms on a golf buggy. We had standard adjoining rooms for my family of five. The rooms were great huge huge double bed and a sofa bed made up for my 6 year old which was perfectly adequate. The rooms were serviced everyday with lovely touches of petals on the beds and shapes made with the covers. We were there for Christmas and I was unsure how the hotel would celebrate this feast day?? I needn't have worried beautiful tasteful decorations a fabulous fun afternoon on christmas eve with santa on a camel! and a present for all the children a wonderful evening of cocktails and food and when we returned to our room a surprise chocolate santa on the bed!  All the staff were very attentive and friendly my elder children made great friends with them. They all work very hard and always with a smile. the Animation team are excellent and the quality of the shows is superb especially the 'Nutcracker' on Christmas eve really magical.  The heated pool was a real bonus as the other larger pool was really really cold ( well it is december). My youngest child spent the majority of the week in this pool.  The Spa is excellent and so is the hairdresser.  All in all we had a marvelous week we were sad to leave and i am sure that we shall return.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Cromer, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonbY2850QP

Got to our deluxe room which was nice cosy and very clean however we did notice that the fridge did not work we had no shower curtain and the tv was not working my husband paid for the safe for the week but then we realized it was broken and the began to realize the air con was not working we rang reception and reported everything they very quickly apologised and had us moved to a suite across the hall it was stunning 2 rooms 2 bathrooms and twice the size for no extra cost our maid kept the room very clean and if you needed extra's she was always on hand clean linen and clean towels everyday.  Dining was incredible breakfast was from 6am until 10am so much to choose from all fresh and plenty to eat.  Lunch was from 12pm until 2.30pm and again the food was great all sorts to choose from and loads of it and all fresh.  Evening dinner was from 7pm until 10pm and again fab choices and fresh with different themed nights wine and beer and soft drinks as much as you want the puddings were lovely with so much choice the staff were happysmiling and always there to help you.  Snack time was mid morning and mid afternoon cakespancakes doughnuts panini's etc all very good although beware off the bee's they came out when all the sweet stuff was uncovered my daughter freaked!!! still had the pancakes and strawberry sauce though!!!  The bar was a nice place with entertainment every night the kids have a great time dancing as do the adults because they get everyone involved waiters get all your drinks if you want them to or you can go to the bar for us or if you are a non smoker sometimes it got to smoky and your eyes got itchy and your clothes began to smell but unfortunatly there is not much you can do about that other than leave every night they had something different on the animation team were brilliant and involved everyone.  The resort is a large complex with plenty to do they have 2 pools 1 is cold and the other is warm/hot for us the cold pool was to cold and you could not use it and the warm pool was to hot and made you feel sick and it felt like you were in a bath in our opinion they need to change that especially as the kids slides are in the cold pool but nobody could use it otherwise you would have a heart attack or freeze to death!!!!  The sports activitys were great and with lots off them there programm ran all day from early morning until late afternoon the aquasize was great twice a day everyday my husband and i did it a few times they had so much going on even in december you always had something to do if you wanted it plenty of sun loungers and towels we were so very lucky we were there 16th december and the weather was in the 80's we were not expecting it to be quite so hothowever in the evenings it drops and is pretty chilly i advise warmer clothes and jumper or cardigans etc it does get nippy.  Marrakesh is a great place to visit the square is great we went to town only the once we had a guide simply because if you don't everyone hassles you and drags you everywhere our hotel supplies the shuttle and guide however he still wanted money when we were done for showing you things he did take us to places we would never have seen especially the spice place we went to riads and took picture's and to the square to see the snake charmers we went in the day time as we felt with kids it is safer.  Our whole week away was greatmade fab by the constant sunshine!!  The only other thing that got to us a bit was the lack of english speaking the staff new the basics but on announcements everything was in french and needed to be said in english aswell we guessed what was being said but unless you speak french then sometimes it was pretty hard to understand.  All in all amazing value and a great winter destinaton we have also been in the summer and it was way to busy and way to hot!!!,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Ollerton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynParky

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Julia B wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Loved it,We stayed for 4 nights just before Christmas. The food was excellent with a varied and wide choice. The hotel was impeccably clean. Tucked away in a corner is a small children's area with goats and chickens lovely for little ones (although we didn't have any with us). Only one pool is heated but as the hotel was quiet that was fine with us. The staff were extremely helpful and (as previous reviewers have commented) the wine bottle is left on the table. The courtesy bus into the town and the souks is excellent. The hotel only change your money one way and wont change dihrams back into sterling. Also be warned that once through passport control at the airport on your way back you cannot spend dirhams.    The souks are fabulous and if (when) you get lost ask a shopkeeper the way. They will point you in the right direction without offering to guide you or charge you. As dusk settles grab yourself a seat in one of the panoramic cafes around the square and simply watch the madness descend. It's about £3 for two mint teas so hardly expensive and well worth it. we loved it and would return time and time again to both Marrakech and the same hotel.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Northampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyJuliaB
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jacqueline H wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Great value Great service Great experience,I have recently returned from a trip to Marrakech during which time I stayed at the Kenzi Club Agdal Madina. this was a truly enjoyable stay. This was mainly because it was a very large complex set in beautiful gardens. The hotel is of an excellent standard and far exceeded my expectation based on what I had paid for the trip.    I had a five day holiday in December and the weather was lovely temperatures were approx 75* and this complimented the excellent facilities three large swimming pools a gym a studio for massage and lots of quiet areas to sit and read a book.    I highly recommend this hotel its vast so big we were taken to our room in a golf buggy.  I found the food menu to be varied and had something for everyone. i spoke to one guest who criticized the food saying it was not as good as Egypt but I could not fault it. I suggest he try Egypt next time which will be twice the price. some people are never happy!    The staff are also lovely and went out of their way to accommodate us in every way.    I was on an all inclusive deal and this included a special meal in the Moroccan restaurant which had to be pre booked it was a lovely experience and gave a true reflection on traditional Moroccan culture. i think you may have guessed I am a very happy traveler.,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Liverpool, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieH919
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Meg H wrote a review Dec 2012,40,Interesting short break,The hotel was clean with strong dramatic arcitechture making it very atmospheric. On arrival with my daughter and baby grandson staff were very helpful - it was our first time in Morocco and my 8 month old grandsons first trip abroad.  ROOMS  we were tired when we arrived and taken by buggy to our room - to find that someone was already in there! We were then given a room which was nice and probably superior to what was originally allocated (don't know this for sure as we never went in the first room) two days later we were requested to move by the manager due to 'technical problems'. This was inconvenient due to having to pack and all the things associated with a baby but what was really annoying was then waiting 50 minutes after packing to be taken to the new room during which time we could not settle the baby as we thought we were moving shortly  and this was cutting into our holiday time. It was never clear why we had to move - the room we originally had was lovely and although we were moved to a similar one it was slightly shabbier and out of the sun. I had requested a kettle in the room to sterilise and prepare the baby's food  and to let me know if this wasn't possible (I had a travel kettle I could have brought). As I never got a response back I assumed there would be a kettle - when there wasn't one I asked and was told to go and buy one from the shop down the road! This was largely troublesome because of the baby - in general I would say the rooms were very adequate - espcially the upgrades    RESTAURANT - the food was plentiful and varied and I felt the pasta  pancake and pizza stations added to the variety. I don't eat meat but there was plenty of vegetable options and lovely salads and bread. It was a bit hit and miss whether you got a clean high chair or not but we were always helped by Khalid - a lovely young man - very sweet with the baby and cleaned and sterilised the high chair and was generally very attentive. Wine and water and soft drinks were readily available. We also ate one night in the specialist Morrocon restaurant which was very atmospheric and there was a musician which the baby was fascinated by !    POOL AND BAR - we mostly took coffee here which was fine but I wasn't impressed with the one and only G&T I had - it was served without ceremony by a grumpy looking girl and tasted flat and sugary. I think if you are prepared to work at getting it right the staff will go along with it but I couldn't be bothered . It was fabulous round the pools with cabanas and sunbeds.    SPA - the spa and indoor pool were lovely - I had a package which consisted of a facial body massage and reflexologie - and it was really  good - not particularly cheap but certainly no more expensive than anything in England    KIDS CLUB- you had to pay to use this but the facility was good and I wasn't sure if you could use it without paying if you stayed with your child    OVERALL- really enjoyed it - the above review is about improvement and communication - not about reasons not to go there - the baby survived and now expects everyone to wave at him and kiss his hand back in England - he was made a real fuss of everywhere,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"St Ives, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/728megh
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Barnesy73 wrote a review Dec 2012,40,"Nice resort, friendly staff, lovely upgrade","Overall we really liked the resort. We were greeted by a tour rep at the hotel and had to fill out some forms and have the usual talk before we could check in. When we checked in we were very pleased with a free upgrade to a suite as we were ""1st time visitors to Marrakech""    The room was very nice with two TVs and two bathrooms along with a lounge area and a patio outside. Food was very nice and although slightly ""samey"" by day4 there was a lot to chose from and the drinks were flowing (especially beer and wine). You cannot get spirits in the restuarant and you need to walk to the bar and bring that kind of drink back.    There was a conference on while we were there and the DJ was awful during the day around the pool. It was 1990's Club 18-30 level noise (all in French) which I used to love but a repetitive CD with a bloke shouting over it was painful especially after a few drinks the night before    Evening entertainment in the bar was average and the ""Animation"" team need to understand that not everyone wants to dance with the (like Butlins) to Gangam style 6 times a night and also that NO means NO - it is not acceptable to try and drag women that dont want to dance onto the dance floor!!    We went out into the town but didn't stay too long. As soon as you get out of the taxi you are mobbed by locals who want to be your guide sell you something or try to pick pocket you. I am over 6 ft and 17 stone and it was inimidating for me let alone my fiancee and her parents. Some people we met there said the deeper into town you got the safer and more authentic it became but the main square was really hectic!    Maybe it's a cultutal difference about personal space but my main moan about Marrackech was the men are too hands on with foreign women although do back off when confronted and asked to stop (eventually!)

We were all so impressed with the value for money this break suppled. We paid for hotel transfers beforehand which were excellent. When we arrived we were greeted with hot mint tea and upgraded to a suite each without even asking. Huge double bed lovely bathroom and a second loo. All of the staff were friendly cheerful and helpful at all times. The hotel rooms restaurants toilets swimming pools bars and gardens are all spotless. The main restaurant is excellent with so much choice. I really don't understand some of the reviews which criticize the food. At the pasta station the chef will willing make a pasta dish just for you where you pick out the ingredients! There was always so much choice we never knew where to start. There are excellent sun bathing booths with loads of cushions. The water in the main swimming pool was very cold but the pool by the bar was a little better still it is winter. My only critsims would be that the animation team (althought lovely people) tone it down a bit around the pool. The sound system is much too loud. There was always entertainment of an evening with some excellent dancing but again they need to tone it down a notch. It's a shame the hotel doesn't have a quiet bar but that is just nit picking. There is a free shuttle to Marrakech which saves bothering with taxi drivers. All in all this is an excellant hotel with lovely staff and amazing value for money.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Nickie E wrote a review Dec 2012,40,Unbeatable Value For Money,Just returned from a 5 night stay at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina with 22 colleagues and their partners. Whilst the resort is not 5 star in my opinion it's a very good 4 star with excellent facilities from archery to volley ball and fantastic staff. The rooms are meticulously clean and the surrounding grounds which are lovely and bordered by olive trees are very well tended. The choice of 2 outdoor pools which whilst not such an issue in December is I guess a real bonus in the height of the season with 1 of them more family focused. There was a wide variety of food available and an onsite Moroccan speciality restaurant which we didn't try as it was a set menu - 100 dirhams (approx £8) cover charge and open everyday except Friday. The Spa with it's own indoor pool was very tranquil and offered a good variety of fairly priced treatments. The free shuttle buses in to town was really handy but remember to book. Also a hop on hop off red bus stops outside at 10.30am which gives you access to a couple of different routed tours (only downside is that you'll probably have to get a cab back to the hotel - around 100 dirhams - as it only stops at Kenzi 3 times a day). The all inclusive concept suited us perfectly but be warned that this only extends to 11.30pm so does not include drinks in the nightclub. Only other gripes were that you have to pay for using the in-room safety deposit box and that there aren't tea and coffee making facilities. However we had a great time and I think that Kenzi woudl suit all types of travellers and offers fantastic value for money,Date of stay: December 2012,Trip type: Traveled on business,"Steyning, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickieE281

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SPANISHSUE wrote a review Nov 2012,30,Not really a 5 Star,I stayed in this hotel for a long weekend at the end of November. On arrival check in is quick with attentive staff and you are given a Mint Tea whilst checking in! The hotel is spread over a large complex which can mean a bit of a walk to your rooms however there are Golf Buggys that can take you to the main areas!  The rooms are tastefully decorated with very comfortable beds. However for a 5 star i expected a complete set of toiletries and not just a small shampoo and bath gel and was disappointed to find there were no tea/coffee making faciities in the room!  We were on an all inclusive and although the food was o.k once again it wasn't up to a 5 star standard! Also i may add if you went to any meal within half a hour of the restaurant closing then a lot of food was not available!  There is a disco bar but this was basically the evening entertainment maybe because we went out of season there were no shows!  The pool area is good....with 2 pools of which one is heated both with ample sunbeds! The pool bar wasn't the most salubrious place as everything seemed to be covered with flies!  Overall for the price we paid it was good but maybe their star rating needs to be looked at!,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Benalmadena, Spain",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPANISHSUE

Room was huge as was the bed lovely bathroom and plenty of hot water at all times. Everywhere spotlessly clean  gardens are beautifully kept. The restaurant offered something for everyone we are both veg salad lovers and have have never been anywhere where the choice was so plentiful. Had no complaints about the wine beer or the cocktails. one very small moan  the flies. You could not sit and eat outside without being pestered but hardly the fault of the hotel. just make sure you bring insect repellent.Would definitely come back again had a lovely holiday thank you.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"West Mersea, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancesK357
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DavidM186299 wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Relaxed resort ideal for families,We went to the Agdal Medina in half-term as a family of 4 with two teenagers to get some autumn sun. We had a very enjoyable stay. The staff were very friendly everyone from reception to the gardeners say 'bonjour' and smile as they pass. I didn't feel - as is sometimes the case in resorts in lower income countries - that everyone was out for a tip in return for doing something for you.    Our room - a suite for 4 - was very spacious the bathroom with bath shower area double sink toilet and bidet was huge and we had a separate second toilet which was a big help. The beds were really comfortable and the double bed was bigger than normal. The standard of cleanliness was high and the room was cleaned thoroughly every day.    The food was good. We'd heard some complaints there wasn't a lot of choice which we couldn't understand. There were a good variety of staple items on every day - such as omelettes in the morning pizzas at lunch and tagines at night - plus different themed meals each day including Spanish Italian Moroccan and Seafood. Our kids can be fussy and there was plenty for them including fries breads salads pancakes for breakfast and so on. I like trying lots of different things on buffets (5 plates on my first meal) and there was enough to keep me interested. The food quality was good and the stations were kept well supplied. We drank the local beer and house rose (Morrocan) and both were perfectly good.    The pools were spacious with a good amount of sun beds. One pool was a little cold which would be nicer in August than the end of October and the other was beautifully warm. The small slides were a good distraction for younger children.    The Animation team who led events from aquarobics to basketball and kids club were very professional and always happy. They got people involved without you feeling you had to join in if you just wanted to relax.    We were there on an all-inclusive and wondered if the drinks might be a bit stingy. However apart from not having any Baileys there was no reluctance to serve us beers cocktails or anything else at any time. It wasn't the kind of resort to get drunk every night (see below) but the one night we went for it a bit if anything the staff encouraged us to try different cocktails.    In terms of the atmosphere the guests were mostly French with a few other English. As one Brit said when we got back to the airport it was nice to sit by the pool not surrounded by sunburnt beer bellies sleeping off their hangovers. The French were really friendly always smiley and relaxed and while they drank they did it to relax not get drunk. There was no trouble or loud groups just families and adult groups having an enjoyable time.    The hotel ran a free shuttle service to the Marrakech souk which worked well.    We would very happily go back and can recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing break in a friendly pleasant resort within easy reach of the bustle of Marrakech.    One tip. The taxi's at the airport will try and charge you about double what the fare to the hotel should be. Make sure you haggle before you get in the cab.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Southampton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidM186299

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ColonelC81 wrote a review Nov 2012,30,A mixed bag but clean and pleasant.,The hotel was very close to Marrakesh and the airport however the taxi drivers were very inconsistent and always trying to cheat money out of you (a universal problem) but really the travel is reasonable.    Inside it is clean well maintained and very impressive. Our room (1 bed for 2people) was nice and always well maintained and had a pleasant outside space. The complex is walled as outside is a baron building site so don't expect hotel views.    The entertainment is very repetitive and poor quality it is family focused and as an English speaker you are a second class guest.    Food and drink: The food hall has set opening times and outside of these times food is unavailable. Once I saw some bread out on the bar but the ''snack bar'' was simply a lie. However the food hall is plentiful and quite varied. Most nights there is a themed menu would main stays available everyday. We stayed for a week and by the end I was getting bored of the food! Wine and beer is ok and served by the bottle but spirits taste like chlorine and without fail made us ill. I was ok as I generally drank wine or beer but my girlfriend was trying many cocktails and they were all unpleasant.    Service: The staff are ok and were never outright rude but as an English speaker you are not their priority.    Extras: We had a spa in their on site spar which was very very impressive! We also took an offroad buggy trip booked on site. We had a great time but the buggies wheel did break off. So probably not upto UK health and safety.    Overall: The hotel was great to look at but mediocre in terms of food and service. Marrakesh is like the wild west and spoilt by people trying to rip you off. We had a nice week by the pool with occasional trips to Marrakesh. Better service and advice on visiting the city would of helped but was lacking here.

You finally arrive at the hotel around 12 (only 15 minutes away from the airport) where you check in and get your room.... at 4:00 PM. PS/ make sure you go find your lugage first !  After unpacking time for some relaxation in the Spa? (""wellness included"" by Thomas Cook)  The indoor swim after the hammam will cost you 10€ pp...  During the whole week no wifi available in the room only rarely at the reception desk.  Do you want do exchange some euros into dirhams you will be better off at the Carrefour (15min walk)    And now for something a little more positive:  the buffet is offering a nice variety of European & Morrocan cuisine. You must eat quite early though: once the buffet is running on empty some plates will not be renewed (desserts....).  Some international wines are even available: if you're lucky they'll even find the key to get it.    Hotel-entrance the receptiondesk and rooms are beautiful and always clean. The same for the beautiful gardens and swimmingpools the great sun-lounges are very inviting.  It's staff is very friendly but always slow: if you need something ask twice. (When you arrive late at the restaurant it will be difficult to find a clean table...)    This hotel has everything to offer a great 5* stay but it's missing structure and organisation.  Everybody's always doing a little 'something' but there's no one to organise and give directions.  Responsables are extremely good in overlooking without interacting. As someone said: organised chaos.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Dim S wrote a review Nov 2012,30,Not bad for the price,"We also stayed here over half term and having read previous reviews I was pleasantly surprised. I booked the accommodation on Expedia ( after having received a cheap Groupon Deal for this hotel) and initially had booked flights with Ryan Air (never again) which we changed to Easy Jet (another pleasant surprise).    We got a taxi from the airport which cost 200 dhirams. Were at the hotel within 15 minutes. Reception were very friendly and checked us in straightaway. Yes we were offered a welcome drink and were taken to our room in the buggy and our luggage brought to our room. We were also told about the charge for the safe .    The room was quite nice. Flat screen tv and fairly decent bathroom. The beds were rock hard and the pillows made of concrete. We were short on towels and pillows. The next day we asked for extras and they sorted it out straightaway. The free wifi wasn't working in our room so I reported it to Reception and she said she would notify the ""technician"". I thought she was spinning me a yarn but the next time I tried the wifi it was working! The free wifi was a real bonus.    The place itself was beautiful and my son loved the water slides. However if you are expecting an All Inclusive like the ones in the Caribbean then this one falls short. It advertises all sorts of activities like Archery and Cooking but they weren't very good. It sometimes rained and when it did there was nothing to do except sit in your room. If you have children then there wasn't really much to do in the evenings either. On the other hand its only a 3 hour flight and was keenly priced. The animation team were very friendly and always tried to include you.    The food was not bad. It was a lot better then the food you get in All Inclusive Resorts in Egypt but not as a good as the Caribbean. The fresh orange for breakfast was good and the bread was lovely. The food did get a little repetitive but you could always find something. The restaurant could get a little manic and was calmer the later you left going. They didn't seem to run out of food so going late did not create any problems and it was easier to find a table and to get food without having to queue.    You do have to be careful with the food. On one occasion the chicken kebabs that were served were raw on the inside. If you are vegetarian it may be a problem.    The staff were friendly enough but if you wanted something you did have to be assertive and ask for it otherwise you would just be ignored. I used my school girl french and found that whenever I tried to speak French to get myself understood they would speak back to me in English so no problem. I have to say I had no problem with language or communication.    We used the Spa - for massages which was lovely.    The shuttle bus was also very efficient but book the day before otherwise you may not get the time slots you want. Marrakesh was brilliant fun. The souks were amazing.    The plus points for this hotel are its beautiful good value slides free wifi. The negatives are too many flies.",Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamush07
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,999lexi wrote a review Nov 2012,40,Good Holiday but not 5 star,I stayed there with my husband and 2 kids for half term. The price was very good but the reviews appeared quite mixed so we were unsure what to expect. On arrival we found a long queue in reception and lots of unhappy guests. The staff were friendly but appeared out of their depth and it took us an hour and a half to check in. No welcome drink no apology and no explanation. We were then taken to our room in a golf buggy. Unlike others we were not shown around - we were dropped at the bottom of the stairs and the driver pointed up to where our room was and left us to it.  The room was small but very nice but we saw a problem immediately. One double bed (which was actually 2 singles pushed together) and one single sofa bed. And there were four of us. Also only two towels. I was not happy as we had waited so long to check in but went back to reception to complain. To their credit staff rectified this very quickly and brought another bed and more towels. The room was quite cramped but we weren't in it much so it didn't matter. The bathroom was also very nice but there was no shower curtain which we found odd as the shower was quite powerful and the floor was soaked very quickly.  The hotel itself is lovely. The grounds are picturesque with paths lined with olive trees. There are gardeners always working on it. The communal parts are luxurious with beautiful vases of flowers in reception and sweet smelling oils burning. The dining room is vast but the tables were always beautifully laid and spotlessly clean.  My kids loved the pools - one freezing cold and one lovely and warm - and could have spent all day going down the water slides. There were always plenty of sunbeds and towels were provided. I wasn't too impressed with the pool bar. No real shelter if it rained (which it did!) and the main bar not open until 6pm so nowhere to go for a quiet drink during the day. The drinks were not the best quality there either.  The food - very good although we did have dodgy stomachs. This is probably to be expected. Massive choice for every meal wonderful desserts. Can't believe anyone would think the food was the repetitive! Freshly squeezed orange juice and omelettes to order at breakfast were great. You can't request a glass of wine at lunch or dinner - they always bring a bottle which is not necessarily a bad thing. Moroccan food available for every meal but if not your thing there was plenty more to choose from. Every night was themed which was a nice touch - and the staff were always very friendly and helpful. However I did feel that if you were French you got a slightly better service.  What did surprise me was that there was a charge (180 dirhams) for using the room safe and a charge of 200 dirhams a day to use the gym. I haven't experienced this on an all-inclusive before and was not impressed. We were not told about the safe charge until check-out. However the shuttle bus to the medina was free and was very reliable and efficient making several trips there and back every day. This saved you having to haggle with the taxi drivers who would attempt to rip you off at every opportunity.  I must mention our lovely cleaner a young lady who was always smiling worked like a trojan and left our room looking gorgeous every day. Bedcovers in the shape of flowers rose petals scattered everywhere spotessly clean bathroom with replenished toiletries every day. They deserve a big tip as they go way beyond what is required of them!  All in all a good holiday and I would recommend.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,MCPK wrote a review Nov 2012,30,Not a 5*,"I have been going to Marrakech for over 40 years and have stayed in a number of places although when I am very happy with a place I tend to return time and time again.  However this time I chose to try the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina as it is a fairly new chain of hotels (although I felt quite guilty not to go to our usual Club in the Palmeraie area where we are treated like VIPs at all times and nothing can be faulted!).  I regretted this choice within the first 2 hours there. We arrived well after the check-in time and found a totally disorganized reception desk were ignored totally as 2 of the staff were far more interested in playing with their mobile phones and when they attended to us on and off again total disorganization and it was evident that they did not have a room ready for us.  After at least 1 1/2 hrs (during which I actually had to request the welcome drink which they were supposed to offer in the first place) we were allocated a room. We were taken to it and to my utter dissatisfaction it was a room overlooking wasteland and rubbish (I actually had sent an email asking to have a room possibly near the main building - no notice was taken) - not what I am used to in Marrakech or anywhere else or an acceptable location for anyone. After I complained we were moved to a decent room in one of the aisles with olive trees etc which was far nicer and close to the Spa.  We thought we would then enjoy our stay but this was not to be. The hotel/club was very busy the service got worse the food although plentiful was pretty much the same at every meal and luckily we were only there for 4 nights. We tried the Moroccan restaurant (set menu for each day of the week) on the day they were supposed to serve ""tagine de poulet au citron"" (chicken with lemon tagine) but instead they served lamb tagine with prunes. I happen not to be able to eat lamb (which smelled more like mutton than lamb) and therefore did not eat the main course as there wasn't an alternative. I wasn't the only one in the same situation so the other guests didn't eat either. Taking into account one actually pays extra it is appalling.  Throughout our stay we heard various people complaining. We used the Spa which was fine but not as good as some and the gym was fee paying which we certainly never encountered in any 4 or 5 stars establishments. We always stay in 4+ or 5+ stars and that was a first!  We had rain most of the time which couldn't be helped but there again the drainage was totally inadequate in parts of the ground as well as the walkways for 1st floor rooms which were totally flooded above the inside of shoes. Wi-Fi doesn't work everywhere either.  The restaurant staff were very nice helpful and friendly but simply couldn't cope with the number of guests which is not their fault - there is an obvious lack of staff and in other areas lack of experienced and well trained staff as they don't seem to know how to treat guests without whom they wouldn't have a job.  The beds were comfortable and clean the amenities in the bathroom were only soap shampoo and shower gel - in a 5* a great number of other amenities are there; I would rate this Hotel Club a 3* but definitely not a 5*; we shall not stay there again and are unable to recommend it.  My only additional comment is that if the hotel isn't very busy may be it's ok.",Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCPK

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jules Q wrote a review Nov 2012,50,Simply brilliant,I am an avid research and trip advisor user so I checked this hotel out before I went and was aware of the mixed reviews which were either absolutely excellent or downright awful. Following my visit to this hotel I am amazed that anyone could say anything negative about it! They really must have been to another hotel as far as I am concerned.  So rather than just expel the virtues of the hotel I thought I would breakdown some specifics.    The Hotel:  It is as shown in the photo’s in fact I would say the photos don’t do it justice. I noted some reviews commenting on a bad smell I experienced nothing of this in fact I have to say the smell of both reception and the spa is beautiful it is fresh and flowery. This is probably due to the stunning vases of white roses and lilies in the reception areas and the essential oils etc from the spa. The reception staff are in my experience attentive helpful and polite down to the offered glass of a cool refreshing drink as you arrive. We were driven around the hotel pointing out where everything is on a buggy on route to our room. Our cases arrive 5 minutes later.  The outside space is clean and the gardens well manicured. The pathways were always being swept and the care of the staff for their environment was obvious. The pools were clean and the pool area was always attended. The slide was great for the kids young and old and they appeared to have sessions when they opened the slides and then also closed them during lunch that did allow children sensible settling time after their meal.    The Animation Team:  Wow Wow and Wow! These guys really work hard to make your holiday special you could chose to join in or simply say no thanks never any pressure and they really did make sure that the dual languages of French and English were catered for. My husband and I went with his 15 year old twins my step kids (a boy and a girl) and they really understood how to draw the teens out of themselves. Even on rainy days (to be expected this time of year) they were offering teen time with Wi's etc. We really liked the old fashioned way they would ask you to dance with them in the bar in the evening my husband never dance’s but up he was happily swaying round the dance floor with one of the girls from the Animation team. The animation team worked from early morning through the day and in to the evening including a fully choreographed show in the evening always with a hello and a smile. They are a credit to the hotel brilliant!    The Room:  A really good size huge double bed we asked to be rooms near one another and we were right next door. The room was cleared daily and well with petals and beautifully folded sheets in flower shapes etc. The cleaning staff again always says hello and smile. I have seen pictures of bugs on other reports I saw nothing like this. I always get bitten on holiday and I was bitten only once on the last day. There is a fridge but it’s not stocked but that is my only slight complaint but the drinks were free flowing and not restricted and you could have easily requested a bottle of wine in the restaurant to drink back at your room if you’d wanted too.    The Food:  Again I cannot see why anyone complains about this in other reports. The food was plentifull a pasta station  Moroccan selection pizza bar and chips every night if that’s your thing. The salads were amazing the bread fresh daily and the sweets to die for. The Moroccan restaurant on site is definitely worth a visit too and a small surcharge of about £10 per head should not put you off. There was something magical about the evening and the local lute player.    The Pool Bar:  Great service and always friendly a special hello to Mohammed who really was very sweet. The pool bar staff also regularly go round the pool picking up plastic glasses plates etc and show a real pride in the hotel.    Free Hotel Medina Shuttle transfer:  Easy to book the night before and a really easy service to use both from the hotel and on pick up. Save your money and don’t take a taxi there really is no need.    In Summary  This is a top hotel in Marrakech and has an excellent reputation which is well earned and in our experience as a family group with teenagers a great holiday destination we would come back again at the drop of a hat. Our only disappointment was some rain and cloud for the first few days but there’s not a lot the hotel could do about that I’m sure if we’d asked the Animation Team would of done a sun dance and solved it for us if they could. Don’t let the negative reviews put you off you’d regret it this hotel is fabulous.,Date of stay: November 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Staplehurst, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesQ_12

All I can say is that I am not sure some of the people had actually stayed at this hotel.  check in was quick although a little disorganised as Iam not sure they knew which rooms we were going to have. having checked in we were taken to our rooms and the porter in his golf cart was willing to wait to take us to the restaurant as dinner was still being served. We declined choosing instead to go to the bar for a much needed drink after the delays in immigration nothing to do with the hotel.  Throughout the stay the staff were helpfulcheerful and always willing to meet our requests despite our very poor efforts at french. The choices in the restaurant were plentiful and we were always able to find something to our taste. With plentiful supplies of wine water and other drinks there was no danger of dehydration.  All in all this is not a euro pean 5* but is a good clean hotel that is fast learning on what it takews to make guests happy. A more organised system in reception controlling room allocation  an ATM to get cash would all enhance the facilities.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Poole, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/974lesl

They also charge you for use of the safe in your room which is a bit strange but free wifi (albeit very slow) was good!    if you want some wine they put a whole bottle on your table! :) we also went to the seclude restaurant for a meal (small supplement) but it wan;t necessary as the food was even better in the buffet...the salads were outstanding and so was the tagines....we stayed away form the pizza and chips    People have said that it was noisy but our room was a way from the main area so we no issues with noise.    the complimentary drop off and pickup minibus in to the Medina was great so we didn't have to worry about getting ripped off with the taxi.

The grounds are amazing incredibly clean with two lovely pools and plenty of sunbeds for everybody.

The food is plentiful and available for most of the day with Breakfast Lunch Dinner and afternoon snacks and there is a good selection. If you put a bit of everything on your plate everyday then I suppose it might get a little bit boring after a while but that's more down to being greedy than anything else. Their puddings were amazing!    The rooms are large with comfortable beds and are cleaned daily with the cleaner often leaving little rose petals and decorations on the beds.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,annah r wrote a review Nov 2012,50,What a beautiful place,So I wasn't 100% enthusiastic about going to Morocco but had to as it was mums 60th. We arrived around 11am at Kenzi club and after filling out paper work we were taken to our rooms (so we checked in early and didn't get charged for it). First impressions were lovely. Gardens and rooms were clean and modern. My brother and his wife changed rooms as they had twin beds and wanted a double and managed to get a huge super king size bed. Their room smelt a bit of sewage which wasn't great but the smell went after a couple of days.  Every day the rooms were cleaned and rose petals put all over the rooms. On mums birthday they put more rose petals around and done a few fancy tricks with the towels. There was also a bottle of champagne in the room on ice when we got back from our trip (we paid for this). The hotel organised a cake in the restaurant and the staff came over singing happy Birthday. This was embarrassing but nice.  The facilities were good. E.g. tennis courts basketball courts. Spa was a bit pricey and not the best job but still a nice treat when you're away.  The staff were amazing. All very friendly from the porters to the dancers. Everyone had a smile on their face and said hello every time you saw them.  Only found out about the club in the hotel on the last night which was a shame as I was desperate to go out clubbing. You get in to Pacha for free BTW.  Food was good but we all had a funny stomach for a few days but this may not have been the hotels fault as we ate out on several occasions. There was a huge variety and the presentation of the food was excellent.  The staff put on a haloween show which was excellent.  I will definitely go back and would recommend this to anyone.  You cant really fault anyone or anything in the hotel.  The cab drivers do rip you off but they are all nice.  You should pay about 100 to get back to the airport and about 150 on the way there.  Moroccan people are just lovely.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annahr_12
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lawrence R wrote a review Oct 2012,50,A perfect oasis close to bedlam!,The hotel exceeded my expectations peaceful clean friendly well kept gardens good food plenty to drink a large comfortable room with a good shower and free transport to and from the centre of Marrakesh [5-10min ride].    The centre of Marrakesh is chaotic and a bit of a shock if you've not been before. We felt safe and had no problems with the local people who were very friendly even when you didn't want what they were offering but they will take your money if you don't barter hard. In contrast the hotel was peaceful and run at a relaxed pace -no need to rush for dinner.    It's the little details that made it stand out; rose petals on the bed clean and in good order throughout - from the swimming pool to the gardens smiling helpful staff who without asking prepared a table and had the wine cooled and ready before we turned up at lunch and dinner [we were a party of 10]    To top it off the weather made a tremendous difference - with a distant mountain backdrop- plus 30C and blue sky's for the 4 days in late Oct when we were there. A complete contrast to our children's holiday with their grandparents in the fog bound north east @ 12C. And it's only a 3hr flight.    The fact that we could not speak hardly any French and no Arabic made no different gesticulation and patience works wonders in fact it made for a more private holiday. The only exception is for taxi drivers who want Roll-Royce prices to drive you around in a 30 year old wreck.    We'd go back and with the children - a great holiday in a great place.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Shepshed, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LawrenceR44
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Beth G wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Beautiful hotel, exceeded expectations",Kenzi Club exceeded my expectations which were largely based on previous reviews and the hotels website which leaves a lot to be desired.    We arrived early (11am) and were allowed to use a room to change for the pool whilst we waited for our room to be prepared. We'd booked a 'quad' via Expedia which was misleading as no such room exists! What we'd been given was a large double with two day beds in the living room area - which would be fine for children but suitable for grown women. As per the review below this caused a few teething problems as we repeatedly had to call the front desk to try to get this rectified. Eventually we walked down to the front desk and were referred to Mohammed who was more than helpful came back to the room to discuss the options with us and even offered us an extra room so we would have more space. We ended up deciding not to move rooms as we wanted to all be together and once we were settled in we loved our room despite two of the party being on put-you-up style beds. With this in mind I'd advise anyone booking for a group to factor in what type of beds you'd be happy with.    That issue aside our stay was really enjoyable. The hotel decor and facilities are comparable with a European 5*. The room was spacious the main bed was superking size (with room for a put you up bed on either side!) the bathroom had twin sinks separate bath shower and toilet area plus another toilet off the hallway. Loads of wardrobe space and a living area with the aforementioned day beds. Flat screen TVs in both main rooms hairdryer etc. The room felt luxurious with lots of marble mosaic in the floor very modern and super clean.  A few minor negative points on the room: bottled water wasn't provided in the mini bar which given it's all inclusive would have been welcome rather than having to go to the bar to collect them each night. There was also no room service option and no stock in the mini bar so you have to plan ahead any drinks you want to have in the room whilst getting ready.  The room could also do with a couple more plug sockets if being used by 4 people.    In terms of facilities on site the pools were clean and far better than the pictures suggest. Loads of good quality loungers fun slides abundant towels covered beds for those who want shade (a lot of people were making good use of these for small children). The snack bar serves a decent range of drinks all day. The lobby is stunning the grounds are pleasant and well tended the hamman in the spa (which was free on the all inclusive) was worth a visit too. We also made use of the bar and on the last night discovered the discotheque (though you had to pay for drinks at the latter). Plus there were a range of sports facilities - table tennis volleyball archery which if you were taking children would be welcome I'm sure.    After 4 days the buffet did get a bit repetitive despite having eaten in town for some of our meals so it's worth bearing that in mind if you're planning a longer trip. The free flow of wine mint tea both Morrocan and European dishes was good though.    The location is a fair way out of town with our taxi fares varying depending on the time of day or night and our negotiating skills; normally settling somewhere between 50-100 Dirham (£3-£8). The shuttle bus is worth booking for trips in the day and early evening to reduce these costs.    The thing that makes it not quite 5* are the service at reception being told we'd have to pay for a call to a restaurant as they wouldn't make a reservation being told to use taxis rather than arrange a private transfer to the airport lack of assistance over the initial room issue etc; and the few little touches that were missing (bottled water in the room etc)    Away from the front desk everyone was very welcoming and eager to help however they could. Jameila who looked after our room stood out in particular for her hospitality and warmth.    All things considered I'd definitely recommend the hotel to others and would visit again.,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bath, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethG233

The service varied we had a few problems with our room to start with and wasn't dealt with very effectively by the women on the front desk until Mohammed on the front desk took over he was friendly efficient and we felt well looked after by him this friendliness continued from all the staff from the bar staff to the waiters and our wonderful cleaner/maid jamilla she was great!!! It seemed to be the women on the front desk who were unhelpful and grumpy! That is my only complaint.  Shuttle buses into town were great as we ran out of energy bartering for taxi's lovely lovely lovely!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Mrs W wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Fantastic, could not fault",I've just got back from a four day break with two friends and I could not give this hotel a better review. I can only presume that the people who have described the staff as unfriendly and useless were not friendly to the staff themselves. We made every effort to speak French to them why should they speak English - this is not Europe! The rooms and grounds were immaculate. The food was Moroccan it's Morocco!! If you are dubious about the food there is always bread cheese eggs chips (if you must) so you will not go hungry. The wine is nice. The cocktails in the main bar are pretty good. Yes it does take a long time to get anything done but have you never been to Spain?? The staff here and in fact everyone in Marrakech are in no rush so just chill enjoy the fantastic weather all inclusive food and drinks stunning locations clean rooms and give them time to do their job without complaining every five minutes.  Every single member of staff was hugely helpful and fun. The entertainment staff really made this holiday for us. If you want to get involved in activities do it you might even enjoy yourself. Treat them with the respect that they deserve and you will not be let down. We are already arranging to come again next year with our families. This place would be great for children of all ages. We felt so safe here which is why I can't understand some of the bad reviews. We left our mobiles expensive camera money and room cards on our sunbeds whilst swimming and nothing at all went missing.  If you want to snap your fingers at the staff and get everything rushed over to you - try France! If you want to have a relaxing fun entertaining and very friendly experience try this hotel. You will not be disapointed. I have had such an amazing four days Huge thanks to the animation team for the entertainment I have never laughed so much in my life!  Like I said I cannot fault this place and I really can't understand the bad reviews at all. The staff aren't moody or rude. Just try treating them with respect try speaking French to them and learn their names and you will be treated as well as we were!,Date of stay: October 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Stow-on-the-Wold, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viciwitt
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,wttghgv wrote a review Oct 2012,10,Useless untrained thieving staff,My honeymoon stay at this hotel was very upsetting. The reception staff are moody and very rude and when it comes to asking for clean towels you will end up waiting for 4 hours till you get a response. My suitecase was also broken into and wifes was tampered with upon arrival when I checked in as they were looking after the luggage all valued items were taken. When speaking to the manager Nabeel he knew it was the staff responsible for the breakin but reckons the cctv only records for 3 days and cant do anything about it. As a couple we felt unsafe leaving any items in the hotel room when we went out as when we did return our items in the rooms were moved around and sometimes even missing. Dont trust the cleaners or security or any staff working in the kenzi club agdal medina hotel. Bad experience wouldnt advise couples to book the hotel. Food in the restrurant was uncooked and was the same everyday we were there. We had all inclusive but due to the bad food had to order takeouts by getting taxis everyday which is also a pain as rates are never fixed and if you dont haggle it down they will rip you off tourist prices as they call it. Overall bad honeymoon experience and wouldnt recommend this hotel rather stay in the medina.,Date of stay: October 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wttghgv
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DawnW758 wrote a review Oct 2012,30,Kenzi club Agdal Medina,I am actually staying at this hotel as I write this review. 12th October. We arrived on the 10th in the morning and were sat in reception and given a welcome drink of cold lemonade which was lovely we had to fill out forms which we needed a little help with (wording a bit confusing) and then told to go and sit at the pool bar whilst we waited for our rooms to be ready which we did. As the flight took of from gatwick at 6.25 am and we were all up from around 2am we were all hungry but unfortunately the restaurant did not open for another hour and the bar food was covered in flys! So breakfast was beer and cocktails that were not anything we recognised. Eventually we returned to reception to get our room keys (rooms 900 &902). The rooms both smelt of sewerage and seemed a bit dark. We decided to go to lunch when we got back to our rooms we found 5 cockroaches so immediately returned to reception and asked to be moved (I took a cockroach with me). The reception manager changed our room strait away.  So far we have visited the old town we opted for a personal guide which was great we paid 300dinah and bought him lunch he stayed with us for about 5 hours it was very good. The food at the hotel is plentiful but average in choice and quality our favourite meal is breakfast. The coffee is not good and not a costa in site help! The staff are a mixture of friendly and rude unfortunately some appear to be more interested in their mobile phones than the guests which is very rude. I would remove all their phones during working hours. The spa was not a good experience I have visited many and this one really only caters for people who can speak French which means the manicure and pedicure was very boring and the atmosphere a bit strained not pleasant and not cheap my sister had a manicure and tried to explain that the beautician was cutting her and the girl tutted in response. When the manicure was finished 4 of her fingers were bleeding! Needles to say we cancelled everything else we had booked.  So far There has been I a disco every night I have not had any sleep and now have a headache because I can here it from my room when I went to reception to complain the girl laughed. We paid £395 each all inclusive through an on line site for one week. To be honest I am glad we did not pay more I would not stay here again and would not recommend it. Too many flys on the food and by the pool so you can't relax which is a shame because the pool area is lovely the entertainment people seem lovely and the chambermaids are friendly the rest of the staff is hit and miss. The grounds are lovely the room we have now is ok but noisy at night. No shops near by and the one on site is very expensive.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Stephen B wrote a review Oct 2012,40,A taxi ride from town,As you drive along Avenue Mohammed VI you see what appears to be a prison complex on your right hand side as you approach you realise it is your hotel.    However once inside the 15 foot walls it's like an oasis in the desert.    At the time of writing this review Oct 2012 the Kenzi Club is in the middle of a vast open area of development so the sound of construction workers at 7am is a slight issue but shouldn't spoil your stay.    The hotel appears to be built on an old olive grove because throughout the hotel there are very old olive trees in neat lines. I didn't ask about this but I find it hard to believe such old trees would have survived being disturbed and replanted.  The grounds are beautifully laid out and the ground staff clearly take a pride in the whole appearance even sweeping the paths first thing in the morning. The shrubs are manicured and the palms trimmed. The grass is cut and the rose beds neatly dug.    Iced lemonade greets you upon arrival and the multi lingual reception staff are able to answer all your questions. A golf buggy takes your luggage and you if you wish to your room. The rooms are quite spacious and there are rose petals on the bed a bottle of wine and some sweets.    One big negative for me was that the gym was in the Spa area and you had to pay an additional charge to use the Spa so hence a charge to use the gym. Very bad. I thought this was totally un-neccessary. I therefore chose not to use the gym which was a shame because for me that was one reason to choose the hotel. It was only 100DH per day but for me it was the principle.....call me petty if you wish.    I didn't use room service.    The hotel has a predominantly French clientelle some English and a few Spanish.    The restaurant is laid out buffet style for breakfast lunch and dinner. There were always a wide selection of dishes tagines salads fruit deserts. Some better than others...take your pick. I wouldn't call it 5 star but it was adequate. Some things were cooked fresh for you upon request.  Smoking was permittted on the open terrace of the restaurant I sat inside fewer flies and cooler.    Restaurant service was very good so were the bars. All staff were very pleasant and eager to help. The quality of beer was surprisiingly good. No tomato juice for Bloody Mary's though so stick to Screwdrivers.    The pools are great the terrace areas around them is spacious free towels upon request.    Entertainment each night.....the French love line dancing and generally getting involved. The English a little less so.    Because of the location of the hotel you need a taxi ride to get to the city / medina / sgaure / souks. There are traders in the hotel but you must barter very hard because you can usually buy the same for less in town. There is so much competition it REALLY is a buyers market. Be prepared to walk away because the next trader / shop / stall will want your business just as badly.    There is a basket ball court table tennis agua aerobics water flumes small football pitch tennis golf driving net (I'm not a golfer) and boules (if that's how it's spelled)    Overall a good experience and once inside the hotel the grounds are wonderful quite romantic even.  The whole place is very clean and inviting.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,John H wrote a review Oct 2012,50,Lovely Relaxing place to chill,Just returned from a 4 night stay and i have to say i really enjoyed it. This place is superbly well kept and the adult pool is just brilliant. The hotel itself is only a couple of years old and the rooms have superb features such as flat screen tv and i found the rooms to be very pleasant. The only downside is its away from the hustle and bustle but for me this was great as it gave me an incentive to relax more. The staff are very polite and will go out of their way to help you. I have to say a big thank you to Mustafa in the snacks bar and the chief of reception i forgot his name now who allowed us to check out at two instead of 12. oh and the girl in the spa i had the best facial massage ever! you have to book a spa session it makes all the difference to make you relax and enjoy your stay. Do haggle on the price as its high but still worth every penny.The food was great and they will make you a delicious fresh ommlette in the morning and pasta to your taste at luch and dinner. Big hello to Luena the animation girl. Although the main language spoken is French as a lot of the residents are well to do French people mostly everyone speaks English and i found the French people to be very nice always saying bonjour etc. Im back in England now and already missing this hotel and will be looking to come here again as soon as i get the opportunity.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lauren J wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Fantastic resort,I have only just got back from this resort and felt I had to write a review as I had such a fantastic time. Normally I would venture out on holiday but this hotel offered so much more than expected that majority of the time we stayed in. The staff could not do enough and although some were not great at English they would still try and help. There was always something to do even though it may not be your thing and the Animation team did exactly what they are there for which is to entertain. The Mojito party by the pool was definitely the best day if you are looking for quiet and boring then this is not the hotel for you. We were unfortunate enough that it rained one of the days and the hotel still catered for this with the bar open inside with a selection of games to play etc. We did not use the spa while we were there as it seemed a little over priced but all who did use it told us it was worth it. Food comes down to personal preference but you must be a fussy eater if you can not find something. There were different meats fish potatoes tagines everyday along with pasta pizza and salad. Also some of the desserts are to die for! The hotel was next to a building site but i do not think this is unusual as majority of the land is empty and barren. I think most hotels would be experiencing the same problem on a positive note the work going on was at resonable times and not very noisy just not great to look at.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,stevebrownett wrote a review Sep 2012,30,Average describes this well.,Had we not got a fantastic deal on this hotel we would not have been impressed. The hotel's star rating is way above what we would have expected. It is a decent place to go and relax but do not bank on it being quiet. We stayed for 4 nights and that was enough.    The positives:    The room was decent.  The pools often had nobody in them so were quiet and pleasant to use.  The pools were a good temperature.  There was a good choice of alcoholic beverages included in the All Inc and the staff in bar by the pool side served drinks quickly.  English speaking staff are fairly easy to find.    The negatives:    The room was next to a building site.  The cleaners were so slow getting around the rooms that ours sometimes never got cleaned.  The resort is geared up almost solely to French visitors.  The entertainment at the pool was too loud and intrusive for the majority of guests (quite a lot of guests left the pool area when it was particularly bad at times).  The entertainment staff seemed more interested in their own enjoyment than that of the guests often turning up the music up even louder shouting over the PA system and dancing at the pool side.  The music at the pool was very repetitive maybe only about 10 songs on loop throughout the day and they did not change from day to day.  The quiet/adult pool is adjacent to the entertainment pool so it is not quiet at all.  Whilst the variety of food was good it did not change much day to day and got boring quickly.  The information telling you that you will be charged for the safe in the room was written in French only and was NOT explained to us on arrival as they claimed when we objected the charge.  The double bed was two twins pushed together with separate bed sheets.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Harrow, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevebrownett
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kelly_Sky88 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Girls Holiday,We holidayed here for a week and it was one of the most fantastic holiday's I've had to date. We were a group of eight girls and were bowled over when we arrived at night as the hotel looked stunning when we pulled up in the taxi. On arrival they took our bags and greeted us with a glass of fresh lemonade which we drank as we filled in a form with our details. We were then whisked to our rooms on a golf cart and then our luggage soon followed.    The hotel is large and devised into raids and the grounds are kept immaculate. The rooms are modern and on arrival the bed was scattered with rose petals. Rooms were cleaned everyday and one maid even arranged my pyjamas into a cute flower shape on the bed.    The hotel has two pools a main one with slides (we felt like big kids and loved going on them) it was busier then the other pool which was nearer the bar. We alternated between the two depending on what mood we were in that day. The pool is slightly cold but after laying in the heat It was a refreshing change. The hotel provide beach towels and we didn't need to wait long to get them.    The hotel caters towards the French but they had no problem speaking English and the staff were lovely especially the restaurant waiters who were always there to help and ready to refill your drinks.    During the day they run activities we gave water aerobics a go which was actually fun and ended with a trip down the water slide. The animation team are energetic and always on form. At night the entertainment (albeit sometimes very random shows) ended around 11pm and people hung about until 12pm. There is a club onsite which was quiet but I was told that it really picks up during the peak season. Cocktails were 'interesting' and they used a lot of sweet flavoured liqueurs I stuck to gin and lemonade.    The food was plentiful and there was a lot of choice and included a variety of meats salads pizza and pasta and an abundance of desserts. The breakfast was my favourite with my choice always being the yummy Moroccan pancakes and fresh fruit. Each night was themed and ranged from Italian Chinese Spanish and Moroccan. We also visited the Moroccan restaurant at the hotel for a small fee of 100 dirham which also included wine and excellent food.    This was not a generic hotel we really felt as though we were in Morocco. I will be returning and would recommend Kenzi Club Agdal Medina for a fantastic holiday. For those who have given the negative reviews I do believe it depends on how open your outlook is when you go on holiday. We made the most of our visit choosing to go on tours outside the hotel a jump in quick taxi ride takes you to the souks and we even went to a club in town which was the best I have been to (So in the Sofitel).    NB: There are charges to use the safety deposit box on exit they have wifi available which was sporadic around the various parts of the hotel.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly_Sky88
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Reenzp wrote a review Sep 2012,30,Its an average holiday resort?!,I can see the resort has a mixture of reviews i can only comment on our stay and experence.    We stayed here on a girls holiday (old and young) for 5 days the staff are ok although not speaking much english they just get on with their job but there is no real customer service or friendly faces around. Although if you ask for help you will recieve it but its difficult to get much interaction or a smile from any members of staff.    The resort is fairly big it has 1 main dining room and 1 pool bar. the pool can get fairly busy  and i noticed there was a fair bit of pool side entertainment water aerobics salsa and games so be prepared for the noise....  we asked nearly 10 staff for towels and they just told us they don't speak english or they would get some and they came.... 1 and half hour later that is!!  There is 1 bar in the evening which gets quite busy but its just the same thing every night and full of kids i would say staying more than 3 days could get quite boring at the resort itself.    You will need to get a taxi everywhere from this hotel and the taxi drivers will try and over charge you so always bargain with them.    The food is awfull! 5 days of the same food afternoon and evening same old chips pizza pasta salad and its all bland and not very interesting at all. Although one of the chefs made us some special food with more spices and chillis for a bit of flavour which was nice!  there are snacks everyday at 3ish its donughts crepes and coissants but they are all kept outside and covered in flys so be careful.    The rooms are good for what you pay although our balconies were facing a building site and reception wouldn't move us to another room.  We had to get our bedding changed as it was the same bedding from the previous guests and had obviously not been changed it had blood and stains on all 3 beds with crumbs?!  The bedding was not changed in the 5 days we were there which i know is not the end of the world but still.    We had a great experience in the spa which we visited twice although expensive we didn't find much else to do whilst in the resort but the treatments were great.  Walking around the city and squares are good its really lively and the shopping is good.  I understand you get what you pay for but after staying in other resorts in different countries for the same price bracket or a little more you can get so much more and feel like you have had a fantastic holiday.  but unfortunately i wouldn't reccommend this resort to anyone and definately would never go back.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Reenzp
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Dougeso wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Honeymoon stay,Myself and my new wife stayed here for our honeymoon and it was more than either of us could have imagined. Dont listen to other reviews saying about the lack of english speaking staff as they are talking rubbish. Everyone speaks english. Some better than others but everyone understood what we were saying. The food is fantastic with loads of choices every day. The first thing we noticed was how peaceful the place is for being so big. The rooms are excellent with a massive bed(which was made fresh every day with a flower and rose petals sprinkled over it). As soon as we got into the room we headed for the pool. There are 2 pools. One is a really chilled out pool if you want to really relax and the other is more of a fun pool with water slides and activities going on all the time. The entertainment at night is good fun. Lots of cheesy 80's karaoke and dancing. Lots of football and boxing on tv inside the bar. Loads of cocktails for the ladies and he beer on tap is damn tasty. Dont hesitate booking this hotel. Just book it. You wont regret it.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Ballynahinch, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dougeso
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Schippi wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Great Spot for any kind of holyday,"We have been to Kenzi Club Agdal Medina two times and it only got better!  It was opened just recently when we went there teh first time so a few things were not jet perfect.  The second time anything went just smoothly :)  Exept maybe for the reception they are sometimes a little slow....  The rooms are quiet good clean tidy and nicely sized!  For any kind of food or drinks you just need to hop over to one of the bars or restaurants.  Especially the SNACK BAR near the pool supplies you with great service good coffee and whatever you need.  The can even replace your travel guide if you just talk to them for a while cause they really know the good spots around marrakech and they tell you where to go.  Pretty much the same great service is offered in the big bar (dont remember the exact nam right now) near the restaurant in the evening just before or after dinner.  We always rent a car and drive through the country but it was always nice to come ""home"" after a daytrip!  So go there and have nice stay :)",Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Schippi
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,alanjackson10 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Great Holiday!!!,I think trying to give this hotel an overall star rating is a little unfair as there is a lot going on this being the case obviously some things are better then others. Where shall I start???    The Rooms; * * * *  Our room was pretty big and very nicely presented. It had a super king size bed views of the Atlas Mountains (and a building site that I believe is going to be a golf course). We had the pleasure of seeing the sun set from our room also. Couple of strange points there was no shower rail/curtain and although the maids made up our rooms very nicely every day they did not clean the bath or change our bed sheets once in a full week. We knew this as there was a small stain on the sheet that was there all week. But all in all a very nice room.    Hotel Grounds Pools and Pool Bar; * * * * *  Simply beautiful these guys put A LOT of work in to keeping this place pretty much spotless. Two lovely pools smaller one heated. The larger pool had 3 slides that were surprisingly quick. Although the hotel was pretty busy there were always sun beds available which came with free towels that you get from behind the large pool. Also in this area the guys are happy to hand out basket balls volley balls etc to play with in the respective areas. Oh and don’t forget to visit the mini animal farm tucked away at the back of the hotel. There is only one pool bar but there was never more then a couple of minutes wait and all the drinks were off good quality they are also happy to provide full bottles of water. Couldn’t have asked for more from this side of the hotel. Oh and make sure you join in the Mojito pool party on a Friday this was great fun!    Food; * * *  Sadly the food is very average. In a full week we ate in the hotel restaurant 3 times during the day and 4 times during the evening. I’d say the day time food is a little better then the evening. It’s a real shame the food was not better as some of it looked lovely but the taste never really matched the way it looked. Also my girlfriend ate prawns one evening and had a bit of a dodgy stomach for 3 days after. We tried to get in to the A la carte restaurant one evening by booking the previous day but it was full I’d recommend booking this at the start of your trip (beware there is sheep brains on the menu on a Tuesday!!!)    Staff; * * * *  I really can’t understand the negative reviews regarding the staff we found most of them to be extremely polite and very helpful. Obviously there was sometimes a language barrier as the main language in Marrakesh is Arabic then French and we sadly speak very little of either but we tried our best and they really appreciated this. Special thanks to Abdul on reception Bargach the manger for sorting out our terrible experience in the spa (that’s coming next) Mohammed the waiter in the restaurant (with a few missing teeth) and the tallish black guy in the pool bar. These 4 guys really went that extra mile to make out trip special apologies if I’ve spelt your names wrong and for not getting the guys name at the pool bar. I really hope the boss reads this and is aware of these members of staff. The animation team are extremely hard working and very good fun the evening shows are very cheesy but funny.    Spa; zero stars!!!  I thought our holiday was going a little to well we had had an almost perfect trip then came the spa experience on our last day. We entered 10 mins before our treatment. We were greeted by a sour faced receptionist (I sadly can’t remember her name she had wonky teeth and I don’t say this to be rude but so the manager knows who I am talking about). She was extremely rude and miserable this can not be blamed on a language barrier as Mohammed spoke pretty much no English and was such a delight to deal with. We sat there for 25 mins during this time we seen 4 people get seen to before us and witnessed 4 or 5 members of staff have an argument in front of us. We booked a 50 minute massage which was of decent quality but seemed strangely quick. When we got out we realised we’d only been given a 30 minute massage. I then went back to explain this and said we were happy with this but obviously didn’t want to be charged for 50 mins. The miserable girl once more shocked us by saying even though we only had 30 mins we would still have to pay for 50 mins after 5 mins of complaining she still refused to credit us. I then went to see Bargach in reception and he sorted the whole sorry saga out in a couple of minutes (thanks again). What should have been a nice relaxing experience was nothing short of disgraceful. But we did not let this spoil out last day and eventually found it quite funny.    All in all we had a fantastic trip and would definitely return probably for a long weekend. If you visit this hotel just be sure to visit the Medina and the new town as you are approximately 5 mins taxi ride (50 Dirham) and the food is so much better there. But other then the food I loved this hotel. Oh and obviously don’t waste your time money and effort in the spa. You can get much cheaper spa experiences in the Medina.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Newcastle,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanjackson10
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Suzanne019 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Absolutely lovely,Having heard mixed reviews of Marrakech and this hotel a friend and I were a little apprehensive. We were very pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Although our room wasn't ready till late afternoon we were able to get our bikini's and head to the pool and enjoy the quieter area.    We found the all of the staff with the exception of some of the Reception staff so helpful and they were very happy to practice their English on us some of the fluent. Coloured Wrist bands issued by nationality was helpful to us and staff. The white bands for English speaking brown for French etc. Wherever we went we were greeted in English.    I didn't go hungry but the food didn't particularly appeal to my taste but there were many people enjoying their meals. Wine is served at meal time if required and beer is available on a self service basis. The Oasis snack bar was excellent.    Our twin room was comfortable and clean.    As indicated earlier the only criticism would be some of the Reception staff. Clearly this doesn't apply to all but 3/4 of the staff who worked the day shift were positively rude. It wasn't a one off and was a talking point around the pool amongst the French and the Brits.    All in all we had a great 4 day break with wonderful weather and wonderful people. If certain reception staff could raise a smile or at least appear to care this hotel would have been spot on.,Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kettering, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzanne019
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Aislingsmyth13 wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Fantastic break for my sisters hen do!,"We have just returned from a week long holiday and had an amazing time. The staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to help with any request that we had. The Morroccan restaurant was well worth the additional money as the food and the traditional musician was excellent. The rooms were lovely and clean the only flaw was not having a socket point by a mirror which made straightening your hair difficult.  The pool area was well kept and the animation team were always on hand around the pool area to entertain us. The dance routines had us up and joining in every day although the other pool was quiet should that not be your kind of thing.  The hotel is situated near Pasha nightclub and with your hotel armbands you get free entry. We also visited ""So"" the club within Sofital Hotel which I would definitely reccomend. There was a mix of live music as well as a DJ and the outside was lovely to sit and have Shisha.  We did a tour to the Ourika Valley Waterfalls in Fatma which were amazing just make sure you were good protective shoes as there is a fair amount of trekking up steep slopes involved.",Date of stay: September 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Bracknell, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smyth13
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Francesca B wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Great value for money,My boyfriend and myself have just arrived back from the Kenzi Club Agdal and I cannot emphasize enough what a spectacular trip we had! The hotel was near enough perfect for us with only a few tiny disappointments.  Reviews that state that the hotel staff were unfriendly I cannot find further from the truth. The majority of staff went out of their way to make us feel very welcome well looked after and that they were genuinely interested in how we were finding our stay. In particular we found Mohammed a member of the waiting staff to be absolutely brilliant.  The food at the hotel was very very satisfactory with a large range of tasty dishes many of which could be cooked freshly in front of you. Was pleased with the authentic Morrocan food presented also.    The pool is lovely however a little on the cold side so it takes some getting used to! entertainment was provided around the main pool and there adult pool is a little quieter. The hotel provide beach towels so there is no need to pack one.    The majority of travellers at the hotel are French therefore most of the entertainment on the night is in French which English travellers may find hard to understand. However we found it easy to join in with the singing and dancing and general night atmosphere despite this.  The general atmosphere ended around 12 o clock just after the bar closed and it would have been nice to be able to continue the evening after this point.    The rooms are of an excellent standard and cleaned immaculately. However the placement of the electricity plugs make it diffcult to use hair appliances as they are far away from the mirror so I would suggest considering taking a small mirror yourself.    One of the best parts of the hotel is its a la carte restaurant for a small fee of 100 dirham (about £7) you can have a beautiful 6 course dinner with wine. The atmosphere is wonderful and you feel as though you could be anywhere in morrocco not neccessarily at a hotel. The night is complete with a musician which we really enjoyed!!    As you can tell from our review we have high opinions of the hotel and the only issues we had are tiny.

The hoter was still new that time and took the full board option food is generous good tasting and open drinks for all you could even take bottles of wine and water to your rooms.  It is a shame I was there alone my wife would have loved it.  Rooms are quiet big and comfortable staff very friendly and polite.  The hotel is on the far end of the city so at least 20 minutes from the main touristic areas in the city.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Tory11 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Good value - great holiday,Travelled last week in August with my partner and another couple. On arrival reception seemed muddled to say the least and all we wanted was to get in our room! However after a refreshing mint drink and a trip by golf buggy to our room we were very impressed with a spacious spotlessly clean room the bed was super kingsize at least and the maid service was excellent. Pool areas and walkways were spotless. A huge selection of food was available at lunchtime and in the evening. Breakfast was omelettes pancakes cereals toast fresh fruit etc. Plenty of locally produced alcohol and cocktails on offer. The downside the animation team did not translate anything into English so we could not really get involved with the entertainment.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SCS2000 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,Great value for money,We really enjoyed our stay here and felt that it offered good value for money. We stayed four days which for us was about the right length of time. I enjoyed both lunches and dinners here with a good array of foods with some excellent seafood choices including cuttlefish prawns octopus and swordfish. Excellent bottled wine although the beer wasn't great. Breakfasts were a disappointment for me as the coffee was terrible and the pastries didn't seem fresh having said that there was alot of choice and freshly squeezed juice was on offer too. The hotel has a very French atmosphere and all entertainment is in French and generally all staff greet you in French. This wasn't problem for us and we found that most staff attempted to communincate in English once they realised. The facilities were generaally good and well maintained. Bar service was a bit sporadic but generally it was easy enough to get a drink although there was restricted choice. Lovely grounds to sit in in the evening but they should consider moving the kids mini disco away from the main bar to give adults the option to sit in there. Entertainment was terrible but it has been in every hotel we have stayed in so we weren't disappointed. We took advantage of the free shuttle into the centre of Marakech and paid 50 Dirhams for a taxi to return. We would stay here agin without doubt. A very short transfer from Marakech airport makes this a great short break option.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Devon, UK",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCS2000
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Hazamcbaza wrote a review Aug 2012,40,A very good holiday !!,We traveled to the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina for a week during mid August 2012 with my family (2 adults and two children.)  We had booked the hotel and flights separately as we got a good deal for a weeks all inclusive.We had arranged transfers prior to travel through 247transfers which were fantastic and recommend.Upon arrival at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina our first impressions were how lovely the outside entrance looked and when we walked into the reception area it was even better. We immediately went to reception to check-in were we were greeted by the reception staff and told to complete some forms required for the hotel  whilst we were served with non - alcoholic mohitos. As we had arrived about 10 AM we were told that we were no able to go to our room until about Mid- Day so went to the pool area and began to have a look around.  As we began to walk around the hotel grounds we found all the gardens to be well kept and presented with beautiful array of flowers in each beading  which blended in with the traditional colours of the riads.  Our first experience of the food was at lunch time and we were very pleased with the standard of the food every day of our week long holiday. There was different meat :pork  lamb turkey chicken steak.There was also lots of traditional tangines for anyone who wishes to try some true Morrocan food. Additionally if you are fussy when it comes to food then there was a pasta bar where a chef cooked what ever pasta and sauce you wanted along with a pizza station. Overall the food in the hotel was to a good standard although if you stayed more than a week you would soon find that the food began to become a bit repetitive. The dining hall were you eat was very big and thankfully air conditioned  but to be frank it was like a mad house .... kids running  noise and everything that is associated with an All Inclusive I suppose. Drinks were served in bottles : coke was the real deal and they served red wine and white by the bottle  where you have your own waiter ready to serve you. Bare in mind these waiters rely heavily on tips so are always there to help you when you need.  After lunch we went back to the reception where we went to or room which was situated in Riad Clementine. We had booked to stay in a suite or quadruple room and the room was excellent . We had two separate areas : one was a huge double room with a double bed and a bathroom with shower bath and the other part of the room had to single beds along with plenty of space to walk about and another smaller bathroom. Both rooms had flat screen TVs which was a nice extra but we didn't use them so cant comment on the channels.  We then made our way to the pool at about 2PM and was still able to find 4 sunbeds albeit on the grass area  we also found this to be the case throughout the week as there was plenty of sunbeds and no need to get up early to get sunbeds as there was still plenty available when we went for breakfast at 8 o'clock.  The hotel has two pools : the main one was very big and contained slides and was generally the busier pool as it attracted a lot of families because of the slides although the other pool was just as good.  The hotel is situated in the middle of no where basically and not worth going out the hotel unless you wish to visit the market or go on a tour which we heard was very busy and an experience in itself.  As many other reviews have mentioned the hotel is many occupied by the French Germans and Italians and a few British guests. French being a primary language in Morroco all the staff seemed to be much more friendly and helpful to the French guests and the food was geared more towards there needs  which was the only disappointment.  With regard to entertainment at night well all I can say is don't stay up for it as its not good at all. Firstly there never seems to be a rush in the performances as they say they start at 10 but never do more like 11 !!! If you do manage to stay up then you have to listen to it in french.  During the day they run activities for adults and teenagers such as :volleyball  football table tennis which was very good.  All in all a very good hotel which if it adjusted a few things could be a fantastic hotel  I would definitely return and would recommend it.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lady_rsr5 wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Expectations thoroughly met,My partner and I were looking for a holiday in Morocco where we could sunbathe relax and not worry about our spending. We found a reasonable deal on lowcostholidays and were impressed by the Kenzi website. I read through a few reviews and as usual they were a little mixed but I noted the most recent ones seemed to be positive and that the negative ones seemed to have a recurring theme- 'French' and as a result proceeded with the booking. Now having been to this hotel I can confirm that the hotel employs a large number of French speaking staff (expected given Morocco is widely French spoken) however I don't really think it's fair to complain about this. If you find yourself lost in translation at Kenzi then ask yourself how much French you know and stop complaining!! Considering I barely speak a word of French I managed to communicate with the staff just fine and found them to be generally polite.    The food at Kenzi was actually pretty good and exceeded my expectations although I never expect too much when going all inclusive. Each night was themed and we ate a mix of Italian Chinese Spanish seafood and of course Moroccan food. There is always chips pizza salad and pasta available as an option and the pasta can be freshly cooked in front of you exactly to your taste. Wine and water to my delight are served by the bottle and opened in front of you (although make sure you get on the pina colada too) and Coca-Cola is served rather than local brands... General thumbs up to the food and drink!    Regarding the hotel grounds they were a lot larger than expected and the rooms (see hotel website for pictures) are found in mini riads dotted around the hotel amongst the 2 main swimming pools (one with 3 water slides and a seated edge) tennis courts volleyball beach table tennis and the pool bar (situated out of the pool). I thought the grounds were generally clean although the bar did seem to attract a fair few flies.    I'd say Kenzi is a family friendly hotel there's quite a lot to do to keep kids active and entertained although it does mean that if you're a couple not used to kids you may have to get used to their behaviour quite quickly and be prepared to endure some splashing by the pool!    The grounds surrounding the hotel are pretty bare. I didn't really see anywhere that we could go for dinner outside of the hotel at all and our view from our room resembled a construction site which was a bit of a disappointment. The hotel does run a few shuttle bus to the souks though and you can spend around an hour there (plenty!) looking round the market stalls and haggling. There were some restaurants along here which you could try if you wanted...    Some further things to note. This hotel charges you to use the safety deposit box on exit (I think it was around £20 for one week); wifi is available at reception and in your room; pool towels provided (although only available from 9am and you have to queue by the pool for them; quad biking and camel rides bookable at hotel; a on site spa pass is 100MAD (£7) for single use or 200MAD for a week; every Friday the hotel hosts a 'mini souk' where you can purchase some souvenirs or get a henna done; late check-out is about £30/40 however they will keep hold of you bags and you can shower by the pool/ in the spa and a taxi to/from the airport (15mins) should be 150MAD (That said on the way to the hotel they wanted to charge 300MAD and even though we argued they wouldn't take us for less than 250MAD).    All in all perfect for somewhere to kick back relax and not break the bank balance. Maybe not quite luxury standard but if you're after luxury good luck finding that at an all-inclusive!!,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Singapore, Singapore",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lady_rsr5
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,xXloulabelleXx wrote a review Aug 2012,40,"Great value, pleasant stay!",My partner and I have just returned from a week's stay at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina and it was very pleasant. Not 5* maybe but certainly the best All Inclusive we have stayed in especially considering the price we paid for 7nights. Service was fantastic in the Restaurant and Bar especially Abdullah the staff wait on you hand and foot and we rarely had to wait for our next drink. We found the wine and beer to be very drinkable and you are given a bottle rather than a glass to go with your meal. The buffet catered for most tastes and we never struggled to fill our plates! Plenty of sunbeds to go around by the two pools in the day. Having read the other reviews before we came we did still have an open mind. I'd echo the fact that a lot of the staff seemed to speak in French at first however this was soon found not be an issue; I speak a little French and when I couldn't expand on my basic phrases (and when the staff picked up on my terrible accent) they did understand and speak to you in English. Gardens were lovely and well maintained (impressive in 42degrees of heat) and the hotel was very modern and clean. Rooms were spacious and modern and quite clean - our only issue here toward the end was that the cleaner sometimes didn't get around to our room until 6/7pm - not ideal when you're wanting to shower and get ready; so maybe an issue of deployment here.

My sister and I took our mum and my niece (aged 20) for a mini break. We couldn't believe how beautiful the hotel was the grounds were stunning. We arrived early so our rooms weren't ready however we were offered a class of sweet lemonade and assured that our room would be ready as soon as possible. We were taken in a golf buggy to our room. We had 2 rooms next to each other in a Riad style setting. There was a smell of drains however we contacted reception and this was dealt with straight away. We went straight round the pool there were plenty of sunloungers and well as the cabanas. There was a fantastic selection of food although the beef sausages wern't very nice! My mum had mostly raw food and has had a slightly dodgy tummy but I stuck with the fried stuff and was fine! The service in the hotel was second to none and better than any hotel I have been to bar none! There was bottled water on the table at breakfast lunch and dinner bottles of wine offered instead of a glass and extremely polite but not invasive sevice. The bar staff were brilliant. The pools were perfect and took the edge off the 48 degree heat! We got the shuttle bus to the medina but decided to return early as it was too imtimidating - we got a guide but we were dumped unceremoniasly when we didnt want to buy anything from the shop! We'll stick by the pool next time! My mum and niece had treatments which were lovely and charged at the end of the trip there is NO reason to carry cash! My niece had jewellary made by the man at one of the stalls that are in the hotel. The staff in the shop were not very helpful but hey ho didnt blight the holiday. We had booked a cab through the hotel to collect us at a cost of 30 euros but they didnt arrive so we got a cab from the airport ourselves - which cost 25 euros. However we were told that it shouldnt be more than 10 euros but again you live and learn - it wasnt a huge issue considering how fabulous the hotel was. Our flight was at 7pm and check out was 12 but we were given a clean lovely room at no cost to shower and relax in.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,HelenJ007 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Excellent hotel!,This hotel is very modern which I really liked - 10 minutes out of town but there is a free shuttle bus. Pay about 50 or 60 dirhams approx £4/£5 if you get a taxi. We booked our transfer with Lowcost holidays when we booked the trip - all worked out fine. I gave pound coins as tips to taxi driver and porter and they were fine with this. Hotel front desk has money exchange. I thought all the staff were great. We got a ball stuck in a big tree and maintenance climbed the tree which was kind. The food was really good - I got through the week without eating pasta pizza or chips; the tagines are delicious. I sometimes had no idea what was on my plate but it tasted lovely so who cares. Animation team are great - if you want to do stuff it is available and if you don't they say hello which suits me fine. Sports seem to be at 10am and 3pm. There is volleyball table tennis and archery etc behind the towel hut. Water polo and aqua aerobics about 11am and 3pm. You do not need to bring your own towels but some people put sarongs or whatever on sunbeds before breakfast. There are plenty of sunbeds. This is very different from a riad but I was with children and the pool and slides were perfect for them. You can all relax enjoy yourself and feel safe. i think this hotel is brilliant value for money. There is a safe in the room and I was wary about leaving stuff by the pool at first but all seemed very safe. There is a tax to pay when you leave 190 dirhams each - approx £17 pp. The hotel is mostly French - everyone was pleasant. I have stayed in other all inclusive hotels where you feel obliged to give tips - this hotel was not like this at all and I did not feel that the staff were looking for tips. Gave a few tips at the end. I don't drink spirits - discovered white wine and lemonade as I don't know if they had soda. This was lovely. Obviously Marakesh a must see - we got the shuttle in and eventually got a guide Abdul. I didn't want one but he hassled us from the bus. Looking back I should have asked the driver from the hotel what to do. He had a government badge that he was very proud of but anyone could wave a bit of a badge about. He was great and took us to the Medina and the souks. You could not do this on your own. You would get hassle and get lost. The souks are 7 miles of passages and the Medina was my favourite place on the holiday. I think that it must be one of the trendiest places to live in the world and families are still there amongst the riads. Then we went to the Majorelle Gardens (Yves St Laurent's house) which had a nice cafe. Go back to the Medina at night - this is an experience! I have been to Dubai and Jerusalem and Cairo etc but this was definitely something else. Young guys try to befriend you and are very plausible. We had drinks at rooftop bar there. We also went to La Mamounia Hotel for drinks near the Mosque. You can only go 3-6pm if you are non resident and you cannot take photos inside but worth it for the experience. People booked trips with Click.com - just ring from your mobile - starts with 020. The man was very nice and suggested the trip I picked was too long for children. This was very nice of him and he could just have taken our money. This is a great hotel if you are on a budget/ with children/ need a week in the sun.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Orlando, Florida",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenJ007

The staff couldn't do enough for us they are so friendly polite and helpful. The entertainment isn't very good and it was in french although we kept telling them to also use english. The animation team do try their best (we believe they have just employed a new head of the animation team and he is still trying to sort it all - which after all takes time!) We agree with muffin 155 (hello by the way) we booked a trip to the Atlas mountains with click excursions and they were fantastic. Our guide spoke excellent english! As for the weather...HOTTTTT!!!!

The rooms were very spacious and clean. The food was very good there was something for everyone the restaurant staff were very helpful. The pool and slides were child friendly. The animation team were good but they could do with someone speaking more english for the shows at night so keep bringing this to there attention as more english people are staying there. The staff at the pool bar were very friendly and very helpful (and funny) There is plenty of activities during the day. If you book any trips use click excursions they are excellent and have very good english. Plenty of sun beds and free towels.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,debskez wrote a review Aug 2012,20,"""overbooked""!!!!!!!!!!","After a very early start (2am) we arrived at this hotel around mid morning. All we wanted to do was check in and get to the pool for the day. However we soon found out that this would not be the case. On arrival we were given some paperwork to fill out (even though we had already given this information at the airport) unfortunately we were then told that there was a major sewage problem and that our rooms had been afffetced by this and we could not stay there for 1 week We were told that we would be staying at their sister hotel ""Kenzi palace"" which was 1 star more. We were ok with this because we did not want to sleep in a smelly room but then they told us that this was only a half board hotel and not an all inclusive. They said that we would sleep have breakfast and evening meal there but would have to travel back to their hotel for lunch in the mini bus each day and that only soft drinks would be provided but no alcoholic. As we paid best part of £850 pp for all inclusive we were very angry. Not only did we not want to waste time travelling to and from we wanted what we was rightfully entitled to. When we got the Kenzi palace reception staff there told us that there was infact no sewerage problem at all but they had just overbooked so we were blatantly lied to (not very professional ). The new hotel was aware that we were coming but were very confused regarding the concept of the all inclusive. We spent 1 1/2 days trying to get this sorted as there was a huge lack of communication between the two hotels. At first we felt like outsiders and were treated like dirt by some staff because of us wanting free drinks ( which we had already rightfully paid for) We were told that we could move back after the 1st week but we refused as we had already wasted enough of our holiday so they agreed that we could stay. Eventually we got things relatively sorted and enjoyed our stay at the Kenzi palace .",Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Kingston upon Thames, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debskez

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jane E wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Very Enjoyable Stay,"Family of 4 stayed for 6 nights in August 2012. We greatly enjoyed the stay but with so much heat/food and drink 6 nights was long enough as a stay (second part of a trip). We had a two room arrangement - one room had single beds converted from sofas and second room had a King Sized bed and large bathroom - there was also a second small toilet/half bathroom and large balcony- great layout for a family.    We found the pools/facilities and usually the food to be very good and above the average for similar all inclusive hotels that we have stayed in and overall good value for the price paid.    We found that virtually all staff spoke a degree of english (although we did try our french out on them whenever possible). The entertainment and waiting staff quickly recognised and addressed us in english automatically. We did not feel that not being french excluded us from the daytime entertainment - the entertainment staff always invited the children to join in with the activities and language was not an issue for us at all.    We did experience an issue with food availability on the first night which was addressed professionally by the duty manager. I had a birthday during the stay and was presented with a homemade cake iced with a personal message which was a very nice touch. Most people preferred to eat lunch in the very well air conditioned restaurant but our preference was to eat outside in the shade. by the end of the stay we found that a table in the shade was prepared for us and our choice of drinks on ice before we arrived - in a large all inclusive hotel we found this to be an unusually high level of service.    I do agree with previous comments that all inclusive should ""include"" using the safe and be aware that all guests are charged local tax even where the agency docket appears to say this is included so do budget for this as an additional cost.    Overall we would return especially for a long weekend/short break in the sun.",Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Surrey, England",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/familye
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,HNUK wrote a review Aug 2012,30,Wouldn't bother unless you speak fluent French!,My partner found a pretty good deal for this hotel a few months ago and we'd both always wanted to go to Morocco.    1) Make sure you pack a pen in your hand luggage as you have to fill out a form before you get there and before you leave to come home.    2) As you can't take money out there with you use the cash machines at the airport (there isnt one at the hotel which is ridiculous). You could change money at the hotel but everytime we asked at reception they didnt have the right change.    3) You will have to pay a separate tax charge for each night you stay. I think it cost us 3 dirhams each per night. So 42 dirhams for the week. We weren't told that until we checked in which was really unhelpful as we'd hardly taken any money to the hotel    4) The reception staff are some of the rudest people I've ever encountered with the exception of one man. If you're not French (which 90% of the guests are) they don't seem to care much.    5) The first room (ground floor) they gave us was full of ants and we had to ask twice to move (after being told to come back after dinner). We requested a room on the top level and there were no ants here but the air con was so bad we didnt sleep at all.    6) We took a trip to the souks & squares which is worth it but go with a guide. You'd get lost otherwise and its quite imtimidating. Plus our guide helped us with the haggling. We went back at night with a couple of people we met at the hotel and it was so busy but interesting. Beware the snake charmers they charge you to take a picture and they get pretty upset if you dont give them paper money. They also try to drape snakes around your neck so watch your back if you don't like snakes! The men with monkeys on chains also try to do the same thing. As soon as we stepped out of the taxi we were being hassled by different 'guides'. One man then came up to us and told the rest to leave us alone - he said he worked at our hotel and would show us the best place to go. Turns out he didnt work at our hotel and had recognised our wristbands - apparently they take you deep into the markets and then ask for money or they won't show you how to get back out.    7) The pools at the hotel are pretty good. The main one with the slides was really busy so we stayed around the quieter one. There were quite a few loose tiles on the bottom though so watch your feet.    8) The food was ok if you werent particularly picky. If you want it hot then go as soon as its served!    It was about 46c every day and was worth the trip but we won't be going back. The hotel was ok but the staff (and most of the guests as they were mostly completely rude) ruined it for me. I'd say the hotel rooms are a good 3* depending on which room you get. The first one we were given had a wet room rather than a bathroom and it wasn't in the best condition. The second was a lot better.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HNUK

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Liamo99 wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Chilled out but characterless!,Hotel is situated in the purpose build new city which contains miles and miles of very similar hotels. Most of these are all inclusive and lack the charm that you will get from staying in a Riad in central Marrakech. We split our time... two days in the old city and five days in this beautiful hotel.    We stayed in January which is obviously the low season with lower temperatures... as a post Christmas getaway it was nice and chilled out. As the hotel was quiet we were upgraded to a suite .. bonus!    Free WIFI but this was a little patchy and random.    The suite was spotlessly clean had a lovely bathroom with nice big bath... beds comfortable and a couple of nice big tv's... perfect place to chill out.    The food was pretty good for an all inclusive affair ... breakfast lunch and dinner were all buffet style and above average. The inclusive wine and beer were also pretty good ... most of the clientel were French so I doubt dodgy wine would hav been tolerated!    The pool area was pretty nice and one of the outdoor pools is actually heated so even in January you could enjoy the ourdoors.    The location is ok for the sights of Marrakech if you are willing to get a taxi. Remember these are purpose biuld compexes so you wont be walking anywhere and realisticly you could be anywhere in the world once inside... if you want to explore the real authentic central Marrakech... Get a Riad! (at last for part of your trip).    The staff were helpful enough but also kept themselves to themselves.    So in summery if you need a nice little chilled out getaway with some nice food in a relaxing environment then this is ideal... If you want to see Marrakech and experience soem Morrocan food and culture...

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,km20 wrote a review Aug 2012,30,The rooms are the best quality of the hotel however staff not so sure!,When we arrived out first thoughts were lovely hotel and grounds. Arrived at our room which was lovely and big - air con not the most powerful at all but happy to be provided with one. Throughout the stay our room was cleaned daily sometimes being woken up around 8 for the cleaner to come in (can't say I loved this as being on holiday I prefer not to be awoken so early) holiday was nice however as time went on lack of English speaking & helpful staff began to highly irritate us. Every time we asked for assistance it took a while to actually be able to understand - if at all. Definitely would not recommend this hotel if you are English and are not able to speak French. Also found the attitude of a fair few members of staff stunk terribly - the cleaners seeming most polite.,Date of stay: August 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/km20
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lisa-MJ123 wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Price/Quality very good,We've had a great experience at Kenzi Club. First of all the food was delicious. I can imagine the same dishes appear on the buffet if you stay here for two weeks but that's very typical for a lot of all-in hotels. We only stayed for five days and everyday the buffet was different and typical maroccan specialties were served. Very friendly personnel especially Karim stole our heart ;).  The room was beautiful as well and the animation really good. There is aerobics twice a day the possibility to play waterpolo beachvolley etc...  Only one thing: the organised tour to the Ourika valley was very disappointing. Very touristic and we hardly saw the valley itself definitely a no-go !

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,David L wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Brilliant ....,We have just returned (29 July 2012) from a five nights break at The Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. This hotel was absolutely brilliant. Food was served throughout the day and the choice well ... too much. The staff were very polite the swimming pools were great and free information about where to go in Marrakech was so very helpful. Overall we had a great time and we would go again. The only thing you have to watch is the variance of taxi charges. To the airport 150-200 and to the Medina 50-100max. You have to tell the taxi drivers how much you will pay and stick to it. Overall we had a great time. There were a few wingers in the hotel one complained about an ant in the bedroom. Hey you're in Morocco get a life this happens! Brilliant!!!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Preet84 wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Great Value for money,Just returned from a 4 night stay at this resort and I really liked this resort infact I am really going to miss it! Before I went I had read the previous reviews so was a bit sceptical but the resort exceeded my expectations. We got a great deal on this via lastminute.com and it worked out around £350 each including flight and all inlcusive accomodation.    Check in:  Check in process was pretty smooth and as soon as we arrived into the impressive lobby we were given some refreshing non alcoholic mojitos and taken to our room by a golf buggy which was fun! In the room we also found a complimentary bottle of wine and a fruit basket which was nice little touch!    The room:  The room itself was pretty standard nothing amazing but clean enough. The room had rose petals on the bed and even in the toilet which was kind of sweet! Very basic furnishings and a small flat screen TV (although only 1 or 2 English channels). I have to say I did not like the shower very much. The pressure of the shower was very low especially when you put it on a higher temperature but this was just as well as we did not have a shower curtain which made it a bit difficult! On the first night I managed to flood the entire bathroom without even getting in the shower! It was leaking from somewhere but couldn't for the life of me figure out where from! The issue fixed itself by morning though as that didn't happen again. The shower was bearable at best! Apart from that the room was cleaned daily and some lovely shampoo and shower gel left daily too. The air conditioning worked well which helped keep us cool each night. Bed a little bit uncomfortable for my liking but absolutely huge!    The food:  I was very impressed with food. An absolutely huge selection of food for all 3 meals a day! Good quality food and very tasty especially the desserts-wow! I understand the reviews which say the food was very repetitive but I guess everyone has their own personal taste so you end up going for the same kind of food each time. If you tried different stuff every day you wouldn't get bored! In addition to the 3 meals a day you also get crepes and pastries at 4pm. I had read about previous reviewers saying that there were flies all around the food. Yes there were bees everywhere but this is Morocco! The food buffet was indoors and if you eat indoors the bees and flies are not a problem. When you have drinks by the pool that is when they become problematic- must be all the sugar that attracts them!    Drinks:  Unlimited drinks all day and evening including cocktails. The alcoholic drinks are very strong! The soft drinks very sweet and full of sugar but when its all included you can't really complain! Fresh fruit juices with breakfast are lovely!    Staff:  Very friendly staff however the majority of them don't speak English but they try and help as much as they can. They are all a pretty lively bunch and are always smiling. There is always plenty of staff available to help everywhere and all wear the tell tale orange uniforms so are easy to spot! Maybe avoid wearing an orange top though as you may get mistaken to be a member of staff!    Entertainment:  Live singer at night who is pretty good but always the same one so gets a bit boring after a few nights. The atmosphere in the resort is lovely at night and I loved sitting there and soaking it all in. One night we were there the staff put on a cabaret show which was really very good although again the majority of it was in French but we still enjoyed it and thought it was a great idea.    Shuttle:  Got this twice on the way to the medina and it was very efficient and didn't take long at all. I has read that this hotel was really far out but I didn't think so at all. It is around 15 minutes max from the airport 10 mins to the medina and there are cabs waiting right outside new hotel. We always got a cab back from the square for around 3 or 4 quid! Only problem is the hotel is pretty new and the cab drivers speak very little English so they find the hotel very difficult to find sometimes.    Spa:  A bit expensive for Morocco but reasonable in comparison to UK prices. The staff only spoke French though so it was very difficult to communicate with them during the treatments. On top of that you would just see them huddling together and laughing at us which was very odd! The treatments themselves however were very good. The staff just need a bit more training in how to communicate in basic English and customer service!    Pools:  The pools were very lively and the slides were loads of fun for adults and children! You do need to get there early to get a sun bed as they do get taken very quickly. The towels were a bit smelly which made me wonder if they bothered to wash them (I chose not to dwell on it).    Miscellaneous:    Was really not impressed with the fact that we had to pay to use the safe in the room- this is the first time I have had to do this and I travela lot!    Overall though it was a very postive experience and If I ever return to Marrakech then I would most definitely stay here.,Date of stay: August 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Preet84

The wifi was not great in the rooms and mostly worked in the lobby. The food was great but yes it did get old (even if they had a variation each day). Some of the food was cooked with a certain olive oil that made each dish cooked with that oil taste terrible. However the pool the room the activities the welcome drink the bar and the beautiful resort all made up for these little flaws. The spa was BEAUTIFUL the massage was fantastic the gym is great with a beautiful indoor pool.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,tedinthebar wrote a review Aug 2012,30,Not impressed,Having decided on a quick 7 day break we independently booked the flight and hotelalong with a private transfer via the hotel.  Nothing came and the hotel told us to get a taxi.  Whilst i appreciate some people find hagling part of the charm of such a countryI find it tediousespecially after a long journeyand especially when we had made arrangements with the hotel for a car to collect us.    Reception did not wish to discuss this problem on our arrival which was a ongoing trend throughout our stayextreemly unhelpfull.  Where else would you find a Hotel that told you they had no local currency and you would have to find some elsewhere.  The room was clean but resembled an original travel lodge.    The poolside bar and only day bar was run badly covered in wasps which could have been controlled with a little management skill as to keeping the bar top clean and putting cordials and juices away when not in use.    Though a family hotel most of the children were European and did not over power the immediate area.  The restaurant was a little disorganised whilst as mentioned below the variety of food on offer was large much was overcooked and in one instance chicken undercooked.The manager seemed a little put out when I suggested he remove the tray and even more put out when I insisted he remove the tray which he did and gave back to the Chef to cook some more.    The bar glassware was filthy only ever being rinsed out and from what we could see never washed with hot water.    If you have never been to an African city then it is perhaps worth a go but its really no different to all the rest.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RemyLeBeau_UK wrote a review Aug 2012,50,"Five-Star for a short break with hidden gems, stars would begin to fall for any longer than four days...",My partner and I travelled to this hotel between 28 July to 1 August 2012 after finding a great deal via LowCostHolidays.com which meant including flights the holiday was a little over £400 per person for the five days.    The hotel's website and LowCost claim this hotel is a five star property and I don't dispute this but I do believe that you'll only maintain the five star feeling over a short break (before the buffet style meals get a bit repetitive) and if you decide to pay surcharges for some of the more exclusive elements of the hotel such as the great Spa service the private pool and sun garden and the very authentic Moroccan table d'hôte restuarant which you must book in advance to experience.    If you do book a spa treatment or two into your shorter holiday and a meal at the table d'hôte restaurant then I'm certain you'll come away with as close to five star service you can get for the steals you can find for this hotel.    The hotel is also in very good distance to the city or Marrakech and there are taxis outside of the hotel (be prepared to barter with them as even agreeing a cost before you get in the taxi will often have them change their price at arrival). Also - we noticed taxi drivers told us that the Souks were closed (when they weren't) just so they could drop us off at a shopping arcade in the centre instead (which wasn't too much of a problem as we got to work through the streets of Marrakech to find the Souks).    The hotel is very Western (and I do have to stay that it was nice having French German and Italian holiday makers around me rather than a lot of loutish Brits) and my partner and I (both male) never were made to feel uncomfortable by the staff during our stay here.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wednesbury, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RemyLeBeau_UK
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,AS1992 wrote a review Aug 2012,30,More like a 3 star,The Kenzi club mainly operates in French. All communication is in French even down to announcing what show is on that night that is told in French to the French. We stayed for 2 weeks and for the first week we had no idea of the shows taking place in the conference room because nothing was communicated to us and there was notie board showing the times/days etc for evening entertainment although there was one providing daily activities. Due to this after the first couple of nights we were pretty bored with the bar area. Another issue we faced was that the clocks were put back one hour due to Ramadan of which there was a notice in reception once again in French. Therefore we had no idea of the time difference until we turned up an hour early for lunch.. I think this was pretty poor service from the hotel given that they knew when we checked in that the time difference would affect us and failed to warn us instead we relied on google. While i understand that predominatley the guests are french there weee quite a few english people there and not a lot is done to fully accomodate the communication between the language barrier. Another failure of service from the hotel was their choice to not tell us about the compulsory government tax until the end of the holiday. We had been made aware that some guests paid it and we witnessed it when friends of ours checked in but we assumed that ours had been included in the price or alike unfortunately that wasn't the case as we were informed on our departure.  I got the feeling that on arrival the reception staff could not do enough for you but as soon as arrival is over the story was not the same.  The fail to inform you of little things like dress attire for the restaurant yes it may be obvious but it seems unfair to be told off almost for doing something that you weren't made aware of beforehand.  The food was ok quite a lot of fish if I'm honest. Children should be more supervised in the food area.  Overall it a good holiday but certain parts did let the hotel down.,Date of stay: July 2012,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AS1992
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jayne-Enfield wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Great value all-inclusive,Visited Kenzi Club in June 2012 for 4 nights using a Groupon voucher. Great value. Large clean rooms plentiful food of all varieties unlimited alcohol helpful staff large swimming pools and lots of additional sports/activites if you wanted to join in. I went with an open mind bearing in mind some of the previous poor reviews. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised - I believe he poor reviews are totally unjustified. Food claimed to be same every night - well yes that's true but the variety is huge. If you have a little bit of everything every night then your plate would be the same but if you choose selectively then each night your meal could vary from pasta with various sauces burger and chips omolette and salad meat fish or veg kebabs with rice meat targine fish targine or lentil curry with couscous pizza and chips prawn salad egg mayonaise-and this is just to name a few of the combinations with such a huge range. I found staff helpful and courtious - if you are nice to them then they are nice back. Am guessing if you are a rude and obnoxious guest your reception may be different but personally I can see no reason to be ill mannered to staff even if you are asking for something - they always responded well to my requests. I note query around groupon offer which should come with mint tea on arrival and bottle of wine in room. We got the cocktail as we filled out forms on arrival but no bottle of wine - this was not a problem as this is an all inclusive so all you have to do is walk out and order anything you like from the bar- I wasn't going to get upset about it - you can always bring back dink yourself if you are really that bothered about wine in your room. Groupon came with a free massage - very lovely although the staff were a little abrupt in the spa but mainly because their english was not good and communication difficult. Flies on food have been mentioned. I agree that there were flies in the dining room - not sure how you could really keep them out in such a large area with doors open and people coming in and out. I don't see it as a problem - no more than flies in your garden when you are having a BBQ - occassionally they will land which I think is inevitable in a hot country but I certainly did not see swarms covering food as claimed. I did not experience any tummy problems. The entertainments team were a bit hi-de-hi spoke in french and English - we chose not to join in as we were looking for a quiet break for a couple of days just sitting around the pool eating and drinking - entertainments team were not intrusive - we just kept away from the pool where the main activities were. Those that did join in seemed to be having a good time. All in all a great value short break which I would have no hesitation recommending.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Enfield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayne-Enfield

Fantastic Stay.,We stayed at the hotel in February 2012 and had a fantastic holiday there after our experience at the hotel I can not understand some of the negative reviews the hotel has been given. We had an all inclusive deal which was very good value all drinks were included and you got as much wine as you wanted at dinner they would happily provide a second bottle and the red wine was very nice. The service was very good all the staff we spoke to were very polite and spoke english to us the people behind the reception were very helpful when we asked them to give us an idea how much we should pay for a taxi to go into the center of Marrakech and to the airport. I can't understand how people can say there is no choice of food for the buffet there is so much choice you could easily have a different meal every day if you were staying for a week! The food was very nice and we had no complaints. The staff were sometimes very busy so you had to wait a little while to get a drink but it was only because they were serving so many people at one time. I think its a good to leave a small tip for the restaurant staff which is easy to forget to do when you have booked an all inclusive deal. The shuttle bus into town is a good service although taxis back from Marrakech are very reasonably priced if you haggle a bit with the drivers. The hotel has a brilliant view of the Atlas Mountains which we didn't realise before we got there and has plenty of green garden areas to walk around and lots of seating. The room was lovely very big with a good bathroom and balcony.

The rooms were lovely always cleaned daily fresh towels and water left in your fridge for your return after a day lazing on the sun beds. Staff were attentive in the restaurant with taking away finished plates more drinks when needed the lot. Bar staff were also very good at eeping your driks topped up .. ok sometimes when they were busy ( as it was fully booked when we were there ) you had to wait a few minutes for them to clear tables and them come back with your drinks but that is nothing !!    Food was also very good considering the chefs would be cooking for hundreds of people  there was plenty to choose from and was all fresh  and pasta etc cooked infront of you. woudl ay one thing to get to lunnch and dinner as soon as it is open as when it is busy ques do happen !!    Around the pool was also nice we stayed by the quiter pool but did venture to go on the slides ones or twice you got fresh beach towels also everyday so no need to take your own !!!    I would also say book your hotel transfers from 247 transfers before you go alot easier and cheaper !  All in all i can not say one bad word about this hotel would deffinatly recomend it and we will be going back next year !!,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeriB511

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Julia wrote a review Jul 2012,40,Lovely hotel,We have just returned from a 3 night break. After reading some negative reviews we were pleasantly surprised.  The hotel is very clean with lots of comfortable seating areas. Our room was lovely and it's very quiet so no problem sleeping the air-conditioning was also very quiet which is unusual.    We used the sun beds around the quieter pool which is huge we did use the other pool to go on the slides which was fun and it was much livelier with music & water aerobics etc.  It is true that the hotel is very French with little English spoken I don't think this is a negative though after all we are in a foreign country!  When they say all inclusive it literally means all in it was fantastic - if you asked for water you were given a cold 2 litre bottle which was much needed in 46 degree heat. The food was also amazing I can't believe people say there's no choice there's everything you can think of.  We had a 50 minute massage at the spa (not free obviously) and would def recommend it was lovely.  If venturing out there are always plenty of taxi's and they are very reasonable less than £5 to the Medina  All in all a very pleasant stay & I would definately recommend this hotel,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Edington, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlintell
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Louise F wrote a review Jul 2012,50,Outstanding,We will begin from the start. The hotel is a maximum of 15 minutes from the airport so you are there almost immediately. You can see planes going over when you are lounging by the pool but far enough away for it not to be noisy. Was quite exciting trying to guess which plane was what.    As we entered the hotel it was immaculate so beautiful and tidy. Aswel as them being extremely clean. We were greeted by security who took our bags to the luggage hold and then Given a Mojito and told by reception that we could explore the hotel and get some lunch as our rooms wouldn't be ready for another hour. We arrived at midday so it wasnt a problem as check in usually isn't til 2.    FOOD. Well whoever writes bad review on the food at this hotel must be extremely fussy. Food was varied every night and absolutely amazing. Would recommend the morrocon restaurant especially on Thursday night. It's amazing esp the chicken pastilla as my boyfriend says they are to die for lol think he fell in love lol. It is an extra 100 mad which is around £7.50 each but worth it as there is 6 courses way too much for us but if you pick ul enjoy.    A good tip is to TIP. The waiters are so attentive anyway but they were extra attentive to us as we tipped after the first night. Something we do if we feel service is good. Baring in mind we only tipped around 20 mad which is about £1.40 they were over the moon and from then on we never went without an empty glass and every lunch time & dinner we had rose wine (which is very drinkable) by the bottle waiting for us at a table.    Pools and sunbeds are great and towel provided daily. You just need to get the from the towel hut. We used the spa and had a rhassoul wrap (like a mud wrap) and a 50 minute massage each. All we could say after is OH. MY. GOD. It was amazing. Recommend it to everyone. Perfect variety to the holiday.    The only downfall we can communicate is that This hotel is very French. It can be quite intimidating if you are a reserved couple or group however we found it quite amusing trying to communicate but as they started to realise we were English they tried to use as much as they knew.    Overall we would say this hotel is worth the money and the break. We have even recommended to a friend who is looking to go morroco. Give it a go and see for yourself. Dontbe out off by the bad reviews there obviously miserable people lol,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, England, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisef339

It was my first package holiday (I've always been more of an independent traveler) and I was very impressed and would definitely come here again. Probably helps that we got a good deal. Good room with great views lovely pools and lots of comfy beds around them lots of activities good fresh food and friendly staff. Oh and fantastic weather.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kay P wrote a review Jul 2012,10,PLEASE PLEASE READ!,Well here we go our first ever trip advisor review. I have been on so many holidays and never felt the need to do this but we felt that on this occasion it was imperative to give this hotel a review!    When we first got to the hotel we were told our rooms where not ready so to have lunch whilst they got this ready for us. Lunch was disgusting! We thought we would just have some bread but it felt hard as rock. (regret not taking cupa soups with us but saying that there is no kettle in the room!) Food is the same for lunch and dinner and by the second day you no longer want the 'all inclusive' that you have paid for as its boring bland and flies and birds are roaming free in the food hall.    When we came back to go to the rooms we had to wait for 15 minutes before someone attended to us.    Wifi well that’s one bar that u can get near the reception and that is about it if lucky.    Animation team speaks in French so you have no clue what they are saying.    We ordered a lemonade from the pool bar the guy gave us a cup with floating wasp (beware of wasps at bar!) and when asked to change he said it’s only a wasp!    If you don’t speak French then basically they don’t give a [--] about you!    Their service was ridiculous. Hotel was 4/5 stars but what is the point if you don’t have the service to go with it? Travelodge is better!    Another thing as you’re just about to check out to get to the airport they ask for local tax! Please be aware and check with your travel agent if this is needed. We really suffered here. Had a bad stomach for the entire trip.    To summarise would we consider coming again? NO! No way. Would we ever recommend? NO. We felt this hotel really let Marrakesh down and being honest I am happy to back in Britain with horrible weather but friendly people!,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayP67
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,eagertoseetheworld wrote a review Jul 2012,50,"Beautiful Hotel, Fantastic Holiday and Great Value",Myself and my fiance returned from a weeks stay at the Agdal Medina on 11/07/12. We found it to be a beautiful hotel on lovely grounds. We did have a few niggles with our stay but nothing like anything of the previous reviewers have had.    Check in/out - On arrival we were greeted in to the beautiful lobby with iced non-alcoholic mojitos. The check in process was very easy and we were immediately given our inclusive bands and as we arrived at 9.30pm we left our cases with the doormen and wandered off to the restaurant to have dinner before we went to our room. After we finished dinner we were taken with our cases by golf buggy to our room which was on the ground floor north west corner of Riad la Roserie (Riad 4) which is the furthest from the main buildings. Call reception when you are ready to check out and they will send down a golf buggy for you and your cases.    Accomodation - We loved our room as it was very quiet and out of the way of the complex but still within 2 minutes walk. The room was clean and spacious and was fully cleaned and fresh towels provided every day. We had twin beds which we actually enjoyed as they were very comfortable and even though the air-conditioning was very good we did not want to be all sticky next to each other. For british and american travellers MBC is a good film channel broadcasting 24hrs in english with Arabic subtitles. We watched several decent films from the last few years during our stay. Just to note we used the digital safe in the wardrobe every day (the instructions are on the front in english so no need to ring reception to activate) and were not even asked whether we'd used it on check out so we did not pay extra for it. Nor were we asked to pay any city tax on check out despite our tour operator notifying us we would need to we were not asked to pay any extras at all. We had a patio with table and 2 chairs with a washing line and as we are both smokers we borrowed an ashtray from the bar so we could just step outside for a smoke. The cleaners even brushed the patio and emptied the ash tray every day. The bathroom was nice with a proper toilet and toilet roll (which if you venture out of the hotel is hard to come by) bidet washbasin large 5' x 4' vanity mirror with lights full size bath power shower decent hairdryer and shaver socket. The only issue we had with the room was the key cards. On 4 occasions coming back to our room the key cards had deprogrammed themselves and we couldn't get access which was a bit of a pain when we were the furthest from reception. We did get decent wi-fi in our room until the second to last day but then it was very tempremental. Wi-fi in the lobby and bar was always good. Note the lights on vanity mirror are positioned awkwardly to do your make up and hair so best to take a small cheap vanity mirror on stand (I noted previous comments and picked one up for £1). I didn't take straightners myself as when we visited it was 40 degrees plus but taking a mirror would also solve the problem of having a plug socket next to a mirror.    Food - The choice was vast. We found it very good in quality even for my fiance who is a very picky eater. However even with all the choice and us taking 5 trips out by the end of the week we were sick of it. I found the fresh soups really good as they were different every day. The beef and the potato tagine and rices were rather nice. The pizza although nicely freshly made was not to our taste but we think that this was the cheese as they don't have mozzarella or hard cheeses. The drinks were very good with a selection of juices coca-cola branded soft drinks local beer wine bottled water at lunch and dinner with the addition of fresh coffee mint tea and champagne at breakfast. The juice at breakfast is fresh but at lunch and dinner it is from concentrate. Just to clear up the situation with the snacks... it's the main pool bar that serves snacks in the morning and the it's snack bar which is located outside the left hand side of the restaurant that serves afternoon snacks. We didn't fancy eating in the Moroccan Al a carte restaurant after seeing the menu at reception as one of the set menus included brains and although we wouldn't have ordered it we probably couldn't have stomached watching anyone else eating it in front of us. However we were told by other guests that it was very nice.    Pools - There are 3 and they are all clean and well maintained. The main pool is seperated in to 2 with the main part being where the slides are and the smaller part being by the entertainment station and used part of the day for activities such as water aerobics. This is generally used by families. The second pool is much quieter away from the music and closer to the pool bar and used by couples and adult groups. The third pool is for small children and is located behind the slides. You can pick up a towel from the animation station just give them your room number. There are loads of sunbeds and cabanas. If you want your pick of where you sit you need to get up go down and put your towel out before 10am. If you are happy to have a sunlouger in the grass area 10 yards from the second pool by the bar you can get away with going down at 1pm as we did when we ventured out a few mornings. You need to put your towel in the laundry baskets on the exits from the pool on leaving. They are keen to get these back from you so all the orange pool towels go to be laundered together seperately at night from all the white room towels.    Staff - If you go out to Morocco and point blankly refuse to speak anything but english you are more than likely going to encounter a few problems. Morocco is a officially firstly Arabic and secondly French speaking country. In mountain and desert regions they are mostly Berber which has recently been re-recognised as an third official language. English and Spanish are fourth languages in Morocco in general. With Morocco being occupied by the French for so long French is very widely used and 80% of the tourists in Marrakech itself and particularily this hotel are French. All of the staff speak basic english but it really helped us to first greet and give basic plesantries in French. We then found them extremely helpful except for a minority of 3 female pool and waiting on staff. The bar staff made a real effort to chat to us and the waiting on staff were always making jokes with us and spoke more english with us as the week went on. We certainly think this is due to the effort made on our part to speak a little french. A lot of the staff are actually french not moroccan with some Italians and Tunisians. We picked up some basic arabic whilst out on trips which went down a storm in Marrakech itself. English is more frequently spoken in Jemaa el Fna the Souks Medina and Gueliz and even our caleche driver could speak a little english.    Getting out and about - If you want to explore Marrakech itself we recommend you hire out an inexpensive calache. We utilised the free shuttle to get into Marrakech iteself. Again the driver was extremely helpful after we had exchanged pleasantries in French and arranged our return some 3 hours later. We went out by caleche in the evening around the Medina and Gueliz and also in the morning to le Jardin Majorelle (not to be missed) and the Menara Gardens which were both very enjoyable trips. We did go in the evening to Jemaa el Fna for the night market which was amazing and again not to be missed but very disconcerting at times. It's very busy and noisy but if you are polite you will have no problems.    The best part of our holiday was the 2 trips we took out by 4x4 into the Atlas Mountains. Firstly to Ait Benhaddou which was amazing and secondly to the Ouzoud Cascade which was also amazing and well worth the money. We arranaged this from the UK and will review seperately.    Overall - We had a fantastic weeks stay at the Agdal Medina. It really depends on what you are looking for from a hotel but having seen the other hotels and Riads in Marrakech our personal preference would not be to stay anywhere else as we found it to be a blissful relaxing retreat away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech itself. So far as the star rating goes I've stayed in 4 star hotels in Tunisia and Turkey which are comparable countries and the Adgal Medina far excelled their standards. If it was in the UK it would probably be a 4 star. Needless to say if we go back to Marrakech we will be going back to the Agdal Medina.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Chester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eagertoseetheworld

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Leish007 wrote a review Jul 2012,10,"NOT for couples, NOT 4.5 star, NOT a recommendation from us.",Well here we go our first ever tripadvisor review. My wife and I have been on holiday 9 times in the last 2 years and never felt the need to do this partly through laziness but generally due to the fact that we agree with the reviews and ratings already posted on Tripadvisor.  Not sure what the best way of approaching this is but I think breaking the review into pro's & con's is probably easiest.    CONS.    1. Cleanliness. On day 2 we returned to our room to discover a large dead cockroach being consumed by around 200 ants. My wife behaving in the appropriately womanly fashion ran away back to the swimming pool and left me instructions to 'deal with it'. I phoned reception (no housekeeping number available) and explained our problem I was promptly told 'hold on' and was put on hold. The phone was then hung up. I phoned reception a further 5 times each time only to have the phone put down on me. I then tried the managers office No reply. Irritated by the fact that nobody wanted to deal with our issue I walked down to reception and once again explained our problem. The shift manager came up to our room apologised and said he would have it cleaned up and would move us to another room to make my wife feel more comfortable (he could not guess where our infestation of insects had come from). I was told to fetch my wife re-pack our bags and he would have us moved to a 'nice room'. By this time the housekeeping manager had joined him so naturally I thought job done and wondered off to fetch my wife. We returned 10 minutes later to find our room wide open with nobody there. All our possessions available for anyone who fancied them. Insects had not been cleaned up but had been joined by a few more of their ant friends who fancied a meal of cockroach. Nonetheless we packed then returned to reception. 30 minutes later we where shown to our new room. 2 single beds made up as such pushed together & a cracking view of the building site next door. A firm no!! 30 minutes later a new manager had shown us to our third room it had a strange smell but we thought at least it was clean and had the correct bed. Having wasted around 2 hours of my afternoon trying to sort out a five minute problem we were given a voucher for the hotels 'a la carte Moroccan resteraunt' as means of apology. Room 3 maintained its 'drain like odour' for the remainder of our stay. Nice.    2. Butlins on speed. We visited in early July. Hundreds of kids everywhere no place of refuge for adults or couples even the evening bar which seemed to be there solely for the use of a children's disco (ages 2 & up). We felt overwhelmed by children and left the resort at any available opportunity. Hotel management if you are reading this we spoke with many couples who felt the same.    3. Service. With the exception of a couple of great members of staff (evening bar & restaurant) TERRIBLE. The worst we have ever encountered. Do not expect good service at this hotel as you will not receive it. During our stay we witnessed several people exploding at reception (always in french so not sure why but we saw a few unhappy customers). This is a real surprise as when you leave the hotel Morrocan's are a friendly and helpful people.    4. A la carte Moroccan restaurant. Although we where given this as means of apology for our encounter with the insects I would not recommend paying the extra money for it. We did not eat our entree and saw three family's walk out to go to the buffet next door when presented with theirs.    5. General standard of room. NOT 4.5 star not by a long way. good 3 star at best.    6. Availability of towel's/sun beds. After 10.00am you have had it. No sun beds and you will be lucky if you don't need to wait for a towel. When we asked the Spa manager if anyone could help she replied 'not my problem - see reception' (10 minute walk away) Another example of the shining standard of service.    Pro's    1. Marrakech. Brilliant would come again but just not to this hotel.    2. Shuttle service in & out of Marrakech on the hour with friendly drivers. (our escape from the hotel)    3. All inclusive buffet Despite some of the other reviews I have read the standard of food at the buffet was of an O.K. standard. Plenty of choice & variety. We have had worse. My only issue would be that it is set out like a large school canteen but in hindsight this is probably to suit the hundreds of kids that are running around it unsupervised at all times    4. Drink measures. Bar and waiting staff where generally good with this although its only local beverages they always came in a large measure. If you asked for a white wine you got a full bottle in a cooler with ice.    5. Gardens. Attractive and well maintained. (except for the hundreds of kids running about them).    To summarise would we consider coming again? NO! no way. Would we ever recommend?  NO. We felt this hotel really let Marrakech down.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leish007
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Louise C wrote a review Jul 2012,40,Sure i stayed at a different hotel to some! Fabulous!,I have just returend from a week at the Kenzie with my partner and another couple and have to say i cannot fault the hotel at all. We arrived early at 11am and were greeted with a mint tea in the beautiful reception and given our All Inclusive bands Our room was not ready ( understandable as check in was not until 2pm)and our bags stored safely. We were pointed in the direction of the snack bar and advised to come back after 12 and our rooms may be ready. We had a drink and took in our surroundings and wandered back over to reception where we were shown to a golf buggy and taken to our rooms (ground gloor in block 100-120) and our bags were brought for us. The rooms themselves were beautiful we had a huuuuuge super kingsize bed and our friends had a twin room with 2 larger than average singles. All the rooms looked out onto a beautiful courtyard with a fountain. We had bottles of water on arrival a fridge to keep drinks in and aircon. Only slight issue is that there are no plugs near any mirrors in the room ( for straighteners etc) but there is a hairdryer fitted in the bathroom. Rooms cleaned and bedding/towels changed daily.    Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner is typical buffet style and there was masses of choice. Breakfast = fruit cereal freshly made omlettes pancakes and honey and loads of coffee and fruit juices. Lunch was pretty much the same as Dinner which was Pasta bar different Meat every day ( we had lamb chops steak chicken wings liver and homemade chicken 'burgers' with chips/rice/veg etc Pizza paninis huge salad selection and a wide range of Tagines every day.    They even had a snack hour in the afternoon where you got fresh doughnuts ( huge) and pancakes croissants and paninis but there was generally a    The only thing that spoilt the experience were the french guests who did not seem to understand the concept of a queue and pushed to the front while everyone else waited patiently for their turn!    The waiting staff were friendly and generally quick to get drinks and open bottles/clear tables even when it got very busy over lunch.    The pool areas are great  liked the idea that they provided you with towels and found it amusing rather than annoying that you had to give room numbers for towels and then put them in the basket at the end of the day my friends partner even got chased by a 'security guard' because he still had his towel round his waist! ( much giggling at this)    Always plenty of sunbeds even though people were reserving them early and never came back to them all day. Loved the day beds!    The main bar was well stocked and never had any problem getting served with a good variety of drinks the rose wine that was served with meals and in the bars was lovely and the vodka long drink very strong! - staff always friendly and we were fine with the fact that the bar closed at 11.30 as despite being 2 couples in our mid twentys we were not after a rowdy drinking holiday! ( why come to somewhere as beautiful as marrakech for that?!)    We made use of the free shuttle into the centre of marrakech but got a taxi back ( 80 dirhams for 4 people) as you only get 1.5 hours with the shuttle.    We made use of the safety deposit box which was about £2 a day ( nothign at all )    All in all we had a fantastic holiday and would definately stay here again.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/177LouiseC

Food was quite varied but not great quality  just about average . It was also 'moroccan' style with some odd flavours. Food often cold so best to get in early. Pool lovely  large and very easy to get a sun bed and parasol in June. It is a bit out on a limb but easy to get a free shuttle or taxi.  There is a nearby shopping centre (about a mile) so dont walk in the baking heat like we did  taxi 30Drm.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,shaka316 wrote a review Jul 2012,10,READ BEFORE YOU BOOK!!!!!!,This hotel is not a 5 star hotel in any country I would say 3/4 star would be more accurate. I have stayed in hotels on 5 different continents and this one is the WORST ONE EVER!!!    Room    Our room had a bad smell which made it difficult to sleep we complained three days in a row. It would take a number of phone calls and a visit to reception for someone to come to our room and use a candle as an air freshner. On the third night they finally agreed to a room change at midnight we decide to switch in the morning. The next day I visited reception and they just looked at me with a blank face and asked me to speak to the other receptionist third receptionist had no idea and looked like she had never heard of a room change. One receptionist lady point blankly ignored me and walked to the office behind the desk she would pop her head out every few mins to she if I had gone very strange. The third one then asked me to stand aside while she saw to other French guests I patiently stood at the side for over 25 mins while she saw over 10 other guest. I finally lost my patience and voiced my annoyance she then told me to see the first receptionist I saw and he sorted out our room change.        Food/Entertainment    Basically DON'T get the all inclusive it’s a TOTAL waste of money all you get is pizza pasta panini fish chips and soup every single day for lunch and dinner. There are very little labels out saying what each dish is and don’t bother asking the chefs they literally ignore you and walk off. The bar staff are very very rude most of the staff are rude to you. You can be waiting for up to 30 mins for a drink while you watch the boring entertainment. If you look around at the guests all you can see is people half asleep or bored out of their minds.        We spoke to a few other English coupes at the hotel and they all said the same thing I hate to say this but I quote “if you don’t speak French you are a second class guest here”.        I have been to many countries where English is the 3 or 4 language and I have made it work. Outside the hotel in new and old town every single person you talk to on the street in the market place and waiters in restaurant they all speak English. You walk through the front door of this hotel and you are total lost.        I would recommend you stay in new town or near the Atlas Mountains it’s around the same price and you will enjoy it much more.,Date of stay: July 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaka316
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,The_Real_Cruiser wrote a review Jul 2012,40,Just nice to get away to the sun in October for a good price,We needed somewhere to go and not having done all inclusive before we were a little apprehensive. We needn't have been. Ok what do you expect with an all inclusive...? There was unlimited food and it wasn't bad at all. There was unlimited drink but don't expect top brands this was all local versions. We got on well with the bar staff and they would mix anything you wanted. The accommodation was very good cleaned every day... Additional extras was the massage parlour and the 'real food' restaurant - the real food was traditional Moroccan. Two pools and I believe there are slides there now. The entertainment was a bit repetitive and if we had stayed there more than a week I may have started to twitch.    Marrakesh is a mix of old and new. We went to the old part and had our own guide for the day apparently attached to the hotel. We quickly realised he was only taking us to the places where he got kick backs. It was a pleasant walk around though. But BEWARE: fortunately I am ok with a little bartering but if you go to one of the rug makers beware for HIGH HIGH PRESSURE selling. Their promise as we entered was that we didn't have to buy anything if we didn't want to but wrapped up our tour of the place with a sit down and look at 6 trillion rugs.Then we had to deselect the ones we didn't want lol. At the end the guy was practically begging for a sale or at least a generous tip. So go careful.    Would we go again? Well to be honest probably not to Kenzie - not because it was dire but just because it wasn't that special either. As a one-off I would definitely say 'go try it'. We are going to go for a small hotel in the middle of Marrakesh next time. It's about £10 per night....,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Inverness, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Real_Cruiser
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Megan C wrote a review Jul 2012,20,"Inclusive, yes. All inclusive, not even close.","To start off this was a vacation that my boyfriend and I had less than no control over in terms of the choice for a resort and time of year. There were certain circumstances that lead us here and by the time we had booked our non-refundable $3400 flight from the US we were committed to coming. So we made it a working vacation so it didn't feel like a complete waste.    There is no way that this is a 4+ star resort. So right off the bat I feel as if the star quality is completely unrepresentative of the quality of the resort and misleading to potential guests. I've been to a few other all inclusives and while I understand that they need to keep an eye on the bottom line Kenzi Club Agdal Medina makes it blatantly obvious that the bottom line is all they're keeping their eye on.    Food  I am a vegetarian so it can be difficult for me to eat when we go on vacation but generally it's been easy these past few trips. At this resort they do a terrible job of labeling the food at the buffet (which is the only type of restaurant they have that is included in the AI rate) so I pretty much at the same thing every day for lunch and dinner. I don't think I'll eat pizza for a few months after these past 10 days. Nowadays you really need to label food as there are lots of people with dietary restrictions food allergies and the like. Something as simple as a little vegetable in the corner of the card to indicate vegetarian would have been fine. And the food was just really bland and boring. My BF and I cook pretty elaborate dinners every night and love spices and flavors. I was craving my homemade Indian and Ethiopian food the whole time we were here.    And they have a ""snack bar"" but they only make crepes with sweet caramel or chocolate toppings. Variety would have been nice. And while people were still in line for the crepes they'd just decide they were done for the day and not serve them to people who had waited 15 minutes.    Rooms  We stayed in 3 different rooms at this resort. The first room had two double beds pushed together and we wanted to be in a room with a king size bed. So they moved us from building 1 right at the front all the way to the furthest corner of the resort in building 4. We got to that room and the air conditioning didn't work the wifi didn't work and our sliding door to the balcony had a broken lock so anyone could break in if they wanted to. So they ""fixed"" all 3 things the next day though none of the were actually fixed. The A/C worked for about 10 minutes and then started blowing out warm air again the wifi only worked if we walked out of our room and the door wasn't fixed. We went to the front desk several times to ask for a new room since they never fixed any of our problems. Finally after 2 more days they moved us to a new room. We had the internet and a locking sliding door and while the A/C was better it's not what I would consider cool. The lobby had nice cool air blowing through it and it actually felt refreshing walking in there. Our room never felt cool our entire trip but complaints seemed to fall on deaf ears so we just dealt with the weak A/C for the trip.    And they only provide 2 large bath towels for the room which is incredibly strange to me. I like having 2 one for my hair one for my body. But they provide 1 per person.    The bed is as hard as a rock. I never felt particularly comfortable sleeping and had to put a pillow at the end of the bed to try and make myself somewhat comfortable.    Drinks & Bar  The drinks were pretty terrible here. They actually ran out of vodka and rum one night which was a first for me at a resort. And the bar closed at 11:30 pm every night and they were slow slow slow when it came to getting you drinks and kept the bartenders to a minimum to keep those drinks (read dollars) coming out slowly. There is no such thing as juice at this resort. What they call juice I don't think ever spent a stage of its production cycle as an actual fruit.    The best? One night they went around telling everyone at the bar about the club they were opening on the property that night and how convenient it opened at 11:30 pm right when the other bar closed. We walked over and went it went up to the bar and I saw a menu with drinks and prices. So they charged for drinks at this place and overcharged in my opinion. 50 dirhams for a beer and not a good one is way too steep for an AI resort. This is one reason for my saying they are really obvious when it comes to their bottom line.    Pool  The dreaded towels. I've never been to a resort that is so stingy and strict about the number of towels a guest can have at the pool. They even go so far as to have a list of all of the room numbers with the number of guests in each room to ensure that you only get one towel per person. They even have guards sitting at the exits to the pools to make sure that you don't walk away from the pool with a towel. And they will go so far as to stop you and make you take off the towel and hand it to them.    Non-Smokers Beware  It felt like every other person at this place smoked cigarettes and they smoked them everywhere by the pool in the bar outside the bar. .    Wristbands  This is a wristband all-inclusive. The previous 2 I went to (Mexico Jamaica) did not require their guests to wear wristbands.    I felt ripped off and short changed at every turn at this resort and would not recommend it. There are far better all inclusives out there if that's the type of resort you'd like to stay at and this is not one of them.",Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Wilton, NH",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megan1284
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,fromcitytocountry wrote a review Jul 2012,30,"Clean, modern and fun but terrible staff in bar","Rooms: Large modern and clean and great for the price. Our air con was very poor but when we asked them to look at it we were told it was ""fine."" However other couples complained more and were successful in being moved to rooms with good air con.    Restaurant: Up market canteen style. Food quality and options quite good for all inclusive but very repetitive. Enjoyed the fresh meals the chefs could make in front of your eyes omelettes for breakfast and pasta at lunch. Tables cleaned slowly meaning often left wondering trying to find a clean table but generally staff friendly. Option to eat outside if you prefer. No water served with breakfast though have to wait till pool bar opens at 10am (the 'snack bar' that doesn't serve any snacks.) Odd.    Pools: Quieter pool towards back with mildly heated pool that we enjoyed few chilled days around. Main pool has water aerobics a few times a day which provided a few laughs but water polo far too vicious - one member of staff bit two English friends mid game!! Main pool has fun vibe with music playing most the day but nice to have quiter pool as an option. Pool bar staff generally very friendly and enjoyed teaching me Arabic but they all tend to serve men first.    Bar: Closes at 11:30pm but lucky if you get a drink after 11pm and by 10pm they were often out of beers vodka and rum. Nice option to sit outside and get table service with olive and nuts but often quicker to go to bar yourself. Bar Staff some of the rudest people I've ever met. One in particular was very aggressive and I felt uncomfortable every time we saw him. Sadly most the bar staff here wouldn't smile say please or thank you no matter if we ordered in Arrabic French or English. They alone could ruin this resort and almost ruined several of our evenings.    Guests: Good mix of French English and a few Dutch. Mixture of young couples groups and families. Made some great friends had some fun on the slides and all bonded over the silly rules and rude bar staff.    If you can laugh past all the staff problems get used to the food and drink timetable and odd hotel rules then you will have a great time - we certainly did.    Note: We were travelling as two women and our friends with male in the group seemed to have a little less hassle.",Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bristol, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LasBabas
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,PanamaEd63 wrote a review Jul 2012,30,"Good fun, but could easily be so much better","When ""all inclusive"" was explained to the management of the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina something must have been lost in translation.  Well quite a few things actually.  Room air conditioning? Think penguin sneeze.  Drinks after 11pm? Non. Rum on a Wednesday? Non.  And no to Vodka after dark too.  Of course the more serious drinkers can find some relief at the night club.  Head downstairs just behind the pool toilets ignore the smell of freshly sawn timber and painted walls wallow in the neon lights and pumping 80's soundtrack of almost hits pass the in-club crèche and wii and stop just before the Darby and Joan bench for the bar.  Not included though so prepare to pay 30 dirhams for a soft drink and 50 dirhams for local beer.    Thankfully a frequent shuttle to the town centre is included. Book a day before for a set time and wait in the scorching Moroccan heat as it sits around for 20 minutes in case any less organised tourists fancy it.  Pity the resort operated airport bus isn't as relaxed but that may have something to do with the back handers openly given to hotel staff whenever you take a taxi.    Kenzi has a strange set of rules and priorities.  The most prized possession has to be a single orange beach towel so reluctantly given to each guest.  I kid you not that there are uniformed guards at each entrance to the pool area tasked with ensuring they remain at the pool.  On several occasions guards chased after tourists walkie talkies squawking solely to recover a towel.  Funny but since there are no lifeguards and no indication they would react as swiftly in a real emergency potentially serious.    We had hoped that arriving somewhat wearily at 5pm our room would be ready.  That was too much to ask since there is an elaborate check in procedure that not even the staff understand.  It took what seemed like ages and we were not even offered a cool drink while we waited.  A good half hour later a golf buggy took us to our unmade room. A row a shrug and another wait we were finally allowed into an alternative room in block four the furthest distance from the facilities which we since discovered is the naughty block for trouble makers.  Lovely views though. Road building machines a watch tower and an abandoned sun lounger.    Pity we were hungry as dinner was not until 7.30pm.  So we head to the cruelly labelled ""snack bar"" to discover another expression that doesn't quite translate since it serves drinks only.    Dinner was a true experience. So much so that it is repeated in exactly the same format every night and every lunchtime.  Actually this was no bad thing as there was quite a lot of variety available all the time with a good selection of Moroccan food pasta salads pizzas available with fresh trough constantly being brought out from the kitchen.  The fruit was really good fresh and tasty but some extra tongs wouldn't have gone amiss.  Seating was difficult at times but with such a large dining room this was never really a problem and we were able to finish most nights in time for the entertainment offering.  Certainly entertaining but for all the wrong reasons.    We stayed at Kenzi for a week which was probably about the right time.  The daily water aerobics were always followed by a water volleyball  session designed more for the ""animation"" team's enjoyment than the guests.  In fact it seemed like an excuse for certain animated characters to go round hugging the players at length after each goal.  But this proved a good fit with the deafening Eurotrash techno soundtrack and overall feel that the staff's needs were greater than those of the French guests which in turn were always greater than those of the Brits.    Pity really. The setting was lovely and the weather faultless.  Kenzi could be so much better if the lengthy rule book was torn up.  I would have loved a burger or pizza by the pool but lunch was rather more formal with dress required which was a struggle in 40 degree heat after a few hours at the pool.    Kenzi positions itself as a 5 star.  I disagree.  It's probably a good 3 star with 4 star aspirations just like Benidorm's Solana.    Go by all means if you want an affordable easy week in the sun.  Learn to argue join in when they shrug their shoulders and you will enjoy it.  But if you want luxury or service look elsewhere.    Would I go back?

Having booked in groupon - it was much better than I could have expected. The resort was clean and is fairly new.    The rooms are spacious/clean and the beds are XXL which is a must for me!  The food (All inclusive) was good for 4 days. Snack time could have been improved. The waiting staff were helpful and polite unlike the bar men in the main bar and the ladies in the spa. The hairdresser was great and defiantly worth poping in for a blow-dry or hair treatment. Also had a massage which was very good!    As for the location it is a little out of the centre but there is a free shuttle bus which runs from the hotel into the Medina you must book as we made that mistake and ended up just taking a taxi for 50Dirham do not pay any more!!!! They will try to charge you more.    There is a great restaurant down the road called bo-zin which was great and within walking distance.    There are 3 pools and the aqua aerobics class was hilarious.    Overall would most defiantly stay again!.

The pools were well maintained and the pool bar good for beersoft drinks and coffee. The only negatives - air con in rooms not great but did get better when complained and the bar closes ( in my opinion) too early at 11:30 pm.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,GreatNT wrote a review Jun 2012,40,"Great holiday, would strongly recommend",We went as a couple for four days in June 2012. The cab journey was very quick 10 minutes and cost between 15€ -20€.    The negatives first:  The daytime drinks bar staff had a bit of an attitude and made it a little bit uncomfortable at times to ask for a drink. They (and only the day drinks bar staff) seemed to favour the French speaking guests. The rest of the staff made real effort and were very friendly and helpful.    All the toilets in the hotel including the ones in the rooms although were vey clean had a strong unpleasant smell.    On our first day I forgot my photo camera on the sunlounger when we went back to look for it the guests in the next sunloungers told us they found it and handed it to a member of staff. When we asked him for the camera he denied any knowledge of it and so did the rest of the staff! During our stay we heard of a few other things that went missing.    There were a few flies in the restaurant and wasps by the dinks bar however it is to be expected in such a hot country! Otherwise the hotel was spotless.    Now to the positives:    The hotel is very big luxurious with beautiful grounds that throughout our stay were kept immaculate and very clean.    The staff (with the exception of daytime bar staff) were very polite and helpful. Especially the restaurant staff were very nice. On our arrival which was couple of hours before check in we were greated with a cold drink our case was taken away and once we did check in we were taken to our room in a golf buggy and shown how to operate everything.    The best thing for me was the fact that there were always enough sunloungers for everyone and there was no rush to reserve one at the crack of dawn! Also it did not feel crowded by the pool.    The food was very good everything for any taste. A lot of salads vegetables daily grilled and Moroccan dishes as well as pasta station where the cook would make any sort of pasta with any sauce and ingredients you ask for there and then for you! The drinks were served in 1.5 litter bottles at the table and were known brands such as Diet Coke. Unlimited alcohol and even champagne at breakfast!    The majority of guests at the hotel were French speaking. However we found this to be an advantage as we wanted to go on holiday and experience another culture not be surrounded by the Benidorm cast!    All in all very good holiday. We enjoyed it thoroughly and would recommend this hotel. It was more than we ever expected and had a brilliant time.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreatNT
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sarah_Bedford wrote a review Jun 2012,40,Better than these reviews would have you believe.....,"We were here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Pools were great staff incredibly helpful roms beautiful with great air con and good power shower.    I get very cross reading the reviews stating that the resort doesn't cater for English speakers. YOU ARE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WHERE THE FIRST LANGUAGE IS ARABIC AND THE SECOND IS FRENCH! Do you expect the people at Oktoberfest not to speak German? This is not the Costa Brava! Staff DO speak english and are very very accommodating. Perhaps it's an opportunity to use your old school French - they love it when you try!    Most of the guests were French and very considerate with beautifully behaved little children. The entertainment wasn't spectacular but you don't expect a West End Show for these prices do you?    Food was consistently good - there is always something you will like with a changing selection of tagines a pasta and pizza station a hot food station and a regularly changing area that does kebabs/chinese/fish as well as a large and interesting salad bar.  Fresh doughnuts and pancakes are served with coffee at 4pm the bars serve decent beer spirits and cocktails and the Moroccan wine on the all inc package is delicious. Serving staff are constantly watching to se if you need anything and it's great to be able to sit outside in the shade under the sail structure they have. The ""authentic Moroccan restaurant"" was a bit of a disappointment due to there only being one waiter to serve 44 diners and so I'd recommend eating in the city if you want a truly authentic meal.    Stories about flies and bugs..... I give up.... it is OUTSIDE it is HOT there are bugs - honestly do you expect them to place the whole resort under a plastic bubble?! I had one insect bite in the whole week!    OK this isn't Mauritius or Dubai - it's a developing country with a newly expanding group of resorts. But I can't see that you aren't geting value for money here and I simply don't understand why people are so negative about this place.    We are booking to return. I would rather spend a week here than a week in Benidorm - and perhaps that's where the complainers SHOULD have gone!",Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah_Bedford

The hotel facilities were amazing - my room had a lovely terrace black out curtains and a great big bed.    Most importantly the food was excellent the buffet offered a large selection of traditional Morrocan food and a mix of other foods from around the world. It was very easy to order drinks beers and cocktails throughout the day.    There was a good mix of singles couples and families.

They went out of their way to allow us to use another room while ours was getting ready as we arrived early and transport to the rooms via golf buggy was a lovely extra. The room was cleaned every day but backed onto the building site at the back which was sometimes a bit noisy in the morning. The all inclusive buffet always had a huge variety and so much of it though lunch got a bit repetitive but evening buffets included a Moroccan night fish night and Chinese so a welcome change. Deserts and Afternoon snacks were delicious!! There was entertainment every night and very strong cocktails! The pools very always clean and lots of sun beds available. Use the rectangle pool if you want a quieter sunbathing session.  We spent every day at the hotel apart from a morning at the market...don't get a guide...they aren't worth it and we didn't get hassled in the souks (apart from the guides!). We also did a morning trip which the hotel organised...drinking mint tea with a Moroccan lady in her home and seeing the view from her terrace was well worth doing.

We hardly left the hotel except to go and bargain hunt in the medina. It was very clean and beautifully done. The usual all inclusive buffet - but lots of fresh salads. Very good value for money. Despite probably being too old for it we had a great time on the kids slides too!  Great location away from the centre but very easy to get a taxi in.  Also had a lovely massage in the spa which is very relaxing.  The only thing I could complain about is the evening entertainment - not much going on there at all. Also if you're going to go out at night best to do your homework first as to where to go. We found a small strip of bars/clubs which was not the best and there is a hotel which serves alcohol in the main square. However I have since heard others mentioning lots of lovely places so I think it's a case of knowing where they are.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAS063
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,racingqueen wrote a review Jun 2012,30,Lovely Hotel Let Down By The Food,This hotel is absolutely beautiful spotlessly clean. The staff are amazingespecially 2 of the guys on reception-see pic that I have uploaded. I only stayed here for 4 nights but really found the food so repetitive even after the first couple of nights. Everything was buffet style and it was always luke warmespecially the soup. The desserts looked lovely but were not covered ..well only in flies was really off-putting.  The coffee and powdered fruit juices at breakfast were terrible.  However the house wine especially rose was lovely.  We were really disappointed with the afternoon snack bar as apart from the hot doughnuts everything else was uncovered so being outside were covered in flies. There were no burgers or hotdogs etc as we have normally found on AI.  My daughter and I were both ill for a few days and we think it may have been the bottled water as it tasted really weird definitley wasnt like the bottled water we buy at home.  The pool area was lovely and always lots of sun loungers and cabanas available.  The animation team worked so very hard especially Mimishe always made time to come over and have a chat. They put on excellent shows in the evenings.  Found it very off that there was only one place to get a drink during the day and that was by crossing the pool area to the raised pool bar.  We used 247 transportation to and from the airport and they were excellent.  If I went to Marrakech again I would look to stay closer to the city and somewhere where you can take a stroll nearby as this hotel really is in the middle of nowhere. I think this is why the hotel shop charges ridiculously high prices ie a packet of plain biscuits was the equivalent of £4.00 and a bottle of sun tan lotion £20 !!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Aloc1n76 wrote a review Jun 2012,40,Fantastic week!!!,Firstly I wuld just like to say some of the reviews before we went were off putting but I can't fault this hotel!!    I would reccommend using 247booking.com if you require transfers from the airport cheap and were there at the airport and at hotel on return at time agreed.    On arrival at the hotel our bags were took away while we checked in and we were given a refreshing cold drink. We were then taken by golf buggy to our room. We stayed at the further riad away but we enjoyed that it was quiet and very peaceful.  The room was clean and very nice. It was cleaned daily and we have no complaints about the room-great!!!    After strolling around we found where everything was. The pools are great and my boyfried loved the water slides great fun!!! There was games to take part in or you could just sunbathe and enjoy the sun. These were mainly in french but the animation team would speak in english if needed. The pool bar was fantastic and drinks available all day!!    The food was amazing lots of variety and so much choice every day. Our favourite time of the day was 16.30 when you could get hot donuts pancakes pastries toasties etc from the snack bar-lovely!!! No complaints about the food.    Free bus to the markets is great and we took advantage of this. Markets are good but be on guard for 'guides' who say they are not guides and don't need paying. They make you follow them and then ask for money. We sat in a cafe in the sqaure and watched all the goings on loved it!!    Overall we had a fantastic weeks holiday and would love to go back.    *Just one final point the hotel tried to charge us a local tax of 330 dirhams (abount £35) on check out. Our booking paperwork didn't warn us about this. So please check your paperwork before going. We argued the point of this at the hotel and they did waive it in the end but just check*,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cheadle, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aloc1n76
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LondonTobias wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Way beyond our expectations...,Having read some of the reviews on tripadvisor we were bracing ourselves for a fairly bumpy week but we consoled ourselves with the knowledge that it was incredible value. We could not have been wider of the mark. My wife and 2 children (6 and 8 year olds) absolutely LOVED everything about this hotel!  I can't imagine any of the staff being unfriendly but if they were the guest must have been a nightmare!!! They were a delight from the manager down to the gardener. We experienced absolutely no animosity because we were English. Infact we were made to feel so welcome that we tipped various members of staff at the end of our stay and they were surprised but delighted (TIP: Not a bad idea to do this with a waiter at the beginning and he will probably save you the best table with your drinks at the ready?)  The food was amazing. If you stick to sausages and chips all week it may become repetetive but the variety of food was mind-blowing (if you see a chicken tagine grab it). Even the lady that makes the pancakes for breakfast made a special effort for our kids by making them in the shape of donkeys bears stars etc...they were literally exploding with happiness! I can't even begin to tell you about the puddings. I did not see a single fly in the buffet area in the entire week.  Beer wine and cocktails are available all day and there is no question of them holding back because it's an all-inclusive. In fact if you so wish there is champagne available at breakfast (easily disguised in the freshly squeezed orange juice...)  The room was fantastic. We had a ground floor room. Every day it was cleaned beautifully and left with a smattering of petals. I recommend that you try and get a room close to the pool and reception but that's because I'm bone idle.  We played tennis volleyball basketball and tried our hand at archery all of which was free. In fact you could stay a week at Kenzi and not spend a single penny. The shop is expensive particularly for suncream so bring enough. If you do need to shop get a taxi to the massive Carafour Supermarket down the road for 20 dirham (c.£1.50). It has everything you could possibly need and is super cheap.  I could go on forever but needless to say we will be going back and there is no better endorsement than that.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LondonTobias
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lisa R wrote a review Jun 2012,50,Best All Inclusive Ever.,If you are a salad dodging tattooed bingo loving chav then DO NOT GO HERE. This was our first visit to Morocco and the only worry I have is that it will get trashed by the British in the same way that Spain and now Turkey has.  The hotel staff could not do enough for us on arrival. We were taken to our clean and spacious room by a sort of golf buggy so no need to carry luggage in the heat. The food was not at all repetative like other all inclusives. Plenty of local food as well as other dishes no queues and lots of wine and water on tap. There was a fresh pot of coffee on each table at breakfast too.  The pools were clean and safe with lots of loungers and free towels each day. There is plenty of space so there is no need to be disturbed by the entertainment. The evening entertainment was mainly in French but was no problem as it is mostly visual so you only miss the introductions anyway.  All of the staff were so helpful and spoke good English however they really loved it when we spoke to them in French rather than just assuming that they would speak English.  The gardens are beautifully looked after and full of quirky sculptures which are a nice touch.  The hotel is not close to much as the area is being developed but inside you wouldn't know it. There is a taxi rank outside so agree a price and use them. Only about £4 to go to the market which takes 10 minutes and is amazing. There is a free shuttle bus from the hotel but they keep you waiting a while for other guests so just splash out £4 for a taxi!  After telling my husband that I didn't want another all inclusive holiday surrounded by English slobs this place has changed my mind. We had a fabulous time and will be returning.,Date of stay: June 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Woodbridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaR839

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Harvey123456 wrote a review May 2012,40,Great stay lovely resort,We stayed at the resort for my birthday celebrations (as a large group) in December 2011. The club was welcoming right from the start with polite check in staff and a calming reception area with wonderful mint tea on arrival. We were taken to our riad style rooms by motorised buggy and shown all of the facilities en route. We were all inclusive so had the use of a buffet for breakfast brunch poolside snacks and drinks all day and also for lunch and dinner. In the evenings there was a bar with entertainment and free drinks from a certain list. There was the option to dine in a paying restaurant also on resort and there were various activities to do behind the pool area. There was a spa and a gym which you had to pay for. The resort prices were not cheap but fairly reasonable. Staff were always respectful friendly and polite though not always able to understand English (understandable of course- just describing the situation). The rooms were clean comfortable and minimally decorated as was the resort itself. The poolside areas were very relaxing. We usually ate dinner from the buffet and there was always a good amount of choice with options to customise certain foods like omelettes and pancakes made fresh before you and the inclusive wines were delicious. A note that there were always lots of stray cats hanging around but they were more like pets and a lot of guests liked them being about. We were a lively group and the resort was probably more for quiet families or couples but we were always accommodated. The taxi ride to town was always around £10 each way which wasn’t cheap but a necessary expense I suppose of staying at a resort on the outskirts beyond walking distance with nothing at all close by. The resort was in a developing area so on the side of our room there was only a view of a sparse dusty waste area however behind the pool there were stunning views of the Atlas mountain tops. There were a few things to be desired I feel the resort thinks it ‘ticks all the boxes’ without fully understanding 4/5 star service but it does a good job overall. You are after all in a developing country with very different lives to what we are used to and expect. You can’t also give a full westernised 5 star experience and retain lots of Morroccan authenticity and we found that the resort struck a good balance. We would love to return to the resort again but for more of a relaxing break doing very little than a party holiday even though it was a good base for us on that occasion. We went into town a few times and didn’t always enjoy the attitudes of the locals towards us despite bearing in mind that they earn little and we are vastly fortunate compared to them we expected to be overcharged for things but some locals gave us disgusted looks for no reason and were rude to us on occasions. On returning home our flight was cancelled and the airline put us up at a hotel in town which was nothing at all like this lovely relaxing friendly resort and made us appreciate our stay even more.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harvey123456

The staff are extreemly friendly funny and very helpful. The reception staff were very helpful and I will upload a photograph of them.  However the food is repetative theres flies on the buffet food and the management don't allow bottles of soft drinks into the rooms. There is nowhere to get food after 10pm. Nowhere to get drinks after 12am and only one bar open at any one time.  The bottled water made myself and my mother ill therefore we only wanted to drink bottled soft drinks but because they wouldn't let us take bottled soft drinks to the hotel room we became very dehydrated.  I had emailed the hotel to inform them that it was my mother's 50th birthday whilst we were there and my mother had emailed them to ask if we could have a 1st floor room because this makes us feel safer (2 females traveling on our own). They did nothing about both emails and we had to move rooms on the 2nd day to an upper floor room.  The fruit juices are faulse and taste like they are made of powder.  There isn't a mirror near a plug socket so there is nowhere to plug in hair straightners.  There is only a bin in the bathroom not in the bedroom.  The safe didn't work and we had to have a technition to retrieve our passports.  The free shuttle bus only allows you one- two hours in the city per trip.  The pool isn't heated.    I usually stay in budget accomodation and don't usually complain about small details however if the management want to run a 5* expensive hotel none of the above should occure.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hayleyandmarvin
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Charlotte C wrote a review May 2012,20,Butlins camp for French people,The hotel is very modern and smart and generally very clean but the sink in our room was blocked which might sound picky but not pleasant when scum kept surfacing from the plug hole. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere and the view from our balcony was of a vast expanse of dusty ground inhabited by diggers dump trucks and other assorted plant equipment for 180 degrees there is a 15 foot tall wall surrounding the complex with a guard tower in the corner the pools were nice and clean but the nasty Europop music blaring out full blast from dawn to dusk was impossible to get away from if you wanted to relax poolside. The food although varied was of a very poor standard with lunch seemingly turning into reheated dinner - overcooked and burned beef tagine raw potatoes and chicken kebab meat that was worryingly pink in the Center there is a poolside snack bar that does not serve snacks in any shape or form for some reason and none of the staff seemed to understand what a cup of tea was. in the evening the loud Europop continued relentlessley with the staff doing their best impression of some ceebeebies tweenies style of entertainment my wife and I we're in the hotel lobby at midnight on the first of our pre paid and booked 4 night stay scouring the internet for somewhere else to stay and left the hotel the following morning after only one night forgoing our money and were frankly pleased to get out of there  did I mention the morbidly obese women around the pool in a Muslim country with lots of young children playing who thought it acceptable to get there baps out and change their clothing poolside with a towel half wrapped round them displaying their lady parts for all and sundry to see? I'm no prude but found this bahaviour to be unacceptable in a family style resort where Muslim women were wearing traditional clothing. Needless to say we were most disappointed but could see that many others were perfectly content. Consider carefully what you are looking for in your holiday before booking as I do not feel the ratings reflected the resort I have travelled extensively over the last 13 years and this is the first time ever I have felt it nessecary to write any kind of review,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteC709
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Kaz0203 wrote a review May 2012,40,Good hotel away from the Medina chaos,My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights on 11 May. The weather was superb - a very hot 40 degrees. Rooms on first floor in block 900 nice but air conditioning not up to much. Tip - keep your second room card in power supply to keep aircon on all day. Room was modern and clean and had flat screen tv. Two pools were good; one being unheated - bliss on the hot days. Pool towels were plentiful and the best animation team I have ever seen . French is mostly spoken but if you are english and you make an effort to speak to staff they will make conversation with you. Food in restaurant was plentiful but they do need more staff to clear and layup tables more efficiently as when we were there it was very busy - another French bank holiday I suspect! From 4 - 5 pm afternoon snacks are served ie pizza pancakes and hot doughnuts (lush!). Reception staff were friendly and greeted us well and took luggage to room on golf buggy and picked us up again with our luggage at the end of our stay. One bug bear is that although the waiters work very hard to serve drinks to the tables outside of the bar it took ages for us to get them and this is because there is only one guy behind the bar pouring the drinks and alas unless they employ more bar staff this will not improve. We took a trip to Djeema el Fna square on our own - BIG mistake and is not for the faint hearted. Tip - book a guide to take you around otherwise it is hassle hassle hassle - also my friend got conned by a henna lady - grabbed her had and starting drawing (for free she said - yeah right!) and when my friend tried to pull her hand away she couldn't as the lady had a firm grip and kept on drawing. Then she asked for 300 dirhams. When my friend complained out came the male minders lurking in the background who were very imtimidating. She paid 100 dirhams in the end but lady was not happy. Also saw the monkeys - well I say monkeys they are the size of baboons. They had a collar and lead and wore a disposable nappy and the man kept yanking their leads. We also saw the tiny wooden cages they lived/travelled in. As we stayed 15 mins drive away from the Square and souks we noticed lots of building going on with big hotels. With our english TV promoting Morroco tourism hence the building sites I'm not sure how animal rights activists would welcome the traditional culture of Marrakech. Tip - don't even attempt to take photos of snakes as the snake men will hassle you to pay or call you bad names even if you won't paythe price they say. I would go again and stay at this hotel but would do the other trips to Atlas mountains next time but the Square and Souks you must experience on your first trip to Marrakech - but get a guide!,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Bristol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaz0203
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,rah37 wrote a review May 2012,40,"Nice Resort in Marrakech but problem with language, food and bathrooms.",We recently stayed at this hotel in Dec '11/jan '12 for 4 nights. My husband booked this hotel after searching on booking.com which allows you free cancellations. It was very expensive to stay in expecially on new years night. We had arrived by ferry from Spain into tangers and then took the overnight train to marrakech. the train station was a bit isolated and we took a cab to the hotel. Its situated along a wide hotel lined road- avenue Mohammed but away from the Old parts of marrakech. Not too far but nowhere within walking distance of the Medina. My intial impression about the hotel was very good. Its a huge resort style property with typical red adobe style architecture. Our guide explained that all the buildings here have to confirm to this color which is evocative of Marrakech.  Now for the hotel. Its a huge complex with its double tier of building blocks clustered around a central pool area. The entrance foyer is quite nice and well done up. It leads to the outside courtyard where you first encounter the main restaurant where you will eat all your meals. there is another bar/disco to the right. There is a huge pool with water slides though it was quite cold to swim in Dec. There is another deeper pool to the side which may be heated as it was covered and uncovered everyday. There are plenty of canopied cabanas and deck chairs around to soak in the sun. Amenities for the kids include a kids club where the hosts take charge in leading the children in games and other activities. There is a basketball court tennis court archery and I think they could play soccer or volleyball I forget. Daily activities included belly dance lessons tennis lessons archery lessons etc for adults and kids. There was always music playing and a bar serving drinks- coffee tea juices all day long. Our kids really enjoyed staying here especially as one night they got dressed up in traditional Morroccan clothes and danced to music. There was also a hammam/spa which had its own indoor pool and turkish steam room and a gym and hair salon. All charges were extra. Though the experience was not as good as one in istanbul.  Now for the rooms. Since we were four we had a suite which was quite nice. It was located all the way out towards the back of the property in the 900's but which we dint complain about even though it was a bit of a walk to get to and initially difficult to find especially at night as there is no good signage leading to the rooms. An outer room with a half bath and two beds and then an inner bedroom with a king bed and full bathroom with tub and shower. Since we were on the ground floor there were glass doors leading to a small patio and path outside. Luxuriously furnished rooms clean and neat and modern. But we had a problem with the bathoom. The shower was built in did not have a door and even though it had a curtain  it kept falling down and all the water streamed outside into the bathroom. Drainage was very poor. Same for the bidet and toilet area. The fixtures weren't of good quality.  Apart from that the food in the restaurants during all meals was very good. Lot of choices and variety even though it was repetitive sometimes. Do try the traditional pancakes with honey and the sweet moroccan tea. yummy food most of the times thats why the New years fiasco was so surprsing. The staff was very friendly as well and took quite good care of us. The problem we had was on New years eve where the hospitality group had planned a surprise party for all the guests. It started at 7 pm in the main restaurant where they had a sit down dinner. The program was very good with good music and dance performances even though it catered mainly to the french crowd. And the compere spoke only in french too which we couldn't understand. The food was a big problem and left a lot to be desired. It was mainly seafood based which we do not eat. Therefore for 2 hours we were sitting hungry until fianlly a fter making repeated requests to the manager we finally got served something we could eat. I found that very perplexing as to how they could serve a complete seafood meal with caviar fish shrimp for all courses to all the guests especially if some body may have a seafood allergy or dietary restrictions. They should have had choices for this night whether it was sit down or not. we had a paid a lot of money to stay in this hotel for New years eve night and certainly deserved a better dinner rather than staying hungry for more than 2 hours. The service was so bad that even when we asked for soda we weren't served until we repeatedly kept calling. One of us had to get up and walk over to get the managers attention. This was most appalling. And also that the staff should speak in english which being a universal language is understood by most tourists. Hardly anyone spoke english here and even if they did they had limited understanding. If this is a five star resort then the amenities and conveniences certainly aren't. The assistant manager mr. Mustafa was nice though and took good care of us once we had his attention. the next day when we were leaving for casablanca he packed us a nice cold lunch. Thank you mr. Mustafa but the manager should have been careful on New years eve.  Also There are free hotel shuttle buses to Jmaa el Fnaa sqare but they have limited tmings and when we got on we were told that we had to return within a set time whcih was just an hour and half and only if we accepted that we could board. that w as quite crazy in my opinion. And of course wandering in the Jama el fnaa square looking at the Kutubiya mosque and it s environs wandering thru the huge souks of Marrakech cannot be seen in an hour and half. We had to take a taxi back which was a bit expensive.  We also booked one of those adventure treks from the hotel from a tour operator that didnt speak any ENGLISH. but thank fully it was a fun trip though expensive. one of those dune buggy rides. Was quite an experience and really enjoyed the sweet Moroccon tea experience.  Another trip we took was to Ourika loved going for the drive alongside the mountainside even though we didnt get to trek to the waterfall( it was dusk by the time we reached). We stopped at a berber house along the way. the taxi driver took us to one of those Berber gift shoops which sell everything quite expensive and try to rip off tourists so beware.  We did enjoy our stay here barring these few hiccups amd maybe the hotel could improve their services and upgrade their bathrooms. I do travel quite a bit and here's my thing- that if a place wants tourists to visit then they should speak a universal language so that guests feel comfortable visiting and donot experience any problems.  All in all they could do with a bit of improvement. If anyone has a specific query feel free to ask me.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Hillsborough, New Jersey",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rah37

The staff in the restaurant and those who cleaned the rooms and staffed reception were friendly and eager to help. The spa experience however was poor with surly silent staff who didn't seem interested or trained. To sit in an armchair for an hour having a pedicure with non functioning air conditioning and no offer of a drink was unacceptable. As I was travelling without my husband getting a drink at either of the two bars as an unaccompanied female was a challenge! Whilst this may be a cultural issue with all the European women that must visit here the management should address this.  The food was very good and plentiful. The pool clean with lots of comfy sun loungers and parasols and the gardens were beautiful.  Overall a very relaxing holiday for the price with a few small niggles that that could easily be put right.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ed_Dam wrote a review May 2012,30,Nice hotel but let's itself down,I stayed at the Kenzi club Agdal Medina for the Easter break after getting a cheap deal on Travel Republic. If you are looking for a good cheap sunshine break then go for the Kenzi.    However I've got a few tips:    1 Book a taxi from the airport from www.247transfer.com: they were much cheaper than the ones outside and from what I could see a lot more welcoming!!    2 If you drink beer/lager take a bottle opener with you - I cannot stress this enough! There are only bottles in the dining area and finding a waiter to open one for you is a nightmare. I had to wait twenty minutes on one evening and only managed to get a maximum of two beers a night despite being all inclusive.    3 Bring some spare towels. Quite bizarrely for a 'five star' hotel the Kenzi rations you to two towels a day. Also the Spa supplies no towels at all (which I thought was a minimum requirement for a spa??)    4 Avoid the hotel Hammam - it's basically a lukewarm cave and you'll get more of a sweat walking to dinner.    5 Don't book a 'city view' room the Kenzi is very isolated and the city view is basically a building site    6 Be prepared for no-one speaking English at all (I know it's Morocco) and quite a 'relaxed attitude' to service at the front desk/bar restaurant. I didn't get annoyed but I could see why others might!    7 Borrow some of the cushions from around the bar for your sun lounger (they make all the difference)    Other than some slight complaints I would still recommend this hotel. The rooms are large and nicely decorated with big comfy beds. The buffet food was lovely with great pancakes and doughnuts at teatime. And who doesn't enjoy an endless supply of cocktail or beers while soaking up the Morrocan sun.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,West London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ed_Dam
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,wesleyparfitt wrote a review May 2012,40,Very Enjoyable Holiday,My wife and I stayed here for ten nights and really enjoyed the place. We had a nice quiet room on the ground floor with a patio fronting on to lovely gardens. Most of the clientele were French and most had families so during some French holidays the place was a bit busy though quietened down afterwards. However with three pools and large grounds it was not too noisy or crowded. Perhaps because of the French influence the buffet food in the restaurant was very good and varied ( they even served pork one evening - in a Moslem country!) Even more to the point the wine beer and cocktails were free any time of day; the Moroccan wine and beer were very acceptable. I've never been to a Butlins so can't comment on that but nobody wore singlets in the restaurant mostly smartly cas. The waiters and cleaners were extremely helpful and polite though the front desk staff could have been more forthcoming. There was a free and frequent minibus service into the centre of town. As an ex-French Protectorate French was much more widely spoken than English though in the Souks the traders could speak all manner of languages. Have thoroughly recommended it to our two (adult) children and friends.,Date of stay: May 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Devizes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wesleyparfitt
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,RobandJay wrote a review May 2012,40,Lovely hotel,We are frequent visitors to Marrakech although this is our first stay in the Kenzi. The hotel is spotless and very well maintained. we were in Riad Clementine which was towards the back of the complex. It was a very quiet room with a huge very comfortable bed. There are three pools (babylarge free form and one that tended to be more adults only) the loungers around the pool were plentiful and pool towels refreshed everyday.  We both are gym users and and forunately due to reading previous reviews were aware that the gym was payable locally- this is the first time we have never stayed in an AI and had to pay extra for the gym(this was also the case with the in room safes) really find this disgusting.  Only real other downsides were the restaurant-although the food was plentiful we have eaten much better at lower star morroccan hotels. The other grip was that the hotel mainly caters for French guests and they seem to smoke all the time!! The only bar is also the mini disco/nightclub It was so loud and so smokey that it really wasn't the sort of place you wanted to sit and have a quiet pre or post dinner drink or two. This may be better in the summer as I imagine the evenings are warm enought o sit outside.  Marrakech as always never fails to steal my heart please don't visit without fully exploring the medina. The hotel does run a shuttle bus but its last journey back is at 6.30pm taxis are plentiful and fairly reasonable and the main square is grest fun at night and the food is amazing.  All in all my husband and I had a great break at the Kenzi the weather was fantastic although the evenings were slightly cooler and the hotel didn't let us down. I would return.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,AlexanderSofia wrote a review Apr 2012,30,All-Inclusive without quality food,We have been to all manner of five-star all-inclusive hotels in many parts of the world including Tunisia and Egypt. Kenzi Agdal is the worst hotel in terms of food until now.  And what I mean is the quality of the food not the quantity that one can usually expect from this type of hotels. You would not starve to death - there is a lot of food there but it is cheap food of poor quality almost always. Certainly nobody expects Michelin-star dining when staying at an all-inclusive hotel but yet walking around the restaurant stalls again and again just to find something tasty or different is unacceptable in my opinion. We also stayed at riads in Marrakech Medina and Essaouira for other four nights and so ate at riads cafes restaurants souks and even a Berber house near Imlil once and as a whole the dining experience outside this hotel was better than in it.    It is a pity because otherwise Kenzi Agdal is an excellent hotel although too far from the medina of Marrakech and therefore the name itself - Kenzi Club Agdal Medina is misleadind for the peоple who are not awere of the real location of the hotel - in fact one of the most distant hotels in the city subururbans (according to the taxi drivers even out of Marrakech and so they often refuse to put their meters on thus they charge much more money to and from the center). Actually the location was not a disadvantage for us since we had been aware of it and our three nights there were our final and relaxing part of the Morroccan trip after our stay in Marrakech Medina.    Nevertheless this hotel is very good value for money due to the great number of positive features it really has and the inexpencive price we paid. New and comfortable rooms two huge pools with different shape and style all outdoor sports facilities and vast green grounds with beautiful gardens and palm trees.  Staff are very nice and friendly usually efficient but once we had a day tour to Atlas and when we returned to our room in the evening tired and wishing to have a shower we found the room uncleaned and our old towels unchanged.    Shortly obviously there are better five-star accommodatoins in Marrakech but they are more expensive and sometimes ways more expensive. On the other hand if the sun and pools are your first choice criterion then go there and you would not regret it.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Sofia,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderSofia
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,soomark1 wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Oasis in the wasteland,We visted this hotel for a week - 12 April till 19th a family of four two boys 13 and 10. No this is probably not a 5 star establishment - do they usually provide all inclusive and a team of animateurs around the pool ? - but it is very comfortable and clean with welcoming and efficient staff. We did not find a problem with language when our basic French let us down staff seemed perfectly able to communicate in English indeed some of the waiting staff didn't wait for us to try out our language skills before speaking to us in English. Having said that efforts to communicate in French useful even the odd 'shokran'. Predominantly French clientele smattering of British other North Africans Dutch. Still Easter holidays so lots of children but as you may expect from the French well behaved. Shame a group of five or six British men virtually alone in the pool one afternoon felt the need to swear to each other we were trying yo get away from all that!    The main downside to this hotel is its locationbeing located on the Rue Mohammed VI  which is in an area earmarked for tourist development and now suffering from the economic downturn. I understand that it was once covered with olive trees which have been razed and now there is only this hotel and a sister establishment further down the road - both huge complexes. The odd empty shell of a building lies about with no work going on; shades of 'Ozymandias' here and a bit sad. From a magazine article I read it would seem that Marrakech which was very. trendy about 10 /12 years ago is also considered expensive for other Morrocans who can escape for a week toTurkey for the price of a weekend there. The hotel does provide two minibuses into town but it does mean you are less likely to just go in on a whim.    Opposite the hotel is the Morrocan Racing circuit and while we were there two big races were going on the Morrocan Grand Prix and an international touring race. You might want to check out such events if the noise is going to bother you. We were given entry bracelets if we wanted to enter the complex though the view from the adjacent road bridge was probably sufficient unless you're a fan.    Would echo the comments of other guests food good and plentiful but rather repetitive after two or three days. On the whole the music around the pool not too intrusive though sometimes the europop was grating. The cocktails were a disappointment - don't expect vodka martinis or any of the classics. The wine very drinkable.My husband was rather underwhelmed by the spa but my son used the gym daily. One of few downsides was having arrived early at the hotel we had to wait around for a room for a few hours so be prepared for this.    We explored the usual tourist attractions and would particularly recommend the Saadian Tombs and the Bahia Palace. Yes we were scammed and ended up at a spices shop when actually heading for something else but keep a good humour these people earn very little. Unfortunately it was too 'in your face' for my eldest son who hated Djemaa el Fna because of the hassle and refused to enter it again after his first trip ( my husband had a snake placed on him which freaked him out) so some of the experiences i'd planned came to nothing. Recommend a patisserie/ice cream shop' Patisserie des Princes' for delicious ice creams off the Djemaa el Fna and a trip in a caleche up to the beautiful Jardins Marjorelle.    All in all a very enjoyable trip. Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.it is not La Mamounia but doesn't purport to be - nor does it cost anything like it but a very good chill out location with the option of visiting the cultural delights of Marrakech.,Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soomark1
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sudhir PATEL wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Good Hotel a bit far from city but in an excellent Quiet Location,"This is a big Hotel with over 300 rooms and build in the form of about 9 RIADS ( rooms around a square and with a garden courtyard in the middle). Our room was a first floor room with a Balcony in ""Riad Jacaranda"" in the middle of the complex and it was an ideal location with a short walk down to the reception or the restaurant . We had the use of free wifi facilty in our room as well as the Restaurant and Lobby areas.  Unlike an earlier reviewer I have only good things to say about this Hotel after our stay in April 2012 in this all inclusive Hotel. The room was spacious and like the rest of the hotel and facilities was clean and very good. The all-inclusive deal works very well as the food was very good and always plenty to choose from Breadssaladssoup meatsfish pizzasicecream and desserts. They serve you full bottles of good Moroccan red white or Rose wine with your meals.If you arrive later than 2.30 pm the Snack bar serves plenty of items like Pizzas pancakeswafflesetc and the Bar offers cocktails and other Drinks in a unique and pleasant atmosphere until 23.30hrs.  The Hotel's Animation team has a diversity of activities to keep guests and children entertained throughout the day and we enjoyed watching a cooking class near the Oasis Snack bar.  We stayed three nights and wish that we had a couple of extra days in this relaxing Resort.

There was a great choice of food which was delicious and something for everyone. The restaurant's décor was contemporary and comfortable much better than any all inclusive hotel we have ever been to.    This is a great hotel for couples groups or families. There was plenty to do including complementary golf lessons aerobics tennis courts children's zoo table tennis gym spa volleyball football and cooking lessons. All activities were tucked out the way so they didn't interfere with our relaxation.The swimming pools were large and not overcrowded with plenty of sunbeds and contemporary shaded bed areas and hammocks surrounding the pool.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Londonkraut wrote a review Apr 2012,30,Five star? No way!!,For the first time ever we booked an allegedly 5* all inclusive for three nights and it will certainly have been the last time. This place is neither 5* nor all inclusive as food tends to be on the cheap and pretty poor side service virtually non existent and drinks are charged for after 23.00 hrs. I was also not amused to find out that the gym was not free but carried a hefty charge. Whilst I can fully understand that the hotel charges for spa services Use of a hotel gym is free at all 4 and 5* hotels I have visited so far. The shuttle bus is not very well organised and information received by staff is confusing and not always correct. I loved the experience of Marrakech but would not recommend this hotel if you are planning on a little treat.,Date of stay: March 2012,,"Berlin, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Londonkraut
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,lymajo wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Pleasant Stay,We stayed at the hotel at the end of March...  At first a bit weary as we tried contacting the hotel via e-mail and telephone but never a response. Only to find to our surprise we were warmly greeted by staff. Check-in was smooth and quick - be sure to make sure your passport has it's entry stamp/ number they will ask for this and also we were requested to pay upfront for our stay.    The room was clean spacious and the rest of the hotel and facilities were very good. The all-inclusive deal was great. The food was very good and always plenty to choose from. The pool facilty and bar was perfect - only pity was the weather was not great but at no fault of the hotel. The hotel provided plenty of entertainment and even though we do not have kids we noticed facilities and activities to keep the little ones entertained.    TIP: We found the taxis outside the hotel to be very useful. No where you are travelling to and also have an idea of how far it is... Agree a price before hand and it was very helpful getting the taxi's card to be called later for our return journey we found the price better than picking up a new taxi... especially in the evening.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cape Town, South Africa",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lymajo

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,jetseta wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Cannot Fault It!,"I took my daughter for her 40th birthday for 4 nights. I did my research via Tripadvisor and cannot have made a better choice. We were All Inclusive so had no worries about food and drink etc. The food was lovely and catered for all tastes it was fresh and many dishes cooked were Morroccan in tagines. The deserts were so tempting and a huge variety that we had to forget our weight and ""go for it"".I loved the salads and the variety was good with ""salmon in a lovely view"" (poached whole salmon lol). I would say if staying longer it could be a bit ""samey"" but there are lots of local restaurants to go and try.The wine was very drinkable and a choice of whiteredor rose' also a bottle was given.  The rooms were much better than I imagined they would be although the balcony was a bit small but hey we were at the pool or out and about so it didn't matter.  The hotel staff were lovely helpful and good for advice on local things.  The pool was great and as I had a knee injury and couldn't swim I relished the lovely cabanas around the pool so lazed around on that....sooo comfy! The weather was faultless at 28 degrees.  The spa is excellent and treatments a lot cheaper than some hotels I have stayed in although the hammam was a wet one ie.steam not dry which I prefer.  I was asked at the airport for 200 dirhams to get the few miles to the hotel but managed to pay 90 in the end.You do have to stick with it and walk away to get a decent price which we did many times....do not be intimidated or you will pay silly money.I just told them I would pay x amount a fair price and most times they agreed.  We went to Djemma el Fnaa one evening which is certainly worth a visit but we found a lot of the souk owners quite intimidating if we didn't want to buy.We did find a place where we bought some excellent pottery(save space in your suitcase).but the best place we found was along Mohammed Avenue VI which is fixed price shopping with no hassle and good prices and lovely owners willing to show how they make thingsfelt hats for instance I wish I had bought one now!.  There were mainly French Belgian and Italians here which was nice and the English were not loud that were there.There were not too many noisy children and all were well behaved which can make a difference to a restful time.  I would certainly stay here again and I am going back to Morroco in October but to see Casablanca...I hope the hotel is as good there as the Kenzi.",Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Beaworthy, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetseta

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,belgianbun wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Not bad for our first time all-inclusive experience,"This was the first time I experienced an all-inclusive holiday and I wasn't too disappointed! There were a few things I didn't like but in general it was a great experience. The negative points were not the hotel building and facilities but a few things that involved the reception staff and the ""bagagist"". When we arrived (my husband and 12year old son) we were taken to our room in a golf buggy by the bagagist who was at that point very accommodating. Once he had put the bags in our room we realised only one bed was made up. Although our booking states 3 single beds we had one king-sized bed and 2 sofabeds in a little section off the main bedroom. He reassured us that someone would come and make up the other bed within 10mins. As it was late at night and we only had big bank notes (no small change for tipping) my husband apologised for not being able to tip him and that's when it went all horribly wrong! The bagagist gave my husband a look I have never seen anyone do before and if he could have spat on him I am sure he would have done just that! Needless to say that when we got back to our room after a late dinner the other bed was not made up. After several calls to reception someone eventually showed up with a cot! Another phone call later the sofabed was made up. My son said it was a very uncomfortable bed. For the rest the room was spacious and had a lovely bathroom 2toilets and 2 flat screen tvs with all day movies channels and sky news etc..On another positive note: the hotel is very clean and gardens pool area etc are kept clean at all times. There was always someone walking around with a brush and dustpan! The all inclusive buffet was plentiful but got a bit boring after 3days of similar dishes. The wine (Morrocon red white or rose) was a hit! Lovely wine and again plentiful! The waiters in the restaurant were very helpful and always clearing up plates. There is an entertainment team onsite by the pool who have a morning and afternoon program on the go every day if you don't feel like lounging around all day by pool. They announced the activities but never pressurised you in participating. There were activities for children as well as adults. We used the free shuttle bus (navette) a couple of times which was very reliable and only 10-15mins away from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech. A taxi cost us 100MAD (Morrocon Dhinar) one way and 150MAD from airport to hotel on arrival. The reception staff were mainly very abrupt and uninterested in our requests apart from two on duty that week we were there. As this is quite a big complex and it was the Easter holiday it got very busy towards the end of the week. The main clientele were either French or Belgian and a few Scandinavians Germans and English. It was also mainly families with small or teenage children. Most of the staff spoke English. All in all this was a lovely holiday to get away for a week and recharge your batteries if you don't mind being surrounded by crying children at meal times and exciting screaming children going down the slides by the the pool. If I could I would prefer to visit this hotel again during non school holidays as it would be less crowded and noisy.",Date of stay: April 2012,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belgianbun
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SNOZ82 wrote a review Apr 2012,40,"Lovely hotel, great value and great holiday March 14-21st 2012",Upon arrival the hotel reception smells of lilies and the staff were welcoming offering mint tea. The room was a good size clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower was great. Only issue was the air con it didn't seem that strong but it was March so not too hot. The buffet was large we found there to be plenty of variety didn't find the food to be cold except for 1 evening when we ate very late nearly 10pm.    The pools looked well kept we used the heated pool which was lovely not too cold in March. I also used the gym once which was quite basic and there was no water available in the gym so bring your own! We used the hammam which was a good experience although we haven't used them anywhere else so can't compare to others. My boyfriend had a massage which he said was good. Bear in mind that you have to pay extra for the gym (about £7) but you get one use of the hammam for free.    The hotel in general looked well kept the decoration and surroundings were very nice. We didn't get woken up on any day by cleaners but our room was cleaned daily while we were out. We left our laptop at reception for 3 days while we went to the desert and this was kept safely for us no problems. We also used the minibus to town once and this was fine but it only goes a few times a day so depending on when you want to go it might be best to get a taxi from outside (don't pay more than 40 dirhams there's no need just haggle)!    We can't comment on the entertainment/bar as we didn't go there. It seemed like there was something going on each night though. We left the hotel for 3 days on a desert trip to Mezourga (separate review).    Overall I think this hotel would be ideal for anyone. It looked like there was a lot for kids to do and there is a lot of space outside the hotel itself is very large. For couples it is also a great holiday we found it quiet didn't get woken up at all by noise outside or by people in rooms next door or above. It was a great time of year to go as the temperature was around 26-31C.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,PeterGiles wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Execellent Value for Money but a few niggles,On the whole a pretty good hotel (although they would describe it as a “club” – not sure what the difference is) but a few irritating niggles which I will describe later. I also provide a bit of advice about Marrakech itself later on in my review.    Starting with the positives the hotel has only been open for 18 months or so and is very clean indeed. I’m not sure I would call it 5 star but it’s on a par with other five star hotels abroad.    The rooms are very comfortable and well appointed but by far the strong point of the hotel is its staff – they are excellent. Also the gym is the best I have ever come across in a holiday hotel like this as normally the gyms abroad consist of a load of broken machines and not a lot else.    There are two really nice pools one of which is heated and the water slides are great fun for adults and kids alike. The “executive” sun loungers (like double four-poster beds with a canopy and cushions) are worth having but you’ll need to disobey the “sun loungers cannot be reserved” directive and get your towels down before the French! (btw I have nothing against the French per se.)    There’s plenty to do without venturing out of the hotel (apart from eating and drinking) including tennis table tennis archery keep fit aqua aerobics dancing lessons football volley ball and petanque.    On to the “niggles” then:    The food on the whole is excellent particularly the traditional Moroccan cuisine (tagines cous cous etc.) There is also a fantastic selection of salads and desserts as well as good old chips. However we did find some fish and chicken that wasn’t cooked properly on one day but I think this was an isolated incident.    There is a proper Moroccan restaurant which you have to pay a small supplement for but to be honest we couldn’t see the point in it given that the main restaurant’s selection of traditional cuisine was always good. I think for a change of scenery they could do with a second AI restaurant and I’d hate to be in the main restaurant at the height of the holiday season!    The bar near the pool is an asset and the staff there are excellent however it shuts at 6pm – personally I think it should stay open longer as the only other bar is inside.    The air conditioning across the hotel was near useless apart from in the main reception (I have a feeling they disable it off-peak to save money). Not such an issue for us as the weather was rubbish (some of the staff mentioned that the weather around the end of March/beginning of April is pretty variable). In fact on one day we got a free exfoliation courtesy of the wind and the Sahara desert!    The gym whilst excellent doesn’t open until 9am which means that you can’t have a work out before breakfast.    The animation team whilst talented and lovely people were more passive than any hotel I’ve ever been too. In fairness I think they engaged more with the French (which is a natural second language for them) rather than the Brits. Most of the entertainment was in French although us Brits overtook the French in terms of numbers in the week we went and they seemed to try harder with the English translation as a result.    If you are honest at checkout and say “yes” to the question “have you used the safety deposit box in your room?” you will be charged about £20 – something they omit to tell you on check-in. There are also local taxes to pay which work out at £1.50 per person per day (no big deal).  In terms of Marrakech itself you would be ill advised to take children or anyone with a nervous disposition to the Medina. The Medina is a real “eye opener” in terms of the crowds noises smells and some of the “unusual” things that you might see.    If you fancy the Medina and Souks then get your own guide (from your rep or hotel not one of the sharks in the City) and go early one weekday morning. Our guide took us right into the depths of the markets where you can see some of the goods being manufactured by hand.    This was very interesting and we were not hassled at all (because we had a guide and the markets were quiet). Watch out for the mopeds though as they drive through the market no matter how narrow the paths are.    Don’t engage with or photograph any of the “sideshows” like snake charmers or monkey handlers or you will be deemed to have signed a contract with them and they will insist that you pay.    Also (ladies) steer clear of the Henna tattooist women; they are really annoying albeit they will leave you with a (pretty) “rusty” mark on your hand that lasts about 4 days.    The hotel runs a great shuttle service that’s free but you need to book it through reception. Alternatively you can get a taxi but make sure you agree the fare upfront and don’t sit in the front (the seatbelts don’t work because they tend to put two Moroccan ladies on the front seat and four passengers on the back seat – in a 30 year old E class Mercedes!). Having said that the taxi drivers are really good despite the driving conditions being somewhat like playing an arcade game.    One day we wanted to go the Yves St Laurent gardens (recommended) and then into the Souks for half an hour to do some last minute shopping so we negotiated a 200 dirham fare (approx. £20) for 4 of us and the guy was at our beckoned disposal for 2.5 hours.    The Medina is extremely unpleasant in the evenings and is best avoided.    My final advice is “barter like crazy” and be prepared to walk away. Start by offering at least a third of the price the guy quotes and don’t pay more than 50% - they see you coming and will rip you off. We found things in the fixed price shops at the airport that were cheaper than in the markets!,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterGiles
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ColchesterDaisy wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Value for Money,"Visited in March 2012 and found the Hotel excellent value for the price we paid. Apart from a poor start when they sent us to a room what only had one bed made up and not another bed for the 3rd person and then sent a fold up bed what would have been too small for a child and certainly where they wanted to put it would not have been able to get in or out of bed. I protested to reception and asked for a Manager (I was told he was not around and they could not do anything about it) however when I refused to accept it and sat in the reception they got the Manager who arrived but was dressed in a track suit he was certainly not happy but eventually sorted it however when we got to the bigger room there was not another made bed and along came the fold up. We pointed to the sofa what we explained looked as though they could be put together to make a reasonable sized bed however we still had to assist in moving the furniture and awaiting for linen it was now gone midnight.  The rest of the holiday run smoothly thank god and we enjoyed the variety of foods the fish was very good some of the tangine a bit too greasy but lovely salads and breads besides an array of deserts and ice cream (thanks to the Chef for supplying our favourite) and a variety of drinks. They had wonderful lounging tents around the pool besides sun loungers and although the pools were very cold with the very hot weather was worth getting in for a dip. The entertainment Team tried very hard and were very pleasant (a ""Louis Spence"" chap was very athletical). We managed to get booked on to the free mini shuttle bus however it was only 50 dm for a taxi back. The square in Marrakech was very atmospheric and the souks although we had to ask the way out.  We will certainly go back to Marrakech and probably the hotel it will be a first as we do not normally as there is too much of the world to see.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,MariaNineteen84 wrote a review Apr 2012,50,Excellent relaxing hotel away from the hustle and bustle of the souks,Our group of ten arrived at the hotel in the evening where we were promptly served and offered mint tea whilst we checked in. We were all impressed by the hotel foyer and the service and the fact that we had managed to get such a good deal with the hotel and flights. We were then directed to the restaurant for our evening meal which was brilliant as there was plenty of choice at the buffet even though we came late.  After dinner we were lead to our rooms on a nice little golf buggy our rooms were on the ground floor and all next to each other which was good for safety. The rooms were clean and basically but tastefully decorated. The beds were firm and it was cool enough at night so we did not need the air con. We were all inclusive and thought the buffet restaurant was pretty good with a good mixture of Italian French and Moroccan dishes. I note that people have said that it was pretty repetitive but it is a buffet and there are only so many ways you can dress a lettuce and cook a chip! The reason people thought it was sometimes repetitive was because there was so much choice in the first place that cooking anything again would appear monotonous. In between there were cakes pancakes and hot and cold drinks from the snack and cocktail bars. I don’t drink alcohol so I can’t comment on any of that side.  Entertainment-wise there was a bar/disco and a little theatre for the animation team we went to the theatre once it was all in French and they did some covers of popular songs and it all passed the time. We preferred excursions and going into the medina for entertainment and just relaxing at the hotel in the evening. We were happy with the shuttle service and used it a few times when going into the souks – try and book them in good time to avoid disappointment. If you want one in the morning then you should book it the day before. The driver would then let you know what time he was coming back to the same spot.  We did however encounter a problem with the pool we were all Muslim women and the few who used the pool were asked to leave for wearing water-proof leggings and tops. However this said the hotel manager who came to tell us off was very nice and apologetic and said we were free to write to Kenzi Group management about this policy (we emailed the group a week agao and have still not received a response so maybe a letter at the time would have been better) and conceded that we could have exclusive use of the indoor pool at any time we wished during our stay. If we had any problems we usually spoke to Mohammed (there are a few Mohammeds there but this one has a Tom Hanks forehead if that helps!) he was the only one who I felt genuinely wanted to help you and he would go out of his way to do so. There were a lot of nice and friendly staff the morning buffet servers for breakfast omelettes and pancakes in the restaurant Mohammed and the hotel manager especially come to mind.  Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel a nice oasis away from noise of the souks – I enjoyed spending time in the hotel and found it relaxing unlike other hotels I had stayed at.  General tips on Marrakech –  The hotel is a nice 10 minute drive away from the hustle and bustle of the souks and the medina and about 15 minutes from the airport.  Bargain hard with taxi drivers – it should cost no more than 50 dirhams to the medina and no more than 100-150 dirhams to the airport depending on the time. Bargain harder at the souks - The souks can be a bit much and coming from a culture where bartering is the norm that says everything. The sellers were aggressive and overly friendly and there is no such thing as browsing if you go into or look at anything in a shop they will rarely let you go without pushing you into buying something. If they give you a price halve it or just under if you are feeling cheeky and go up slowly if you have to – best tip is to offer your best price and walk off as they will usually call you back. If you get lost just ask for directions to the medina and then look for the minaret of Katoubi Mosque the shuttle pick up point is near the mosque just past KFC and in front of the currency exchange.  On our 3rd and 4th day we took excursions to Palmorie for quad biking and Orica Valley. This was not done through the hotel because we were able to negotiate everything a lot cheaper out of the hotel. Unrelated to the hotel – if you are thinking about going quad biking please bear in mind that it was positively unsafe and dangerous is not anything like quad biking in the Sahara desert which is actually fun. Orica Valley was relaxing with camel rides hiking up a mountain to a waterfall and a stop at a herb garden with good quality organic products for sale.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Bradford,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaNineteen84
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,@KissmouseAlf wrote a review Mar 2012,30,Serenity amid chaos but leaves a bitter taste in the mouth!,Upon arival we were able to check in immediately. The ambiance in the hotel lobby was calming after a stressful journey a wide open space and a beautiful aroma surrounds you. We were taken to our room in a golf cart which was on the ground floor within a riad.    The room was spacious and pleasantly decorated however we were faced with two single beds pushed together instead of the King sized bed we had paid for. This was the first disappointment. We then found that the patio doors that led out to the patio (facing a mud wall)was broken. We phoned reception to request a room change and was told that we could not move until the next day. This was honoured the next afternoon.    Generally the food was ok. Breakfasts were great with a wide selection of foods to choose from. We found the lunches to be better than the dinner selection...although the choices didn't vary much between the two. The hotel has a different theme for evening meals each night however you'll find that the options are generally the same with one small change to the freshly prepared food counter. In terms of the actual restaurant we prefered to eat outside by the little olive trees in the sunshine for breakfast and lunch and inside for dinner. There is no set table for your stay so you can choose to sit wherever you wish. The service inside was mixed. One evening you would have a glass of wine at your table before you'd even sat down and other times you'd ask for a drink that would never appear. At 4pm the hotel offers a snack bar which serves cakes crepes paninis and coffee. This was always a welcomed treat.    The pool area I thought was great. There are numerous double sun loungers under a canvas covering and plenty of sunbeds. The larger pool is unheated and quite frankly too cold to dip your toes in for more than a minute at a time. The smaller pool is heated and although still cold it is bareable and refreshing in the heat.    The pool bar is surrounded by tables and a cute little perimeter of padded seats which overlook the pool. We enjoyed a cold beer up on this terrace as the sun was setting.    I have stayed at many all inclusive resorts and I have to say that the Kenzi club is distinctly average. My partner and I were discussing what would have made it better and although we couldn't quite put our finger on it we felt that it was missing the personal touch and customer service that makes you feel welcome. This was accentuated when we went to check out and were told that we owed them 200 DH for using the safe in the wardrobe. We were not told about this when we checked in and there are no signs in the room to state a charge. We were outraged by this but had no choice but to pay. We left with a sour taste in our mouths and would not recommend this hotel based on the service or lack of that we faced. I was quite relieved to be leaving.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KissmouseAlf

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Danielle D wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Better than expected,Staff were extremely helpful and friendly reps were full of energy (but not pushy!) Plenty to eat and a lot of variety the Moroccan restaurant - although similar to what is available at the restaurant - is one not to miss. Cooked to perfection and mood is amazing and for 100 dirham's per person it's totally worth it. Good wine tasty spirits and bottled/pumped beer available all day everyday desserts were heavenly! The pool with the slides in is very cold but the other one is much better! A couple of bad points: 1 is beware of the safe rental. My sister paid for her safe outright and then they asked for money again when she left. The safe itself is in the room and perfectly secure it's just they charge you twice for it (this happened to another group in the hotel too) the maids are extremely loud too so if you like a lie in take ear plugs! Camel rides which are available to book at the opposite side of the reception are brilliant value for money and a very good experience. Marrakech market is one to see but only if you don't mind hussle and bustle. Blonde and young watch out you may feel uncomfortable on the market. Lots of people trying to get your attention. Cab from/to the market should be no more than 50 dirham. State your fair before you set off - if it's two men getting in the taxi the driver will drive a hard bargain but it's easier to haggle if you're a woman! Last thing I will say is - it might be useful to learn a bit of French before you go as that is their 2nd language!! Although the staff did speak English some of them did struggle so I felt a bit rude not knowing any French which someone told me before I went! Overall brilliant hotel clean quiet (apart from the maids!) good entertainment good leisure activities (table tennis archery etc) and just a relaxing atmosphere. Would definitely go again!,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Norwich, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleD307
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,KalordT wrote a review Mar 2012,20,"Resort, that would like to think it is a 5 star, but really is a 3",The rooms are perfectly acceptable (maybe even 4 stars) but the variable food served is at best 3 stars and sometimes dips down to 2 stars depending on what day you arrive there to eat.  For an 'all inclusive' resort i found it hard to bear that one had to pay for drinks after 11pm in the resort bar. Plus one had to pay to use the onsite gym i can understand them asking for payment for spa treatments but not for the gym - where you do all the work.  The system for gettign into town via the resort's free buses is chaotic and even the staff do not seem to understand what they are doing - trying to stuff 12 people into a vehicle that should only transport 8.  As for the reception staff 'service' does not seem to a part of what they provide.  Every time we approached we were told that it would take 45 mins to sort out a request / problem. Even to get something simple like the code for the room safe!!!!!!!  This stay has put me off resorts and all inclusive packages for life.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KalordT
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,malc316 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Fantastic break !!!,Just back from 4 days at the lovely Kenzi Club Agdal Medina and what a 4 days away.  Met at the airport immediately transfer time to the hotel was 10 minutes...where do the travel agents get this hour and 5 minutes from is beyond me. Check in swift driven in a golf cart to the room by the tennis courts and cant fault the room spacious very clean bath and shower were great.  Got up for breakfast everyday and the choice was amazing as was lunch and dinner there was literally something for everyone even the fussiest of eaters like myself and ignore any reviews that say otherwise. The staff were as friendly as can be and do try to speak a bit of french it will get you seated quicker and served drinks quicker. Oh and you have to have the fresh crepes around 5pm....cooked right in front of you.  Went to the bar every night always got a good seat to watch the entertainment and served immediately which was a bonus.  The animation team work their nuts off in the day and night and are always polite even if you dont participate as does every memeber of staff we came into contact with.    Had a half day in Marrakech booked with Sahara tours learn't a bit of history from our guide Mohammed and toured the souks and square which was an eye opener. Beware of children selling hankies....they literally dont leave you alone and probably would've come back to the hotel if you let them.    All in all this was one of the best trips in my life there is nothing at all you could find fault with at the hotel with the service food cleaning.....    I will be returning later this year or definitely next year as the weather was around 30 degrees but chilly in the evening.    Lastly don't jump in the big pool it's bloody freezing use the smaller one it's a lot warmer !!!,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Bicknacre, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malc316
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,No Fixed Abode wrote a review Mar 2012,40,Excellent Facilities but let down by the food,I stayed for a week on an all inclusive basis in March 2012. The hotel facilities and grounds were excellent with a great choice of activities during the day and in the evening. The staff were extremely friendly helpful and charming. I thought my basic French would be a hindrance but everyone at the hotel spoke excellent English. The hotel is outside the centre of Marrakech but there is a free shuttle bus available although the last bus back to the hotel was at 18.30 each day. Of course there are plenty of taxis available in the city and outside the hotel if the shuttle bus is overbooked. My only negative point about the hotel would be the food. There was plenty of choice in the restaurant so there was always something to eat including pasta dishes chinese and delicous salads and fresh fruit. The drinks (wine beer soft drinks) were also freely given but I found the quality of the beef and lamb to be very poor. On one occasion a Pork roast joint was offered (!) but this was undercooked. There is also a Moroccan restaurant on site which could be booked for an additional supplement but this was well worth it for the experience.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harryc52000
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,james w wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Great Time,"Myself and my wife visited as a belated honeymoon and we were not disappointed. We booked the holiday as a very good deal so weren't expecting too much especially as the price we paid was more than reasonable also we were skeptical as the the ""5 star"" tag!  Once we arrived and got settled in we realised this is very well set-up hotel where the staff are attentive polite and enthusiastic our rooms were always cleaned to a high standard and we were always served promptly at the bar. They have an entertainments team who will encourage you to get involved but with a polite ""no"" they do not insist and continue to be friendly and say ""good morning"" without making you feel guilty about not joining in.  The two pools are great with towels provided there was always somewhere to sit and quite often a cabana!!!!!!  Overall we had a fantastic time and found ourselves able to relax and de-stress for a whole week.  The only comment we would make is that at times the showers would go from hot to cold in seconds without touching the taps and the walls were slightly thin not that this disturbed us.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone that wishes to relax and chill.",Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,bearsted,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesw219
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,ellesbelles57 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Superb little oasis,"I recently made my first trip to Marrakech with 2 other girlfriends. I didn't really know what to expect as friends have had mixed reviews about the city. However I went with an open mind and was not disappointed.    We took a cab from the airport and had read elsewhere on here that the fare should be around 100/150 dirhams. The cab driver obviously saw us coming though and was insistent that it was fixed price of 200 dirhams - he would not even enter into any form of discussion. I am not a fan of batering and after a long journey was quite happy to cough up the difference. It only took about 20 mins so pretty convenient really albeit not terribly close to the main centre.    Upon arrival at the hotel we were met at our cab by very helpful staff who took our cases away and presented us with a gorgeous glass of hot sweet mint tea.    Entrance into the reception hall was a joy. The whole place was immaculately clean and elegant heavily (although not overwhelmingly) scented with incense. The check in procedure was smooth and efficient. We were then driven by buggy to our room which was set down near the tennis courts.    The room was lovely - spacious clean and well appointed with plenty of lights plug sockets etc. We had glazed doors onto a lovely private patio at the back communal courtyard to the front. Plety of cupboard space clean and modern fresh bathroom and nicely powerful shower.    The complex is huge and I am ashamed to say that we did not make the most of the facilities. There are numerous activities organised during the day and a beautiful spa which I kept meaning to book but just didnt get round to. There are two pools - strangely the ""kids"" pool (the larger of the two with a fun water slide) was unheated and absolutely freezing! The smaller pool felt like a bath in comparison. Both were spotlessly clean with plentiful loungers sun booths etc.    I wasn't expecting much in terms of food but it was all great. Bear in mind it is a buffet so there are limitations on what can be cooked fresh but if you go with the expectation that this is a buffet albeit a very good one you shouldnt be disappointed.    One night we paid the additional 100 dirhams to dine at the Morroccan restaurant. This was lovely the food and wine was plentiful the service prompt and efficient. The only thing lacking was that there were only 3 tables of guests so no real ambience but I guess most people were taking advantage of the free buffet!    There is a free shuttle bus that runs into the Medina hourly. Couldnt be easier.    All in all I was delighted with the hotel and will definitely go back there again later in the year. Next time I will book for longer to make sure I have time to do evrythig I missed out on this time!",Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Houghton Conquest, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellesbelles57
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,scarlet1969 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,We were at Club Kenzi for a week at beginning of March and had a fantastic time. I was slightly hesitant on going on this holiday but I can honestly say it is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. I have nothing negative to say and loved every minute. From the minute we arrived until the moment we left and believe me I did not want to leave.    I loved the food and can't complain on that front and I certainly ate my fair share as did my partner!    Our room was lovely a huge bed which must have been kingsize! Our room was upstairs opposite the tennis courts which I would recommend as this was a lovely quiet area. Although if you had a room on the other side of this riad you would see the sunset as I used to walk up on to the roof to watch this.    All the staff are so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The animation team work so hard and there is always plenty of activities to do.    No need to get up early to get your sunbeds as there are plenty! I don't think we were next to anyone the whole week.    We did a lovely trip to the Atlas Mountains and went to a berber house where the locals were so welcoming. You must try the mint tea lovely! We then went on for lunch which again was just so nice. Our guide was called Fred (easier than his real name) and was organised by the rep in the hotel and he was great so helpful.    Oh re the air con - this is switched off in the Winter and throws out hot air instead! I made the mistake of saying to reception it didn't work only to be told this! Personally I loved having the window open as no worry of mosquitoes or the noise of the air con.    Marrakech is such an interesting place magical and mystical and can't wait to go back there.    Can't recommend this hotel enough and def looking at going back in September or October when it is cooler.,Date of stay: March 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scarlet1969

It is exactly what I expect from a hotel - relaxed and helpful friendly staff beautiful surroundings alfresco restaurant. The hotel is in a complex made up of mini riads where you would find your room.    Its all-inclusive you get a wide selection of food – Moroccan dishes as well as Italian cuisine. Also you get a choice of wines. There’s a nightclub on the premises as well it’s hilarious! A must try.    My only complaint about the hotel was with the air-conditioning in the rooms - it’s not very good and you will feel HOT sometimes! I had to sleep with the balcony doors wide open.

All of the staff are friendly and helpful however French is the most widely used language. Most staff speak very good English though.

It's only 15 mins from the airport and the free shuttle bus that goes from the hotel to Marrakech market takes around the same time.

I really dont understand how people can say its a wonderful hotel..... In my opinion the rooms gardens and swimming pools are ok but food and drinks are very limited - ALL the days basically you have the same food and sometimes grilled chicken from one day becomes ""cesar salad"" the next day - using the same chiken cooked the day before... Wine they offer you is good marrocan wine but coctails are very bad - pure sugar and little more. No mojito!!)))  The good point of this hotel is its animation team - they are doing their best to entertain everybody. But as there are mostly french guests in the hotel - they nearly dont speak any English....So if you dont speak french - problem for you!  The bad point is that even though its all inclusive hotel - you need to pay for everything - 10 euros per day to go to the gym (!!) and 10 euros to go to marrocan restaurant.....  Let me say about the room service - 2 out of 5 days they came at 8.00 a.m. (!!!) to clean the room the other 2 days they came around 5.00 p.m. which is really strange....

The hotel is great the food is great and endless and the staff are out of this world. From breakfast through lunch and evening meal there is an endless supply of good food lunch on the terrace is an absolute delight and I cannot think of a better way to spend lunch than there.    They have a team of entertainers and hostsall day long that have to be seen to be believed. They are not only incredibly professional but also the most sincere people I have ever met and it broke our heart to leave. We have many favourites within this team but it would be so unfair to name any one as they are all superb people.    During the day they also have so many things going on that you can do or see personally I needed my sunbed by the pool between meals so did not do many but my wife enjoyed the 'cooking' demonstrations which were a combination of information and entertainment.    Kids (and adults) could play football beach volley boules tennis archery ping pong dance lessons keep fit and much more - and that was all out of the way so it did not intrude on the ones who wanted to just enjoy the main pool areas and sunbeds.    We saw some 'nasty' comments before we went but like most 'negative' comments left on this type of site they are just whines from people who generally should never go abroad! If YOU do not speak French then that is not a problem as long as you understand that maybe some of THEM don't speak a lot of English - and you are in THEIR country!    The best tip I can give anyone who goes is learn to smile all the time say hello all to all the staff and you will be the most welcome person there - they just love to laugh in Morocco.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Shazia A wrote a review Mar 2012,50,Fantastic,Booked this through Last minute.com. We went at the end of February 2012 for 5 days. All i can say is what a a brilliant chill out break we had.  The check in was fine the receptionist told us about the facilities for the hotel.  The hotel has 3 pools one pool with the slides a heated pool where majority of the people would go swimming and do water sports like aqua areobics and another pool for kids. The towels are given for free for users and there is no need for a deposit.  The areas around the pool is great as they have little secluded hut things and lounges around the pool to relax in or loungers. The poolside bar is great serving alcaholic and non alcaholic drinks along with hot drinks they also serve snacks. In between your meals they have snacks somewhere in the complex for you to munch on.  The dining area is great you can either choose to sit inside or outside and even though it is buffet style they do have different stations where they make individual food for you the desserts do get repetitive but they are scrumptious anyway. They serve alchool wih your food either by the bottle or glass and beers they also bring mineral water and coke / zero coke if asked for at your table we ordered a bottle of wine (choice of white rose or red LOVED THE RED) and when we finished our meal we would take the bottle outside and soak up the sun. At breakfast they do a thermos of black coffee so it remains hot if you wish to take it outside or back to your room.  Basically what ever you ask the staff for they are more the happy to help you in everyway.  They have various activities going on through the day. We did archery aqua areobics learn various dancing cooking lessons tennis volley boll......... the list is endless.  The hotel has on site rep staff who over look the entertainment for the evening and the day. At 9.30pm in the conference hall they have different entertainment like caberet and shows. The bar is brilliant if your all inclusive all the drinks are free including your spirits and your cocktails and they are not mean with the measures they also give you little snacks to go with your drinks.  The grounds are huge and impressive well maintained and you can take anything you want from the dining area and bar and take it back to you room or chill out in the many various lounges scattered around the complex.  They also have a shuttle mini bus that goes to the main square during the day for free so no need to catch a bus to see the markets. Be careful though once your in the market haggle alot but also try not to get lost as it is huge. In the evening the square comes alive with great food stalls snake charmers entertainment etc.  We had a ground floor room with an en suite the room was large and the bathroom had a great power shower - loved it.  I can say a lot more about this hotel but i would probably bore you but i HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel especially if you want to relax and enjoy with out any worries. We only verntured out a couple of days as there was no need to go anywhere as what ever we needed the hotel provided.  If you read any negative reviews on here then i will assure you now that this hotel is brilliant.

Luckily smoking is banned in the restaurant unlike a lot of restaurants in Marrakech. Unfortunately it is allowed in the bar though. The bar is okay for families otherwise but we preferred to go into Gueliz for drinks or the Sofitel. The food was good I thought the wine was horrible but I am quite fussy with wine. For the price we paid I would have been happy to eat out every night but we didnt need to. The main complaint I would have on the food is that it was often a bit cold so we tried to eat early. The 4pm crepes are good too.    Channel 28 is a movie channel (Arabic subtitles) which is good if you get sick of Sky News!    We didnt bother with the shuttle bus into the Medina as taxis were 50 DHS - less than £3. You just have to haggle a lot.    In terms of the Marrakech souks and Medina I would echo other reviews in saying do not make eye contact if you dont want to be hassled say NO firmly haggle everywhere you can and dont take photos of anyone in the square or accept help with directions unless you want to pay.

In fact most of the staff in the bars and the restaurant loved to speak English. The hotel offers tennis archery football volleyball table tennis and petanque - all free. There is no deposit for the pool towels. There is a creche and the entertainment staff will keep children occupied most of the time.    The rooms are of reasonable size and the showers TV etc work fine. The TV has about 18 channels . 4 of which were in English language but mostly news channels although we did manage to watch all the six nations rugby matches live. There is a fridge in the room for which if you ask you can get water beer and wine all free. The food in the restaurant in unexceptional but adequate. The staff are attentive and lively. We found it paid to identify a particular waitre and find him each time to get you a table and look after you. The wines beers water are quite good and in inexhaustible supply. The pool bar is not so good. The bar staff have a way of ignoring you by pretending to be busy. The bar ran out of beer several times with no immediate back up. It woks if you make them no you are there when you arrive. The evening bar/Nightclub is entertainment oriented and quite noisy. . Don’t go to the bar when you arrive - get a seat and waive at a waiter. There is nowhere to have a quite drink. In the end we stayed in the restaurant after dinner.    It is worth going to Marrakech but don’t go on a Friday as it is much less active. A taxi was 150 DAM return for up to 4 people.    We paid £219.79 each for the Hotel All Inclusive and found it good value for money.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinO639
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,JoeK134 wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Marrakech uncovered,"Arriving at the airport the first challenge is to negotiate your way around a taxi fare to the hotel. I would imagine you could pay anything from 70mads - 7000mads depending upon how gullible you look and how long you are prepared to have a row after a 4 hr flight (even though it is all part of a game). Arrival at the Kenzi Club was very welcoming would like to have swerved the gentleman in the local dress(bell boy) who took our bags and drove us all of 20metres to our apartment. Oh how I wish I had travelled with a smaller denomination of currency for his tip!  After this it all got increasingly better. Facilities good staff very friendly and accomodating and tried exceptionally hard to engage holidaymakers and encourage participation in the many events available. Plenty of sunloungers quiet spots well maintained pools and good food and drink options  A trip to the souks is a MUST ! I can not tell you what it is like to get off the courtesy bus and have people swarming at you to take you on a guided tour to take your money and extract every last bit of enjoyment you could have had. 15mins later lost in the labyrthinth of market stalls a very helpful individual offered to help the two stressed tourists back out to the main square. The pleasant smile turned to an aggressive toothless grin ""you give me present you buy me small chicken"" After giving him 20mads and finding our own way out we made our way to the open top tourist bus. This is where we should have started ! On a more serious note it is a great experience to watch the snake charmers and multicoloured stalls of fruit etc.  I would recommend the Kenzi Club and the views of the atlas mountains were stunning. My only regret is not making time for a trip to the mountains.",Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeK134
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,raquiesce_80 wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Fantastic!,Stayed here for a weekend and loved every moment of it.    1. Clean rooms everyday.  2. Hospitable multi-lingual staff who were very accommodating. Upon arrival we were served with Moroccan mint tea which was refreshing.  3. They have loads of activities within the hotel so even if you decide not to go out you can still find things to do there. (THE SPA WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE THOUGH most staff there do not speak English so there was a bit of miscommunication)  4. Buffet was fantastic!  5. They offer tours within the city which is convenient.  6. MONEY CHANGER AT FRONT DESK.  7. 3 swimming pools  8. Bidets in the toilet/bath    Tip: Avail of their ALL INCLUSIVE OFFER. You wont regret it.    Before hiring a cab ALWAYS ask reception what the usual rate is. Cab drivers normally  increase asking price and big taxis dont have meters.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquiesce_80
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Charlotte M wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Kenzi Kitch!,The positives; this hotel has the best soundtrack going! The hotel was spaced out well so even if you were lazy like us and wanted to have some downtime and do nothing for a couple of days you didn't feel like a battery tourist. This hotel is very current sharp designs and bold colours throughout. The more attractive staff are designated to mix with the guests and others are on hand to wait on you with good grace. Feburary is great time to visit as it doesn't feel too busy and the winter sun is very welcome. We used Transfer 24/7 who were very reliable and cheap £24 return for 2 in a nice private car pay in full on arrival at the airport.    The food was good; there was a wide selection of different foods to choose from. We went fully inclusive and there was a nice breakfast that even included a cook making an omelette of your choice. Wine beer and cocktails were limitless and good quality. In regards to the entertainment the first night was the best (Friday) a Morracon themed night although I did not agree with the snakes being used for entertainment as it didn't seem to fit with the hotel's modern image. However I loved the dancers and drummers and woman with a tray of candles on her head!  The only slight issue was being 'bumped' into their sister hotel on arrival for one evening; that made us feel slightly unsettled. However the hotel made up for this with an upgrade to a suite and a free Hamman in the hotel spa it was lovely. I'd reccomend you do this anyway (about £7.00). I would also have liked the shuttle to Marrakech run later than the current time of 6PM and also for it to be a clearer system as a couple nearly ended up at the airport!  Overall this hotel is well worth the money we paid (£150 for 4 nights). It deserves it's 4* plus rating and we're intending to return next year with more friends.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlotteM592
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,LK_MBE wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Absolutely Fabulous,Stayed 3 nights at the beginning of February got a real bargain through Broadway Travel. The Hotel is on the outskirts of Marrakech in the middle of nowhere this is not a problem as there is a free hourly shuttle bus from the hotel this has to be booked.  Our room (814) was on the fround floor of the Riad nearest the pool. it was lovely very clean and spacious. There are only a couple of niggles the shower seat was broken and the water did not rain away making the floor very slippy also the safe did not work and they didnt send anyone to fix it but we still had to pay for it. The Riads are all set in the most beautiful gardens whih are lit up at night teams of gardeners work really hard to keep it looking lovely.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned it is All Inclusive but the good thing is they dont stop you from using the facilities and restaurant before you have checked in or after you have checked out.  the food was nice the restaurant was very busy at the weekend.  We were one of only three or four English couples which was great! I disagree with those reviewers who complained about a lack of English spoken as soon as they found out everyone fell over themselves to translate even other guests. Its amazing who you get to meet and chat with if you just smile and say hello. The staff on reception mainly spoke very good english and the animation team were very friendly and helpful. it was one of the happiest places I have ever stayed and I cant wait to go back.  The temperature when we went was about 15-18* spring like weather but I was amazed to see some Brits dressed for the height of summer! You should bear in mind that it is an Islamic country and dress respectully especially in the city.  The bar was very good nice cocktails and the shows were very well done (even if you dont like snakes!)  The free wi-fi available thoughout the hotel was faster than we have at home but was a bit slower at the weekend.  A trip into Marrakech is a must do not be worried by shopping in the souk just be firm but polite if you dont want to buy anything I found the Morrocans much less agressive than the Tunisians or Egyptians in this respect. one warning be wary of the men with the monkeys they looked a bit sorry fro themselves but do explore the souk and the main square. A taxi ride back to the hotel was about 100 dir. £8 make sure you fix the price before you get in the taxi especially if you are going to the airport we forgot and the fare doubled according to the driver because it was a sunday.  The whole trip was an amazing experience.,Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Colchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LK_MBE
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SFFoodies wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Great hotel,We stayed here one night after finding a deal on a hotel site. It was the highlight of our stay given that we had kids. It is all inclusive so it was just easy..although if you ate here every day you'd probably want to try something different. That said the kids love the buffets they could eat the moment they were hungry and could eat what they chose. The wonderful thing about this hotel is that it had a water slide and a heated pool...a rarity in Morocco in the winter time. Also there was ping pong tables and plenty of space for them to run around. Security was tight so they had a lot of freedom and that was fun for them. And the wireless worked in our hotel room which for me was a big plus. Many hotels in Morocco only have wireless connections in their lobbies. The one other drawback is that this place was far from the center of town so you had to cab it in and out.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Rancho Santa Fe, California",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFFoodies
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,qwerty5 wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Very satisfactory,"Pretty much agree with everyone else. Room was very nice couldn't fault it. Food is average to good but gets very repetitive. Definitely not haute cuisine but enough choice to satisfy everyone. The staff were always happy to bring bottles of wine water and coke on request which was nice.    Staff in general seemed quite miserable personality-less but were always polite. There was no service with a smile but they were perfectly competent and English was never a problem.    Poolside bar was nice and afternoon snack bar with crepes was a nice touch.    Only two downsides I can think of one the shuttle into town is generally full unless you book it the night before. It goes about once an hour up until 6pm. Taxi into town/airport costs about £8-£10. If you stay here yoiu will likely have to get taxis more than once.    The other downside was on checkin. I am a guy and I came here with my boyfriend. Knowing that being gay is still illegal in Morrocco I decided to checkin alone and ask for a king sized bed. The man at reception said that that would be no problem until he realised I was staying with another guy at which point he said in a disgusted voice ""and you want a king sized bed?"". Was quite embarassing and demeaning but then maybe I was being optimistic to think it would be different. No problem with staff members after this. We got a room with two singles.    I would definitely return to Morrocco but I would be more careful about the gay thing in the future.",Date of stay: February 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/460Rob
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Doraexploring wrote a review Feb 2012,50,Great 5 night break in Marrakech,My boyfriend surprised me with this trip to Marrakech and I loved it. The hotel is gorgeous on arrival they welcomed us with a cup of mint tea and it was delicious. We were too early to check in so they looked after our bags whilst we went for lunch once we had eaten our rooms were ready. We were upgraded to a family room as it was my birthday the room was beautiful 2 toilets 2 sinks 2 flat screen T.V's a gigantic bed and a walk in shower with a seperate bath.    There are 2 pools 1 heated which was lovely very cold in January when yoyu get out but we took out dressing gowns from the room and put these on when we got out and went back to the room. We used the indoor pool as well. This cost approx £10 per person to use once or £20 to use for your entire stay. The pool is not very hot the outdoor pool is warmer. We used the Hamman which is a turkish spa (we were never sure whether there was an extra charge to use this but we used it and nobody said anything) after the turkish spa the cold pool was refreshing.    The courtesy bus is great into town we used it 3 times. Make sure you go to the Souks. After 3 attempts we managed to find the palace and this was worth a visit. We once caught a taxi back from the town to the hotel and paid around £7. They tried to charge us more but we negitiated the price down.    We booked a camel ride with the company located at the hotel. It was a great morning we were on the camels for around 2 hours and half way stopped at a moroccan home for tea olives and bread.    The best thing about this hotel is the lack of other English people there i go on holiday to get away from England so it was nice to have to try and communicate in French and not have everything so easy. The all inclusive aspect of this hotel is fab if you order wine at dinner they leave the bottle and will bring another when that is finished we were never short of drinks.    One small sad part of the hotel is the a la carte resturant which is £10 extra per person. The food is not any different from the other restaurant the only difference is they serve you. They take absolutlely ages between courses and if its January the resturant is very cold. I wouldn't recommend this at all. The funniest part is when we asked for the menu we were told there is no menu haha not very a la carte!!!    Stay at this hotel if you want luxury away from the noise of the city centre. There is a beautiful view of the mountains and it's just pure relaxation!!!!!,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Leamington Spa, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doraexploring

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,matrix1000 wrote a review Jan 2012,20,Initally good until.......,Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.  We got a taxi from the airport. 180MAD...but if you book on 247transfers you can get it cheaper.    Although it was away from the city centre it was a short ride from the airport.    The hotel was lovely and clean. As you entered a lovely smell hits you. But after 4 days it gets a bit nauseating.lol    Checkin was easy and we were taken to our room by golf cart.  Our room was way at the other end which we loved it that way...so we could sun bathe outside our room with out much disturbance.  The room was large and there was complimentary soap/body wash etc.  The AC worked.  And we managed to get wifi in our room just.    The restaurant was large and most people ate outside for lunch and breakfast.  Breakfast was standard buffet and they did do eggs moroccon style in the tagine.  Fresh orange juice is always a hit.  Fresh bread. That was the best.    Lunch was good on the first day.  Loads of choice and freshly cooked. Loved the grilled vegetables and also grilled fish and even grilled turkey.  I was excited to try lamb tagine but sadly it was bland. I thought maybe I was accustomed to overly seasoned food so my taste buds must be numb. But I saw loads other people using the salt shaker very liberally.  Dinner was ok. They try to change the meat kind between lunch and dinner but most of the veggie stuff was the same  Loads to drink and the wine flowed freely.  The desserts were really good I thought.    There are two pools one was heated.  And there are large couch like sunbeds for you to lay on which I liked.    The pool bar served the best coffee...much better than what was served for breakfast.  There as loads of snacks to eat for a mid afternoon snack.    Entertainment was okish to good. The first night there was a selection of entertainers from snake charmers to fire dancers and belly dancers and traditional singing. It was really good.  The other nights there was singing and dancing by the animation team. There were pretty good.  The first night was excellent as most people were dancing after the entertainment so there was a good vibe.  The host spoke mostly in french.    A little note if you are English.....at the start of the entertainment the host will say ''good evening'' in many languages so that they get a feel of the different nationalities present. If no one answered back in English then there was no english translation. We only sussed that on the second night. lol. But we still enjoyed the show.  The other nights if there were more than 3 couples dancing that was too much. I guess it was the quiet season so most guest came on the weekend.    My holidays was turning out great.  I was really happy until I had dinner on the second.  I went for the grilled chicken which was tasty. Until I got to the bone and realized it was raw.  I went back to the grill station And I noticed that they were all checking the chicken not sure if other guest complained.  The following morning I was sick with tummy aches nausea and diarrhoea.  It was so bad I missed a planned tour to the Berber Village.  I stayed in bed for that day/night and took some anti-d tablets and I was ok by the next day.  I guess I was fortunate only to have had a little bit of chicken bcz if I had more I would have had to be hospitalized.  This spoilt my holiday because I thought a 5 star hotel would have properly trained chefs operating the grilling station.    The next two days I was careful with what I ate and enjoyed the rest of my stay.    There is a shuttle bus which has to be booked.  Make sure you go to the souks. We got properly lost.  Thats the fun in it. U must haggle for the price.  Be careful of the locals trying to give u and unoffical tour.  When we got lost it was so obvious that we were that someone pointed this way to the souks then he tried to give us a tour and demanded 5 euros each when we told him we wanted to be left alone.  Be careful of the snakes in the big square. There were like 6 diferent snake charmers all over the square.  We didnt take the horse and buggy ride.    There is also a KFC in the main square right where the shuttle bus drops u off. Try the spicy chicken its great. I booked a 5 star all inclusive hotel but ended up having KFC bcz I got food poisoning from eating hotel food.    My friend didnt eat any grilled chicken during the stay at the hotel and if you how the holiday was the answer would be...''very good'' and would give the hotel 4 out 5 stars.    But for me I cant bcz of the undercooked grilled chicken that made me unwell.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Devon, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matrix1000
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DTWinfield wrote a review Jan 2012,40,Close to MEDINA,The KENZI CLUB AGDAL MEDINA is a great place to stay. The rooms are large with a good sized bathroom. The safe try it before you pay as it is free to use but they charge 3 euro per day. The hotel is like new and very clean. The whole of Marrakech is built in red brick (Marrakech is called the red city) so the hotel can seem like a fortress. All the staff gave very good service and could speak good English. They were very helpful when the informed you about trips without promoting their own tours. There are two large swimming pools one heated. The hotel has only two bars one pool side. This is raised and overlooks the heated pool and you can see across to the other pool to the slides. The only other one is in the entertainment room. There are plenty of hidden places to sunbathe (As the hotel was quiet there were a vast amount of available sun beds including massive double sun beds around the pools (Heaven)). There is a refundable charge for towels in the hotel details but they just said they are free help yourself no charge. The entertainment was average and lacked atmosphere. Waiter service but is quicker to go to the bar and once they service you they will serve you again and again this saves you waiting. The restaurant is first class though there is a nice choice of food mainly Moroccan and Italian not a array of food as in other 5 star Hotels. All drinks are served by the bottle Wine or soft drinks Coke lemonade etc (1LT bottles). Marrakech is bazaar and a must to see late afternoon and after dark. This hotel is a great place to stay as there is great views across the Atlas snow-capped mountains very close the centre of Marrakech The shuttle bus is a good free service.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Josephine K wrote a review Jan 2012,40,An English couple's review in January 2012,Half way though and quite pleased. Downside is although plenty of varied food it is never very hot soups usually tepid at best and tea always only tepid. Nowhere to go for a quiet drink either before or after dinner as bar/lounge is very big with a dance floor but often has extremely loud music playing (like a kid's disco/nightclub and you cannot talk. The vocalist sings most nights and has a good voice - BUT her songs are almost all in French. There are no other rooms to sit in. So if it is cold (and it IS cold after say 5pm in January) your only option is to go to your room. Everyone of the French guests have brought anoraks and wool sweaters and wear them - even at meal times. No one tells you what is happening or where anything is and all announcements are either in arabic or french. No reps boards to read no library of books and no helpful notices in reception. However it is very clean with lovely pools and gardens and pleasant and plentiful staff. There is a fairly comprehensive shopping mall about a mile away otherwise you need to book a place on the shuttle bus but the last one back is at 6.30pm. Last night the dining room staff were dressed as pirates some French custom? - who knows?

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Elainenutta wrote a review Jan 2012,50,OUTSTANDING!,I go away at least 2 or 3 times a year I like to try lots of different places this is by far the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. I am 36 and came here with my mum aged 61. I can't understand how anyone has felt the need to moan/complain or put this place down I thought it was outstanding in every area apart from food which I would class about 3star still very nice but not outstanding. Me and my mum could not fault this place.    Upon entering the hotel the smell of orange flower filled the room very pleasent. Reception is big bright and welcoming very modern decor throughout. The reception staff couldn't have been more helpful or friendly Yesar was particularly attentive and contrary to what I have read in other reviews most staff spoke excellent english only the porter I found spoke only French but even he was friendly and helpful.    We were taken to our room by golf buggy which we thought was a lovely touch everywhere is spotlessly clean including the rooms and everywhere in the grounds. The room had a balcony with a view of the apartments opposite but we didn't care as we were so impressed with everything and were only there for 2 days. The room had tv air con/heating safe fridge and the shower was really nice.    We went in the first week of January and had one day of beautiful sun 22degrees and one day which was cooler maybe 12degrees. The pool area is lovely again spotlessly clean big water slides comfy sun loungers and big pagoda style sunbed's big enough for 2 or 3. Towels are provided. There wasn't much going on in the day as it was out of season but there are programmes of activities for busier times.    Food was nice just maybe not quite my taste huge variety of salad fruit and cakes a couple of Moroccan style dishes a pasta counter and some other fresh meats being carved pizza chips and fish also lots of bread. Wine soft drinks and water are served at your table by the most lovely freindly and chatty staff who take the time to get to know you and look after you if you are courteous enough to them.    The bar at night is full of atmosphere serving various cocktails which we found were VERY strong not what Im used to at all inclusive! There seems to be entertainment on every night regardless how many guests there are which I thought was great. There is a Moroccan style restaurant which you need to book into and need to pay a little bit extra for we didn't try it.    The Spa was nice too I had a massage very relaxing and reasonably prices 300dirham for 30 mins (a bit less than £30) There was a charge to use the pool which I thought wasn't very good. The grounds and seating areas are very impressive.    There is a shuttle bus to the town for free very useful. If you've never been to Marrakech I recommend getting a guided tour around the souks it can be daunting and overwhelming. Overall this short break was made very special for me mostly by the staff and facilities I will be coming back here some time soon and bring my 2 children.,Date of stay: January 2012,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Lancashire,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elainenutta

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Manchester_Matthew wrote a review Jan 2012,30,You can see the Mountains,"The Kenzi Club is a bog standard affair. It's so bog standard it's obvious the 5 stars are self applied. Based on their own special criteria my bathroom is a five star hotel complete with fresh towels everyday; a place to bathe; hot running water; and food hastily prepared in the kitchen with little effort to make it taste marvellous because hey it was hastily prepared.  But wait! There's a glorious pool; TWO! glorious pools with comfort for all; and a snack bar open most hours of the day serving pizza and pastries (hastily prepared mind you); and beer on tap; and the hotel rooms have TVs showing Spanish cookery shows (which demonstrate rather aptly how to prepare food hastily); and a wristband you have to wear at all times to prove you're a guest.  WAIT! What? A wristband? Never before have I been to a hotel where the most important requirement is for a guest to wear a wristband that I must report cannot be removed. Is it really necessary? I mean who would want to sneak in? It'd be like somebody sneaking into my bathroom to use the soap. Wait there sir! Have you a wristband? Have you paid to use the soap? I looked around and all the guests were wearing the same brown wristbands. Except the children; the children were wearing pink wristbands. Of course! The wristbands are to differentiate between the children and the adults. It all begins to make sense; particularly if you consider this question I was asked by a member of the reception staff ""do you prefer humans or babies?""  The food then you may have gathered is hastily prepared. This is not a guess either; I have not spent time considering the conditions that would lead to such bog standard food. The chefs are on display hastily preparing food missing key ingredients like seasoning and spice. Plus. PLUS! The food is cold; typical of a buffet really. I mean whoever heard of hot food at a buffet? Come to think of it why do buffets exist at all?  Enough of the complaints. Let's provide a plus point; something on to which we can all hang a glimmer of hope; the Kenzi Club is cheap. Very cheap in fact. Unless you spend New Year's Eve there in which case you'll pay a lot more for a special meal of boiled carrots.  Also you can see the mountains.  One last gripe before I leave this domain and enjoy myself elsewhere. If you think you're going to get a double bed you'll be wrong. This is one of those hotels that prevents acts of intimacy by pretending two single beds pushed together is a double bed. Any movement towards the frisky and you'll find yourself in a very different type of crack.",Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Manchester, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manchester_Matthew
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CiprianRomania wrote a review Jan 2012,50,Excellent hotel,I spent 6 days at Kenzi Club Agdal Medina with my family and I can tell you and everyone that was a fantastic holiday one of the best I-ve ever spent in my life. The hotel was superb decorated for Christmas days. On 24 of December Santa Klaus came on a camel and offered a presence to every child. Every european tourist received a precence in his room (a chocolate Santa). The Christmas dinner was a very big surprise with very high standard food specialities like Homars Duck with oranges Turkeys Lamb with spices (boiled 10 hours) and so on. I cannot understand how some customers made bad reviews about this hotel. I think that this hotel is EXCELLENT in any point of view. So  if you really want to spend your holiday at this hotel just ignore the bad reviews. This hotel has very high standards and services for all customers and the prices are not so high if you book in time (a couple of months before you go). The main foreign language speaking by employees is french but many of them speak and understand english. The all inclusive board is one of the best I-ve ever met in fact is an ultra all inclusive. You can have every drink at bar (not just locals). I think that the position of the hotel outside the centre of Marrakech is an advantage because here is a safe zone and really smell the fresh air coming from Atlas mountains. A free minivan transport the customers daily to and from the centre of Marrakech but you must book with 24 hours in advance. Do not hasitate to go in a trip in Marrakech by the tourist company wich is in the reception hall “Tour de ville” is 19 euros (aprox. 190 dirhams) and of course do not forget your camera. When I saw for the first time Jema el Fna I was a little disappointed but someone told me: “This is history. 700 years ago this place was the same.” You must be very carefull because a motorbike can hit you in every moment they have no rules. Everyone wants to be a guide for 5 euro (do not accept them) and everyone wants to sell you something (their prices are twice or much bigger than the real price). If you want a shop with fix prices I recomand an “Artisanal complex” at 10 minutes distance from Jema el Fna on the boulevard called Mohamed V (five). There is also a good shop of souvenirs with fix prices at the airport (before check in). Marrakech has also a modern zone called Gueliz. For the transfer to and from airport you can use site internet www.247transfer.com wich is cheaper than taxi (13 euro instead of 15-20 euro) and booking.com for hotel. If you want to change money the best course is at the airport. Do not change money in town the reception of hotel is better. All in all there was a very interesting holiday in an african old town and if I return in Marrakech I will go back to Kenzi Club Agdal Medina.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Otopeni, Romania",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CiprianRomania
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Jilljilani wrote a review Dec 2011,20,"Hugely disappointing, no way a 5*hotel.",Spent the worst week's holiday of our life at this hotel. It looked like Cell block H from the outside inside more reasonable. The staff were surly & the restaurant was the pits. Food was poor quality & the dining experience was worse than a large works canteen. They have made the mistake of mixing conference delegates with paying guestsinstead of separating the dining area.in fact priority is given to the conference delegates who swamp the dining area & take all the best food.  The hotel is miles out of the centre of Marrakech & the shuttle bus is not frequent. There is nowhere of interest to walk it's like a wilderness all round.  If you are from the UK avoid this hotelit's a total waste of money.,Date of stay: March 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jilljilani
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,J W wrote a review Dec 2011,40,Great for a winter break,Good hotel about a £20 taxi ride from the airport far enough out to be quiet with lovely clean air. Because of the time of year things were very quiet this suited us. Staff were polite and friendly and we had no language problems. We are quite active but the hotel is much too far from the centre to walk. Used the very efficient shuttle bus in and out of town centre this has to be booked at reception – make sure you see the receptionist put your name on the list next to the time requested as if the bus is full they will bump you to the next time and not tell you. Shuttle stops about 6pm but a taxi only cost about £4-£5 one way.  Room was large and clean with a small fridge. If you are AI You can ask waiters at meal times and staff at the outside bar for water or soft drinks to take to the rooms. Pools are fab and the large outside heated pool is really lovely and warm. Nice areas around pool to sit and read soaking up the winter sun.  The food although plentiful was bland. There was plenty of choice and no one should go hungry. The AI is a good deal as the wine served by the bottle at meals is very nice especially the rose staff make sure you have a plentiful supply. Not as impressed as others with the cocktails but as we do not drink a lot we are not really experts. Would highly recommend this hotel for a winter break.,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Swansea, Wales.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OspreySwansea_Wales
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,holiday003london wrote a review Dec 2011,40,excellent,On arrival to this hotel the reception area was very spacious well decorated and smelt lovely! Checking into rooms was simple and straightforward. Rooms were perfectly fine and clean. We were in a group of 12 and the foods and drinks were all inclusive. There was a variety of buffet food. Being vegetarian i was very concerned about the choice of food however there was no problem at all. Omelettetes and pastas etc are made fresh on the spot with choice of ingredients to add. There is all sorts of foods like pancakes morroccon tagines and loads of desert choices. The only reason i put this as a 4 rather than 5 is because i asked twice if particular food was vegetarian and specified no meat or fish and i was told yes it is definetely vegetarian yet the pizza had an anchovie in and the rice had a sausage. I put this down to poor understanding of languages. The staff were pleasant but communication in the country as a whole was slightly difficult. The country itself is pretty expensive and everyone will try and rip you off when out and about and in cabs. For people looking for a night life pacha was good but le comptoir was amazing terraces with sheesha and bar lounge had amazing music atmosphere and again people drinking and smoking sheesha inside having a laugh. It is an up market club and drinks are expensive but definetely worth it for a night. We went for a weekend suprise birthday and had an amazing time in resort and pacha and le comptoire. We spent an evening visiting the markets (souks) i would advise to be on guard here as random people will attempt to touch you belongings and you may get a little harrassed. I woudl also advise going well covered as they like to stare! However on resort and in clubs dress as you like!,Date of stay: December 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday003london
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,VikkiSlade wrote a review Dec 2011,50,lovely antidote to the madness of the medina,"after two wonderful days in a riad (dar silsila fantastic!!) we wanted to try out a ""western style"" hotel. just 10 minutes from the medina (with hourly free shuttle bus) this hotel was ideal. the rooms are modern and spacious with all mod cons and the pools lovely - one heated and one not. waterslides were in the process of being put in and there were sports and childrens facilities. the hotel was all-inclusive and the food was plentiful and delicious.  staff were friendly although it was mainly french speaking everyone did speak english and we could follow most of the entertainment team's commentary in the evening.  the bar is large which means there isnt a lot of atmosphere early in the evening but when full its very good i presume in high season the pool bar would be open too. we would definitely return here with or without our children",Date of stay: November 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"poole,dorset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VikkiSlade

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,portugalfan22 wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Go but don't pay 5 star prices,The first thing to say is that this is not a 5 star resort and if you pay 5 star prices you will be very disappointed. Take advantage of the many offers through lastminute etc and you will have a good value holiday. The standard is 3 star plus bordering 4 star. As other reviewers have said the location is very good. 15 mins from the airport and 15 mins from the centre of Marrakech. The first impressions are good. A nice entrance and reception. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. Everything we asked of them they did. Most speak good enough English but exchanging courtesies in French is well received and they will patiently let you recall your school days French if you have a go.  The rooms are nice and spacious and well furnished. We had a quad room which was great for our family. The only disappointment was the lack of attention to detail in the finishings. Poor tiling and grouting which has become dirty and a broken shower rail being a couple of examples. It is a shame because the design and quality of furnishings is good but they are poorly installed. Also as mentioned previously the showers are hopeless as they constantly alternate between dousing you with hot and cold water. Pretty poor if they are truly aiming for 5 stars.  The restaurant has a good range of food albeit a bit repetitive and everything is freshly cooked. The only problem is that the hot plates are not all turned on and a lot of the food goes cold quickly. Drinks flow well and the local bottles of wine very drinkable.  The grounds of the hotel are very nicely maintained and the swimming pools are very good. One tip is that the heated pool is only switched on from 1 November so if you are planning a trip at this time of year worth bearing in mind. Once the heating is up and running the heated pool is very pleasant. Although we did not take advantage of it the kids club team seemed enthusiastic and friendly.  The hotel has a good shuttle service into the centre which it is best to book the day before. The organised trips from the hotel were very good and the tour of Marrakech a less stressful way to see the main sights particularly with young children. The presence of a guide also deters some of the street vendors.  Overall a good hotel with friendly helpful staff and a good inclusive package.pay the right price and you will not be disappointed.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Albufeira, Portugal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portugalfan22

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,alisonmurphy30 wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Brilliant time,We had originally booked a riyad in the medinabut on arrival found it to be nothing like the internet pictures and definitely not able to accomodate the 6 of us who went together.  So 3 of us moved to this resort.  We booked it through laterooms 2 hrs before we arrived at it. We were both shocked and delighted to find out it was all inclusive as it was really cheap for a last minute booking.  From start to end we found it a lovely relaxing holiday .Was really pleased to be away from the noise and smells of the Marrakech centre.  A few dirham tip to the staff ensured we had their full attention all day and they were excellent .  Our room for 3 was roomy and really clean. Great having a fridge also . Was good to find out they were giving us quality drinks and water mainly with the CocoCola brand and not the cheap tasteless stuff.  Found a lovely taxi driver outside the hotel who took us on trips out for only a few pounds and spoke English quite well . One trip took 4 hrs and cost us the equivalent of £27 ! amazing bargain. for 3 of us  and we also felt safe with him.  Mrrakech itself we did not enjoy especially being touched and them attempting to drag us into shops . Did go around the souks to the tannery etc but did not enjoy it.  In the Medina men tried to grab our camera's off us as they wanted money off us to take pictures . Had never before seen so many drunk men lying in the gutters and streets .  The hotel made our holiday amazing we met a lot of new friends who we danced and laughed the night away with . The night animation teams were fun .    Cant really think of any negative things about the hotel except the spa people need to be taught how to do pedicures properly as their way is uncomfortable and painful.    10 out of 10 Kenzi Club Hotel for making our disaster of a holiday into a brilliant one at an amazing price as well .,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"Stafford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alisonmurphy30
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,blevins wrote a review Nov 2011,50,Excellent place for a short break!,We travelled to Marrakech during the October School half-term (24-28 Oct). I had been to Marrakech before and wanted to show my family a bit of the place. The Kenzi Club is a very nice new hotel complex and the rooms are all quite large clean and well decorated. Other reviews mention that the “Brits” are few and far between and that few of the staff speak much English. It is perfectly true that the vast majority of the clientele at the hotel are French; this really should come as no surprise – Morocco is after all a former French colony. Some staff speak English fairly fluently but most do not. However in my view this is part of the charm of Morocco. It is not Benidorm or Faliriki and the food culture and everything else is distinctly French colonial/Middle Eastern - that is the charm of the place and why we went. The simple answer is to brush up on your school French and try a few words yourself. If you can stretch to a few words of Arabic (please/thank you/hello etc) so much the better! The staff go out of their way to be helpful and we never had any problems with service either in the restaurants or at the bar. Indeed I have to say the bar served some of the best cocktails I have had in a long time and the staff were really pleasant and attentive – just be friendly to them and they will return the complement with interest! Although absolutely not essential in common with pretty much any bar in the world the odd tip is much appreciated too and certainly ensures tip-top service! We gave out 20 dirham notes (about £1.80) every other round. Our French cousins love their wine of course and this was freely available and served by the bottle at every meal. We tried the white red and rose varieties during our week; it was Moroccan but perfectly drinkable. The entertainment programme was again conducted mostly in French but we still had an absolute ball – the French certainly know how to party and we joined in and had a great time. We were often the only Brits there but the staff still tried to say a few words in English to make us feel included!  All in all I would highly recommend the Kenzi Club as am excellent value-for-money base for getting a flavour of Middle Eastern culture without the long flight down to Abu Dhabi or somewhere. The rooms are clean and spacious the food is hugely varied and fresh and well-cooked and the pools etc are all very clean. A couple of quirks: you have to pay a small daily charge to use the in-room safe and pay a refundable 150 DHs (about £12) deposit for each beach towel. However if you need it wireless internet is available throughout the hotel (including the rooms) and is free of charge. A visit to the main market place Dejenna al Fna is an absolute must – it is huge and apart from various market stalls it is full of street entertainers (magicians singers snake charmers etc). It is also surrounded by lots of restaurants where you can get a meal and look down on the sights and sounds. Once again – if it’s “Fish & Chips or the Full English” washed down with pints of “Carly Spesh” with everyone speaking English then the Kenzi Club – or indeed Morocco is probably not for you. However if you want a good quality excellent value base to explore a new culture then I would highly recommend it.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,UK,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blevins

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,PhoebeMW wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Lovely 4.5 star hotel.,We arrived at the Kenzi Club Agdal medina on the 21st October. It was unfortunately not the best temperature that day and therefore the atmosphere wasn't great. However as soon as the sun came out it transformed in to a wonderful buzzing hotel. The interior of the hotel is extremely modern and stylish especially the lobby and international restaurant. There was a good range of food available and all good quality. Unfortunately I am not keen on the taste of Moroccan food which did restrict my options but there was a lot of other options still also some of the meat was slightly under cooked. The rooms are situated in blocks called riads. We stayed in Riad Dalia- the courtyard had lovely plants as does the rest of the hotel ground. The spa was lovely however you have to pay for access to the indoor pool and gym which was a bit ridiculous and the staff working there didn't know very good english. The facilities were good though. All in all it was a lovely holiday destination with lovely clean spacious bedrooms.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhoebeMW
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,kajal1 wrote a review Oct 2011,30,The little detail let it down otherwise it was an amazing hotel,Best Bits:  We are both Vegeterian and the chefs and kitchen staff were very pleasant and helpful to make special food for us. 4.5 Star service. Amazing    The bar staff were amazing and friendly Amazing. 5 star    The pool side lounges and animation team. Amazing 5 star.    Worst Bits:  Our room shower temperarue kept changing from meduim to extra hot This was not nice. We complianed 4 days in row. Then on our finaly day the General Manager said he will move us but as it was the last night there was no point. He also mentioned the Maintenance person said it was too much of a big job to fix!! The cheack! Anyway he then said that he would allow us to have our messages on the house due to inconviences and due to the below. 3 Star    Spa: we both had a message and it was one of the worst we had exeprienced. During our message one of the ladies was giggling and talking which was very annoying. At one point we asked her to turn the music of as it wasnt tranquil and she rolled her eye at me!! VERY unprofessional! Therefore for this reason alone we shouldnt have had to pay for this. 1 Star    We also used the swimming pool and was asked to sign a piece of paper. At the checkout we realised there was a charge to use the swimming pool which we werant told about! Language should not be an excuse! 1 Star    Check out staff and General Manager who's name was Saad:  SAAD told us due to inconvience of having a poor shower and exsperience of Spa we would not have to pay and would be able to get a late check out. we felt he was amazing and this was a great service. WE SPOKE TO SOON>>>>>However when we checked out he only gave 50% of the spa and said that the late check was complimentatry instead. This left a sour taste when we left! As he said we would not have to pay for anyhing!!!!  I would have contested more but didnt want to get more annoyed as i was in a nice mellow mood! However that is the difference between a true 5 star and 3 star who dont know what customer service is. 2 STAR    At one point Saad made me feel i was trying to get out of paying which was not the point. I expect a service a normal running shower and professional spa staff. I my self am in the service industry and would have expected no payment.    If Saad understands true customer service then i would have rated this a 5 star! I would still recommend people to come to this Hotel as you only have to use the check out service once.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kajal1

The rooms were spacious (even for 3 of us!) modern clean and comfortable. The grounds with the olive trees were beautiful and well kept. The location out of town suited us perfectly and even though there is a shuttle a taxi was £4. Pools were lovely and large and we had no trouble getting beds.    We found the staff to be really helpful and friendly. Although the majority of guests were French there were no troubles in translation. We spoke lots to those wanting to practise thier English! Saying that there were pockets of Brits who all agreed when we spoke to them that it was lovely not to be in the majority for a change. Of course this meant the entertainment was in French but that's not important to me on holiday. We found it nice not to understand!    We were hugely impressed with the food over our 4 nights. Great quality and so much variety. I think we've all come back a few pounds heavier! The drinks were in abundance wine was available in bottles at all meals whch we occasionally mixed up with a few cocktails.    This was a perfect hotel for a short break which allowed us to both relax in the sun and explore. We booked via a really good deal on lastminute.com which made the hotel we found ourselves in given the money we'd paid really good value for money.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lesley10 wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Mainly French guests,Although English guests are in the minority here and French is widely spoken staff do their utmost to assist non French speaking holidaymakers. Airport taxis appear to operate a cartel with initial expensive fares to all hotels. Otherwise elsewhere taxis are very reasonable and are happy to negotiate a fair price. Hotel has clean spacious rooms ours was within the riad furthest away from the reception and was very quiet just what we wanted. Meals could be improved with the addition of hot meat dishes. The meat we tried was nearly always warm gristly and chewy but all other dishes were tasty but not necessarily nourishing. Pool bar and evening bar staff work relentlessly to serve delicious drinks cocktails etc. Also the animation team worked hard to ensure everyone had a good time. Reception staff were excellent in answering our queries. The hotel would be very much improved if the spa information restaurant meal descriptions and all other printed information were written in English. The highlight was visiting the Medina with all the vibrant colourful activity. Daytime was an absolute pleasure and sunset different again.with all the food stalls and drum beat music hightening the atmosphere.Eating out is inexpensive here as is watching the activity with a soft drink up high with panoramic views in any one of the many cafe's that surround the medina. We would recommend this hotel as it offered good value for money and the staff were always eager to assist and went out of their way to make our stay memorable.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Beckenham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lesley10

As a frequent traveller 4/5 star hotels around the world especailly Boutique Hotels...So my story begins...  Couldn't fault hotel the staff the room 'for the money' was as expected until the air con kicked in hmmmm eau d' sewer! as they say in France  3/4 star type beautiful well kept gardens all hotel was immaculate and the spa was lovely we had a hamman and a massage which again having frequented top class spas this was of a high quality and great value...  The food.....For the money what you pay for is what you get i found the first few days ok but it quickly turned from a love to hate relationship Sooo bland with an interesting aftertaste that would confuse Gordon Ramsay! but lovely staff and I have to say the wine surprisingly good ( rose and red) also the tequila was fine stay away from the brandy unless you need to strip five layers of paint off an old pine door!  Didn't read the small print before we went 'animation' so was very shocked 3 times a day by the entertainment by men in Orange t shirts to the same song every day 'whacka whaka' also by the entertainment at night people esp women drunk cavorting 'Dirty Dancing' style with the 'Animation Team'!!!  Been to Marrakech before love the place and it is near enough to the town also next door is the amazing cool well known lounge/restaurant bar called 'Bo & ZIn' it will set you back £120 for meal for 2 and a bottle of wine ( you must book) Well worth it!!  Also Great weather as expected in Morroco one of the nicest climates we have encountered during October.  So overall would I go back there again NO but did we have a laugh and an experience YES Cheap but very cheerfull!!!!,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Chester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlo_shore
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,cher37 wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Beautiful surroundings and wonderful staff,After searching the internet for the perfect spot to stay in Marrakesh for 4 days my boyfriend and I stumbled across the Kenzi Club Agdal Medina. We were a bit dubious at first as some of the reviews that we read were not very complimentary and complained about the food and location etc. The Kenzi Club offered everything were were looking for and more. The food and drink are constant and the quality of the food is great - although we enjoyed lunches much more than dinners (could be because we weren't really hungry at dinner having eaten so much all day long). The property is immaculately kept and the staff couldn't be more helpful and attentive. Our room was very big and the bed was massive and comfortable. If you are looking to relax and just chill out by the pool and eat lovely food then this is the place for you - also if you have children it's ideal as there is so much for them to do. Pacha nightclub is just down the road and the entry is free for all guests staying at the hotel. Although the location is a little bit off the beaten track - it only takes about 5 minutes by cab from the airport and 5 minutes into Marrakesh. Cabs into Marrakesh should only cost about 30-50dhs if you're good at haggling.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,London,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cher37
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,SandVEssex wrote a review Oct 2011,40,Exceeded expectations but...,The gardens are lovely the lobby on arrival very modern clean and welcoming.    The staff let this place down massively. The do not acknowledge you in fact you sometimes feel as though they deliberately try to ignore you!!! They speak little or no English - it is a French speaking resort with 95% French guests. So be prepared for this!    In terms of orientation - you are not told any of the following - where the restaurants are - there are in fact just two. One is included on the inclusive package the other at a 100 dh per person supplement however this is a set menu so if you want variety this won't be for you. You will not be told the times for meals either so worth checking out the signage at the entrace to the buffet restaurant. You will not be shown where the spa or pools are but they are all adjacent and quite easy to find. You will also not be told that you need to leave a 150 dh deposit per beach towel you need - we have never stayed any where that asks you to pay a deposit for pool or beach towels!!! You won't be told yoy need to pay for the use of the room safe either! Again we've never stayed at any five star hotel that has charged you a per night fee for use of the safe in your suite!!! Two other catches - power supply is 120 not the 240 we use in the UK so appliances/ chargers won't work. The final catch is that on check out you will be hot will another bill from taxes which is about an addition 40 dh per night. They could not explain what this was for and we didn't have time to challenge it so paid up!    The pool areas are nice with king size beds available and lots of standard pool beds available too.    The rooms are nice - we were upgraded to a large family suite which was huge - lovely touches like the rose petals on the bed etc. The riad courtyards and very pretty and well kept.    The food is very repetitive so be prepared for this also! It's fine for what it is and you won't go hungry. Worth queuing for the freshly grilled meats and fish at lunch and dinner.    The location is fine near the airport and old town. Cabs to the old town will be between 50 and 80 dh but if you are a culture vulture worth paying to get there in the evening to enjoy the night market and souks.    Overall - if you are well travelled and always stay five star this will compare more as a 3/4 star. The service is poor food mediocre and entertainment only good for a laugh. It's very cheesy!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Su5ieM wrote a review Oct 2011,50,3 star price for 5 star hotel... fabulous!,Last minute booking for this trip - a bargain so we weren't expecting that much. The hotel is a wee bit outside Marrakech in an area that is a bit desolate as it is being developed... Just now you couldn't walk to town for example but it is only £6 in a taxi - if you want to stay later than the last free shuttle bus.    So yes they all speak French - but it is Morocco! Most of the staff tried really hard to talk to us in English - with a good number of staff fluent English speakers. Regardless they were all very helpful and we didn't feel left out. Staff always attempted to converse with all nationalities. There were activities around one of the pools all day.    The whole place still has that new feel about it; everything was very clean - toilets all European and spotless. Rooms big with Sky news and CNN. Fridge - not stocked. Very modern with some Moroccan styling. HUGE bed and great cleaning staff.    Restaurant was buffet but managed to avoid feeling like a free-for-all at an all you can eat cheap cafe. The lighting dressing and attentive waiters made it feel like a proper meal out. It was hard not to eat eat eat.. as everything from tagines and cous cous to chips and steak really was very good.    The Bedouin style double canopy beds around the pool and the fans and water sprinklers made the pool area feel very lush.. add in a couple of cocktails.. perfection.    We didn't spend any money really on this trip we tipped here and there but couldn't see ANY people tipping in the restaurant or the bars.    Other useful tips? Well they charge £3 a day for the room safe £15 deposit for pool towels the wine is fine and the beer really goodcocktails lethal (my favourite kind). You need to book the shuttle to town in advance and you agree the time of the return trip with the driver and with your fellow travellers. They have tennis and ping pong at the pool - no deposit.,Date of stay: October 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Sleaford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Su5ieM
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,CologneTravels wrote a review Oct 2011,20,"Beatiful landscape, lousy service","We booked this hotel because the photos were beautiful and description sounded very good.    When we got there the photos proved to be right. The landscape was beatiful.    Unfortunately we were ignored when we arrived at the reception desk. 3 employees kept talking about some private topic even though we were standing right in front of them. When we asked to check in they were very unfriendly.    Our room was not ready when we arrived at 2 p.m. which is ok. We agreed to wait and wanted to leave our luggage with the staff but we were told to leave it anywhere in the entrance hall.    Then we went to the pool and found that we needed to leave a deposit for wach towel of 10 euros. We had a discussion with the staff but finally we left 30 euros for 3 towels.    We went to have lunch and foud it hard to find a table outside. They just did not have enough tables for everyone. The inside of the restaurant was huge and very much like a cafeteria. The food was not great but ok.    We then spent the rest of the day at the pool and had some drinks which was the only consolation.    We skipped dinner as we could not stand the turmoil in the cafeteria.    In the morning we had breakfast which was ok.    Then we went on to the pool bar which was just closing because it started to rain. We were sent to the indoor bar but they sent us back to the pool bar. Both bars told us that they are closed. It was not even possible to get a bottle of water even though we'd paid for ""all food and drinks"" included.    When we checked out and handed back our towels the staff told us that we did not leave a deposit and did not return our 30 euros before we asked to speak to the manager.    This was the last night of our Morocco vacation and we've seen several other hotels before. All of them were nicer than this one. Therefore we recommend to rather stay in another hotel or even one of the beatiful riads in Marrakech.",Date of stay: April 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Cologne, Germany",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CologneTravels
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,NQ_Manchester wrote a review Oct 2011,40,"Good value, wonderful gardens but not the best service",We stayed at this hotel for three nights from 28th Sep - 01 Oct.    Location  The hotel is a few km from the airport and is easy enough to get to in a taxi we paid EUR 15 which I believe is more than we should have but it was midnight and we weren't in the mood for haggling!  The hotel is quite a way out of town 5km plus when I had been researching the hotel it was showing on google maps as being near Hivernage this is not accurate. We paid 100DHS for a taxi into town the hotel advised it should be around 50DHS to the main square (we were going further).  There is very little outside the hotel but there is a mall and Carrefour around 15-20 minutes walk away that was easy to find.    Room  The hotel room was not 5 star but was nice it was clean and large with a decent balcony. It was cleaned well each day. The bed was large but a little hard and the pillows were all very thick so hurt my neck a little. The TV had a few English channels and we found an English movie channel.  The only major gripe we had was that not only was there no iron in the room but there was no iron anywhere at the hotel we had to go and buy one!  Also the room information pack was not all that helpful and some of the English pages had random sentences in French that they had not bothered to translate.    Facilities  The pool area and gardens are the highlight of this hotel they were really pleasant and clean and there were always plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas. The cabanas were also a lovely addition.  The restaurant was also pleasant and they had made a decent job of not making it seem like a big canteen.  The a la carte restaurant was 100 DHS per person we didn't use this so can't say if it was worth it.  There is a gym and spa on site which cost extra and there are a number of sports fields at the back which you can get equipment for from the towel booth table tennis tennis archery basketball.  You have to get a towel card from reception for 150DHS deposit and then swap this for towels each day at the booth near the pools. This process wasn't entirely clear in the rubbish information pack.  There is a free shuttle bus to town that you have to book onto but we didn't use this.    Food and Drink  There is a fridge in the room but we didn't get any water or anything put in there.  The food was nice enough loads of choice but it was pretty much the same each lunch and dinner - pasta pizza plenty of salads tagines grilled chicken different hot dishes and about 30 different types of dessert. Breakfast was my highlight with crepes an omelette station and freshly made Morrocan pancakes. There was a Morrocan themed night which was really good.  There are two bars the pool bar is open 10am-6pm and we got served easily most of the time. They do soft drinks coffee cocktails and beer but the cocktails were not amazing.  The main bar is open 6pm-11:30pm the cocktails are better here and the outside area was very pleasant inside is a bit like a rubbish disco if I'm honest.  In addition in the restaurant you can get beer and bottles of wine at lunch and dinner and can get large bottles of water and soft drinks to take away.    Entertainment  Although we didn't partake in much the animation team seemed to put a lot of effort in and there was always something going on. The music round the pool could be a little loud so not the most relaxing but it was normally mainly on the morning and a bit more chilled on an afternoon.  We went into the bar to watch a traditional Morrocan show with acrobats snake charmers and belly dancers it was a little cheesy but fun. The other night we were there there was a singer singing mainly English songs that was nice whilst having a cocktail on the terrace.    Staff  All in all I would say the service was pretty rubbish I don't think this was particularly because we were English as other reviewers have suggested I think it was just because a lot of the staff couldn't be bothered and perhaps if you speak French you can be a little more assertive.  Saying that there were a few members of staff that went out of there way to be helpful it is a shame they were in the minority.    In conclusion we enjoyed our stay the hotel is good value and has a nice atmosphere. I wouldn't have wanted to stay any longer than two days as the food was repetative and it was too far from anything. I much preferred our stay in a Riad but I would definitely recommend this hotel if you just want to relax by a nice pool.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Manchester,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NQ_Manchester

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Eleven Eleven wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Exceeded expectations,I was unsure of what to expect of this holiday having read some of the poor reviews on here. From start to finish this holiday exceeded our expectations. Its very close to both the airport and Marrakech but is a million miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The resort is modern and very beautiful with stunning grounds. The pool area is great. We especially loved the cabanas for avoiding the midday heat or chilling out with a cocktail at night. There is a fully equipped gym and a beautiful spa with reasonably priced treatments. It is also a very child and baby friendly hotel.  What really impressed us was the value for money of the all inclusive deal. We thought the food was of a very good standard  if somewhat repetitive. The puddings were definitely a highlight. The quality of the all inclusive wine and cocktails (notably the mojitos) was also better than expected. The only fly in the ointment was the holiday camp style entertainment and repetitive music and dancing by the pool however you soon get used to it. It is true that French is the first language on the resort so it is worth digging out some of your GCSE phrases to help you get by. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this resort and hope to return in the not too distant future.  If you are expecting little england in the sun I would avoid and head to Tenerife. If on the other hand you are willing to embrace a new culture in fantastic surroundings this could be the place for you.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Hitchin, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iam5ft1
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Elli E wrote a review Sep 2011,50,Fab holiday!,My friend and I stayed at this hotel for a week on the 15th Sep – 22nd Sep 2011; we had an amazing time at the Kenzi club the hotel is beautiful and staff are very friendly. When we arrived at the hotel we found out that we had been upgraded to a suite which was an extra bonus; the rooms are extremely clean spacious and modern. There is also a good choice of food in the restaurant which varies from day to day.    The main language the staff speak is French however the majority of the staff also speak English and try to help you as much as possible. From reading other reviews it seems that some people felt that the staff were ignorant to the British however we did not experience that at all; the staff were extremely polite and helpful and treated you the same as any other tourist.    The hotel has three magnificent pools; the entertainment staff have sports and exercise classes on during the day and play entertainment every night from 10-11pm. Overall the holiday was better than we expected and great value for money we couldn't have asked for anything more. Our rep Omah also helped us to arrange trips out in Marrakech to the medina and atlas mountains which was an amazing experience. We also visited the Medina at night which is bustling with crowds of people and entertainers. I would also recommend visiting a few bars in Gueliz at night which was very cool and classy; the old city and new city are a complete contrast. I will definitely visit Morocco again as it was a fantastic experience.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled with friends,"London, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElliE275

Our week was better than we could imagine as we had been reading som not so good revews.  We booked a holiday through lastminute.com and as we have never done that before we were a bit nervus on what to expect.  The hotel staff is very helpful and wants to to everything they can to make your stay as memorable as possible. I have to disagree on revews on rude staff we are from Iceland and do not speek french (just a few words) but never once did we feel ignored. Of caurse alot of the entertanment is in french but they will try theyr best in translating if you ask them. We took the hotel shuttle to town a few times with no problems they might be a little late from time to time but hey your on holiday and there is no hurry sit back and enjoy.  Mehdi one of the animation team can speek english pretty well as he lived in England for a few months. If you need any information ask Mehdi.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Sophia wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Great value for money!,We stayed for a week from the 18th of August. Wanted a relaxing holiday where we could chill out with guaranteed sunshine and a lack of 18-30 types we were not disappointed. The standard of the rooms is excellent considering the price we paid very modern tastefully done and exceptionally clean. Infact all areas of the hotel and grounds were extremely clean and well kept. The food was lovely plenty of choice and tasty. The only grumble we had was that the service at lunch and dinner was all a bit haphazard and disorganised we called it 'the cattle market' by the end of our trip! You find your own table and sit down wherever which is fine if you arrive early when arriving later on it is difficult to find a clean table with all of the required cutlery glasses etc in place. The staff all speak exceptional French but if you are only English speaking it is almost impossible to get what you need by asking the waiting staff they have absolutely no idea what you are saying. We generally set our own table from the waiting stations. The pool bar was great with anything you could possibly want available for most of the day our only grumble here being that you could genuinely be stood there for half an hour before being served  as nearly everyone staying is French and push infront and the staff are only too happy to serve them before you! That being said it's probably our own fault for being ignorant enough to not know another language however after a while being constantly ignored gets REALLY annoying! Obviously the French have been going to Morocco for a number of years the result being that the Moroccans know exactly what kind of service the French expect and deliver it well it may take a bit of time for them to catch up with what we English also expect. Also worth mentioning is that the hotel is quite isolated things like simple medical supplies (plasters paracetamol etc) are not available in the on site shop (they only sell cigarettes and souvenirs really) so please go well supplied with everything you need as it can be a real nightmare if you don't go prepared. Despite this we had a wonderful holiday in luxury surroundings with tasty food and great facilities. We would definately go again but we would probably learn some French beforehand next time!,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sophia1saskia
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,AndreaO634 wrote a review Sep 2011,30,Shame about the staff,Just returned from 3 night break to Kenzi Club Agdul Media with Husband 3 Sons aged 17 20 & 23 and one girlfriend. The resort is lovely pool area one of the nicest we've visited. Food great good choice and high standards. Animation team and staff working on grounds/rooms very pleasant and friendly. However the Reception and Bar Staff were awful. The Reception Staff virtually ignored us and when you eventually grabbed their attention they reluctantly responded. The Bar staff were downright rude. It became clear that unfortunately that they clearly did not want to serve English people. What a shame. We tried to not let it spoil our break. A word of warning - Marrakech airport is an absolute nightmare - if you go please ensure you allow 2 hours minimum to get through customs/security. Started with a scrum of approximately 100 people trying to get through initial security. They we were ordered into seperate male/female lines - staff surely having been recruited from National Army. However the worse was yet to come with passport control. Roughly 8 lanes approximately 3 meters wide literally packed with people - many of whom were clearly panicing that they would make it through in time to catch their flights! Thankfully we made ours! Old Town made for interesting visit for our boys - rude staff in hotel were bearable for 3 nights - think a week would have been far too long.,Date of stay: September 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Romford, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreaO634

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Supernanbanana wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Loved this place,We had originally booked the Kenzi Club Oasis but were sent here because it was overbooked. I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms are very clean and have everything you need - flatscreen tv fridge hairdryer etc. I particularly liked the patio area which also had a small garden. There was even a washing line. The food was quite good and there was a large selection to choose from. There were plenty of free facilities: tennis archery table tennis volleyball etc. There was even a small farm with goats rabbits chickens etc. The main pool is massive. There is another large pool and a pool for young children. The entertainment at night was largely done by the day staff. Most evenings consisted of the staff being dressed in costumes dancing to pop music. One night was completely different as it was a Moroccan evening. There was a snake charmer a belly dancer a traditional music and dance group and a lady dancing with a tray of candles on her head. Very entertaining. We mostly went into Marrakech centre by taxi as it was difficult to find a suitable time when there were spare seats on the shuttle bus. The first driver ignored where we asked him to take us and took us to the Artisan Centre instead. We eventually got him to take us to the Square. There was not much going on because of Ramadam. We ended up going into the souk where we were constantly harrassed. One guy (who said he was a Berber) took us to a tannery. The smell was awful. Then he took us to a leather shop where a man was asking £75 for a pouffe. When we didn't buy anything they demanded money for their services. Then they gave us the wrong directions. We ended up getting a taxi back to the hotel. Take care if you are taking traveller's cheques.

The food is of a very high quality and is very varied with plenty of choice.    The poolside bar is a little slow and we often had to wait over 5 mins to be served. Often they run out of beer too.

I had a great trip and stay in this hotel from the staff to the room and the food all were great.  The only problem i had was that they ran out of vodka for the last 2 days of my trip.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ceeandthegees wrote a review Aug 2011,20,Don't bother booking this hotel unless you're French as you won't be welcome!,We were originally booked to stay at the Kenzi Oasis hotel but they were 'overbooked' so we were transferred to the Kenzi Agdal Medina. The hotel itself is very pleasant and everyone in our party enjoyed the swimming pools and the food. Our rooms were very clean and comfortable and we particularly enjoyed having a fridge in the rooms and of course the AC. The restaurant cleaning and animation staff were excellent and I can't praise them enough however I can't say the same for the reception staff and bar staff. As soon as they realised that we were English we were treated like second class citizens. We were ignored all of the time at the bar as the staff served other guests even though we had been there first and in some instances already requested our drinks only to be suddenly forgotten about? The reception staff were even more rude and this was particularly concerning when we requested some medical assistance due to one of the children in out party developing a fever of 104. After numerous calls and visits to the reception we eventually established that a doctor could be brought to the hotel and that there would be a charge for this. Thankfully the child's fever got better without medical assistance but we were left feeling very vulnerable. We ventured out into Marrakech using the free shuttle bus that the hotel provides but a word of warning it doesn't run at the times on the list provided by reception. We were booked on the 18:00 bus and were crossing the road to meet it at 17:45 when it drove off! We were then stranded in the middle of Marrakech for an hour and half until after four phonecalls to the hotel reception when they sent the bus back to collect us. On our last day as we weren't flying until the evening we paid a supplement of 400 dhs (approx £30) to keep one of the rooms so we could make the most of the lovely pool and still be able to shower and freshen up before we left for the airport. However although I had a receipt to say that we had paid to keep the room for longer we received a phonecall from the reception demanding to know why we were still in the room and telling us we had to leave immediately. I explained that I had paid and had a receipt and eventually the receptionist agreed that we had paid and offered a very limp apology. In summary we enjoyed the hotel pools and food in the restaurant but the reception and bar staff were downright rude even though we made a big effort to speak in French (albeit school level) and some arabic that we learnt in Tunisia last year. There were several other English families staying at the same time and they all experienced the same problems that we did. Interestingly one family did write a 'bad' review on facebook while they were there to which the hotel promptly removed it. We will never stay in this hotel or indeed any Kenzi hotel ever again and would certainly never recommend it.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Normanton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceeandthegees

As a couple we really enjoyed the chilled out and peaceful environment. The hotel is new and the rooms are modern but still have moroccon features they were really clean and comfortable with flat screen TV fridge and air con and outside seating the whole complex is spotlessly clean and well kept there is an imnpressive reception and bar area again a good mix of modern but authentic.    There are 2 large pools and 1 childrens (also an indoor at the spa) although the hotel was very busy there were plenty of loungers avavilable but the double cushioned day beds were usually reserved with towels by 8am! get up early to beat the rush! the entertainment is all in French (the local language) but there are lodas of activities for adults and children to take part in we declined in favour of sunbathing but the staff are not persistant.    The Food is varied with everything from pasta pizza fries to local tagines cous cous salad bar seafood meat grills and a good selection of dessert and ice cream. There really is something for every one even though some dishes appear again and again.    this is a peaceful and well kept resort but do not miss out visiting the souks and the food market in the centre of Marrakech I would reccomend eating in one of the cities Riad restaurants to see another side to the city and it's culture.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Merthyr Tydfil, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlehaf

I wanted to get this written while it is still fresh in my mind!    I have absolutely no complaints; we had a really fab holiday ... a slight concern here and there but nothing really to complain about!    My concerns and they are slight - were that the Reception staff were a bit “hopeless” ... definitely friendly and helpful to a certain extent but hopeless in some areas and that was with regard to the issue surrounding our airport transfer ... 4 times I had to go back to Reception before I was finally given a pick up time! My only other concern was the loud music at the pool side which wasn’t really that annoying as it wasn’t on all day ... but if you happened to be on a lounger or if you were up at the crack of dawn and lucky enough to get a poolside cabana and it just happened to be near a speaker ... you’d want to move!    On arrival which was approx 9.35pm I was extremely impressed with the Hotel Reception it is really stunning it does have a Moroccan feel but it is very modern in appearance.    We were quickly processed through their computer system given our AI wristbands and escorted to our Riad (La Roserarie – Room No’s 400+ ... our Riad was quite a walk from the main hub of the complex) via a “Golf Buggy”! They things can’t half move! We arrived in our room by 9.45pm ... with only 15 minutes to spare before the restaurant closed at 10 ... our porter said he would take us to the Restaurant escorted again in the golf buggy and we arrived there a moment or so later door to door service and we had enough time to grab a quick bite to eat before hitting the bar where we had some very tasty cocktails! The bar area that evening had a DJ playing really chilled out relaxed tunes the atmosphere was fab just what we need after our journey!    The gardens within our Riad were beautiful and very well kept the smells are gorgeous too as they grow all different kind of herbs there our room was also very nice it was a great size with plenty of storage areas and it was cleaned every day with new fresh towels.    We had concerns about going to Morocco during Ramadan as we had previously been to Turkey a few years previous and were woken up at all ungodly hours with the prayer calling we did not hear one mosque and slept soundly every night.    Our first morning we went to reception exchanged some money (Rate of Exchange was 12.76 dirham to the pound) and paid our deposits for our towels – 150 dirham each (just under £12) refundable on departure. We also enquired about booking the shuttle bus for the following day (Monday) that takes you into Marrakesh main Square – Djemaa el Fna – it was however fully booked for the times we wanted to go! We decided we’d just get a taxi and were informed it would cost approx 70 dirham there and the same back ... £5.50 each way.    The shuttle bus service from the hotel runs every hour on the half hour - up until I think half 5 and the last one back from the main square is at 6.30pm so if you want to eat at the square during Ramadan you will be required to get a taxi back to the hotel as the food stalls are not open during the day. I think all other times of the year; the food courts are open all day.    Then it was off to breakfast – the main restaurant is spectacular the wave structure going the whole length of the roof with the little fairy lights is the main feature it really is lovely in the evening when they are all on!    Breakfast was fab a very varied selection was on offer every day most days we had omelettes (made especially for you) or a selection of cheese and ham with crusty baguettes and some chocolate croissants! But there was everything imaginable you were spoilt for choice. The coffee was also very tasty and I don’t usually drink coffee! I also cannot fault the waiters or waitresses they were first class always bringing water fizzy drinks wine (in the evening or at lunch) or appearing at your table with a bottle opener if a bottle of beer was needing opened ... whatever you required they were great and genuinely friendly.    We found some sun loungers in a “quietish” area around the pool the only thing ... it was at the opposite side to where the toilets and pool bar were so you had a bit of a walk to get a drink or to use the facilities! It couldn’t have bothered us that much though as we stayed that end of the pool the whole of our stay! If you are going in high season I would definitely recommend getting loungers under the electric fans that spray a cooling mist on you all day – they are amazing inventions when its 44 degrees!    The pool bar throughout the day is probably the poorest service however in saying that it wasn’t bad! They were a bit slow in serving as they were always busy and from 4pm to I think 5pm (maybe 6) they serve a selection of cakes or made to order crepes!    We got speaking to a member of staff on our first day at the pool who runs the kids club I think his name is spelt Medhi and having spent some time in the UK his English was definitely the best throughout all the Staff at the Kenzi Agdal Medina he was very helpful and informative and we spent quite a bit of time speaking with him and finding out lots of tips for when we were out and about in the main square and souks. He told us to haggle when in the souks to actually quarter the price that they first say and then work your way up ... I tried this many times and got some great bargains! Actually getting items at a quarter of what was initially asked or just over it!    Lunch in the restaurant was also very good as was the evening meal. Again an extensive variant of foods was on offer ranging from 3 or 4 different types of pastas with accompanying sauces beef lamb fish tagines cold meats salad bars pizzas Panini’s cous cous potatoes chips cakes ice cream there really was something for everyone.    We also booked into the a la carte restaurant ... The Moroccan ... this you had to pay for at a cost of a 100 dirham per person (£7.80 each approx) I personally think it was worth it “The Moroccan” was stunning it had a mystical quality about it and the food we were served (5 courses) was gorgeous however we spoke to others who had also been an alternate night and were a bit disappointed with the food saying it was more or less what was served in the main Restaurant? The menu is different each night we must have picked the best night! But nothing we were served had we saw in the main restaurant the food was lovely. An elderly gentleman plays an instrument in the Restaurant it looked like a guitar but we were informed it was not a guitar; it was some sort of Moroccan flute? He serenades each table ... maybe a bit cheesy but after a few glasses of wine I rather enjoyed!    The Bar ... ok it was a hit or miss really sometimes you’d walk up to the bar and were served immediately others you’d have to wait a while! They served a wide range of cocktails which were all very nice however there were some cocktails available that weren’t on the list ... e.g. ... Mojito’s ... but 2 nights they did run out of Rum ... they had plenty of other spirits and I had a mojito with tequila one night!!! It was “drinkable”. The wine house white was gorgeous and most nights I stuck to that we’d take our ice bucket from the restaurant the waiters would open another bottle and bring this out to us we’d either stay at the outside bar area or head into the nearby cabanas as they were close enough for us the hear the music ... and extremely comfy for a chilled out night with our glasses of wine!    The entertainment ... well ... it was all in French ... but as the area is predominantly French we didn’t really expect anything else! We did go the “Theatre” one night for the Comedy Show ... but left after 10 minute as we didn’t understand! They have dancing some nights and their professional dancers are amazing to watch ... or you could participate if you so wish ... other nights ... there is a lady singer overall it’s not bad ... we met with other guests and just enjoyed the company.    There are several security guards throughout the hotel grounds they are very friendly they don’t speak a word of English but we had a laugh with them nonetheless. They didn’t mind to much either when we jumped in the pool at 2 in the morning neither!    On 3 occasions we ventured into the main square – Djemaa el Fna – they were incredible experiences we went in on the Monday really just to have a rekey and get our wits about us it is so hectic but so vibrant colourful and the smells which are mostly amazing all the spices and leather and then after sunset (during Ramadan) the food courts ... we returned on the Wednesday and did lots of shopping haggling with the souks owners and getting (in my opinion) lots of bargains we stayed and ate at the square we were served lots of little dishes of cous cous chicken kebabs lamb kebabs salads olives bread ... and it tasted delicious.    Some people asked “did your stomach cope with the food in the square?”... Yes mostly my husband had an upset tummy on the Thursday night / Friday morning ... but that really could have been from anything. Too much sun too much to drink ... or even from the restaurant at the hotel ... we’ll never know ... I will say there were 4 of us who ate at the square we all ate the same thing ... more than 24 hours later only one of us had an upset tummy? We ate at food stand No 75!    You can’t buy alcohol in Marrakesh unless you are eating a restaurant we tried to order some beer but were informed they did not sell alcohol! You can get as much alcohol as you wish at the hotel though.    The ladies who do the henna tattoos are the ones to watch; before I knew it half my hand had been “painted” ... so if at all possible ... put your hands in your pockets!!! Or have your wits about you when you’re in their sights! I ended up paying 100 dirham for something I didn’t really want!    We returned to the square on the Friday afternoon to finish our shopping I was really sad to leave ... we had a great time there ... I was a bit concerned about the begging etc but I needn’t have worried a polite no was all that was required. Although I was swore at once when I informed our “wannabe” guide that we knew our way about and we didn’t require his services! He knew perfect English then!    I also had concerns about bringing my expensive camera and opted for a small compact one but I really wouldn’t have had any problem taking my SLR. Lots of people had them.    Kenzi Agdal Medina also provides a free wifi service.    All in all ... we had an ace time ... Would we go back ... most definitely - in a heartbeat! Would we stay at Kenzi Agdal Medina ... same as above - without a shadow of a doubt ... if you are thinking about this hotel ... go for it ... you will have a ball!,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Dundee, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kasarami
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,hannahlawrence wrote a review Aug 2011,40,"Lovely quite clean rooms, good place if you like to chill by the pool all day. All staff speak French not English this can make",We stopped at the Agdal Medina for 1 week rooms are very nice water only in minibar but rooms cleaned well each day no complaints there. The hotel pools are clean and surroundings are well maintained a great place to go if you want to stay in a hotel and relax by the pool.  All the staff speak French and most of the guests are french this can be a problem when trying to book a trip because there is nobody to translate and all the boards are in French! So we didn't manage to book on any trips. :( you do feel like the bar staff don't want to serve you sometimes because they serve the French people first but hey we got there in the end.  We got the free shuttle car to the souks in marrakesh and wish we hadn't if you hate animal cruelty Luke me then don't go and upset your self. They were chopping chickens heads off in the street and skinning live rabbits. The horses in the square were so thin they had sores on there ribs and had there legs tired up with rope so they couldn't move. Absolutely horrible we went back to the hotel within 1 hour.  The hotel is a sanctuary away from the centre and overall I would say it is a 3 star AI the to poor wine no sparkly wine and not much to do.,Date of stay: August 2011,,"Hebden Bridge, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahlawrence
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Ceeandthegees wrote a review Aug 2011,20,Don't bother booking this hotel unless you're French as you won't be welcome!,We were originally booked to stay at the Kenzi Oasis hotel but they were 'overbooked' so we were transferred to the Kenzi Agdal Medina. The hotel itself is very pleasant and everyone in our party enjoyed the swimming pools and the food. Our rooms were very clean and comfortable and we particularly enjoyed having a fridge in the rooms and of course the AC. The restaurant cleaning and animation staff were excellent and I can't praise them enough however I can't say the same for the reception staff and bar staff. As soon as they realised that we were English we were treated like second class citizens. We were ignored all of the time at the bar as the staff served other guests even though we had been there first and in some instances already requested our drinks only to be suddenly forgotten about? The reception staff were even more rude and this was particularly concerning when we requested some medical assistance due to one of the children in out party developing a fever of 104. After numerous calls and visits to the reception we eventually established that a doctor could be brought to the hotel and that there would be a charge for this. Thankfully the child's fever got better without medical assistance but we were left feeling very vulnerable. We ventured out into Marrakech using the free shuttle bus that the hotel provides but a word of warning it doesn't run at the times on the list provided by reception. We were booked on the 18:00 bus and were crossing the road to meet it at 17:45 when it drove off! We were then stranded in the middle of Marrakech for an hour and half until after four phonecalls to the hotel reception when they sent the bus back to collect us. On our last day as we weren't flying until the evening we paid a supplement of 400 dhs (approx £30) to keep one of the rooms so we could make the most of the lovely pool and still be able to shower and freshen up before we left for the airport. However although I had a receipt to say that we had paid to keep the room for longer we received a phonecall from the reception demanding to know why we were still in the room and telling us we had to leave immediately. I explained that I had paid and had a receipt and eventually the receptionist agreed that we had paid and offered a very limp apology. In summary we enjoyed the hotel pools and food in the restaurant but the reception and bar staff were downright rude even though we made a big effort to speak in French (albeit school level) and some arabic that we learnt in Tunisia last year. There were several other English families staying at the same time and they all experienced the same problems that we did. Interestingly one family did write a 'bad' review on facebook while they were there to which the hotel promptly removed it. We will never stay in this hotel or indeed any Kenzi hotel ever again and would certainly never recommend it.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Normanton, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceeandthegees
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,mandy c wrote a review Aug 2011,30,food was manotanus,If you exchange money @ hotel please make sure you ask for receipt and keep it you will need it to exchnge any money back @ the airport. We wasnt given a receipt and really struggled @ airport coming home. If you are sunseekers who dont want to be bnothered with the entertainment during the day then ue the top pool otherwise you will get harrased to join in everything from games to step aerobics etc in scorching weather. The major downside to this hotel was food and only one evening bar. Breakfast was shocking Best meal of the day was lunchtime as this was fresh - then you got everything from lunch mixed up with something else for your evening meal. There is ONE restaurant on sight and it tells you that you must book but you need to book through reception which it doesn't say. One bar that opened @ 6pm make sure you order 2 drinks when you FINALLY get served as they are small glasses Be aware of fresh orange juice @ poolside bar (Closes @ 6pm) as my partner ended up poorly for last 2 days after having a few glasses of that even though it looks like its in a cooler it isnt cold which would breed bacteria. Theres a show/theatre a few times a week - ALL in french. The reception staff seemed harrased everytime there was more than 2 people asking for help etc. If you go on free bus to the centre please make sure you know some french because the drivers know no english.....infact 95% of the staff had no idea what we were talking about. It looks like they are doing some renovation in one of the big buildings near reception - heres hoping it would be another bar as long as they employ more staff to work it that is lol. There are NO do not disturb signs for your door either which I found bizarre the maid just walks in and walks out when she realises your still in bed. Sunbeds are uncomfy so try and take a pillow or another towel. Luggage room is also a prayer room so be careful when you collect your luggage as we walked in on a couple of members of staff on their rugs. Spa is gorgeous and tranquil. I no its all sounds negative but it is a beautifull place and great if you just want to relax and not eat really nice food.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Oldham, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandyc700
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Pogobear007 wrote a review Aug 2011,50,Superb All Inclusive Holiday!,Kenzi Club is an attractive well presented and clean hotel. Booked with travel republic who messed up my transfer leaving me stranded at airport with my child! Fortunately the hotel is close to the airport and I paid £12.00 for taxi.    The hotel manager was first class and very sympathetic and organised complimentary massage in the spa which was a wonderful experience.    I experienced reception staff and hotel management as responsive and attentive and keen to ensure that it was a holiday to remember.    Downside -  1. meal times not well organised and tables not cleared speedily enough for the volume of guests.  2. the guests are predominantly French and French speaking and therefore hotel doesn't really cater for English guests    Positives  Clean hotel and good variety of food  Hotel provided Shuttle bus to Souk  10 minute drive away from airport,Date of stay: August 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pogobear007

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,bhrdg wrote a review Aug 2011,50,"Great family / chill out hotel resort, kids loved it.",Hotel is big modern new clean and safe with security and high walls surrounding the spread out accommodation ANC gardens. All of which was a relief after the eye opening journey from the airport. On arrival we were taken to our room in an electric buggy with luggage the initial room given was a standard room but we booked a suite so the hotel apologised and moved us within a few minutes. The suite was much better for a family with one room with sofas that were made in to beds complete with it's own tv toilet balcony. The main bedroom featured a giant bed massive bathroom with double sinks big bath and large shower.    The hotel is arranged in 8 or 9 2 story quads. Its got a big pool bar dining hall Moroccan restaurant spa / gym theatre / hall tennis courts basketball court football pitch volleyball and archery. There is also a kids club.    The food in the hotel is pretty varied and generally good for breakfast it was breads / cereal/ pastries / beef sausage eggs potatoes / omelettes or pancakes to order (kids favourites). Lunch / dinner was pasta's cooked to order pizzas grill bar salads cold buffet chef cooked dish and tangines of lamb chicken beef or fish on rotation. Fresh bread and desserts. Food changed daily so you had some variation and generally was good. Bottles of mineral water on table and wine on request from waiters plus help yourself to bottles of coke beer etc. Most guests realised if you arrived at the restaurant when it opened you got the best selection!    During day pool bar was open but staff a bit slow and busy you needed to wait to order drinks and they had a range of wine beer soft drinks local spirits. They also gave out snacks and cooked pancakes at 4pm. The main bar opens around 6pm when the pool bar closes and again they are providing more snacks / popcorn etc.    Around the pool there are a large number of sun loungers with umbrellas and some double beds with sail type sunshades all clean and new. Nice big pool was needed to get through the 43' heat. Only slight irritation was the very loud music at the pool every morning.    Most of staff speak Arabic and french and have very limited english whilst most of the hotel guests in attendance are French. We found they were polite but you generally needed to grab their attention and ask as opposed to being offered anything eg bottle of wine at dinner.    We ventured in to Marrakech and that was a real eye opener but was bearable first thing in the morning. There is also a carrefour and modern shopping centre near the hotel.    In summary this hotel was well suited for a relaxing and slightly different holiday probably would be ok for a youngish couple but for those couples looking for sophisticated break this may not suit.,Date of stay: August 2011,Trip type: Traveled with family,"Reading, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhrdg

The food is poor! Same stuff is served and all dishes taste the same especially deserts.    Animation for children lacks creativity just noise noise noise ! Even the night shows were most of the time sleeping pills and some of themes were not adequate to the audience ( jokes on man woman relationship / betrayal ... to an audience of young children )    We found also a cockroach in our room for sure we will never stay in kenzi club again !!

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,DrG29 wrote a review Jun 2011,40,Great value,We got a great last minute deal all inclusive. The resort is out of the town in a modern cluster of large hotels being built on a massive flat area. The hotel was immaculately clean the staff were wonderfully friendly and attentive and the complex was beautiful with lush gardens including kitchen gardens where there were fresh herb lime trees pomegranates etc. there are 2 large pools with plenty of sun loungers and lovely little shady double sunbeds. My only complaint would be the music around the pool. a previous review mentioned the words 'butlins'. there is an element of truth here. there is no where to escape the music which is a shame as it only really needs to be played around 1 pool if any and there are organised group activities with 'red coats' in orange polo shirts doing poolside games archery pingpong football etc. there was also evening entertainment with dancing in the bar.  the all inclusive food and drink were great if a little boring after a few days but thats being picky as theres lots of choice!  the room was lovely. these rooms are in 2 storey quads with a garden in the middle they are spacious with balconies on the top floor and very pleasant.  there was good WiFi which helped save on expensive phone bills (as call outside europe are expensive on uk tariffs)  the staff do speak mostly french as its an almost exclusively french hotel. this was fine for us as we enjoy speaking french and the staff are so accommodating many would try very hard to practice their english but for non french speakers it might be tricky.  the spa was a little disappointing; similar in price to UK but both myself and my partner felt the treatment was disorganised and not very good.,Date of stay: June 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrG29
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Lesley P wrote a review Jun 2011,40,"Good value for money, Pool holiday with friendly staff, french speaking an advantage",Went to this hotel with a group of all girl friends. The intention was to have a nice relaxing short break and on the whole this hotel didn't disappoint. We found staff friendly helpful and respectful. Pool area had plently of space to have sun beds for the day with music playing while you sunbathed. This was annoying at times as could be a little loud but on the whole was enjoyable. Our room was clean and comfortable though sometimes had a smell of drains which went once the air conditioning had been running for a while. All rooms had an outside seating area though if you were on the ground floor when the doors were open you did feel a little exposed to anyone walking in so you wouldn't like to sleep with the doors open. The resturant was a bit hit and miss. The food choice was good as was the seating arrangements. Best get there when food first put out to avoid the number of flies if wanting to eat the cold buffet food !!!. I made sure I ate cooked ( there are freshly cooked in front of you dining options ). Lack of staff made table clearing very very slow so consiquently lots of tables left with food plates and flies. When they were busy they would run out of food and also plates. I would suggest they have a cuttlery area as getting clean additional cuttlery often meant taking it from another table. Drinks service was good and wine came in a cooler. Coffee at breakfast was beautiful :). Small shop on site didn't sell any toiletries so make sure you take everything you need or could need. Young hotel that will hopefully have teething problems ironed out over time. This hotel is worth visiting if it comes up as an offer too cheap to refuse. I used the spa facilities and found the staff very proffesional and the service excellent most enjoyable and relaxing.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Wishyouwerhere wrote a review Feb 2011,20,Butlins,There are many reasons not to go to this hotel but here are a few of what we feel are the most important ones;    Firstly the title of this review serves to indicate the focus on family the resort has with a tacky edge. This might be fine if you have a family but If you are not holidaying with children just don't go you will be disappointed.    The restaurant- it may say it has 2 - the main restaurant and a morrocan themed restaurant you can eat at for a supplement of Eur10 per person- but in reality there is actually only 1 the morrocan disappointingly turned out to be a quiet room serving a fixed menu of morrocan food taken directly from the main restaurant! We walked out after being sat for 10 minutes without service. I should add that the time was c. 8pm and we were the only people in there.    General service in the main restaurant is poor and often our meals were spoiled by children crying and also running past our table. There appeared to be no effort to focus on the adults staying at the hotel. The food in general was a pretty standard buffet. Given the above we ended up spending quite a lot of money above what we had paid for all inclusive by going out to restaurants for dinner.    The bars- there are two one by the pool with waiters who seem not to want to be there and who on occasion can be pretty rude. The other is open from 6 and is filled with smoke. So if you are a non-smoker there is nowhere to drink past 6 at the hotel. We also had a few occasions where glasses were not clean.    The rooms- these were fine and clean. On checking out it was rather strange to see we had been charged about gbp15 for using the safe in our room. There is another strange arrangement for using pool towels which generally ends up in a lot of hassle.    Overall we would recommend you look at booking one of the beautiful riads around the city. This is definitely something we wish we had done.,Date of stay: February 2011,,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wishyouwerhere
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,GuyThornton wrote a review Jan 2011,50,Marrakech - our second time.,First time - 2010 - we stayed in a riyad in the medina. Pleasant enought but the medina 24/7 is exhausting - the bustle noise hustle - get to you.    So this last trip we booked directly with Kenzi's website. Got a great deal. Fetched from and delivered back to the airport - free - by friendly staf in brand new people mover. Friendly helpful reception delivered to room on golf buggy. Great room 40 sq m of faultless design. Bags of hot water. Wonderful beds.    The hotel is set in a magical garden of several hectares of olive palm & citrus trees unbelievable roses and hibiscus. There is an area with sheep lambs goats kids peacocks chickens ducks etc. Several swimming pools with loungers cafe/bar etc.    The restaurant and bar were large - institutionally so and a bit characterless - but the hotel was obviously planned and mostly built before the credit crisis - and so the guests sort of rattle around. The food was fabulous French legacy patisserie & bread Morrocan couscous tagines etc the most wonderful fresh fruit wood oven pizzas fresh fish italian pastas cooked to order breakfasts catered for every possible taste ....if as we are told cooking is all aboutthe freshness & quality of ingredients then it's hard to imagine how it could be improved on. Local wine and beer are excellent.    Entertainment is courtesy of a friendly troupe.....talented young woman singer with back up keyboard and others. They got people to join in dancing. Everyone was enjoying themselves while we were there.    The only mentioned downside to the hotel - its location - is not a downside at all. The hotel runs a free shuttle into & back from the medina every hour throughout the day. If that's not convenient there is a fleet of taxis outside that will take you into the medina for between 4 and 5 euros. The taxis will also take you into the centre of Gueliz (the French new city) for around 6 euros. It is a wonderful walk through art deco cafes & arcades from Gueliz back to the medina and then a 5 euro ride back to the hotel - and your garden of Eden.    The really bad news is that you'll eat and drink too much! Morocco is fabulous and Marrakech and its friendly hospitable Berbers even more so.,Date of stay: January 2011,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Madrid,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuyThornton
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Vivienne F wrote a review Jan 2011,40,Perfect for a short break,We stayed at this hotel for three days in November 2010. It's only been open for about six months so everything is still very new! We thought the hotel was a perfect place for a short break. We got a very good deal via lastminute.com but I expect the prices are likely to rise as the hotel becomes more well known. It's located about 15 mins by cab from the airport NB No airport shuttle bus even though their website says there is. A cab was 20 euros. There is a shuttle bus which goes into the centre of town about 20 minutes away.  The all inclusive deal is very good wth an extensive drinks and buffet menu. There were a couple of problems eg the eggs at breakfast had obviously been hanging around a bit! When we spoke to the manager about this he did say that this was because the hotel was only about a quarter full when it's full the eggs are virtually cooked to order. We did think it a little odd that the in-room safe is not included in the all inclusive deal and we had to pay to use it. The spa is gorgeous with reasonably priced treatments but again slightly odd that you had to pay to use the indoor pool! I think use of the indoor pool should be included especially important in the winter months. Although we had good weather for 2 days - we did have one rainy day and it would have been nice to have used the indoor pool.  The staff were friendly and efficent. The front desk slightly off hand but when I tried to book a guide for the souks became really helpful - good commission I expect - the guide wasn't cheap £100 for the trip. The animation staff were excellent and tried very hard to keep the few guests there entertained.  The rooms were clean and very comfortable. Each group of rooms was set in lovely gardens with walkways in between leading to the communal areas.  All in all a great place for a short break. No doubt as the hotel becomes more popular the few teething problems will be ironed out.,Date of stay: November 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,"Surrey, United Kingdom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133viviennef
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Terry C wrote a review Oct 2010,50,Excellent out of town hotel,Just returned from a few days break with some close friends to the Kenzi Club. What a lovely hotel. The staff are so friendly especially the staff in the restuarant. We read a couple of reviews before leaving and i must admit we did have a few reservations.  Things got off to a bad start when the flight we booked through Tompson was delayed by 13 hours. Because it was a late flight we tried to contact the hotel via expedia who were very helpfull and recieved the information that we may be re-located to another hotel in the group. On arrival at the hotel the next morning we were told this was not going to happen and were also presented with all inclusive wrist bands which we hadn't booked or paid for. There is a bit of a language issue but a bit of pigeon french and a little patience and everyone was very happy. The rooms are lovely clean a good size and great beds. Great pools although the large pool was not heated so you need to be a very keen swimmer to try it. The pool bar is nice and the staff quite helpfull and friendly. The food is not as bad as some reviews say it's not al-la-carte but with a little imagination you can get a nice acceptable meal. The evening entertaiment is French based and is very limited but go to the square in town for real life theatre. Don't get caught by the ladies selling stuff in town they are very clever and far worse than the men.  The local carrefour shopping mal 15 min walk has a good Ice cream parlour and fast food type outlets if required. Don't get the security guy to book your taxi's without checking the price cause he must be on commision like everyone else in Marrakech.  All in all a very nice place to return to after the hectic life in the medina.,Date of stay: October 2010,Trip type: Traveled with friends,sherwood forest,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tez69

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,arcscot wrote a review Sep 2010,30,OK - But not 5*,First the bad - Rude reception and this is the hotels 'front line'  No info or map of the complex - you need to ask everything....How do I get a pool towel? Where is the restaurant? Is there a shop? Is there a bus to town?  Every time you want to know something you have to go back to the rude reception. Don't wait for them to speak to you - you'll wait for ages just ask whoever's there what you want.  Restaurant - a bit chaotic but mostly due to lack of parental control (not the hotel's fault). Kids running around and spilling food. But choice of food was OK. One day the scrambled eggs and potatoes had not even been heated - very dangerous. But the waiters were excellent.  Staff inside though - waiters bar staff pool attendants cleaners porters etc were absolutely excellent and had no problem with english.  Drink choices were excellent and bottled water given as often as you want it.  Room was lovely although 2 mornings we had no hot water until about noon.  Pool area really nice with lots of sunbeds and canopies.  A lot of wasps around encouraged by lazy guests leaving food and empty coke glasses lying around.  All in all this complex was an OK experience -- it is in the middle of nowhere -- but not in my opinion 5*,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Edinburgh,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arcscot
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,TourismManagExpert wrote a review Sep 2010,20,Awful for a 5* Hotel expected service and very poor All-Inclusive,The expectation a tourist has from a hotel depends always on the experience acquired. That is the reason why some tourists misevaluate a 5* Hotel as very good or an All-Inclusive excellent because they never stayed in such level hotel or never booked All-Inclusive.Everyone who stayed in a 5* Hotel or Resort in the Caribbean with All-Inclusive will always rate the Kenzi as very poor sorry not everybody as the same perception due to professional and tourist experience My experience tells me that the Hotels in Marrakech (in Casablanca you find better hotels) are under the international patterns concerning the stars and food & beverage. Some of them go for sure under de minimum you may expect. In Europe some 3* hotels may offer you a better food & beverage package and service than the one offered by Kenzi. The same is valid for front-desk service.  Now our real experience:  UNACCEPTABLE - a front-desk not providing by the check-in information about hotel services. Total payment by check-in required despite our Credit Card Nr known by the hotel. We booked ALL INCLUSIVE and as rule of Kenzi no drinks in the fridge bars of the hotel rooms there is no room-service or food available from the dinning time up to the breakfast. The restaurant service was unorganized and unskilled (egg. where have one seen in a buffet restaurant or à la carte the practice of using the same knife and fork for all the courses just replacing them on request?). Kitchen high deficiency of food hygiene and safety food exposed day after day and poorly packaged repeated daily menu and poorly made (no flavor) and presentation without appeal. The bar at the pool closes at 17:30 and the main bar at 00:30. Pool towels provided only with a deposit of € 10 per pax. The Entertainment was very unskilled and most of the time in French idiom. Beside all of these bad enough we still are suffering from gastroenteritis after one week back home. Never recommend this Hotel. Marrakech outside the hotel was an excellent experience especially the taxi service a very reliable and honest guy speaks Spanish French and English and we paid a very competitive price the best way to discover the real Maroc and to feel everywhere protected. The high point was when he took us during one of the trips to a traditional small Berbers place and to a family house to see how they live where we got nice tea and Berbers bread with honey. Take care with what you pay there they ask you always more. A taxi from the airport to the hotel they may ask you € 15 up €20. With our taxi driver we paid only €10. Hotel’s staff is lovely and helpful they need professional orientation. Most of them do not earn more than €200 per month and are mostly trainees. A front-desk officer earns €250 per month. So you feel to give them some money. Some information you may need please do not hesitate.,Date of stay: September 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Lisbon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TourismManagExpert
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,MtHoye wrote a review Sep 2010,20,5* shell 3* hotel,Hotel is new & meant to be 5*. We went all inclusive for 1 week not our usual style of holiday we needed a quick getaway. The rooms were great and clean. The two swimming pools were fantastic. The food was very average and repetitive. The nightly stir fry's were grim. The deserts looked great and lots of them but they all tasted the same. Drinks were plentiful the wine was vile the beer below par. During the day no one cleared any glasses you had to throw them in a plastic bucket swamped with wasps. The most annoying thing was a French holiday club Eldoraror that expected to whoop everyone up to an excited state and enjoy 'kiss me quick' style exercise in and around the pool to really loud 90's house remixes played by wanna be DJ's. The was no mellow 5* ambience to be had! The Wifi in every room was patchy to say the least.,Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled with family,Hove,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MtHoye
Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,alexandereddie66 wrote a review Aug 2010,30,Supposed 5star but it isn't and we're not returning,"A hotel only 3 months old should expect some teething problems but we hardly expected a supposed 5 star hotel that stirred so many contradictory feelings within us.  Cosmetically it was lovely to look at.It's all on one level so no difficult stairs to negotiate and adequate wheelchair access. Lovely cleanair conditioned rooms with new LCD TVs lovely bathrooms and a huge bed  Two restaurants;a main and an Italian. The main served ok food but with very little variety and for the entire stay the air conditioning was off so the temperature at times was unbearable.Added to that the toaster broke on the first day and was never repaired so if you wanted toast...forget that.In the evening if you wanted to eat outside when the temperature was decidedly cooler it seeed an inconvenience for the staff to lay a table stating that "" we had to eat inside in the evening and outside was only available in the morning"". Hardly catering to the needs of the client! The staff on the whole were lovely and they really took a shine to our 19month boy and were always making a fuss of him.  Two bars and only a so called snack bar situated quite far away from the main pool served drinks before 6pm. The staff there were quite rude unless you were French and on our first day seemed to find us figures of fun because our French was limited.I don't mind being in on the joke but when staff area all speaking Arabic and clearly laughing at you it does tend to irritate.On one occasion a particularly rude staff member gave an English client the wrong drink saying that the other drink at run out despite the fact that the client didn't want the drink.When my wife asked for ice he said that the drinks were cold enough and walked off.On another occasion when we asked for a chocolate milk shake for our son another waiter simply put two heaped spoons of chocolate powder in a glass and filled it up with cold milk with no attempt to stir or blend the mixture.It was tasteless to say the least.  The main bar was within a lovelybig indoor hall that could double as a disco as it had a nice dancefloor and a superb PA.Drinks were easier to get and the staff were friendly but it was understaffed resulting in queues during a busy time.  The animation team were friendly enough but again everything was conducted in French whch meant the small English contingent were left rather isolated.It didn't bother us too much as we relaxed and enjoyed each others company and had a good time.But again there was such little variety; a music quiz and some dancing with the staff every night.The main evening entertainment was hardly advertised so one had to really search or ask what was happening.When we asked at reception an apathetic receptionist told us he didn't know and to ask one of the animation team.It turned out it was in a seperate conference room which was modern but again everything was in....you guessed it French so we didn't bother.But looking at what was on offer I hardly think most of the French thought it was anything to write home about either  There were quite a number of hidden costs that were not made aware considering we paid as did most others for an all inclusive holiday. A state of the art gym whch cost 100D per person to use and a lovely indoor pool with the same charge.And they wondered why it was empty our entire stay! Towels had to have a deposit of 100D per towel to avoid theft whch was a good idea but when an English family we made friends with had two towels stolen from their sunbed the reception stated that wouldn't replace them free accusing the family of stealing the towels.When the dad jokingly said what if he went and took two towels from another sunbed as replacements he was rudely told that that would be theft and he would be asked to leave the hotel.He then had a security guard follow him around for the rest of the day.Fawlty Towers couldn't have written it better!  The last incident was the funniest.We put in a small carrier bag of laundry but were told to write down intems on a sheet completely in French.But a helpful maid supervisor told us not to bother to fill it in and to put the bag in to launder and we'd pay on check out....big mistake! On the final day we were hit with a laundry bill converted into nearly £120.We kicked up a real fuss of course and it turned out that someone had written items of clothing that we never gave in eg. 6 dresses 22 pairs of underpants.It was totally ridiculous and we refused to pay until they reduced the fee.Even French clients were shocked and thought it unacceptable.We finally settled but it was still too much but by that time we wanted to go.  But as with other holidays some of the people made the holiday worthwhile.Some staff were genuinely lovely.The evening singer was very friendly and always spoke to us as her English was excellent and she sang in 3 languages not just French.The maids were good despite the laundry incident and we met some friends who will no doubt be friends for life.Not all the French clients were insular and some spoke good enough English to chat to us each time we met. And of course Marrakech is always worth visiting.

Kenzi Club Agdal Medina,Silvermoon181 wrote a review Aug 2010,50,Lovely Hotel!,"What a great place! My husband and I looked for a few daysin the sun and we were a little apprehensive of this hotel as it didn't have that many reviews and those that were on here were french. However we were extremely pleased tha we did book. On arriving at the airport we jumped into a taxi which cost 150 dirhams which was approximately £13. The travel agents wanted around £60 return booking before hand so we're glad we saved there! Just to warn you the taxi journey is an experience! Thank goodness the hotel was only 5-10 mins away!  The weather is scorching! Expect the that especially at midday! I'm a total sun worshipper but at times it was even too hot for me!  The hotel reception is beautiful. Very modern. We were greeted with some orange juice and the staff were very polite. Once we checked in a porter took us for a tour around the hotel on a little golf buggy which was a nice touch explaining where everything is!  The room was well furnished and again very modern. The hotel is very new so everything was well kept as you'd imagine! It was spacious and was cleaned by very friendly maids!  The food was good. There is a bit dining room with again very modern cream furniture. Breakfast time was seemed busy but lunch time and evening meals you did have a lot of people in there! They catered for most people's taste and even had a section of pureed foods for small children that I thoght was a nice touch! At meal times the hotel doesn't provide any type of pork as it is a Muslim country so no bacon at breakfast.  There is an ample supply of drinks you can have through the day if you're on AI in the restuarant and by the pool. People have complained previously about the wasps by the bars in hotels in Marrakech but really it's not the hotel's fault as they are just attracted to the sticky drinks like orange juice. They are fine and can just be ignored!  The pools are lovely. There is one larger pool then a smaller quieter pool! I stayed around the quieter pool and it was away from the hustle and bustle of the entertainment. Both pools had plenty of umbrellas loungers and some very nice double comfortable beds.  The entertainment was excellent. I tend not to go to hotels and take up the entertainment but you couldn't fault how hard they worked. In the day they based themselves around the larger pool(hence the reason I was around the smaller one) and led many actvities from aqua aerobics volleyball archery and many food/ drink demonstrations by the pool bar. In the night then they had a very good singer and got people involved in dancing etc. I do have to say that they weren't 'hevay handed' in trying to make you take part which was nice - as there is nothing worse than constantly saying "" No thankyou"" or making an excuse about your ankle when the entertainment crew are trying to make you dance.  At the hotel they have a beautiful spa but unfortunately it is at a cost! 100 dirhams for use of pool for an hour and the same for the gym - however I don't think they are so tight on timimgs on the gym.  We went to Jeema Al Fna which was bizarre! Taxi costs anything between 100 and 150 dirhams and when you get there you'll be blown away! The souks are fantastic and I'm sure the many stalls would have provided very fresh food but it wasn't really for me! There are men there with monkeys and snakes but take care as they'll encourage you to have photos then demand you give them 200 dirhams or ""note money"".  It is somewhere you do have to go to say you've been there!  From our holiday we wanted a quiet hotel with nice surroundings and food and some sun. The Kenzi definately did that! We had to check out at 12pm on our last day and were flying at 6pm. When we were checking out I enquired about a shower room so that we could refresh when leaving. The manager happened to be at reception and said it was no problem to have our current room! It was very kind of him and I know that it would normally cost about £40 so I was really pleased about that! We saw him around the hotel and he always made himself known and constantly asked guests if there was anything they needed!  I would definatey recommend the Kenzi Club Medina. We didn't go out and sightsee and there wasn't anywhere you could 'stroll' but everything we required from our few days a way we got! The hotel caters for most couples families etc. If you are looking for adventure I'm sure the hotel could point you in the right direction but the hotel itself is more for relaxing(well definately around the smaller pool!) I am already looking to go back in April with a friend!",Date of stay: August 2010,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Swansea,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Silvermoon181
